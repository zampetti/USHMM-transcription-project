<p><span id="s4">Abstract Irving Horn (born Isachar Herszenhorn) was born in February, 1927 in Radom, Poland.</span> <span id="s5">Irving remembers significant anti-Semitism as a child.</span> <span id="s6">When he was seven years old the Polish government ordered the integration of schools.</span> <span id="s7">Irving and the only other Jewish boy at his new school were severely beaten by some of their schoolmates.</span> <span id="s8">Upon the outbreak of the war, Irving’s father lost his job and his brother was accused of spying and temporarily jailed.</span> <span id="s9">Irving attended a secret Jewish school for two years until Radom became a ghetto.</span> <span id="s10">Upon the liquidation of the Radom ghetto, Irving and his father volunteered to work on the Waschnik estate.</span> <span id="s11">Irving survived encounters with the SS, then worked in a weapons factory where he encountered Jacob Holz, a ruthless security guard whom Irving later testified against.</span> <span id="s12">Around July 25, 1944, Irving marched to Tomaszów because the Russians were approaching Radom.</span> <span id="s13">From Tomaszów, he took a train to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s14">There, Irving, his father and his two brothers were chosen to do work in Vaihingen an der Enz near Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s15">A guard sent Irving to work on the Nazi Secretary of State’s sister-in-law’s estate for two weeks, where he received food and regained his strength.</span> <span id="s16">He was then sent to Camp Unterriexingen, Kochendorf, and finally to Dachau.</span> <span id="s17">Irving was in Tyrol at the end of the war but was taken back to Germany and almost shot into a ravine.</span> <span id="s18">Before the killing was to take place, the SS men changed into civilian clothes and left.</span> <span id="s19">Afterward, Irving ended up in a military hospital in Mittenwald due to severe hunger, and then spent several years in a displaced persons camp in Stuttgart before moving to the United States in 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Tape 1:</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Anthony: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Irving: Well my name now is Irving Horn, but that’s not my original name.</span> <span id="s23">I was born as Isachar Herszenhorn and I was born in the city of Radom, Poland.</span> <span id="s24">Eh…you want the date of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Anthony: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Irving: I was born in 1927.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Anthony: What was the date, the month and day?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Irving: February, 1927.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Anthony: Ok.</span> <span id="s30">Can you tell me a little bit about your family life after you were born, that period… Irving: I come from a middle-income family and my father was a salesman in a tanning factory and I would say we were doing relatively well.</span> <span id="s31">Eh…life was comfortable except for a large scale anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Anthony: Do you remember some instances of this anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Irving: Yeah, when I was seven years old, because of an edict of the Polish government, we were told that we had to start integrating a school and I was the only kid, Jewish kid, in a Polish public school.</span> <span id="s34">The incident I remember most is that we were standing in the line to register for school.</span> <span id="s35">Now Polish schools were not exactly like schools are here, they didn’t have building by themselves, and I believe that the school had the first and second floor and on the other floors, there were tenants actually, and we were, the registration was on the second floor and we were on the stairway after the second floor and there was another Jewish little boy who was thrown off that stairway and he either broke a leg or he got badly hurt, and when we reached the office, and the subject was discussed, the principal looked at my mother and said, “Well, it’s a good thing it happened to him, he had no business being here to begin with.”</span> <span id="s36">So life was miserable at school, we were always being beaten up.</span> <span id="s37">I was always being beaten up, being the only Jewish kid.</span> <span id="s38">After a year I transferred to another public school where there were three or four Jewish children in the class and there at least we had a chance of fighting.</span> <span id="s39">After two years there, I transferred to a Jewish day school and the last day before the war I spent in a Jewish day school.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Anthony: So you were there right before the war then?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Irving: Right before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Anthony: And that’s 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Irving: 1939.</span> <span id="s44">I was in the sixth grade, and the last thing I remember was passing a test for junior high, and getting ready to get to return to school on September 1939.</span> <span id="s45">That never happened… Anthony: Right.</span> <span id="s46">Did you have any brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Irving: Yeah, I have two brothers, twins, and I have a…my father and mother adopted a sister, so I had an adopted sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Anthony: Can you tell me a little bit about when the Germans invaded in September, what you were doing, what your family was doing, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Irving: Well, before they invaded we were out on a summer vacation and we came back, and of course the war started September 1st.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Anthony: Where did you go to vacation, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Irving: A small town, not far away, about twelve miles south of Radom…and we returned…we returned because my…well actually, I was there with my adopted sister, she was already married, and her husband got a draft notice, and we knew the war was on.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Anthony: This is back in Radom, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Irving: Yeah.</span> <span id="s54">It was a few days before the war started.</span> <span id="s55">And when we returned…well, mobilization was fully on, and shortly afterwards, which was Friday, if I remember, September 1st, the war started.</span> <span id="s56">Eh…there were bombings.</span> <span id="s57">The next day and the day after… Anthony: On Saturday and Sunday?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Irving: Yeah.</span> <span id="s59">In fact, one hit very close and there was some machine gunning.</span> <span id="s60">And this town was occupied a week later, on Friday the 8th, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Anthony: What did the Germans do once they entered the town, once they took control and then occupied the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Irving: Well, at first.</span> <span id="s63">Well let me say something, which is, maybe I shouldn’t but historically it’s true…there were a number of ethnic Germans in town who were actually welcoming the Germans.</span> <span id="s64">At the beginning what they…well let me give you a little incident on what happened within the first week.</span> <span id="s65">My brother walked down the street and he saw a…my brothers are seven years older than I, and he saw a young man, a friend of his, that he used to tutor in high school, a Pole.</span> <span id="s66">And all of a sudden the Pole called over a German and pointed to him and said that this Jew said that the Russians are coming.</span> <span id="s67">And the Germans arrested my brother and all of a sudden he found himself in a Gestapo basement.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Anthony: Just on this Pole’s recommendation?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Irving: Yes.</span> <span id="s70">With three other Jews who were there.</span> <span id="s71">We didn’t know they were there but we found out they were there.</span> <span id="s72">And the Gestapo wouldn’t even talk to my mother.</span> <span id="s73">They were beating him up and they were ready to execute him for spying.</span> <span id="s74">The only person they wanted to talk to was a representative of the Jewish population.</span> <span id="s75">Now, I don’t think we had one per se, but we did talk to the elder of the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s76">He went down, and after some negotiations, they demanded a ransom from the community.</span> <span id="s77">A pretty high ransom if I remember, I don’t remember the exact amount…I know we couldn’t pay it as a family, but the town got together and they paid a ransom and all the prisoners got free.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Anthony: They did release them?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Irving: Yeah they released them.</span> <span id="s80">And that was the first incident.</span> <span id="s81">Also, we couldn’t get any help from anybody else as far as the Polish population was concerned.</span> <span id="s82">When we saw the mother of that boy, she said, “Well, maybe he deserved it.”</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Anthony: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Irving: Eh…I told you my father used to work for a tanning factory.</span> <span id="s85">The tanning factory actually belonged to ethnic Germans.</span> <span id="s86">And the day the war broke out they told him they could not possibly have anything to do with a Jewish person, officially, anyhow.</span> <span id="s87">So he was out of a job.</span> <span id="s88">That’s how it started.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Anthony: This incident with your brother started…that was the first week of the occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Irving: I believe it happened on a Monday.</span> <span id="s91">It wasn’t the first Monday, I think it was the second Monday after the occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Anthony: But shortly thereafter?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Irving: Shortly thereafter.</span> <span id="s94">Eh…the other thing is there were a number of edicts that they issued.</span> <span id="s95">You couldn’t…you weren’t allowed to have a radio.</span> <span id="s96">They closed all the schools, there was no education allowed.</span> <span id="s97">There…assemblies of persons of more than five people were not allowed.</span> <span id="s98">All this was punishable by death penalty or ten years, or whatever.</span> <span id="s99">I don’t remember the exact punishment.</span> <span id="s100">Eh… Anthony: You said something about the ethnic Germans welcoming the Germans into Poland.</span> <span id="s101">Were Poles doing that also?</span> <span id="s102">Or was that…were they happy to see the Germans or was it just usually the ethnic Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Irving: I don’t know the answer to that.</span> <span id="s104">I know there were people with flowers who were welcoming them when they were marching into town.</span> <span id="s105">I don’t know who they were.</span> <span id="s106">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s107">But I’d assume they were ethnic Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Anthony: Do you remember before the Germans invaded, do you remember any…I don’t know the best word…do you remember anything…were you frightened of the Germans coming because you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Irving: Yes.</span> <span id="s110">Of course.</span> <span id="s111">By reputation we knew what they are capable of doing.</span> <span id="s112">We absorbed a number of German refugees between 1936 and 1939.</span> <span id="s113">And in fact there was a German girl who used to sleep in our house, she used to eat with us.</span> <span id="s114">And she was a German refugee.</span> <span id="s115">And we knew what was going on…we were aware what they were capable of doing.</span> <span id="s116">But not exactly of killing…but of all anti-Jewish laws; you weren’t allowed to own anything or do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Anthony: Do you remember, going back to the last part of 1939, what happened in Radom…other than you’ve told me of these edicts and things like that.</span> <span id="s118">What things can you remember about that last part of 1939 when the Germans had already occupied the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Irving: Shortages.</span> <span id="s120">Bread shortages.</span> <span id="s121">Meat shortages.</span> <span id="s122">All type of different shortages.</span> <span id="s123">There were…[pause].</span> <span id="s124">I was only a boy.</span> <span id="s125">I was only four years old.</span> <span id="s126">My world was probably different than the world of an adult.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Anthony: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Irving: My main preoccupation was the fact that we couldn’t go back to school.</span> <span id="s129">That changed.</span> <span id="s130">Not immediately, but within the next three months or so.</span> <span id="s131">One day I was walking into a store and the owner came out and told me that he wanted to talk to my mother.</span> <span id="s132">And then the next day, we were in a secret school.</span> <span id="s133">There were ten of us.</span> <span id="s134">Maybe ten or eleven.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Anthony: Was this a Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Irving: All Jews, yeah.</span> <span id="s137">Mostly students from the day school.</span> <span id="s138">It was run by a Ms. Sobol.</span> <span id="s139">She was a teacher in that day school.</span> <span id="s140">And we always had somebody on guard.</span> <span id="s141">And we were trained to give signals in case the Germans would approach.</span> <span id="s142">Of course it would be very dangerous if we were caught.</span> <span id="s143">But we were going to school for two years, two and a half years, going through junior high and most of…some of high school, without being able to carry a book or paperwork or anything of that sort because they immediately became suspicious.</span> <span id="s144">And of course nobody could have known.</span> <span id="s145">If a neighbor had known or a Pole would have seen us or detected us they immediately would have pointed it out.</span> <span id="s146">That was quite an enterprise.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Anthony: Was the teacher, was she involved in setting this up, or was there someone else… Irving: She lived with a family, I don’t know if they were related to her, they must have been in an apartment.</span> <span id="s148">The apartment was right on Main St. and they set it up.</span> <span id="s149">I presume she was involved in it…I don’t really know.</span> <span id="s150">But yeah…it was quite a group there.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Anthony: That’s very interesting.</span> <span id="s152">In fact, it’s a story that I haven’t heard about.</span> <span id="s153">I mean I knew that people would set up schools in ghettos and things like that, but this isn’t a ghetto, and this is very dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Irving: This is not a ghetto, no.</span> <span id="s155">In fact, as it went along, it got more and more difficult to get to the place because it was right on Main St. and for a while, later on, we weren’t even allowed to walk on Main St. as Jews, so we had to go through the back door.</span> <span id="s156">And we did that.</span> <span id="s157">Until it became a ghetto, we were going to that school.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Anthony: And that was almost two years you said?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Irving: ‘Till 1941, April 1941.</span> <span id="s160">I believe we started in 1939.</span> <span id="s161">I’m sure, we started in 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Anthony: And so in 1941 the ghetto was set up.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Irving: In 1941 the ghetto was set up.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Anthony: Can you tell me a little bit about the ghetto, what that was like when they set it up…what the restrictions were, was it a closed, walled ghetto, or… Irving: It was a closed ghetto and walled.</span> <span id="s165">The ghetto…it had…well…no it wasn’t exactly walled, no.</span> <span id="s166">It had entrances on both sides, which you could easily go through.</span> <span id="s167">In fact, to go from one side of the non-ghetto area to the other side of the non-ghetto area they had to go through a street, which ran right through the ghetto.</span> <span id="s168">So no, it wasn’t walled.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Anthony: Did you know people who would go back and forth, who would sneak back and forth?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Irving: Yeah.</span> <span id="s171">I did too.</span> <span id="s172">Well, there were two ghettos that they set up actually, there was one ghetto on one side of the town and the other ghetto, the main ghetto.</span> <span id="s173">Where we lived before the war was actually where the main ghetto was set up.</span> <span id="s174">We didn’t even have to move.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Anthony: Was the main ghetto, was that in a suburb, or was that in the middle of town?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Irving: It was in the old town, called the old town.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Anthony: And that was the main ghetto, does that mean it was larger than the other one?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Irving: Yeah.</span> <span id="s179">Well, it was a historically, traditionally a Jewish area.</span> <span id="s180">Yeah, it was larger than the other one.</span> <span id="s181">The other one was not historically a Jewish area and was on the other side of town.</span> <span id="s182">But there were a number of people that commuted between the two because they had a job… Anthony: Between the two ghettos?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Irving: Right and they had permits to go on bicycles between one and the other.</span> <span id="s184">Well…I can give you an incident, I’m going to deviate slightly.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Anthony: Sure, no, that’s fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Irving: My father, in order to make a living, he went back to tanning during the war, which was illegal for us, but he… Anthony: Why was it illegal?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Irving: Anything was illegal for Jews.</span> <span id="s188">You were only supposed to work for the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Anthony: So he was doing this on the side in order to make a living for himself and the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Irving: Yes.</span> <span id="s191">And then what he would do was stay home and [?]</span> <span id="s192">tan calf…rawhide, and then sell the leather someplace else, a small town…but in order to transport it, he couldn’t transport it out of the ghetto, he sometimes used Polish farmers who put it on a wagon and put hay on top and hide it.</span> <span id="s193">One day, my brother used to work, he had a permit to go from one ghetto to the other.</span> <span id="s194">One day when he was travelling through, going from the large ghetto to the other ghetto, he saw that wagon of hay with the man that he knew, with the Pole that he knew, standing on the market on the main street, near the police station.</span> <span id="s195">Unfortunately, he went over to find out why, and when the Polish police saw him, they arrested him.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Anthony: Is this the same brother who was arrested before?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Irving: Yeah.</span> <span id="s198">And after that, of course, they started looking for my father.</span> <span id="s199">Well first of all, he was in prison.</span> <span id="s200">While he was in prison we then wanted to find out what was happening because we had no idea.</span> <span id="s201">And what we found out was routinely they would take them out, at eleven o’clock in the morning, something like that, and take him from there to Gestapo headquarters for interrogation.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Anthony: Now this is your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Irving: No, my brother.</span> <span id="s204">From the prison, to Gestapo headquarters.</span> <span id="s205">So that was early June, 1941.</span> <span id="s206">And we were in the ghetto already, so me and my other brother, who is his twin, looks like Fagan, we took our armbands off that identified us as Jews and walked in front of the policeman right down Main St. I mean not in front, in back.</span> <span id="s207">They were walking in front and we were in the back, and had a conversation with him.</span> <span id="s208">He wouldn’t turn around, he was talking right in front…and we were talking right through Main St. without our armbands on.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Anthony: Had you done that before?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Irving: No.</span> <span id="s211">Never done it before.</span> <span id="s212">The amazing thing is that they had to cross the street, this was the main street, to take him to Gestapo headquarters and they couldn’t cross the street for over 45 minutes because the German armies were marching east, there were hundreds of thousands of Germans, and this is early June… Anthony: Right, just before the invasion.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Irving: Hundreds of thousands, just walking down the street.</span> <span id="s214">So they were standing on the corner and we were talking to him, and they couldn’t cross the street.</span> <span id="s215">So that’s…you were asking if people would go out…some people would just go out like we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Anthony: That’s amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Irving: People would do that.</span> <span id="s218">In the early days yes, but then later they used to catch them and execute them for that or put them in prison for ten years, which is the same as execution.</span> <span id="s219">It was dangerous… Anthony: Did people go outside the ghetto to try to get food, and things like that from the region…because you mentioned shortages.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Irving: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s221">You’re asking the wrong…I was a kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Anthony: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Irving: I was thirteen years old, fourteen years old…that wasn’t really my duty—I don’t know.</span> <span id="s224">I did this later in the concentration camp, but I didn’t do it in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Anthony: So we’re talking about June 1941, right before the invasion.</span> <span id="s226">Did things change in Radom once the invasion started, could you sense a difference?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">- Irving: Well, yeah, the ghetto, things in the ghetto started getting worse and worse.</span> <span id="s228">There was hunger.</span> <span id="s229">There were different levels of life in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s230">There was an affluent level, which lived normal…but the poor who had no food, there was disease…and there was no way to get anything…and overcrowding.</span> <span id="s231">There were three or four families to an apartment.</span> <span id="s232">And disease was one of the worst, there was typhus, all kind of diseases…and then there were raids by the Germans.</span> <span id="s233">They would come in the night and arrest and shoot people… Anthony: Was there any particular reason given, or they just did this?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Irving: No.</span> <span id="s235">They would have lists, and at various times there were different people they would arrest.</span> <span id="s236">At one time they came and arrested…don’t ask me why, but they arrested the kosher butchers…they picked up the kosher butchers.</span> <span id="s237">I had a friend who was my age, who lived in our house, a young boy, and they arrested him, and they held him for a while and then they brought him back one night.</span> <span id="s238">Right in front, we had a little area, which there was no building on it, it was a little garden, and they brought him back right to that garden right in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s239">We heard them all scream, “Mama, mama!”</span> <span id="s240">And shot him right there where his mother could hear him and then a while later they came and picked up most of the kosher butchers and sent them to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s241">But meanwhile, while they were picking them up they would shoot a number of them and if they would come to an apartment and not find the right person they would take somebody else like a brother or another relative… Anthony: So they were looking for specific people as far as you could tell?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Irving: Yeah, generally.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Anthony: They had like a list or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Irving: Yeah, they would come to our house and pick people up.</span> <span id="s245">But if they’re not there they would pick others.</span> <span id="s246">But if they would find, and those raids usually would be in the morning, early in the morning.</span> <span id="s247">And I know in some of those raids they found some people who were going to work like 5:30, 6:00 in the morning and they shot them, just ‘cause they were moving around and wanted to come to work.</span> <span id="s248">Why, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s249">So those raids got more and more, came more and more often…</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Anthony: More frequent.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Irving: More frequent.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Anthony: Did…do you remember when those raids were, do you remember dates at all, roughly?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Irving: Between 1941 and 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Anthony: Ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Irving: There were a number of those.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Anthony: Do you remember, were you living in your house in the ghetto since you…I know you mentioned that your house was already in where the ghetto was set up.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Irving: Except two other families moved in.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Anthony: Two other families moved in… Irving: And we shared, we had a three-room apartment, so there were two other families moved in… Anthony: Um…why don’t we go on, uh…and move to the, when you left the ghetto, when you and the family left the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Irving: Well, we didn’t leave the ghetto.</span> <span id="s260">Sometime in August 1942, they liquidated the ghetto, the second ghetto.</span> <span id="s261">They came and took all the people and sent them to Treblinka, to the gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Anthony: Now was this the SS, or was this just German guards, or do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Irving: That was, must be SS, helped by the Ukrainians.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Anthony: So Ukrainians were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Irving: Ukrainians were guards.</span> <span id="s266">I really don’t know because they…that was the other side of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s267">I mean, they only left…they killed several hundred people that night.</span> <span id="s268">They only left about a thousand males and I don’t know how many females, not many.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Anthony: Was this in the main ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Irving: The other ghetto.</span> <span id="s271">The ______Glinice it’s called Glinice.</span> <span id="s272">And that was the beginning.</span> <span id="s273">Then there were rumors that they’re going to liquidate the large ghetto any day now.</span> <span id="s274">Actually, they did, probably about ten days later.</span> <span id="s275">And sometime…it began in August 1942.</span> <span id="s276">I don’t know the exact date, but it was some time in August.</span> <span id="s277">It was right before the Jewish New Year.</span> <span id="s278">They…it was a Sunday morning, and they started installing bright lights so we knew something was going to happen that day…there were these two ghettos and there was a group of people who worked in a factory.</span> <span id="s279">There was a factory in town that produced weapons owned by Austrians, and Austrian company ______________[341].</span> <span id="s280">And there were a number of people who were stationed at that factory and one of my brothers was there and my mother was supposed to that day go to the factory, but when they started installing the lights, everybody was trying…they knew that something was going to happen that day.</span> <span id="s281">Somehow they came in that morning and they were looking for some people to go and work in a place called __________Washnik [ph, 347], which is an estate, four or five miles out of town.</span> <span id="s282">So me and my father volunteered for that.</span> <span id="s283">We went to work there.</span> <span id="s284">So we walked out with that group, and mother was supposed to go to the weapons factory, from what I hear by the time she was ready to go the Ukrainians were there and they wouldn’t let her go any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Anthony: From the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Irving: From the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Anthony: Oh, from out of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Irving: So she got deported with everybody else in that ghetto.</span> <span id="s289">Only about ten percent were left or so.</span> <span id="s290">But I wasn’t there that night.</span> <span id="s291">I was in Washnik…eh…we were on a little estate working for…and we didn’t know what was happening.</span> <span id="s292">Of course, we saw all those bright lights and heard shooting all night.</span> <span id="s293">From what I understand there were about 1,500 people killed that night and some 20,000 or so which were deported.</span> <span id="s294">A few days later we decided, the remainder of us got sent to something called the small ghetto… Anthony: Oh, they sent the rest of them to the small ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Irving: In the small ghetto there remained about two or three streets left from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s296">And that was walled in.</span> <span id="s297">Now…we decided to eh…we meaning me and another fellow about a year older than I am, we were standing in water most of the time working on that estate, we caught a cold.</span> <span id="s298">I didn’t feel so well so we went to…the man who ran that was a German, he was not an SS man, he was a civilian.</span> <span id="s299">So we went to him and we told him we didn’t feel well and we’d like to go see a doctor, we actually wanted to go out and see what happened to the little ghetto.</span> <span id="s300">And he finally relented and said he’d let us go and gave us a Jewish policeman who was there to escort us.</span> <span id="s301">And he said he’ll give us a letter so we can go safely.</span> <span id="s302">He gave us a letter and we left, on the way, my brother worked in a factory on the way, so we stopped in to see him.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Anthony: This is the armaments factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Irving: No, no.</span> <span id="s305">My other brother who was in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s306">He survived, there was a selection, some of the men were left, and he was part of the remainder.</span> <span id="s307">And he was working in a factory that was on the way from us to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s308">So we stopped and he told me, of course we knew then that my mother is gone, most of the people were gone.</span> <span id="s309">By that time we opened the letter to see what it said.</span> <span id="s310">And what it said was, it was a letter from that man to the German police saying, “These two Jews are lazy.</span> <span id="s311">They don’t want to work, and I suggest you execute them.”</span> <span id="s312">Of course, we never delivered the letter.</span> <span id="s313">We just went back to the little ghetto and disappeared.</span> <span id="s314">Luckily, they didn’t look for us.</span> <span id="s315">But that’s how I got back to the little ghetto.</span> <span id="s316">Now this is what we called the little ghetto, there of course everybody was assigned a working detail.</span> <span id="s317">Most people were working in cleaning up the remainder of the large ghetto.</span> <span id="s318">There were some other details.</span> <span id="s319">I worked on…in a place that provided a shower and a steam bath for the people.</span> <span id="s320">It was outside, it was in the old ghetto, but outside the little ghetto.</span> <span id="s321">And things there were very bad.</span> <span id="s322">There were all kind of bad actions, constantly going on, every few weeks…Um…some, well let me tell you one personal thing that happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Anthony: Sure, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Irving: When I was working…which is just an example or whatever…when I was working in that eh…place outside the ghetto, one day, there was a bakery right down the street, a Polish bakery…</span></p> <p><span id="s325">[break] Anthony: Ok, you were talking about a Polish bakery… Irving: Yeah.</span> <span id="s326">There was a Polish bakery, so we went out.</span> <span id="s327">It was very difficult to get food.</span> <span id="s328">The only way we got food, the Poles would come to the wall, it was a wooden wall, a fence, and we would give them some of those clothes that were left over and we’d trade it for food.</span> <span id="s329">And I wanted to buy some bread so I went in and there was a line out.</span> <span id="s330">I took my arm band off, of course I didn’t have much of an accent, so… and I was standing in line and I almost got to the counter to buy a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s331">And there were working men here, probably my age, maybe a year older…he saw me at the counter and started screaming, “You’re selling to Jews!</span> <span id="s332">You’re selling to Jews!”</span> <span id="s333">So I ran out.</span> <span id="s334">And he went and got Germans and the Germans start looking for me.</span> <span id="s335">And I had to hide, it’s a good thing they didn’t find me.</span> <span id="s336">If they had found me they would have executed me.</span> <span id="s337">That’s the type of relations we had…You were asking if we risked going out…it got very difficult.</span> <span id="s338">There were constant executions, people would…by the Germans.</span> <span id="s339">A lot of the executions were done by the S.D., the Sicherheitsdienst [450].</span> <span id="s340">They would bring people in, we don’t know who, and execute them right near-by.</span> <span id="s341">At one time in that little ghetto there was a…they announced that there will be a list of people who want to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s342">At first people didn’t want to register but then finally people registered, and I and my brother registered for that.</span> <span id="s343">And one day, and that was January 13, 1943, they got everybody out of the house and put them into a back yard and started calling names.</span> <span id="s344">And the names that they were calling were from that list.</span> <span id="s345">There was only one difference, they weren’t all from that list.</span> <span id="s346">Some of the names were changed, how and when we don’t know.</span> <span id="s347">Our names were not there.</span> <span id="s348">Somebody changed some of the names.</span> <span id="s349">But names were called, they were called from that list.</span> <span id="s350">There were about 1,500 names on that list, and those people were put in the street.</span> <span id="s351">Now the question is, we knew one of the groups would survive and the other would go away, and we just didn’t know which.</span> <span id="s352">But it became apparent that because of the names that did appear on the list that the group who is on the list is going to be the one that survives.</span> <span id="s353">Eventually, I ran forward after they finished reading the list.</span> <span id="s354">The elder of the ghetto was a doctor… Anthony: Was that who was reading the list?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Irving: No.</span> <span id="s356">The Germans.</span> <span id="s357">Some…but no.</span> <span id="s358">A Jewish man was reading the list, one of the secretaries.</span> <span id="s359">But there were two Germans who were checking the list because the men were running out.</span> <span id="s360">If you didn’t show up when your name was called—forget it—they read another one.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Anthony: Did the…Jewish council, or the Judenrat, did they take the list down, or did the Germans take the list?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Irving: Don’t know.</span> <span id="s363">Well…what happened is that I ran out there and the lady who was running the place where I worked, her name was Ms. Zucker, and she was an acquaintance of that doctor who was the elder of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s364">All of a sudden he called out for Ms. Zucker and her family.</span> <span id="s365">And I ran up and they stopped me and they said, “Who are you?”</span> <span id="s366">and I said, “I am her brother.”</span> <span id="s367">And they checked with him and he said, “Yeah, he’s her brother.”</span> <span id="s368">Of course he knew I’m not, but he did.</span> <span id="s369">So he saved my life for that…so they let me go.</span> <span id="s370">And that’s how I wound up with the column [503] that was safe.</span> <span id="s371">Now they took those 1,500 people, which were about half, then they added some other, 50 or 100.</span> <span id="s372">That part, that column stayed.</span> <span id="s373">The other people were just sent on the train and sent out to Treblinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Anthony: So you were able to stay in the ghetto because you were pretending to be a brother of…Did your brother, did he remain?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Irving: Yeah.</span> <span id="s376">He remained because all of a sudden they needed another 50 people or something and somehow they picked him.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Anthony: For a work detail or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Irving: No.</span> <span id="s379">They just needed 50 more.</span> <span id="s380">I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s381">They pushed them over, and he somehow wound up with those too.</span> <span id="s382">At the end he found out that he was lucky too.</span> <span id="s383">We both survived.</span> <span id="s384">Now, there were executions.</span> <span id="s385">One day they called all people who had degrees, doctors, lawyers, and put them in a truck and the Ukrainians took them out to a small town outside the city and shot them.</span> <span id="s386">But that type of thing was happening…</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Anthony: Right… Irving: My father and my brother were in the factory that produced the…the weapons factory.</span> <span id="s388">So sometime I think in April.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Anthony: Of 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Irving: 1943, yeah.</span> <span id="s391">I, they took me over there too.</span> <span id="s392">So I started working there too.</span> <span id="s393">Now there was a camp that, there was a working camp.</span> <span id="s394">We all worked in the factory, two sheds, and slept in a camp a little bit away from the factory.</span> <span id="s395">And we were guarded by Ukrainians mostly.</span> <span id="s396">But in the factory there were a number of ethnic Germans who were guard…eh…guard…</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Anthony: Security people?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Irving: Security guards.</span> <span id="s399">And they really had the upper hand…they used to… Anthony: These were ethnic Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Irving: Yeah.</span> <span id="s401">One of them especially.</span> <span id="s402">His name was Holz, H-O-L-Z, Jacob Holz.</span> <span id="s403">He used to…he executed about eighteen people.</span> <span id="s404">One of them…he forced everybody to watch, as this young boy, a young man who I knew, he was a friend of mine, his name was Weinberg, and the whole camp had to watch it.</span> <span id="s405">And they executed him.</span> <span id="s406">The reason they executed him is I believe, because he fell asleep… Anthony: While he was working?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Irving: Yeah.</span> <span id="s408">One day they called me over.</span> <span id="s409">My job there was to sweep the street, sweep the yard.</span> <span id="s410">They called me over one day in the morning.</span> <span id="s411">And he was there and he told me to dig a grave for a freshly killed body of a young boy.</span> <span id="s412">And he told me to bury it.</span> <span id="s413">And I started burying…and he kept that gun in front of me and said, “Bury it, and if you don’t do it quickly, you’re going to be buried, too” He was something… Anthony: This was the same Holz?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Irving: The same Holz.</span> <span id="s415">He also killed a…there were some people escaped and when they came they got…I think it was some relatives with two children, and they executed…I didn’t see it.</span> <span id="s416">About eighteen people.</span> <span id="s417">Now I went and testified against him.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Anthony: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Irving: Yeah, a few years ago, a couple of years ago, not long ago in Eastern Germany.</span> <span id="s420">They got him.</span> <span id="s421">Ok, that’s the part in the factory.</span> <span id="s422">Now sometime in 1944… Anthony: Now actually let me ask you a question real quick about where you were working in this factory.</span> <span id="s423">You said that you used to sleep at the factory…?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Irving: No, at the camp outside the factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Anthony: At the camp, ok.</span> <span id="s426">How far was this from the ghetto in Radom?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Irving: Oh, it was on the other side of town.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Anthony: Oh, so it was very, very near.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Irving: Near?</span> <span id="s430">What do you mean, near?</span> <span id="s431">On the other side of town.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Anthony: But it wasn’t like twenty miles out of town?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Irving: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Anthony: And there was a camp set up around the factory for the workers, for the prisoners basically I guess to be taken at night?</span> <span id="s435">Or did you all sleep in the factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Irving: Oh, we never slept in the factory.</span> <span id="s437">We slept in the camp.</span> <span id="s438">There were two shifts—in the morning a shift marched into the factory and worked all day and in the evening they went back to the camp and then another shift walked in…they worked in the factory and stayed in camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Anthony: Ok, ok.</span> <span id="s440">And another question…Holz, the guard, you said he was an ethnic German.</span> <span id="s441">Was he an ethnic German who was a Polish citizen or was he a German SS guard?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Irving: No.</span> <span id="s443">He was not an SS guard.</span> <span id="s444">He is an ethnic German.</span> <span id="s445">From what I understand now, and I didn’t know then, he is an illiterate ethnic German.</span> <span id="s446">No, he is not an SS guard.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">[Flip Tape] Irving: Sometime in 1943 we…they brought in the people from the small ghetto and combined the two camps into the camp of the…from the factory, from the weapons factory, combined the two camps and shortly afterwards it became a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s448">Now, if you ask me for a date, I don’t know, it might have been November 1943… Anthony: Ok, but some time in 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Irving: Yeah.</span> <span id="s450">I think it was 1943, yeah…and at that time the SS took over, we had a new set of guards.</span> <span id="s451">In fact, they were trained to be concentration guards and all that…and we got concentration camp uniforms, hats and all that, and we were there until July 1944.</span> <span id="s452">Again, the same thing repeated, there were constant raids here and there.</span> <span id="s453">They would pick a number of people and kill them.</span> <span id="s454">Just before we left, a few months before that, they took a number of people who were carpenters, I don’t know why they needed carpenters, I think they wanted to erase any of the marks that they left.</span> <span id="s455">And these people disappeared, apparently they executed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Anthony: In this camp you were taken to the armaments factory to work, from this camp.</span> <span id="s457">Can you tell me a little bit about working in the armaments factory?</span> <span id="s458">What you did, what your job was…?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Irving: Personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Anthony: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Irving: I personally cleaned the yard.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Anthony: Oh, right, you told me that.</span> <span id="s463">Ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Irving: Most of the other people worked on eh…a line doing…building bicycles or building weapons or whatever…yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Anthony: And that’s what your brother and father were doing at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Irving: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Anthony: Were both your brothers there?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Irving: Oh, my father was also working cleaning the yard.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Anthony: And both your brothers were then working in armaments, they were doing…on the assembly line?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Irving: Yeah.</span> <span id="s471">Around July, shortly after, July 20th, 22nd, 23rd of July, we started hearing noises which were, well, surprising noises, which were…at first we thought it was thunder, but it doesn’t really thunder.</span> <span id="s472">But those were the approaching Russian army.</span> <span id="s473">They were actually in Lublin, which is only 30 to 40 miles down the road.</span> <span id="s474">And we had some Polish people who did some training and at that time we asked them if we could stay with them for a week or two because we thought the Russians would be there within a week.</span> <span id="s475">They refused.</span> <span id="s476">No way.</span> <span id="s477">But around the 25th or 26th of July, again the dates, I cannot be exact…the…we were all evacuated.</span> <span id="s478">We walked out of the camp.</span> <span id="s479">We walked down the streets of the city.</span> <span id="s480">And if I remember, there were a lot of Polish workers who were just looking at us, believe it or not, applauding.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Anthony: Do you know what for?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Irving: The fact that apparently that we were leaving the city.</span> <span id="s483">I’ll never forget that.</span> <span id="s484">I shut out a lot of sounds that happened during the war, but I’ll never shut out that sound.</span> <span id="s485">I never will.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Anthony: The applause?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Irving: I’ll always remember that.</span> <span id="s488">There were some people who tried to run away that day.</span> <span id="s489">And they went into a local building until some of the Poles indicated where they are.</span> <span id="s490">The Germans got them and they were shot.</span> <span id="s491">We walked for several nights and several days.</span> <span id="s492">On the second day or the third day, actually, well maybe it was the second day of the march, they asked that the people who were weak and they couldn’t walk be put in a horse and buggy in the back…and then…so they shouldn’t get too weak…and in the evening we used to…at night we slept in the fields.</span> <span id="s493">Wherever we were they would select a field, and we’d sleep in that field.</span> <span id="s494">And that night, before we got to the field, the sick people in the buggy got driven into the forest and executed by the guards.</span> <span id="s495">And the guards for that march were all Lithuanians or Ukrainians.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Anthony: So were there any SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Irving: There were SS.</span> <span id="s498">There were the regular SS that were with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Anthony: But the majority… Irving: But the majority…they used a lot of Lithuanians and well, there might have been others, Latvians…I don’t know.</span> <span id="s500">Ok…it was a very tough march.</span> <span id="s501">We marched to a place called Tomaszów.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Anthony: Did they tell you where you were going?</span> <span id="s503">Or not at all… Irving: Just started marching.</span> <span id="s504">We were hoping at the time that the Russians would get there, but… Anthony: Get there right… Irving: But apparently they stopped.</span> <span id="s505">As we know now, they stopped for several months, but we didn’t know it then.</span> <span id="s506">They kept us in this Tomaszów factory, in a factory that was idle at the time, for several days.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Anthony: Could you spell the name of that town for me?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Irving: T-O-M-A-S-C-O-W.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Anthony: Ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Irving: And it’s got a yetski [ph 701] on the end because of…</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Anthony: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Irving: And we stayed in that factory for, I don’t know, I think it was about eight or nine days.</span> <span id="s513">They separated the women from the men.</span> <span id="s514">The men stayed in the factory, the women, I believe, stayed in a local jail, I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Anthony: Were they feeding you on this march at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Irving: Yeah.</span> <span id="s517">I think they did.</span> <span id="s518">I’m not quite sure.</span> <span id="s519">I don’t remember anymore, it wasn’t that type of a thing.</span> <span id="s520">We had a shortage of water.</span> <span id="s521">We did not have enough water.</span> <span id="s522">As I remember, one night when we stopped everybody ran to get water and they started shooting and some people got wounded because of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Anthony: Because they went for the water?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Irving: Because they went for the water.</span> <span id="s525">So we had water problems, but I don’t think there were food problems, I can’t remember that.</span> <span id="s526">On a Saturday, one Saturday, they put us in wagons and transported us from there to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Anthony: This was on a train?</span> <span id="s528">Train-wagons?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Irving: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Anthony: From this town?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Irving: From this town.</span> <span id="s532">We arrived in Auschwitz on a Sunday morning.</span> <span id="s533">I’m not going to give you a date because I don’t remember…sometime in August 1944.</span> <span id="s534">I don’t know exactly, but it was a Sunday morning.</span> <span id="s535">While there, it was early in the morning…about…the first thing we know they told us to get out of the cars and line up for a selection.</span> <span id="s536">While we were lining up for a selection, they said, “Hold on, hold on, it’s a mistake, go back.”</span> <span id="s537">So we went back into the cars and we heard another car coming.</span> <span id="s538">And while we were sitting there a train came in from a place called Lodz, L-O-D-Z.</span> <span id="s539">I don’t know how many people were on it, it was a large train, I think there were about 4,000 people on that train.</span> <span id="s540">And while we were standing there they emptied that train, took all the people, all of them.</span> <span id="s541">And what we saw on that train, they came from a ghetto, Lodz still was a ghetto at the time.</span> <span id="s542">And they were eh…there were some children there.</span> <span id="s543">We didn’t see the children because we were in a camp already…there were no children.</span> <span id="s544">It was supposed to be a population from maybe fourteen [ph] years old.</span> <span id="s545">And eh…they took all these people and sent them to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s546">All of them within a few minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Anthony: Was there a sense on your train that you were being held for some work purpose or not?</span> <span id="s548">That you…since you hadn’t been sent--?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Irving: We didn’t know.</span> <span id="s550">We didn’t know.</span> <span id="s551">We had no idea.</span> <span id="s552">We thought, then they told us to line up.</span> <span id="s553">We thought, they’re going to do the same thing with us.</span> <span id="s554">But they didn’t.</span> <span id="s555">What they did is they took the people who looked young and looked old, we were also told to watch out because they were looking for twins.</span> <span id="s556">My brothers were twins.</span> <span id="s557">My father at the time was 48 or 49 and I of course was seventeen.</span> <span id="s558">So we were all a problem.</span> <span id="s559">What we did is they separated, they weren’t standing together.</span> <span id="s560">I didn’t shave, and my father shaved twice.</span> <span id="s561">Somehow we got though.</span> <span id="s562">But they did take, I don’t know, maybe 1,000 people, maybe 2,000 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Anthony: Did they ask you your age?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Irving: No, because it went through, you know, like a short arm inspection in the army.</span> <span id="s565">You know what a short arm inspection is?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Anthony: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Irving: That’s what they did.</span> <span id="s568">They just picked out…you go this way, you go this way…and that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Anthony: Can we backtrack just a little bit?</span> <span id="s570">Can you tell me about the train ride to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Irving: I already told you about it.</span> <span id="s572">It’s just locked, and we were about 60, 70 people in a car.</span> <span id="s573">And the car was locked, and it was overnight.</span> <span id="s574">I mean we left in the afternoon and got in there at three in the morning.</span> <span id="s575">It wasn’t that long a ride.</span> <span id="s576">It was not that momentous a ride.</span> <span id="s577">We were mostly in fear, so…we didn’t…I don’t have any recollections.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Anthony: Alright.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Irving: We left Auschwitz and the thing that I recall is that we stopped…we left Auschwitz Sunday afternoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Anthony: They put you back on the train to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Irving: Except the women.</span> <span id="s582">They kept the women.</span> <span id="s583">The women remained in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s584">The men were put back on the train…and essentially most of the same SS guards came back, and then some new ones.</span> <span id="s585">But not the Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s586">I don’t know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s587">Well, some of them…not all of them came, some of the guards we knew.</span> <span id="s588">And we started off on a journey.</span> <span id="s589">Well, the first stop was in Czechoslovakia as I remember, the next morning.</span> <span id="s590">It is interesting that when we stopped in Czechoslovakia, we saw…we saw a train going the other way, filled with French Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Anthony: French Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Irving: Yeah.</span> <span id="s593">And all they wanted to know was how far it is…how much longer they have to get to Dachau to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s594">That’s the only thing.</span> <span id="s595">And we continued.</span> <span id="s596">Essentially, we went to, I don’t really know what path we took… Anthony: Did they let you off the train at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Irving: No, only on the train.</span> <span id="s598">We went all the way from there, I guess through Czechoslovakia and Austria, Bavaria and Stuttgart.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Anthony: To Stuttgart, ok… Irving: And in Stuttgart I think they took us into a delousing and shower and then they reloaded us and took us to a camp called Vaihingen, which is near Stuttgart, twenty miles from Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s600">It’s Vaihingen an der Enz, there’s also a suburb of Stuttgart called Vaihingen, it’s Vaihingen an der Enz, which is about twenty miles down the road.</span> <span id="s601">Now that camp, it was brand new.</span> <span id="s602">There was nobody there.</span> <span id="s603">We were the first inhabitants.</span> <span id="s604">It consisted of five wooden buildings, maybe six wooden buildings, no walks, all mud.</span> <span id="s605">The latrines that were just a hole covered with a roof and very few basic things available.</span> <span id="s606">And the labor there was to build.</span> <span id="s607">I don’t really know what we were doing.</span> <span id="s608">I think we were building some kind of armament factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Anthony: But you weren’t actually building armaments, it was building some sort of factory… Irving: No, no.</span> <span id="s610">A factory, it was building a building.</span> <span id="s611">It was a baustelle, the German word for baustelle, bau-stelle, that’s what we worked on—the baustelle.</span> <span id="s612">I don’t really know what we were building…em…we would line up in the morning and each group would go out to a different type of work.</span> <span id="s613">Now, the em…food situation, although you get…a cup of coffee in the morning.</span> <span id="s614">And there wasn’t coffee there was smoked chicory or something.</span> <span id="s615">And a cup of soup and a slice of bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Anthony: That’s it for the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Irving: That’s it.</span> <span id="s618">And, eh…it didn’t take very long before people started dying.</span> <span id="s619">And the rate of death was pretty high.</span> <span id="s620">Of course then diseases came in…lice, there was no soap, no washing facilities, no shower.</span> <span id="s621">There was a shower built later, but the shower built outside the camp.</span> <span id="s622">I wasn’t there when the shower was built, but I understand that the day they put in the shower they evacuated.</span> <span id="s623">So I don’t know about it.</span> <span id="s624">But it was built outside the camp so you’d have to run out naked to take the shower and come back.</span> <span id="s625">Ok?</span> <span id="s626">But I wasn’t even there then.</span> <span id="s627">So I couldn’t even take a shower this way.</span> <span id="s628">There was no shower.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Anthony: Were you working?</span> <span id="s630">Was this building underground or was it above ground?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Irving: The buildings?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Anthony: Yeah, the buildings, the factories, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Irving: No.</span> <span id="s634">It wasn’t a factory, it was a baustelle, we were building things, we were putting things together.</span> <span id="s635">There were German baumeisters, they were directing us.</span> <span id="s636">We were taking stones from here and putting them over here.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Anthony: Ok, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Irving: We were doing some buildings.</span> <span id="s639">We were building some things.</span> <span id="s640">I don’t know what they were doing.</span> <span id="s641">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s642">There was…there are things I can…there are some things I can tell you about this camp, which I feel are interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Anthony: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Irving: Which is…unusual.</span> <span id="s645">The guards, we started learning about some of the guards.</span> <span id="s646">Some of them were very mean, they beat us.</span> <span id="s647">They were very mean.</span> <span id="s648">But some of them were less mean.</span> <span id="s649">One of the less mean of the guards, whose nickname was Gabba…</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Anthony: Gabba?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Irving: Yeah, we called him Gabba.</span> <span id="s652">Now I don’t know what his real name is.</span> <span id="s653">I learned that if you went with the Gabba you usually got a better assignment.</span> <span id="s654">So one day I went to work for the Gabba.</span> <span id="s655">And it turned out that that day he took us to a place, which was not the building, not the baustelle, but something in the opposite direction.</span> <span id="s656">We went to the forest and then we wound up on an estate.</span> <span id="s657">It was quite different.</span> <span id="s658">First of all, there was a big tub of potatoes being boiled.</span> <span id="s659">And some of the people, there were maybe thirty people.</span> <span id="s660">They called some of the people to go and get some hay.</span> <span id="s661">The rest of the people were near the potato pot.</span> <span id="s662">And there was nobody near us.</span> <span id="s663">And when we saw…I mean we were hungry!</span> <span id="s664">And we saw boiled potatoes standing there…I mean this is a big estate, it was a nice background and a nice house…we turned the pot over and started going after the potatoes, grabbing the potatoes and trying to eat.</span> <span id="s665">And the SS of course started hitting us with their rifles.</span> <span id="s666">And then this lady came out and started screaming at the SS, telling them to stop it.</span> <span id="s667">They can’t do this, not in her place…they’ll never do this.</span> <span id="s668">And all of a sudden they stopped.</span> <span id="s669">They listened.</span> <span id="s670">We didn’t know why, how, what’s happening.</span> <span id="s671">Turned out that the place belonged to the baroness from _________Neurath.</span> <span id="s672">She was a German noble.</span> <span id="s673">Her brother-in-law was the Secretary of State in Hitler’s cabinet.</span> <span id="s674">During the war he was the protector of Himmler.</span> <span id="s675">He got twelve years in Nuremberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Anthony: Ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Irving: But she said that while we worked at her, we are not to be touched.</span> <span id="s678">She was a good protector.</span> <span id="s679">She protected us.</span> <span id="s680">And they wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s681">After that they made an agreement.</span> <span id="s682">She said, if you’re going to work for her, we’re going to get food.</span> <span id="s683">We’re going to help get the food from the trees.</span> <span id="s684">Any fruit that’s on the trees is hers—any fruit that falls off, we can have.</span> <span id="s685">That type of thing.</span> <span id="s686">And she was very nice.</span> <span id="s687">There was one young man that she particularly liked and she would sometimes invite him to do some special things.</span> <span id="s688">And she was very good to us.</span> <span id="s689">She was a very nice lady.</span> <span id="s690">And we used to get a lot of fruit and things improved because we had extra food.</span> <span id="s691">We could live there.</span> <span id="s692">I worked on that place for about two weeks.</span> <span id="s693">And it really helped me.</span> <span id="s694">It really put me on my feet.</span> <span id="s695">And one of my brothers worked there too, he was on the same duty.</span> <span id="s696">That helped us a lot.</span> <span id="s697">Now her daughter is alive.</span> <span id="s698">She was a book-burner.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Anthony: Oh really?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Irving: Yeah.</span> <span id="s701">And…so… Anthony: Your other brother and your father were back in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Irving: Yeah.</span> <span id="s703">They worked on other details.</span> <span id="s704">We worked on that detail.</span> <span id="s705">Well, it turned out that after two weeks they decided, this is constantly going on, they were sending out 50 people to one camp, 50 people to another camp.</span> <span id="s706">Slowly new people were coming into the camp Vaihingen an der Enz.</span> <span id="s707">Other camps, other nationalities.</span> <span id="s708">At first when we first went in we were all from the same town.</span> <span id="s709">We were all the same.</span> <span id="s710">Slowly, new people came in from other cities, other nations.</span> <span id="s711">And after working there for two weeks they took the four of us, my two brothers, my father and me, and they sent us to Unterriexingen.</span> <span id="s712">Eh…that’s another camp, which is about seven miles down the road.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Anthony: From Stuttgart or from Vaihingen?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Irving: From Vaihingen an der Enz.</span> <span id="s715">About seven or eight miles down the road.</span> <span id="s716">Now who came there.</span> <span id="s717">There was really not, again, nothing was there.</span> <span id="s718">It was a new camp.</span> <span id="s719">There were only…well one building was fully completed.</span> <span id="s720">One building they just started, I’m not sure they even started it.</span> <span id="s721">But by a building I mean a…it was a block.</span> <span id="s722">One block that kept prisoners.</span> <span id="s723">And again, the toilet was a slit with a roof on top.</span> <span id="s724">In there we didn’t even have water.</span> <span id="s725">There was no water inside the camp.</span> <span id="s726">To get the water we had to go outside the camp.</span> <span id="s727">[break] There was no water being brought.</span> <span id="s728">Water had to be brought in.</span> <span id="s729">That camp was [break] the heat consisted of potbelly stoves, except they didn’t give us any wood.</span> <span id="s730">The last time we had been given underwear was sometime in August.</span> <span id="s731">And by that time it was November.</span> <span id="s732">So our underwear was probably torn to pieces.</span> <span id="s733">It was full of lice.</span> <span id="s734">We had no shoes anymore.</span> <span id="s735">The shoes were wooden shoes and the straps were gone.</span> <span id="s736">There was no nails to fix them.</span> <span id="s737">There was no soap.</span> <span id="s738">Nothing to wash…there was no…there were no basics.</span> <span id="s739">The best way to describe the camp is—look around.</span> <span id="s740">See what it is you can’t live without and then say to yourself, well we didn’t have that.</span> <span id="s741">There was a doctor and he had probably some basic pills.</span> <span id="s742">There was also one room reserved for sick people.</span> <span id="s743">The death rate was very high.</span> <span id="s744">It was an awful camp.</span> <span id="s745">We worked there on building a landing strip for German planes.</span> <span id="s746">I believe that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s747">But in the meantime I learned one way to supplement the food and not to die of hunger.</span> <span id="s748">Most of the people of course were dying of hunger.</span> <span id="s749">Hunger was probably the biggest cause of death…was to try to get outside the camp and get some food.</span> <span id="s750">So I did that.</span> <span id="s751">And especially on Thursday (?)</span> <span id="s752">, I learned how to run away.</span> <span id="s753">I remember the first time I run away actually I stole a __________________________[933].</span> <span id="s754">I found myself as working in the fields and dewheating [ph, 938] the fields.</span> <span id="s755">The grass was very high and we were laying deep in the grass and the guards were front and behind us and I was falling behind the column of people.</span> <span id="s756">I looked up and I was like 50 feet behind them.</span> <span id="s757">And I had a choice of either trying to catch up with them and I knew if I do that, _____[944] would see me and beat me up.</span> <span id="s758">I turn around and go the other way.</span> <span id="s759">And I decided to go the other way.</span> <span id="s760">And I did, went the other way I started turning around and running away and I did, I crawled away and successfully and first thing I did was go into a farmer’s barn and find some vegetables and got some of the vegetables but then I have to make a decision.</span> <span id="s761">What do I do?</span> <span id="s762">I was outside of the camp, there was really no place to go.</span> <span id="s763">I couldn’t go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s764">I couldn’t be in Germany.</span> <span id="s765">There was nobody that I trust in Germany.</span> <span id="s766">I knew if they find out that I escaped they could probably harm my father and brothers.</span> <span id="s767">So I crawled back.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Anthony: You snuck back into the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Irving: I snuck back into the labor brigade.</span> <span id="s770">And brought home the vegetables.</span> <span id="s771">It helped us and we… Anthony: What did you manage to get?</span> <span id="s772">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Irving: I think I got some carrots and some garlic from that first time.</span> <span id="s774">Unterriexingen and I did this several times.</span> <span id="s775">But one time, I will tell you this so that we can make this a little shorter.</span> <span id="s776">One time, I went into a farm to a…the German farmers used to store and supply their food outside in the storage sheds.</span> <span id="s777">They never even closed the storage sheds, they would put a branch into the storage shed just to keep it closed.</span> <span id="s778">It was easy enough to open it up.</span> <span id="s779">And so I wandered to that farm and opened up the storage shed and that storage shed was full of potatoes, carrots, and all kind of what were to me goodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Anthony: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Irving: And I started loading up some of that and all of a sudden I felt this thing in the back of my back.</span> <span id="s782">It turned out to be a gun.</span> <span id="s783">And a lady’s voice says to me, __________[979], “Put up your arms.”</span> <span id="s784">I put up my arms and she says turn around.</span> <span id="s785">I turn around and she looks at me and says, “Oh my God, you’re only a baby, you’re only a boy.”</span> <span id="s786">Now we started talking and I told her that I’m…I was only seventeen years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Anthony: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Irving: I told her I’m hungry, I don’t want anything else.</span> <span id="s789">I just want some food, that’s all.</span> <span id="s790">And she looked at me for a while and she said, “You know something,” she said, “we’re very short on potatoes,” and closed the door and left.</span> <span id="s791">So I took some of the stuff and went out.</span> <span id="s792">Now I went back to that shed a couple more times.</span> <span id="s793">I know one time that I went back, I saw her in the window.</span> <span id="s794">She saw me go in.</span> <span id="s795">I think she waved, I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s796">But she didn’t say anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Anthony: Now, this was in the second, this was in Unterriexingen.</span> <span id="s798">What direction was _____[995]?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Irving: One day… Anthony: This was a farm that was not far from the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Irving: Right, not far from the camp.</span> <span id="s801">It wasn’t a big farm, it wasn’t a farm like you might have here, a farm with several acres, just a small farm.</span> <span id="s802">One day, I remember that well, I went into that shed and the door opened and she came in and she said I want you to come into the kitchen.</span> <span id="s803">And she went in first and I followed her.</span> <span id="s804">I went into the kitchen, I sat there and she gave me a lot of food and she gave me all kinds of cookies.</span> <span id="s805">And she even gave me a drink of wine.</span> <span id="s806">She wanted to know if I knew what day this is.</span> <span id="s807">I didn’t know, but it had to be the day before Christmas and in 1944.</span> <span id="s808">While I was there it started snowing and on cloudy day [ph] and snow, it snowed very hard and uh she told me that she cook for the guards.</span> <span id="s809">The guards told her that the only people that are in this camp are political prisoners who are against the German Reich and I told her this isn’t true.</span> <span id="s810">How can I be a political prisoner, I was twelve years old.</span> <span id="s811">What did I have to do with politics?</span> <span id="s812">She uh… I sat there for a while then I left but you realize that I walked around barefooted and the snow was high by that time.</span> <span id="s813">It was very difficult for me to get back.</span> <span id="s814">By the time I get back, it was too late for lunch.</span> <span id="s815">I got back, it was past twelve o’clock and the group apparently was already assembled and they knew that I was missing.</span> <span id="s816">In fact, they had sent guards out looking for me.</span> <span id="s817">I knew I’m in trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Anthony: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Irving: I put stuff away that she gave me.</span> <span id="s820">I tried to preserve it.</span> <span id="s821">I just left a couple of apples in there and I waited till they came back from working.</span> <span id="s822">I mixed in them, you couldn’t see me.</span> <span id="s823">But they immediately knew who it was because there were only one or two who used to run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Anthony: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Irving: They beat me up pretty well.</span> <span id="s826">And they tried to tell…they wanted me to tell them where I went, what I did.</span> <span id="s827">I kept telling them that I went to the airfield and that they gave me some apples.</span> <span id="s828">I knew they weren’t going to do anything to the German fliers.</span> <span id="s829">Then in the evening they put me at the end of the column when they march back to the camp.</span> <span id="s830">Now two weeks before then, they, there were two Poles but I left out that.</span> <span id="s831">Meanwhile, some Poles came in to camp…a couple hundred Poles.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Anthony: They were just…they were not Jews?</span> <span id="s833">They were just Poles?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Irving: They were just Poles.</span> <span id="s835">Two of these Poles escaped and they caught them and the punishment was that, after they caught them, they exposed them overnight, they were kneeling with their hands up, all night.</span> <span id="s836">In the morning they were frozen.</span> <span id="s837">So, when the column went in they made me do the same thing, kneel with my hands up and I was sitting there.</span> <span id="s838">I didn’t know what they were going to do with me.</span> <span id="s839">I knew I was going to get some punishment but I didn’t know what type of punishment.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Anthony: This was already after they had beaten you?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Irving: After, yeah.</span> <span id="s842">And uh it got to be very late at night.</span> <span id="s843">A guy who worked for them, who cleaned up their SS guards’ barracks came out and I asked him what they were going to do and he said they decided to shoot me.</span> <span id="s844">I thought this might be right.</span> <span id="s845">And then finally they came out, two or three of them; I don’t remember how many came over and they said, well, they said we decided to commute the sentence.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Anthony: These were the SS guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Irving: Yeah, they weren’t SS.</span> <span id="s848">They were guards but they weren’t SS.</span> <span id="s849">In fact, the one that said that was actually a member of the German air force but he was a guard.</span> <span id="s850">He said, “You know, we just won a great victory.”</span> <span id="s851">Now that had to be the Battle of the Bulge, you know that now, I didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s852">He said, ”You know we just have to win a great victory.</span> <span id="s853">We’re going to need people like, slaves like you because the German Reich is going to want, is going to rule the whole world.</span> <span id="s854">So we commuted your sentence.</span> <span id="s855">Instead of executing you, you’re going to get fifty lashes.”</span> <span id="s856">That’s what I got, I got fifty lashes.</span> <span id="s857">And then they throwed me into a, what do you call it, hydrolation [ph] (c. 053).</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Anthony: Solitary confinement.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Irving: And actually there were two other guys in that solitary confinement.</span> <span id="s860">One Pole and one Jew.</span> <span id="s861">The Pole was released about fifteen minutes after I got in there.</span> <span id="s862">The other guy, I remember about midnight the Germans would sit here, organize, and they broke several bones.</span> <span id="s863">Well they heal, you can’t see it now.</span> <span id="s864">I take x-rays down at the doctors keep asking me have I ever had a big accident.</span> <span id="s865">I got lots of broken bones.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Anthony: That’s when they beat you, that’s what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Irving: I think the fact that I was frozen helped me.</span> <span id="s868">The pain wasn’t so bad.</span> <span id="s869">Well that’s what happened that Christmas night, Christmas Eve.</span> <span id="s870">Shortly after, because of that night I guess, I got pneumonia.</span> <span id="s871">They kept me in the hospital about ten days and after I got out of the hospital they put me right to work.</span> <span id="s872">They made me, made me carry a load of bricks.</span> <span id="s873">I couldn’t carry it.</span> <span id="s874">I was too weak, I was just out of the hospital.</span> <span id="s875">So I dropped it.</span> <span id="s876">Because of that they threw me in solitary confinement again.</span> <span id="s877">When they left me out of that solitary confinement, they were evacuating the camp.</span> <span id="s878">And all of a sudden everybody else in the second barracks (long pause) and I found my father there and my other two, my two brothers were too sick.</span> <span id="s879">So the sick people were sent back to Vaihingen an der Enz and all the people who were not sick enough was sent out to camp Kochendorf.</span> <span id="s880">There were very few left, very few.</span> <span id="s881">Most, a lot of people died.</span> <span id="s882">There were, the rate of death was like four or five a day.</span> <span id="s883">A lot of the Poles died.</span> <span id="s884">I don’t know how many Poles survived but very few…there were several hundred.</span> <span id="s885">Most of them died.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">When we arrived in Kochendorf, again we went through a procedure of trying to get washed.</span> <span id="s887">The way we were going to get clean is they kept us out it was winter, it was January, I’m sure it was January.</span> <span id="s888">It was cold and on Sunday and we were being kept outside and inside they had a big tub of water, which was being warmed on one of the potbellied stoves.</span> <span id="s889">They filled it up with warm water, and four or five guys would get into that tub and wash themselves.</span> <span id="s890">After the first guy, that tub was as dark as the ground.</span> <span id="s891">We didn’t take a bath in eight months, five months or something.</span> <span id="s892">August to January, five months, four months.</span> <span id="s893">So after that there were no towels either.</span> <span id="s894">Then you went to that around the potbellied stove and waited there until you dried.</span> <span id="s895">Meanwhile, they took your clothes, whatever clothes you had and they sent us to the steamer.</span> <span id="s896">When it came out the steamer they were all wet and you put it on.</span> <span id="s897">They send you outside then you waited till everybody was ready.</span> <span id="s898">Which means you waited outside for two or three hours.</span> <span id="s899">This procedure, I just got through pneumonia, with this procedure, by the time I got to the barracks, I was pretty sick.</span> <span id="s900">Now there we had a guy, the guy who was heading that barracks, his name was Teddy.</span> <span id="s901">He is a Pole too.</span> <span id="s902">And he was pretty tough.</span> <span id="s903">He was one of the toughest guys.</span> <span id="s904">He really beat us up pretty badly, beat up some guys.</span> <span id="s905">People were very scared of him.</span> <span id="s906">But he give us a lecture, he said, “tomorrow you can go and see a doctor if you don’t feel good.</span> <span id="s907">But if you have a 104, he’ll send you to the hospital.</span> <span id="s908">If you don’t have a 104, he’ll send you back here.</span> <span id="s909">I guarantee if you get back here, I’ll kill you.”</span> <span id="s910">And he meant it.</span> <span id="s911">But I went anyhow, I felt bad, so I went to see a doctor.</span> <span id="s912">And when, when I walked in he asked me what’s wrong with me, first he took my temperature and I must have had high temperature.</span> <span id="s913">He took my temperature and asked me what’s wrong with me.</span> <span id="s914">I said I just had pneumonia.</span> <span id="s915">But the German word for pneumonia is lung infection (Lungenentzündung).</span> <span id="s916">That’s what I told him.</span> <span id="s917">And so he put me in the hospital, first in a hospital in Kochendorf.</span> <span id="s918">I was warm and I was in bed.</span> <span id="s919">I was in that bed till about ten o’clock.</span> <span id="s920">They came in and took temperature again.</span> <span id="s921">And then the guy came in and told me to get up and follow him.</span> <span id="s922">And now I thought, well they’re going to take me right back to Teddy and this is it.</span> <span id="s923">And they took me like halfway to the barracks and that’s all I know about Kochendorf is the hospital to Teddy and then all of a sudden he turned to the left and I saw a structure, which I’ve never seen in a camp before.</span> <span id="s924">There was a building, barracks, if you like, that was all fenced in, inside the camp.</span> <span id="s925">The camp itself as fenced.</span> <span id="s926">That other building was fenced in inside and we went to that building.</span> <span id="s927">The guy went as far as the fence and said something in a different language.</span> <span id="s928">Somebody came out, opened the fence, pushed me in and that’s it and they closed the fence.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">All of a sudden I asked what this is, where am I?</span> <span id="s930">They told me this is a TB hospital.</span> <span id="s931">I was in a TB hospital.</span> <span id="s932">It’s the only one of a kind that I know of and it was all fenced in and nobody could get to it.</span> <span id="s933">I don’t know how many people there were in there.</span> <span id="s934">There was a room full of people.</span> <span id="s935">They were all Hungarian mostly Hungarian.</span> <span id="s936">I couldn’t understand most of the people unless they spoke my language, either German or Yiddish, then I understood.</span> <span id="s937">If they wanted me to understand this otherwise, they spoke Hungarian.</span> <span id="s938">But they treated me very well and I actually recovered in that place.</span> <span id="s939">The only problem is if you’re talking about a place with no way out, that’s a place with no way out.</span> <span id="s940">There’s no reason why the Germans would maintain a TB hospital inside a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s941">And I stayed in that hospital till the middle of March, till the end of March.</span> <span id="s942">Nothing much happened.</span> <span id="s943">Just stayed in that hospital, nobody ever came there, nobody came to the door.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Anthony: Were the doctors inside?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Irving: Same doctor that let me in.</span> <span id="s946">He came… Anthony: And he never left either?</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Irving: Well, no.</span> <span id="s948">He would go in and out.</span> <span id="s949">He came in and he would go over to some people who didn’t feel well or once in a while would ask me how I feel.</span> <span id="s950">They would take temperatures twice a day and keep a record of it.</span> <span id="s951">Oh, I asked him to please take my father into the hospital, regular hospital and he promised he would and I think he did.</span> <span id="s952">Why, I have no idea, but he promised.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Anthony: Was he, was the doctor a German?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Irving: No.</span> <span id="s955">He was a Hungarian Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Anthony: He was Hungarian also?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Irving: His name was Doctor Weiss.</span> <span id="s958">Ahh, he was a very gentle person.</span> <span id="s959">I don’t, we didn’t have any problems with him.</span> <span id="s960">And, as far as I’m concerned, he was very well liked.</span> <span id="s961">No problems.</span> <span id="s962">He would come in and visit and talk and probably be our only link to the outside world.</span> <span id="s963">He would go out and come in and that’s it.</span> <span id="s964">But nobody else would…they would bring in food, take it back and that’s it.</span> <span id="s965">Then one day… Tape 2: [unable to verify, Tape 2 inaudible] Irving: And what happen is the people who were in the hospital went by freight and the people who were not in the hospital walked.</span> <span id="s966">And the whole camp was evacuated to go to Dachau.</span> <span id="s967">Now, from what I understand, now, this is from a quarterback position, which we didn’t know at the time.</span> <span id="s968">Teddy said that he once, he was going to try to run away or escape.</span> <span id="s969">He was walking with the people.</span> <span id="s970">And apparently, if there was any food, it isn’t a long ride from where we were.</span> <span id="s971">Kochendorf is somewhere and near ______[013] something like that and Dachau.</span> <span id="s972">Today maybe it’s a ride of two hours, two and a half, three hours.</span> <span id="s973">But there might have been some food they gave us, it was the war time.</span> <span id="s974">And _____[016] from what I understand, Teddy might have taken that food from us, from the sick people.</span> <span id="s975">In any case, they locked the ______[017] sometimes in the afternoons.</span> <span id="s976">This was Tuesday afternoon.</span> <span id="s977">The train started moving.</span> <span id="s978">It moved all day Tuesday, all night Tuesday night.</span> <span id="s979">Wednesday morning they opened the doors and they asked if there are any people dead.</span> <span id="s980">There was four or five people dead.</span> <span id="s981">So we handed them out and they took them out.</span> <span id="s982">And they buried them.</span> <span id="s983">I know the name of the town was Aalen.</span> <span id="s984">I remember that.</span> <span id="s985">And we traveled all day Wednesday, all night Wednesday.</span> <span id="s986">On Thursday morning, the same procedure.</span> <span id="s987">However, no food, no water.</span> <span id="s988">They just came and took the dead out.</span> <span id="s989">Thursday, sometimes during the day, we got into an air raid.</span> <span id="s990">I don’t know what planes, could have been English, could have been American.</span> <span id="s991">_______[028] I mean we were all locked in.</span> <span id="s992">we could hear bombs, we could hear sirens.</span> <span id="s993">We could smell fire around us.</span> <span id="s994">We weren’t hit.</span> <span id="s995">The guards were running all over.</span> <span id="s996">And then they came back.</span> <span id="s997">We were praying that we would be hit so we could get out…and we weren’t.</span> <span id="s998">Again, nothing happened.</span> <span id="s999">Thursday night, we traveled again all night.</span> <span id="s1000">Friday morning they opened the freight train and took more dead out.</span> <span id="s1001">By that time we couldn’t give them the dead anymore.</span> <span id="s1002">We didn’t have the strength to give the dead.</span> <span id="s1003">By that time there were very few people in the car who were still alive.</span> <span id="s1004">On Saturday morning, they came aboard to take the dead out.</span> <span id="s1005">We finally arrive from Dachau Saturday night.</span> <span id="s1006">No food, no water.</span> <span id="s1007">Then when we arrived, then two prisoners of Dachau came out, aboard the freight train.</span> <span id="s1008">They took us down and lined us, five people in a row and put our hands into the pockets and one guy would put his arm around one end of the five people, the other around the other five, and pick us up and took us in like this.</span> <span id="s1009">That’s how strong we weren’t, just couldn’t stand on our feet.</span> <span id="s1010">How many people survived, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1011">Very few, maybe ten percent.</span> <span id="s1012">When we finally got into Dachau, it was late at night and we begged them to give us something to drink.</span> <span id="s1013">Give us some coffee, give us something to eat.</span> <span id="s1014">They said the kitchen is closed, can’t give us anything to eat.</span> <span id="s1015">Finally, after we begged them, they brought us some water.</span> <span id="s1016">It was late Saturday night, just got a drink of water, no food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Anthony: And that was the first time you had water since you got on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Irving: Yeah, just Tuesday night.</span> <span id="s1019">I was crawling on the floor.</span> <span id="s1020">I was crawling around, crawling on all four, couldn’t walk.</span> <span id="s1021">All of a sudden I saw a familiar face.</span> <span id="s1022">It was my father.</span> <span id="s1023">He survived too.</span> <span id="s1024">He was in that transport.</span> <span id="s1025">And on Sunday morning in Dachau there were showers, there were showers in Dachau.</span> <span id="s1026">And then they made us take a shower, so the first few people who went together to shower, I don’t know why, but they turned the hot water on.</span> <span id="s1027">And as soon as the people got in the shower, they died, they just fell down and died.</span> <span id="s1028">I don’t know whether the hot water did it or what.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Anthony: It shocked them or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Irving: Just died.</span> <span id="s1031">And we refused to go on then and they changed it.</span> <span id="s1032">They changed the hot water to a less hot, cool.</span> <span id="s1033">Then we got past this, and it turned out that this was April the first, Easter Sunday.</span> <span id="s1034">And on Easter Sunday we always figured maybe we’ll get—if we don’t get the coffee on Sunday morning, at least we’re going to get the soup at noon because every concentration camp—but it turned out this was Easter Sunday, April the first, 1944 and one day in the year and only in Dachau on Easter Sunday they did not give that soup.</span> <span id="s1035">All they did is give a piece of bread and a slice of salami.</span> <span id="s1036">That’s the only time we ever got a slice of salami in camp but they didn’t give it till 4pm on that day.</span> <span id="s1037">So the first time we got a piece of bread, at 4pm on that Sunday.</span> <span id="s1038">After we got into the block in Dachau.</span> <span id="s1039">That’s how we got to Dachau.</span> <span id="s1040">We stayed in Dachau from April the first till late in April.</span> <span id="s1041">Dachau was to me compared to Unterriexingen and Vaihingen and Kochendorf, although I didn’t see Kochendorf.</span> <span id="s1042">But from what I understand very few people survived Kochendorf.</span> <span id="s1043">Very few people who went with to Kochendorf survived.</span> <span id="s1044">Dachau, compared with these camps, was a luxury because it had showers, it had water.</span> <span id="s1045">There was a Red Cross and they brought packages.</span> <span id="s1046">My father used to wear glasses.</span> <span id="s1047">He broke his glasses and one day he went down to the toilet and he hit himself on the bed on his leg and it wouldn’t heal.</span> <span id="s1048">It started to get worse and worse, almost greenish like.</span> <span id="s1049">They wouldn’t put him in the hospital but then by the end of April they announced that there’ll be a Red Cross inspection.</span> <span id="s1050">So when the Red Cross guy came him we pushed him out in front so the Red Cross guy could see him and when he saw what happened to his foot he told the guy who was in charge of the block to put him in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1051">So my father was designated the next day to go in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1052">At the same time the next day they decided to evacuate all the Jews from Dachau.</span> <span id="s1053">So when my father went to the hospital in Dachau, I got evacuated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Anthony: So you got separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Irving: We got separated.</span> <span id="s1056">He went to the hospital and I went on a train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Anthony: This was the end of April in 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Irving: End of April in 1945.</span> <span id="s1059">Don’t know exactly what day in April but towards the end of April in 1945.</span> <span id="s1060">This time it was a passenger train, not a freight train.</span> <span id="s1061">We got a passenger train in Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Anthony: You got seats and everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Irving: Seats.</span> <span id="s1064">We got a package before we got on the train, a food package from Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1065">I happened to get a Belgian package.</span> <span id="s1066">Other people got other packages.</span> <span id="s1067">That was a food package.</span> <span id="s1068">I don’t know why they put us on the train and where they were taking us.</span> <span id="s1069">I still don’t know.</span> <span id="s1070">It’s still a mystery.</span> <span id="s1071">But we took off from Dachau and went all the way to the Austrian border to a small town in Tirol called Zeaphant [ph92].</span> <span id="s1072">We stopped right before that town.</span> <span id="s1073">We started walking up the mountain.</span> <span id="s1074">When we walked up the mountain a man who looked to me like he was the mayor of Zeaphant [ph100], I don’t know maybe not, but an official in either case, stopped us and said that Austria is no longer at war and as far as he’s concerned we are no longer prisoners; the war is over and we should be free, except since Austria didn’t do anything to us he cannot feed us.</span> <span id="s1075">We got to go back to Germany but the SS were still there with the rifles and the machine guns.</span> <span id="s1076">Apparently he had a long conference with the SS men.</span> <span id="s1077">So they kept us overnight still under SS guard despite the fact of what he said in a barn in the mountains in Tyrol.</span> <span id="s1078">The next morning they took us back over to Germany.</span> <span id="s1079">There they put us into a ravine between two mountaintops, set up machine guns on both ends and there we were.</span> <span id="s1080">I don’t know what they intended to do.</span> <span id="s1081">There were machine guns.</span> <span id="s1082">There was a whole story about it that there were some women who came over and told them that if they shoot us they going to be punished or something or other.</span> <span id="s1083">I didn’t see that.</span> <span id="s1084">I was mostly with some of my Hungarian friends from Kochendorf and so on.</span> <span id="s1085">It was late in the evening, towards the evening, I don’t know whether it was late or dark when one of them woke me up and said look, what we saw is that the SS is changing into civilian uniforms.</span> <span id="s1086">The SS was changing into civilian uniforms and disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Anthony: Just leaving.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Irving: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1089">The next thing I know is Peel’s [ph123] following them and going on the road and I followed him.</span> <span id="s1090">There were others crowding.</span> <span id="s1091">There were lots of people walking.</span> <span id="s1092">This is the Eleburna [ph125] Pass, by the way.</span> <span id="s1093">There were lots of people walking into Germany.</span> <span id="s1094">I just joined them, prison uniform and all.</span> <span id="s1095">Barefoot, no shoes, prison uniform.</span> <span id="s1096">I don’t know if the moon is on or not.</span> <span id="s1097">I can’t tell you but the guy next to me, he’s either Italian or Hungarian, not German, but he spoke to me.</span> <span id="s1098">I just shook my head.</span> <span id="s1099">We walked all the way into the town and as soon as we got into the town the first street I saw I just disappeared, ran into the first street.</span> <span id="s1100">And there I started looking for an empty house.</span> <span id="s1101">Saw a house which looked empty and I started getting in.</span> <span id="s1102">I went to the basement but it wasn’t empty.</span> <span id="s1103">A guy came out with a rifle and started making noises and all these foreigners what are you doing in here.</span> <span id="s1104">Who is this?</span> <span id="s1105">I said very quietly and then he went back.</span> <span id="s1106">I went to the next house and finally found an empty house—got in there.</span> <span id="s1107">And there were three other Hungarians in there.</span> <span id="s1108">The four of us spent the night in that house.</span> <span id="s1109">The next morning there was somebody on the street told us in Hungarian that there is a trainload full of sugar at the station, that people are going down there for sugar.</span> <span id="s1110">So I went down there too.</span> <span id="s1111">And there were a lot of Germans picking up sugar from that train.</span> <span id="s1112">I didn’t need the sugar but I was looking around.</span> <span id="s1113">And there was a German lady and she said to me she wants help with the sugar.</span> <span id="s1114">At that time I was getting very sick, absolutely sick.</span> <span id="s1115">I couldn’t eat anymore.</span> <span id="s1116">The thing that I needed most was sleep.</span> <span id="s1117">All I wanted to do was sleep.</span> <span id="s1118">So I told her that I will help her with the sugar if she lets me sleep in her house.</span> <span id="s1119">And she agreed so I helped her with the sugar and we took it to her house and she let me sleep under the steps in that house until about—in the afternoon, maybe two o’clock in the afternoon, something like that.</span> <span id="s1120">And then she came running in and she said the SS is running around and she’s afraid and I’d better get out.</span> <span id="s1121">So I left.</span> <span id="s1122">I had no place to go so I sat down on a bench, a town bench and I was sitting there.</span> <span id="s1123">I couldn’t go any further.</span> <span id="s1124">I was sick.</span> <span id="s1125">I was very sick.</span> <span id="s1126">Sitting there, a man came over in a uniform.</span> <span id="s1127">Turned out the town mailman, the town mailman, and he came over and he said you can’t sit here.</span> <span id="s1128">If you sit here they’re going to shoot you and the Americans are coming in tomorrow and because of that they’re going to punish the whole town.</span> <span id="s1129">He said, “You come with me and I’ll hide you.”</span> <span id="s1130">So I went with him.</span> <span id="s1131">He put me in the garage and I sat in the mail truck all night.</span> <span id="s1132">The Americans came in that night, sometime during the night.</span> <span id="s1133">In the morning he came in and said, “Now you can come up to my apartment.”</span> <span id="s1134">I went up to his apartment, asked me what I want to do and I said all I want to do and I said all I want to do is lay down and sleep.</span> <span id="s1135">So he let me sleep in a bed in his hallway.</span> <span id="s1136">The first thing I hit the bed I fell asleep as far as I know.</span> <span id="s1137">The next thing I know is somebody is standing on top of me and shaking me and shaking me, and a woman screaming, “You can’t die here, you can’t die here!”</span> <span id="s1138">They were both standing in front of me and saying that, “You have to go to a hospital, you can’t die in here.”</span> <span id="s1139">That time they felt that I was dying.</span> <span id="s1140">So they gave me a pair of pants and I put them on and I started crossing…They showed me where the hospital is across the street.</span> <span id="s1141">I started crossing the street, went to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1142">The hospital was in a school, in a former school.</span> <span id="s1143">It had three steps.</span> <span id="s1144">I had a hell of a time getting up those three steps.</span> <span id="s1145">But I finally made it.</span> <span id="s1146">I got up the steps.</span> <span id="s1147">I got up to the hospital, went in.</span> <span id="s1148">There was a doctor who was an officer, a German officer.</span> <span id="s1149">First thing he did is stuck me with a thermometer.</span> <span id="s1150">I didn’t have any temperature.</span> <span id="s1151">Already told me that he cannot accept civilian.</span> <span id="s1152">I told him I’m not sick, I’m starving.</span> <span id="s1153">I’m dying of starvation.</span> <span id="s1154">I need help.</span> <span id="s1155">So I have to go to a civilian hospital.</span> <span id="s1156">So walking outside I fell down the steps.</span> <span id="s1157">And I lay in the street; I just lay there, I couldn’t get up.</span> <span id="s1158">And a jeep came by.</span> <span id="s1159">A jeep stopped.</span> <span id="s1160">A guy came out, picked me up, put me in the back of the jeep, took me to American headquarters.</span> <span id="s1161">Two guys came out; one spoke Yiddish, one spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s1162">They took me back to the hospital, went back to the doctor.</span> <span id="s1163">One of the guys took out a gun.</span> <span id="s1164">He had a gun; he must have been an officer.</span> <span id="s1165">Took out the gun, went over to the German doctor and said to him in kind of a semi-broken German, he said to him, “You know, he dies, you die.”</span> <span id="s1166">And after that he put me in a bed, gave me IV.</span> <span id="s1167">I was in that hospital until the middle of June.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Anthony: And this was in early May?</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Irving: Yeah, in the middle of Germany in a military hospital.</span> <span id="s1170">It was a German military hospital in Mittenwald [187].</span> <span id="s1171">It was a place called Mittenwald in Germany.</span> <span id="s1172">And that’s where I was when the war ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Anthony: What did you do after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Irving: I spent several years in a displaced person camp in Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s1175">I went back to Munich and got a high school diploma.</span> <span id="s1176">I took an exam and got a high school diploma.</span> <span id="s1177">I went for a short time to a Polish university, Polytechnic, then I switched over to the German Polytechnic and then I left for the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Anthony: Do you remember what year that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Irving: 1948; January 1948 I came to the United States and by now I work as an engineer and design naval combat systems.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Anthony: That’s great.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Irving: And I do have several degrees now.</span> <span id="s1182">I did continue my education.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Anthony: Did you find Poland and Germany different after the war or was it the same attitude towards Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Irving: I never went back.</span> <span id="s1185">Germany yeah, Poland I never went back.</span> <span id="s1186">I was in Germany after the war.</span> <span id="s1187">I spent three years in Germany; 1945 to 1948.</span> <span id="s1188">Did I find it different?</span> <span id="s1189">Yeah, I guess.</span> <span id="s1190">I guess it is different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Anthony: Is there anything else you’d like to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Irving: Well, now you’ve got the story of my life until today.</span> <span id="s1193">Right now I’m happy I’m in the United States.</span> <span id="s1194">In fact, I spent two years in the U.S. Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Anthony: When were you in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Irving: From 1950 to 1952.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Anthony: Well, I think we’re all done.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Irving: Okay, fine.</span></p></body></html>
