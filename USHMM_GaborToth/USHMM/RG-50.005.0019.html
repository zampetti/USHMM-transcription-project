produce testimonials of Jewish Holocaust survivors.</span> <span id="s15">My name is Flora Bel Kinsler and I'm a social worker for Jewish Family Service and I've been one of the interviewers.</span> <span id="s16">I'm going to let the people here this evening introduce</span></p> <p><span id="s17">themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">My name is Beba(?)</span> <span id="s19">Leventhol.</span> <span id="s20">I was born in VilNa, Lithuania and it used to be Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">My name is Barbara Gerson Borren Branka Nomberg, married name Kosherovig(?)</span> <span id="s22">, from Lodz, Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">My name is Barry Brack and I was Born in Lodz, Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">I am Marion Sherman, known before the world as Marion Chervinski(?)</span> <span id="s25">from Warsaw, Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">I am Sophie Weinstein Neshikova(?)</span> <span id="s27">born in Warsaw, Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">My name is Fred Diamond.</span> <span id="s29">I was born in Gelzinkiz(?)</span> <span id="s30">, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">1- 16 I am Ian Russ.</span> <span id="s32">I'm a family therapist and the staff psychologist at the University of Judaism.</span> <span id="s33">We are here this evening to talk about your experience of going through interviews about your experience during the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s34">It's like a time to reflect on what it's like to bring up old memories.</span> <span id="s35">What I want you to do is to put yourselves back to the last ten minutes of your interview and to remember what you were talking about, how you were feeling, what that experience was like, how the interview comes to an end, and then start to remember all the things you wanted say, all the things you forgot to say, your frustrations, maybe the good feelings and that's really where I wanted to begin tonight.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Can you share with us what your experience was like right after you finished telling your history during the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Marion: When I was given the time limit of my interview realized I didn't really say everything I wanted to say.</span> <span id="s38">I guess 1 and 1/2 hours for five years of tragic experience was not quite enough and so many things were going through my mind that it was hard t concentrate and remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Interviewer #1: What did that feel like, having 1 and 1/2</span></p> <p><span id="s40">hours?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">3-13 Marion: At the end I felt quite at ease but I was nervous and reliving.</span> <span id="s42">I was much calmer than at the beginning.</span> <span id="s43">I recall that when I started my interview after maybe the first few words, I broke down right away.</span> <span id="s44">I did not expect for that to happen that fast.</span> <span id="s45">I was much calmer at the end.</span> <span id="s46">I guess I kind of simmered down a bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Interviewer #1: Are you regretting that you broke down?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">3-47 Marion:I don't regret it.</span> <span id="s49">I just feel very happy that I did it and I think it's something all of the survivors should do.</span> <span id="s50">I think it would be impossible to put us all on tape.</span> <span id="s51">I think it is something of great importance.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Interviewer #2: What were other people's experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">4-05 Barry: My experience was that it was the frustrations of so many years that I didn't express other than to my children.</span> <span id="s54">I believe I told the segments of my past and it was one of the most important things at this time of my life to leave these segments for posterity.</span> <span id="s55">I think it's more important than anything I've done through all the years I've been in the U.S. To follow up Marion, when I came to the end of of the interview I thought I didn't; have enough and my interviewer said, "what else do you have say?"</span> <span id="s56">and I said that if I had to say more I'd probably have to talk for another five years.</span> <span id="s57">That gave me afterward quite a relief but at the same time I went in to the car and I had to be by myself, driving around for hours, not talking to anybody.</span> <span id="s58">I was so warn out, even my wife was in the car waiting and I told her to go home.</span> <span id="s59">She said, "where are going to go" and I said that I'll just drive around, and that I'll be back later.</span> <span id="s60">The whole thing, picture, just came back which was hidden for so many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">5-52 Interviewer #2: Where there any feelings going on with that or was it just pictures?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">5-55 Marion: Of course feelings of episodes were brought back by the interview of my parents, relatives, and tragic things that I saw and didn't remember to mention.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Interviewer #1: Did it feel like a reliving Barry?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Barry: It was a reliving.</span> <span id="s65">I saw everything very vivid and I didn't even remember them before.</span> <span id="s66">It was very,</span></p> <p><span id="s67">very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">6 - 3 3 Interviewer #1: What about others?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">6 - 3 7 Beba: I had a somewhat different feeling.</span> <span id="s70">I started out quite relaxed because I was interviewed many times so I'm used to it.</span> <span id="s71">I started to feel myself getting angry because we touched on subjects that I hadn't touched on previously, for instance, about the German people.</span> <span id="s72">I don't always think about that they haven't been punished for what they did to us or that they never expressed their regrets and somehow towards the end of the interview these thing came out and I found myself thinking more and more about it.</span> <span id="s73">I do live with the Holocaust quite a bit and I relive certain portions of it, and I live with these portions, but these portions about the German people got me especially angry.</span> <span id="s74">Also, when I started to think back about my family I and started to think that Hitler didn't make it easy for us to survive.</span> <span id="s75">I started think about it in my own mind and I remained alone from my family and everyone was killed and I always have sense of responsibility.</span> <span id="s76">I used to think perhaps I could have done something and when you live with that, it gets a little heavy, so towards the end of the interview I was more upset than at the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Interviewer #1: Okay, Sophie?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">8-20 Sophie: For me it was quite an experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Originally I didn't want to testify because I never talked about my past with anybody, not even my family.</span> <span id="s80">I understood the importance of the testimony and finally decided to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">But, I was in such an uproar, such an anguish, that for weeks I just couldn't sleep.</span> <span id="s82">It was like starting to unbury all these past experiences of those years.</span> <span id="s83">Finally I came to the interview and I was tremendously nervous.</span> <span id="s84">Looking at it respectively, now looking at the testimony, it was a tremendous release to let it all pour out finally after forty years of silence it was out in the open.</span> <span id="s85">I was really very satisfied with myself that I did it and that somebody helped me to do it because I would have never done it by myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">10-03 Well I had some experience.</span> <span id="s87">Before, I was going to school and I had spoke about the Holocaust so I thought it was going to be much easier now that I had the experience.</span> <span id="s88">It was one of the first days that the taping took place.</span> <span id="s89">I wasn't really very nervous and I didn't expect that after three minutes of taping, as I recall, I broke downn.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Of course, I must say that this was very important for me because I know when my husband was alive we made a partial tape with my daughter and there were some things that I could not talk about and here, in front of strangers, I told my story.</span> <span id="s91">I was very happy later that I could reveal something that at that time I believed was very intimate.</span> <span id="s92">I was not mature enough when I was married.</span> <span id="s93">The tape made me feel that I grew up.</span> <span id="s94">I could now face the future.</span> <span id="s95">I will review the tape with my children I won't be ashamed, I won't be embarrasses.</span> <span id="s96">It's going to be a fact that happened, facts of life.</span> <span id="s97">And I, like Barry, I must say, I did not want to be picked up to come to UCLA.</span> <span id="s98">I wanted to be by myself.</span> <span id="s99">I went back and I was in the car.</span> <span id="s100">I did it for two people in my life, for two men in my life.</span> <span id="s101">It was for my father, and for my husband, my companion, who I did it for.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Interviewer #: And you did it because he wanted to do it, he just didn't live long enough?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Interviewer #2: Fred, what was it like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">12-21 Fred: With me, it was like Beba, I had been Interviewed before.</span> <span id="s105">I also appeared seven times as a witness in the Buchner(?)</span> <span id="s106">Trials in Germany.</span> <span id="s107">I wouldn't say I was nervous, but I felt there's an opportunity to bring out something that unfortunately has not been brought out for years and years.</span> <span id="s108">Namely, the myth that Jews just went to the cellar like sheep is commonly accepted and here there are so many acts of heroism, of resistance, on every level.</span> <span id="s109">Casual resistance, psychological resistance, passive resistance, what have you,.</span> <span id="s110">I don't really like to talk about it and while we were talking I would say I was definitly the first one.</span> <span id="s111">The longer the interviews went on the more we learned from past mistakes and while I was talking I literally got scared I might run out of time.</span> <span id="s112">Did I tell the important things, did I communicate the important things, did I convey the essence of what I wanted to?</span> <span id="s113">And while I was talking about what we did, the resistance and so on.</span> <span id="s114">.</span> <span id="s115">Interestingly enough I have a brother.</span> <span id="s116">We were together five years and he was hanged in Auchwitz and suddenly I got the terrible guilt feeling while I was talking about it.</span> <span id="s117">Did I do enough to Fevent it?</span> <span id="s118">Why didn't I actually go with him.</span> <span id="s119">Suddenly like out of nowhere came this guilt feeling and I didn't even, after the time was up I wasn't really sure if I did a good job in conveying what I wanted to convey.</span> <span id="s120">And this guilt feeling, at night I was thinking about it literally for weeks.</span> <span id="s121">I had this guilt feeling after the war; this was persecuting me for years literally and I got away form it and suddenly it came back.</span> <span id="s122">Thank god I, I had to convince myself, under the circumstances that I did the best I could, and I overcame it, but it came back interestingly enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Interviewer #1: It's something you have to</span></p> <p><span id="s124">live with, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Fred: Exactly 14 - 41 Interviewer #2: It sounds like you started telling the stories and events, but as it reached closer toward the end there were emotions you needed to confront.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Fred: Yes, Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Interviewer #2: One of the things that Flora and I and the other interviewers talked about was the how far we could press you from your memories.</span> <span id="s128">We were concerned; we wanted an accurate, emotional portrayal, but we didn't want anyone leaving as a basket-case either.</span> <span id="s129">What was your experience on that balance?</span> <span id="s130">Do you wish we had pressed harder</span></p> <p><span id="s131">for memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">15-20 Barry: I felt I always liked to talk and discuss in a chronological way because if I co(?)</span> <span id="s133">in a chronological way I remember dates and happenings.</span> <span id="s134">I found I started to tell the story in a way from months or years and then I started to deviate probably because there was not enough time.</span> <span id="s135">Of course, I had to sit there for god knows how many days .</span> <span id="s136">While you start to tell the story you remind yourself of things, but again, you come in with another question because of time.</span> <span id="s137">If you only had an hour and three quaters, it was probably more than somebody else, and I then I stared to open up.</span> <span id="s138">For me it wasn't enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Interviewer#l: So it wasn't just the event, but the feelings that went along with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Barry: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">16-22 Beba: With me it's not enough time because I really wanted to talk about my experience as a witness in Germany.</span> <span id="s142">only recently.</span> <span id="s143">It was 1977 I testified against the Gestapo and unfortunately they didn't give me the chance, but I believe in the future I will interview it on a tape.</span> <span id="s144">But, that was not enough and this was the first day of the tapings.</span> <span id="s145">Like you say about dates; all these years I said I must remember one thing; that was the day when I said goodbye to my father and I never forgot it.</span> <span id="s146">It's just inside my brain.</span> <span id="s147">I will always remember that day when I said goodbye to my family and never to see them again.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">17 - 2 6 Interviewer #2: Did others have similar</span></p> <p><span id="s149">memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">17-29 Barbara: I felt I was not pressed and I was given quite a free reign and I told my story.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">However, I believe that everybody has some natural defenses and deep down there are things that nobody ever reveals and with me too, because there were things going on in the camps that would be very difficult for a normal person to understand and these certain details I never talk about and I never reveal.</span> <span id="s152">One doesn't have to say everything.</span> <span id="s153">You say the most pertinent.</span> <span id="s154">But, I do believe that there is a certain threshold, there is a certain line, beyond which you can't go.</span> <span id="s155">This is the case for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Interviewer #2: Is the threshold for me or for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Barbara: For me.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">18-21 Marion: I'd like to go back to the remarks made by Freddy.</span> <span id="s159">And I think that all of us have some kind of feeling of guilt because most of the cases we are maybe the only survivors of the family and some Jewish families were large, most of the time so.</span> <span id="s160">Why I and Why not others?</span> <span id="s161">Did I do enough to maybe help them survive with me?</span> <span id="s162">But I think that you have to justify and come to a conclusion, I guess I did all I could and unfortunately they did not make it as much as we wish they could.</span> <span id="s163">Also, in thinking about the interview itself I didn't feel any pressure and I was made to feel quite at ease.</span> <span id="s164">I was never tense wen i broke down and I was reminded to calm down and to take my time and to come back to the situation when I can talk again.</span> <span id="s165">I agree with Barbara that there are certain things I didn't talk about maybe very tragic things that I meant originally to put in for posterity but when it came time for it I spoke mostly in general terms.</span> <span id="s166">I talked about general situations rather than specific incidents in detail.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Interviewer #1: Go ahead Sophie.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">20-08 Sophie: I want to touch down on that feeling of guilt.</span> <span id="s169">I have never discussed it with anybody.</span> <span id="s170">That's the first time I am listening to it and I feel it's very true.</span> <span id="s171">We all have that feeling of guilt the guilt stems from the fact that we watched our family being destroyed and we could do absolutely nothing about it and that quilt, it's like a team.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">It's something in all of us I think because we never discussed it between ourselves before.</span> <span id="s173">I sense that it must be something that everybody feels about it.</span> <span id="s174">As for the interview I was put very much at ease.</span> <span id="s175">And even though I was tremendously nervous I felt that you helped me very much to get through it.</span> <span id="s176">There is absolutely no way that you can tell in one and a half hours what happened during that time.</span> <span id="s177">It is practically impossible because every step of the way there is another chapter by itself so there is no way you could tell it all during that short interview.</span> <span id="s178">Just for me, personally, that I was able to talk about it was just a revelation.</span> <span id="s179">It was a marvelous thing for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">22-10 Interviewer #1: So in a way like Beba says about Hitler having the rest of your live in an uneasy kind of condition seems to be what you're attesting to .</span> <span id="s181">That to live and pick up is something else again.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">22-29 Barbara: I think unfortunately we passed it down to our children and many children feel the same guilt.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">There is a guilt, a definite guilt.</span> <span id="s184">They feel guilty that about what we went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">22-44 Interviewer #1: So your saying guilt is separate from maybe Freddy having some regret about not expressing some emotions.</span> <span id="s186">So I think we're identifying a few different themes here.</span> <span id="s187">You're talking about guilt and I'm remembering something that you said about feeling that you had to portray a situation and perhaps not linking it with the feelings that you really had.</span> <span id="s188">That's another theme.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">23-15 Beba: Well I think the underlying thing about the guilt is I think everybody has survived the feeling that he survived and that the other's sent here.</span> <span id="s190">That means in a way that that person took somebody else's place and I usually look at this thing from a mathematical view even though it might be quite silly.</span> <span id="s191">I think I explained to you that I though Hitler was out to kill a certain amount of people and he would have done it no matter what.</span> <span id="s192">So if we weren't there he'd take them, and if we weren't there he'd take somebody else.</span> <span id="s193">I remember quite vividly how they started gathering people or taking them to be slaughtered at eight in the morning and at five o'clock there was a whistle and they stopped like a regular work day.</span> <span id="s194">So when that happened when they killed a thousand people or two thousand people and I happened to be two thousand and one then ,you, see, I'm out.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">So I used to play around with this terrible mathematical game.</span> <span id="s196">I used to think, you know, if I had been killed maybe my sister would've survived.</span> <span id="s197">It's not a rational approach but I really couldn't help it.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">24-30 Interviewer #2: I guess that's the defense you were talking about before that helps keep you safe in the</span></p> <p><span id="s199">memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">24-39 Marion: I can not completely agree with that, I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s201">I think I was asked many times how I survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">It's a pretty valid question really from a person who wasn't there.</span> <span id="s203">You are talking about atrocities and mass killings and ten thousand people daily in Treblinka from the Warsaw Ghetto.</span> <span id="s204">How did you survive?</span> <span id="s205">And I tell the people very straight that I was at the right place at the right time.</span> <span id="s206">I wasn't cocky, I wasn't smart.</span> <span id="s207">If I believe in god or an extra force they were watching over me but nevertheless I have to say that it's the kind of question.</span> <span id="s208">.</span> <span id="s209">I was a young man.</span> <span id="s210">I was nineteen years old.</span> <span id="s211">But there were people who were parents and lost their children and they survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">And there is afeeling of guilt they cannot explain in</span></p> <p><span id="s213">mathematical situations.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Beba: I understand, everyone explains it differently.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Marion: So I think there is a natural feeling of guilt.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">25-56 Interviewer #1: But interestingly enough everybody has to have something that they run back on a tape in their own mind that brings them back.</span> <span id="s217">You in one way, Beba in another.</span> <span id="s218">You could respond to the question,"How did you survive?"</span> <span id="s219">by saying, "which day?"</span> <span id="s220">.</span> <span id="s221">1200 days, which do you want me to talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Marion: First I want to go back to the remark Barbara made.</span> <span id="s223">I don't think our children have a feeling of guilt.</span> <span id="s224">I think our children feel uncomfortable to know and hear about how mistreated their parents were.</span> <span id="s225">I don't think it's a feeling of guilt.</span> <span id="s226">I think it's a feeling of fear that something could happen to my parents.</span> <span id="s227">And as a child no matter how old they fear that something will happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">I know my daughter, or should I say our daughter, doesn't talk too much about it, but she knows quite a bit.</span> <span id="s229">Holocaust was portrayed on T.V. and she wouldn't watch it with us, but she would watch at her own apartment.</span> <span id="s230">But, during every break she called to ask questions and explanations, but she wouldn't sit in the same room with us and watch.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">27-18 Interviewer #l: Why do you think that is?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Marion: I think that she just can not face us and ask us questions and face us and say, "my parents went through that, and my parents could have been shot they were hungry, or beaten, or they were worked not like human</span></p> <p><span id="s233">beings."</span> <span id="s234">Interviewer #1: It's too close, you're saying, it's too intense and so close.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Interviewer #2: Hold on one second, Freddy?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">27-54: Fred: I have to say that everyone of us really has the intention of trying to make them aware, and we maybe made a remark, years ago when we were not to comfortable, when we had to to build our lives.</span> <span id="s237">I certainly did not survive ....</span> <span id="s238">When our children look to us and are spoiled, just one word ... If you believe that this created a guilt feeling it did and it stays.</span> <span id="s239">And we did not do it intentionally; we had no idea what the consequences would b.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">And I have a personal problem with my daughter who is very aggravated, but we talk about fear.</span> <span id="s241">You know, the biggest fear in the camp was that all of us would get killed and when the war was over there would be no one to tell the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">We almost resigned to the fact that if the war goes on another year probably no one will make it.</span> <span id="s243">But in fact, if the war, God forbid, had continued another year we all wouldn't be here.</span> <span id="s244">We were all totally exhausted and there's a limit even a strong human being with a strong will to survive can stand.</span> <span id="s245">I was very close to death.</span> <span id="s246">If I had not escaped I would not be here today.</span> <span id="s247">I could figure out, as Beba said, mathematically if I go on another week... and I was there six years.</span> <span id="s248">I consider myself a veteran.</span> <span id="s249">I know everything.</span> <span id="s250">Every trick, everything in the book about the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">29-28 Interviewer# 2: Were there weeks where you said," If I go on on another week I'm not going to make it?N Freddy: No, interestingly enough.</span> <span id="s252">As a matter of fact the information we got was distorted.</span> <span id="s253">When we heard about Stalingrad, we knew, this is the end of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">The question is who is going to survive, did we last long enough?</span> <span id="s255">And it got worse and worse and at the end there was an effort that someone should survive.</span> <span id="s256">We were so concerned about this, that someone should tell the story.</span> <span id="s257">Otherwise, we put our first efforts is surviving just to sustain life would have been in vain.</span> <span id="s258">It wasn't easy to survive, and it wasn't easy to live as a human being, to preserve your dignity, your humanity because the Germans did everything possible t to reduce us to a level sub-animal, not sub-human, worse than an animal.</span> <span id="s259">And there was an effort day by day, hour by hour, to try not to become an animal, an that was very tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">30-40 Interviewer #l: So, personal integrity.....</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Barry: I happen to agree with Marion.</span> <span id="s262">I also think that it was something extraordinary that I survived and someone else in my family didn't.</span> <span id="s263">I mentioned in the interview that I came from an orthodox family.</span> <span id="s264">I have a certain background and I believe this is probably what God wanted.</span> <span id="s265">I remember after he war I came to Montreal, Canada, I believe it was in 1947 and the Jewish Congress allocated me a home and there was a woman there who said," How come you survived?"</span> <span id="s266">So, I stretched out my arm and told her that I didn't know.</span> <span id="s267">"What do you mean you don't Know- What did you</span></p> <p><span id="s268">do?"</span> <span id="s269">Interviewer #1: So it was an accusation.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Barry.</span> <span id="s271">I said I don't know, I was at a loss.</span> <span id="s272">I don't Know what I did wrong or right, whether I was at the wrong time at the right place or the right place at the wrong time.</span> <span id="s273">The main fact is that I'm here.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">32-13 Interviewer #1: Okay, but I hear you saying something else.</span> <span id="s275">I guess as an old time social worker my own guilt was that we might have intensified the guilt by questions like that How did you do it, what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Marion: I don't think so.</span> <span id="s277">I think that was probably just pure human interest.</span> <span id="s278">I probably would have been as interested if someone went through a tragedy like that where six million got annihilated and and how did this few thousand, hundred thousand, survive.</span> <span id="s279">How did you make it?</span> <span id="s280">- it would be interesting to know.</span> <span id="s281">And I have said that looking back, I don't know how a human being could have live through what we lived through.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">33-07 Barbara: Sometimes I think, did it really happen to us or was it someone else or is it just a fable?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Because it was impossible to remember the nights, the fear, the days, Especially like in our camp we were talking, the factory was mined and there was constantly the Russian.</span> <span id="s284">The Dreckhaus(?)</span> <span id="s285">And whenever the Germans were winning they were good.</span> <span id="s286">They didn't take people out to the guards for lashes.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">But, when they were losing, they were impossible and we were thinking, what should we pray for?</span> <span id="s288">Should they bomb the factory, should they lose, or should we have a few more months to live?</span> <span id="s289">so you don't know.</span> <span id="s290">You don't know what to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Of course, most people in the camp would say let them bomb, maybe somebody will survive.</span> <span id="s292">They will bomb, they will run, let the allies win.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">34-30 Interviewer #2: On thing I get confused about listening to you is I hear most of you saying that the compelling factor was to live to tell the world about it.</span> <span id="s294">And yet, the war ended and, Sophie, you didn't tell the story for years and you must know other survivors who never told the story and could not tell the story and there are parts that</span></p> <p><span id="s295">you don't tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">34-57 Sophie: I want to tell you about my experiences.</span> <span id="s297">I was a young girl went I went into the camps.</span> <span id="s298">I was in four camps.</span> <span id="s299">Maideneck(?)</span> <span id="s300">, most of the time in Auchwitz, then Ravensbruck(?)</span> <span id="s301">, and then in Marakov(?)</span> <span id="s302">Somehow I hoped all the time and that was I fought every step of the way.</span> <span id="s303">I didn't survive because I deserved to but because I was full of hope.</span> <span id="s304">It's after the war, when I came back to Warsaw and saw the total destruction of our life, that I was hoping somewhere, somehow, someone from our family survived.</span> <span id="s305">And when I saw the total destruction of our family, my entire family I just collapsed and I just went on for years never to talk about it and just to have it buried very very deeply, and I was so hurt that I was unable to talk about it.</span> <span id="s306">In the beginning, for the first fifteen or twenty years I wasn't able to smile or cry.</span> <span id="s307">I was just a mess, a complete mess.</span> <span id="s308">Now that I look at it, people weren't very interested in what was happening.</span> <span id="s309">I keep thinking that the interest in the survivors came thirty years after the happening.</span> <span id="s310">I just can't</span></p> <p><span id="s311">understand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">37-15 Interviewer #1 : What does that feel like that to you Sophie, that it took thirty years?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Sophie: I keep thinking about it.</span> <span id="s314">We went last Saturday to the banquet of the Jewish Federation Council.</span> <span id="s315">We were the personna non gratta for so many years, nobody was interested in us.</span> <span id="s316">They were glad that we were here and alive, but nobody took an interest in us.</span> <span id="s317">So I was very surprised when for the flrst time I heard Mr. Gorah, the president, speak about that we are an integral part of the community and that we are all of a sudden accepted.</span> <span id="s318">I was</span></p> <p><span id="s319">very surprised Interviewer #1: Freddy, do you have something to say about</span></p> <p><span id="s320">that?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">38-17 Freddy; I want to say I try to analyze myself and other survivors.</span> <span id="s322">I think there was an invisable stigma attached to being a survivor.</span> <span id="s323">And you have to understand that most survivors of what was going on in the camps.</span> <span id="s324">All they say was people being slaughtered and put to death and beaten.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">There were instances of resistance.</span> <span id="s326">We started believing the myth that we really didn't do enough, that we were really were sheep brought to the slaughterhouse.</span> <span id="s327">I've personally been through this.</span> <span id="s328">I immigrated illegally to Israel in 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Anyone who saw the movie, Exodus, I went through the third degree like that.</span> <span id="s330">I was inducted into Hagganah and interrogated just like in the move.</span> <span id="s331">Where were you liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">What do you do?</span> <span id="s333">Where did you work?</span> <span id="s334">Who were your friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Did you collaborate with the S.S.?</span> <span id="s336">It was like being interrogated by the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s337">Somehow, we ourselves, believed we must ask ourselves, did we indeed do enough, did we take every opportunity, did we risk our own lives enough to save others?</span> <span id="s338">That question is still valid today.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">39-50 Interviewer #1: I have to ask myself the same question and maybe that's why I got so involved in this.</span> <span id="s340">As</span></p> <p><span id="s341">an American Jew.....</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Freddy: Did you do enough?</span> <span id="s343">Exactly.</span> <span id="s344">Now suddenly more research was done and stories came out that indeed that under the most impossible circumsances, Jews and other in camps showed dignity and did resist.</span> <span id="s345">Suddenly people became proud to be a survivor, and rightly so.</span> <span id="s346">As I said, to come out of the camp and act like a civilized human being is an act of heroism.</span> <span id="s347">Something all came out and everybody talks about it.</span> <span id="s348">Everybody has a search for these instances of human dignity and heroism and show it.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">41-09 Barry: You made a question about why we didn't speak about it right after the war.</span> <span id="s350">I know myself, when my children were growing up I made it a point to tell them certain things and leave it at that.</span> <span id="s351">But I believe we were too warped, too absorbed, to involved, and we didn't have the time.</span> <span id="s352">There was nowhere to turn, You came to a strange country without a language and without means.</span> <span id="s353">As a youngster I had to eat.</span> <span id="s354">There were many times I didn't have money to eat, I only had enough for room and board.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">If I had to go to work in a street-car I couldn't pay for it and I had to walk.</span> <span id="s356">This was one thing.</span> <span id="s357">But also, I believe that even at that time if we would have talked there wouldn't have been an interest.</span> <span id="s358">.</span> <span id="s359">No one would have believed it.</span> <span id="s360">The woman I mentioned before who asked me the questions- what am I going to tell her, a story, a happening?</span> <span id="s361">She'll think I'm</span></p> <p><span id="s362">dreaming.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">42-42 Interviewer #1: But Sophie made a point that I think we have to consider that process seems to be unfolding here as to when people feel ready.</span> <span id="s364">It's almost like forty years coming out of</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Egypt.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">45-56 Beba: This is what I wanted to refer to, why it took so long.</span> <span id="s367">It's like a process of mourning, but a long mourning.</span> <span id="s368">In my case, it wasn't that I had to make a living or that I didn't have time.</span> <span id="s369">I always had the time and it was something inside of me that wouldn't let me do it.</span> <span id="s370">It's like Flo says, there comes a time when you are ready.</span> <span id="s371">Frankly, I am never ready.</span> <span id="s372">I always wait for the kids to ask me questions; I can't sit them down and say, let me tell you about the camp.</span> <span id="s373">I can't do that.</span> <span id="s374">My children ask, but little.</span> <span id="s375">When I tell them something its like an agony.</span> <span id="s376">I don't mind talking to you, and I don't mind who asks me questions.</span> <span id="s377">Thereare questions people ought to ask you.</span> <span id="s378">And there was also a stigma.</span> <span id="s379">For instance if you were a woman and halfway decent looking they would wonder how you survived- maybe you slept with one of the guards.</span> <span id="s380">At one point I talked to my son about it and he said, "Ma, I don't care.</span> <span id="s381">I'm glad you survived because otherwise I wouldn't have been born."</span> <span id="s382">I though that was tremendous, but I can't for one moment sit down and tell him how it was.</span> <span id="s383">We have lived a long time in the United States, longer than in any other place.</span> <span id="s384">This is my home, but whatever successes and failures you have, those were the four most important years of my life.</span> <span id="s385">Every time I live with that, every day and it's never going to go away.</span> <span id="s386">And I can see the intensity of it coming back.</span> <span id="s387">I suppose the older you get the more intense those feelings become and the more you think about it.</span> <span id="s388">I used to think that thirty years after the war I wouldn't think about it, but you think about it anymore and not less.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">45-51 Barbara: I think for at least thirty years we were a very unpopular group.</span> <span id="s390">They used to call us refugees, and we wanted to fit in to society, to assimilate.</span> <span id="s391">I didn't even hear the word survivor.</span> <span id="s392">We wanted to be lost in the</span></p> <p><span id="s393">crowd.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">46-26 Interviewer #1: First you're among the despised in Europe, then maybe in the resettlement process, and then</span></p> <p><span id="s395">here.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">46-36 I guess I have a different feeling than the rest of you.</span> <span id="s397">We were called refugees, it's true, but I guess for a certain part of the population we were competition.</span> <span id="s398">We were looking for jobs and taking maybe ones that they could perform, but we were</span></p> <p><span id="s399">younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">I wasn't working in the line, but in the needle trade.</span> <span id="s401">At this time it was a predominantly Jewish trade.</span> <span id="s402">I know my wife went in to this trade for a while.</span> <span id="s403">She was younger, more productive, and a better sewer.</span> <span id="s404">There was jealousy of some sort and we were intruding.</span> <span id="s405">Also, I think we have to give a lot of thanks to NBC for puttingHolocaust on television.</span> <span id="s406">It brought it to the general public, not just the Jews.</span> <span id="s407">From the time it was on T.V. I've met a lot of people who ask me questions and I never refused to answer.</span> <span id="s408">Even during Summer time I have a tattoo and I wear a short sleeve shirt because I don't have a number.I have a very different tattoo that only one camp had.</span> <span id="s409">I never felt inhibited not to talk about it.</span> <span id="s410">Even with our friends, no matter how we start out the social evening we end up with our concentration camp experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">48-47 Barry: What amazed me most is particularly our own age group.</span> <span id="s412">The war finished and we were very young.</span> <span id="s413">Even after seeing all the attrocities we did not become cannibalized.</span> <span id="s414">It took a short time to straighten yourself out in a decent manner.</span> <span id="s415">This is the most amazing thing to me.</span> <span id="s416">Why didn't the go out and maime(?)</span> <span id="s417">and take revenge, but just go about their own thing, and try to make their own livlyhood, get married, have children, and so on?</span> <span id="s418">I think about it very often.</span> <span id="s419">I never got the answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">50-O6 Barbara: I'm not a psychologist, but I'll answer it.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Don't you think that before the war we lived by certain morals, those of our parents, and we were brought up a certain way?</span> <span id="s422">Did you hear of nobody killing another among our population, or raping?</span> <span id="s423">We just took it from our home, whether it was rich or poor, there was just such a dignity.</span> <span id="s424">We tried to give it to our children; not everybody is sucessfull, but at least we try.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">50-51 Beba: I think about it a lot too.</span> <span id="s426">That after all this savagery, no one goes out with a gun, goes to Germany, and kills a few.</span> <span id="s427">We all had experiences in the underground, or some of us did, and we see that in the trials in Germany nobody is brought to justice.</span> <span id="s428">I keep thinking of what is going on in South America with terrorists and I see we don't do anything.</span> <span id="s429">I must tell you, I have my regrets, Ireally do.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">51-28 Interviewer #2: Did others of you have fantasies to want to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Beba: I used to .</span></p> <p><span id="s432">51-33 Barry: I had the opportunity and I didn't do it.</span> <span id="s433">I was given a gun right after liberation by an American soldier and he said to go in the forest where there were some S.S. men and to do what ever I wanted to them.</span> <span id="s434">I didn't even touch the gun.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Interviewer #2: Did you want to?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Barry: No, I didn't want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">51-51 Interviewer #1: But, we know that some people did and it didn't stop them for putting themselves together and</span></p> <p><span id="s438">evolving.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">51-59 Sophie: I actually agree with Barry completely.</span> <span id="s440">I think as a group of people, as survivors, we should be very proud of ourselves that we really are what you call a menchen, and living with this for so many years, being confronted with this all the time, and remaining what we are,respected as a group.</span> <span id="s441">I think we should be very proud of ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">52-55 Interviewer #1: I have to say though that some of our people have had very terrible struggles and haven't made it to the level you have.</span> <span id="s443">You can't condemn them either.</span> <span id="s444">They did what they could do and they say what they saw to their own level.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Barbara: But a very small percent.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">53-16 Interviewer #l: Yes, a small percent.</span> <span id="s447">But what I cherish, I have to share with you is the number of survivors helping in the community, not just with other survivors, but with</span></p> <p><span id="s448">the general population.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">53-29 Marion: I think we have a great feeling of social responsibility.</span> <span id="s450">During the Warsaw Ghetto, where you would think everyone was only thinking about themselves, there was the Jewish so called self help who were helping those who had less.</span> <span id="s451">There were kitchens for those who could not afford to buy food on the black market.</span> <span id="s452">I guess there is something embedded in us, maybe through family upbringing, like Barbara said, that's charity, tzadaka.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">54-14 Interviewer #1 : It really struck me that all the way through the taping the degree to which the community maintained its standards and values as long as it could.</span> <span id="s454">Once it wasn't a community anymore it was hardly within your hand to keep that</span></p> <p><span id="s455">going.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">54-28 Freddy: Isn't that what kept the Jewish people alive for two thousand years?</span> <span id="s457">Judaism is not just a religion, but it is a way of life, a civilization.</span> <span id="s458">There is a certain value system and it's stuck in us.</span> <span id="s459">Maybe it was hidden, maybe it was sleeping, but we always sustained thinking and seeing like in the movies, seeing good life like we had at home.</span> <span id="s460">Sometimes we dreamed about it when we were hungry.</span> <span id="s461">We looked back to the nice Jewish family we had and it all came back.</span> <span id="s462">After we survived, if we survived, we will revitalize, and there will be a renaissance.</span> <span id="s463">That's what we believed.</span> <span id="s464">We at least had to try to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">55-16 Interviewer #1 : Could it be that it's happening</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Freddy?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Freddy: The survivors, whoever survived the camp, must have been a tough cookie, a tough guy.</span> <span id="s468">And when the American Jews said, "how come the survivors are so successful?"</span> <span id="s469">I said that don't you see that they are the few that survived, they are the tough people, they are veterans, they went though hell?</span> <span id="s470">If they survived Auchwitz they had something in them that made them stronger than the average and the applied this after the war to new circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Obviously, a good person must have learned during the war that there is an infinite capacity for evil in man, but there is also a capacity for good.</span> <span id="s472">If we survived ,we tried to be good.</span> <span id="s473">In regards to shooting the Germans, there were times when we were in camps that we said if we had a gun I would kill him, but when the day after the war came, we were back</span></p> <p><span id="s474">in civilization.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Interviewer #1: As we move to the end of the first hour of the tape Freddy has put before us the notion of survival of the fittest.</span> <span id="s476">But, I think we have to consider that there are dangers in that.</span> <span id="s477">If your children see you as larger than life, do we come back to Marion's point about difficulty</span></p> <p><span id="s478">being close you?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Barry: I don't know, even if I saw a killer that killed my relatives, I wouldn't have it in me.</span> <span id="s480">I just don't hate.</span> <span id="s481">I can't hate him.</span> <span id="s482">I couldn't even hit him- It's against my</span></p> <p><span id="s483">principles.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Interviewer #1: You have passed these things on to your granddaughter, I notice after seeing her on tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">57-46 Barry: Of course.</span> <span id="s486">You remember the past, you think about it.</span> <span id="s487">You just have to go on in the future.</span> <span id="s488">I just don't hate.</span> <span id="s489">I don't think many survivors do.</span> <span id="s490">It's not in us.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Sophie: I don't agree with that entirely.</span> <span id="s492">I that it's personal.</span> <span id="s493">It's normal to hate, it's part of emotion.</span> <span id="s494">You don't love a person who has destroyed everything.</span> <span id="s495">It's just not possible.</span> <span id="s496">It's normal to want to get back at a person.</span> <span id="s497">I do not agree with you that we do not hate and that we forgive.</span> <span id="s498">We are not that good.</span> <span id="s499">We are Jewish</span></p> <p><span id="s500">people.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Interviewer #2: You already do have different events, though the events are recorded the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Interviewer #1: Apparently Hitler didn't destroy the individuality.</span> <span id="s503">We did not come out like one.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">59-45 Interviewer #1: We started out by thinking about the feelings of being taped, but other things are arising that are so significant.</span> <span id="s505">While you were in the ccamps, you had some dreams, some objectives.</span> <span id="s506">How do feel now and where are you in your life with those things and wishes?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Marion: My dream in the camp was that there would be a full loaf of bread and a knife to cut it and not to have to be given a portion.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Barbara: My dream was that one night I'll go to sleep and I won't be hungry.</span> <span id="s509">Or that I would be able to sleep longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Will I ever have enough sleep?</span> <span id="s511">It was hunger pains.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">1-01-18 Sophie: The only thing we talked about was food,.</span> <span id="s513">That was the single subject.</span> <span id="s514">We talked about it constantly.</span> <span id="s515">The reason is obvious.</span> <span id="s516">We were so starving that there wasn't anything else we could think of.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">1-01-51 Interviewer #2: Are you satisfied with your</span></p> <p><span id="s518">lives now?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Barry: I'm very satisfied.</span> <span id="s520">I think we've achieved quite a lot since coming to this country.</span> <span id="s521">I think a poll should be taken about loyalty to this country; they have had a more loyal citizen because we recognize the freedom and</span></p> <p><span id="s522">tranquility.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Interviewer#l: And maybe the opportunity to have the whole loaf and not just someone slicing off a piece.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Barry: The ability for one to have more or lass.</span> <span id="s525">You never have to go inside of a police station if you want to be good.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">We've had a full and satisfying life, particularly in the</span></p> <p><span id="s527">United States .</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Beba: Talking about dreams, I don't know if you can, I lived one day at a time.</span> <span id="s529">If one day passed and I was still there there than that was an achievement.</span> <span id="s530">And food, that was a constant preoccupation.</span> <span id="s531">I was preoccupied with matters of time because I worked near the Gestapo and I saw what happened.</span> <span id="s532">There was a war on two fronts and they needed supplies.</span> <span id="s533">They always seemed short of this and that, but there lways seemed to be enough trains for the Jews.</span> <span id="s534">I thought that we wouldn't be so lucky.</span> <span id="s535">I was pessimistic and I think that helped me.</span> <span id="s536">I was always concerned there wouldn't</span></p> <p><span id="s537">be enough time.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">People that see me from my camp remind me that I always thought the end was near and we wouldn't make it.</span> <span id="s539">This pessimism colors my life.</span> <span id="s540">The preoccupation and dream was if we would have enough time.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">1-O5-36 Interviewer #1: We have food, time, sleep, what</span></p> <p><span id="s542">else?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Freddy; Obviously we were hungry, we couldn't think of anything else.</span> <span id="s544">It was like a sickness.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">There were moment, I was in Auchwitz, we had a group of youngsters who were part of a Zionist group who wanted to go to Israel and build a Kibbutz.</span> <span id="s546">We decided to have a Hannukah party and this Madriach talked about the Maccabbees of Israel.</span> <span id="s547">He was strong enough to talk about what he would do after the war.</span> <span id="s548">Why not another miracle?</span> <span id="s549">We dreamed this image for four or five months and it gave us strength.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Interviewer #1: but, did you relate to the pessimism of Beba because I wonder if some lives are a hostage to that</span></p> <p><span id="s551">pessimism.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">1-08-48 Sophie: When you speak about how you feel about yourself, about the things you have, we are comfortable.</span> <span id="s553">Like Barry said, is more or less.</span> <span id="s554">I don't think I'll ever be the same.</span> <span id="s555">We go through the motions of living and having a good time, we rear our children, but as for me I won't be what I</span></p> <p><span id="s556">was.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Interviewer #1: What do you think it would</span></p> <p><span id="s558">have been like?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Sophie: First, I lost my hope in the human race.</span> <span id="s560">I don't think I have too much hope.</span> <span id="s561">I know what they are capable of and if circumstances permit it will happen again.</span> <span id="s562">There are forty wars going on around the world right now, so I really don't have too much hope.</span> <span id="s563">I'm pessimistic.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">1-10-57 Barry: I'm basically an optimist.</span> <span id="s565">I was always one.</span> <span id="s566">I will agree with the notion oh hunger and we did dream about food.</span> <span id="s567">When I came home from work in The Lodz Ghetto there was nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s568">I put my head down and dreamed.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Truly, the smell was in my imagination.</span> <span id="s570">Basically I was an optimist.</span> <span id="s571">As bad as it was, I thought maybe tomorrow.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Marion: The loaf of bread was true.</span> <span id="s573">In the first camp we didn't work on Sundays and we sat down and if we thought of chances of survival they were nihil.</span> <span id="s574">But something inside said maybe I will make it.</span> <span id="s575">One of my friends said not to talk about it because it makes you hungrier.</span> <span id="s576">So, to divert our conversation we talked about intersections in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s577">That was part of going back before the war.</span> <span id="s578">That's how we killed time.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">I remember the disappointing moment when we heard about Roosavelt's death.</span> <span id="s580">That was the only outside news that the Germans gave us.</span> <span id="s581">We thought, what's going to happen to us know?</span> <span id="s582">The second big let down was in April at the end of the war and we found out about an agreement made to take prisoners to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s583">Our commander in Bergen Belsen(?)</span> <span id="s584">would not open the doors.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">10-15-53 Freddy: Flo, you asked if we were satisfied with our lives.</span> <span id="s586">Every survivor is a missionary.</span> <span id="s587">I ask myself not only if we described enough, but if we have taught the lessons of the Holocaust to our children and the world at large.</span> <span id="s588">If the lessons are frogotten it will come back.</span> <span id="s589">There are great powers ready to initiate another Holocaust and in this respect I'm a pessimist like Sophie.</span> <span id="s590">That is the biggest disappointment as far as I'm concerned.</span> <span id="s591">I blame survivors that we didn't do enough to remind those in power to remember the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s592">We feel we were running out of time, getting older.</span> <span id="s593">We fell that life must have meaning an what better meaning is there that to teach.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">1-17-37 Interviewer #1: Maybe,Freddy, You're giving a reason for this project.</span> <span id="s595">The question is, should we have done</span></p> <p><span id="s596">it sooner?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Interviewer #2: And what is the effect that this project is going to have on the rest of your lives, for you and your families?</span> <span id="s598">Combine what I said and what Flo said</span></p> <p><span id="s599">all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Barry: I'm quite satisfied with my life.</span> <span id="s601">I think it is a very necessary thing to be done, particularly ten, twenty, thirty years down the line when we are gone.</span> <span id="s602">This is one of the most important things to be done and I'm very proud to have been a participant in this endeavor.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">1-18-36 Interviewer #1: Did it do something for you though?</span> <span id="s604">Did the American gathering do anything for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Barry: When I was at an auction sale two weeks ago one man came over to me we solicited him for funds for the Chair.</span> <span id="s606">He is not Jewish.</span> <span id="s607">He gave a substantial amount of money and we put him in a plaque at the hall.</span> <span id="s608">A friend of mine came up to me and said, " Barry, you know a friend of mine was at UCLA and saw my name on a plate.</span> <span id="s609">How come?"</span> <span id="s610">I said, you know when you give four thousand dollars... He said, " Okay, next time you have something like this you come to me and put my name on another plate.</span> <span id="s611">It's a worthy cause."</span> <span id="s612">this it what makes me happy.</span> <span id="s613">This is going to come out in younger generations.</span> <span id="s614">For what better way is there to educate?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">1-19-44 Interviewer #1: I'm just going to explain that.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">You're talking about the Holocaust Chair in the history</span></p> <p><span id="s617">department at UCLA.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">That has been endowed by the 1939 club and reaches many</span></p> <p><span id="s619">students on campus.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Beba: You asked what results this has.</span> <span id="s621">i don't know right now.</span> <span id="s622">It was good for me.</span> <span id="s623">I don't know if our children will have a chance to see it .</span> <span id="s624">I don't know what Yale is going to do with it.</span> <span id="s625">I hope it gets the greatest exposure possible and will not be left on a shelf frogotten.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">I want to go back to whether I'm satisfied with my life, whether I had better or worse times.</span> <span id="s627">I don't think this is very important.</span> <span id="s628">What is important is the legacy of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s629">One thing that bothers me to no end is that the criminals are not brought to justice and just sit here and it's not our concern.</span> <span id="s630">The Germans are sitting in the highest councils of the world.</span> <span id="s631">People are paying great attention to, they have the greatest industry, they are in positions of power.</span> <span id="s632">It's like nothing ever happened.</span> <span id="s633">This is what bothers me.</span> <span id="s634">Pretty soon we will not be here and they won't be here.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">They will never know about the Holocaust because they simply never bothered to tell their children about it.</span> <span id="s636">The German children don't know about the Holocaust and this I consider a great failure.</span> <span id="s637">Also, our community with our children; there is a second generation, but I think it's a minority.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">1-21-29 Barbara: what about our government.</span> <span id="s639">There are criminals under our government who saught heaven and they got away with the biggest crimes.</span> <span id="s640">Germans, they wanted to annihilate us, I understand.</span> <span id="s641">But, this government, and that's because it was convenient, it was their policy.</span> <span id="s642">So now the skeleton is coming out of the closet and we know.</span> <span id="s643">The criminals are still here.</span> <span id="s644">They are hidden, they are in the intelligence, they are in high positions.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Barry: Because of that it doesn't mean that we shouldn't do what we do for posterity- this education, whether it be at UCLA or another school.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Marion: I think we stepped on a difficult plateau.</span> <span id="s647">These are different things.</span> <span id="s648">I guess we have to remember that in the whole world the Jewish population is about fourteen million and to be honest we are not a very well liked group.</span> <span id="s649">There are very important political decisions being made.</span> <span id="s650">They need Arabs for oil, and they need Germans as a buffer against Russia.</span> <span id="s651">They preoccupy tomorrow with that instead of our problem, that the Holocaust should never happen again.</span> <span id="s652">I agree with Sophie that if the situation is economically and politically right there is a chance of another Holocaust happening.</span> <span id="s653">There were many before.</span> <span id="s654">There were other things that happened to the Jews.</span> <span id="s655">But that doesn't preclude the situation that we should not do what we did because that</span></p> <p><span id="s656">might help.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">1-24-32 Sophie:; I just want to say exclusive of what's going on around us we have to do our share.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">We have no impact on what's going on around us, the politics, but I feel very good about the tape.</span> <span id="s659">As much as I was against it in the beginning, not against per se, but I couldn't do it, I feel good about it.</span> <span id="s660">The only thing that can save us is education.</span> <span id="s661">If we use it to educate people there is hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Interviewer #2: We only have time for one more question which we will have to do briefly.</span> <span id="s663">The question is, how do you hope this project is going to effect your children, either directly through you- maybe you've changed and that's going to effect you children?</span> <span id="s664">But let's focus on that you want to do this for you and your relationship with</span></p> <p><span id="s665">your children.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">1-26-00 Beba: I can't say what it will do for my children.</span> <span id="s667">I can say what I hope it will do for them.</span> <span id="s668">I hope it will bring them closer to us, that there will be a showing for them.</span> <span id="s669">In this way they will become better acquainted with us because I feel there is a great difference.</span> <span id="s670">We cannot reach them.</span> <span id="s671">We do have a second generation and when they see t.v. they watch Holocaust they have to go in to another house or room.</span> <span id="s672">There is a reason for that.</span> <span id="s673">I can say about my own friends that they have great difficulty understanding and communicating with their children.</span> <span id="s674">They talk on a different level.</span> <span id="s675">I would like to see that conquered.</span> <span id="s676">I am not able to do that, but I try my best.</span> <span id="s677">I hope this project will</span></p> <p><span id="s678">facilitate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">1-27-21 Barry: I would like to see it even broadened.</span> <span id="s680">I would like to see the chair, or chairs, on the education in highschools and to teach more young people particularly.</span> <span id="s681">I think the message would get across because the further we get away from it the more perspective young people get.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Sophie: I just about expressed what I felt, before.</span> <span id="s683">I believe the tape is an extremely useful thing.</span> <span id="s684">We should teach our children, not just our children, but young people, because our hope is really in them.</span> <span id="s685">And that should be expanded and taught in different ways and different levels.</span> <span id="s686">Now, in terms of my children.</span> <span id="s687">I can not answer that.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">I said I never talk to them about it but I think they should have the tape.</span> <span id="s689">If anything it's going to strengthen them and give them moral support.</span> <span id="s690">A lot of what made us stronger will make them stronger too.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Interviewer #1: So it may offer them the opportunity to interact with you also.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">1-29-15 Freddy: If you look into the essence of it, the key word is sensitizing.</span> <span id="s693">If we make our children and all those who see the tape sensitive to the happenings then we have accomplished a lot.</span> <span id="s694">Obviously we talk about it to make people sensitive to human suffering and to make them aware that you are not alone in this world.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">If we talk about broadening the project, what we haven't yet accomplished is to hold up the example of the few people that stood up during the Holocaust to show that a human being has to do under those circumstances .</span> <span id="s696">We as survivors have failed, only recently, a counter-realization, that it's not enough to show our children and the world only the capacity for evil.</span> <span id="s697">It's just as important to show the capacity for great.</span> <span id="s698">This can make the greatest difference, to show one human can save one thousand.</span> <span id="s699">We saw this all the time.</span> <span id="s700">I dare to say that we all survived because someone, somewhere helped</span></p> <p><span id="s701">us.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Marion: I can't say that l know what the tapes will do.</span> <span id="s703">It depends what is done with them.</span> <span id="s704">If they are chelved, it's not good.</span> <span id="s705">They have to be put to use.</span> <span id="s706">The question that I asked before is if they will be available to schools, to synagogues, to organizations, and so on, and I geuss this is not decided yet.</span> <span id="s707">What it will do for my children, I don't know.</span> <span id="s708">I told her there might be a possibility that I can purchase it and she sounded interested.</span> <span id="s709">She participated once on one with me as a second generation.</span> <span id="s710">I certainly hope these tapes will be put to use and not collect dust.</span> <span id="s711">We did as much as we could.</span> <span id="s712">Maybe we didn't emphasize everything.</span> <span id="s713">I want to go back to what Freddy said; that there were not enough good people and I want to pay som tribute to a gentle Pole because of whom I might have survived the war.</span> <span id="s714">He was very helpful.</span> <span id="s715">He questioned as to if they were really as bad as everyone sais and I said yes.</span> <span id="s716">Even though I survived because of a Pole, there were really very few of those.</span> <span id="s717">As a rule you do not have a good record, I</span></p> <p><span id="s718">said.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">1-32-35 Barbara: I'd like to leave this legacy to my children and grandchildren but that they should not view the middle age woman who faces tham but a young girl who struggled, who had courage.</span> <span id="s720">I hope they will take an example that during difficult times they will have time and they will know what we sacrificed.</span> <span id="s721">There is another part.</span> <span id="s722">I was picturing at Yale and UCLA when future historians and leaders will study they will not just get a sheet with statictics.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">They will see a real person, they will see real tears.</span> <span id="s724">I hope this is a legacy we will leave for the future generations.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Interviewer #1: So, in 2084, feelings will be</span></p> <p><span id="s726">seen?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Barbara: Yes, it's not played by an actress.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">It's just a person who lived through hell, that had hope and I am an optimist.</span> <span id="s729">I must survive and I was obsessed with this.</span> <span id="s730">I hope that it will be a better world.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Barry: We all talked about ourselves and the tape.</span> <span id="s732">I would like to salute those who were instrumental in this.</span> <span id="s733">They deserve as much praise as we do.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Interviewer #1: It's been a privilage that you've allowed us to share in your experience.</span> <span id="s735">It's been a very meaningful experience for all of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">1-35-55 Interviewer #2: Let me pull a few things together.</span> <span id="s737">I shared with Flo that this was one of the most extraordinary experiences of my life.</span> <span id="s738">That you and others would be willing to share with us the most difficult moments that have put you in a vulnarable position, again to be willing to have that pain.</span> <span id="s739">What I heard tonight was many different themes.</span> <span id="s740">One of them was soscial.</span> <span id="s741">That as a group of people who were victimized by war, by anti semitism before the war, and after the war you came to America and were victimized again and again, this time not only on purpose, but by a Jewish population who couldn't listen to what you were saying.</span> <span id="s742">It was overwhelming and we shut you down.</span> <span id="s743">We then took what we couldn't listen to and turned it around to accuse you of being sheep who walked to the slaughterhouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">You were chopped again and again.</span> <span id="s745">Now something's changing.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Some of it has to do with your age.</span> <span id="s747">Because of NBC's program, because of Israel, because of Jewish pride, we can begin hearing you.</span> <span id="s748">We can survive it and you can survive telling the story.</span> <span id="s749">I hear you saying that you hope the experience isn't in vain/ Yuo got throagh the camps, what got you through, you hope isn't in vain.</span> <span id="s750">The tapes will be used to make people more sensitive and to make this world a better place, and that's very exciting.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">.</span> <span id="s752">END.</span></p></body></html>
