interview takes place on Saturday, August 23, 1997.</span> <span id="s3">The subject of the interview is Henry Froehlich, and the interviewer is Liesl Joseph Loeb.</span> <span id="s4">Henry, please tell me where you were born, when, and a little about your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">HF: Well my name is actually Hans Arnold Froehlich, and that’s spelled F-R-O-E-H-L-I-C-H.</span> <span id="s6">And I was born in Rottweil am Neckar.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">LL: And can you spell that, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">HF: R-O-T-T-W-E-I-L, small lower case “a”, hyphen, capital “N”.</span> <span id="s9">It’s a river in Swabia in Wuerttenberg [Württemberg].</span> <span id="s10">Wuerttenberg is nicely spelled W-U-E-R-T-T-E-N-B-E-R-G.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">LL: And that’s in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">HF: That’s in the southern part of Germany, in the Black Forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">LL: Right.</span> <span id="s14">And tell me something about your life in your early childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">HF: We had a small town of, we lived in a small town.</span> <span id="s16">It was about 10,000 inhabitants.</span> <span id="s17">My father was a shoe merchant.</span> <span id="s18">He had a shoe store in town.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">LL: How many Jewish people do you think lived there?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">HF: About 20 families.</span> <span id="s21">And we had one synagogue, which was also the home of the Hebrew teacher.</span> <span id="s22">We called him, it, Israelitische Kultus Gemeinde.</span> <span id="s23">Do you want me to spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">LL: Well, it would help.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">HF: Israelitische is I-S-R-E, I-S-R-A-E-L-I-T-I-S-C-H-E, and the Gemeinde of course is congregation.</span> <span id="s26">And the...</span></p> <p><span id="s27">LL: Can you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">HF: Gemeinde is G-E-M-E-I-N-D-E.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">LL: Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">HF: And the families were all of similar cultural backgrounds.</span> <span id="s31">Some were, a couple of families were very rich.</span> <span id="s32">A couple of families were very poor.</span> <span id="s33">Most of them had stores, of different types.</span> <span id="s34">One was a department store.</span> <span id="s35">One was a textile store.</span> <span id="s36">One was a houseware store.</span> <span id="s37">I don’t think there were any laborers as such.</span> <span id="s38">But there were teachers and there were lawyers and there were doctors in town, that belonged to the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s39">My family was called a Reingeschmeckte, that’s R-E-I-N-G-E-S-C-H-M-E-C-K-T-E.</span> <span id="s40">[local term]</span></p> <p><span id="s41">LL: What does it mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">HF: That means you’ve arrived within the last generation.</span> <span id="s43">You were not here for the eight or ten generations.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">LL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">HF: Because most of the people prided themselves of having been the third or fourth or fifth generation Rottweiler, people living in Rottweil.</span> <span id="s46">And my father had moved to the city, to the town, after having been born in...Hessen, it’s H-E-S-S-E-N actually.</span> <span id="s47">And he had been from Hessen.</span> <span id="s48">My mother was from a town near Berlin.</span> <span id="s49">And they had met in Mannheim, M-A-N-N-H-E-I-M.</span> <span id="s50">And that’s when they got married.</span> <span id="s51">They got married after the First World War in 1920 and settled in this small town in the Black Forest because it was such a beautiful little town and my father liked it and he had, he found that it would be a good chance to make a shoe store there because there weren’t many shoe merchants in town.</span> <span id="s52">My mother found a job there in the local department store.</span> <span id="s53">And from my earliest recollections they were always both working.</span> <span id="s54">My mother was working in a department store.</span> <span id="s55">My father was working in the store.</span> <span id="s56">And the earliest recollections I have was that I had an older brother who was born in 1920, so I imagine my parents must have been married in 1919.</span> <span id="s57">So my older brother was born in 1920 and he was crippled from birth.</span> <span id="s58">He had been a victim of a bad obstetrician who had created a problem for my mother, as well as for another woman in the same year who also had a first child who became crippled in the same fashion, whereby they were not able to walk except in a very cramped style, as if they had had infantile paralysis.</span> <span id="s59">But it was not infantile paralysis.</span> <span id="s60">They simply discovered that their muscular structure was damaged during birth.</span> <span id="s61">So when I was born and I was, started to walk, my brother didn’t walk.</span> <span id="s62">It became a very interesting situation for me to know that I have an older brother who couldn’t walk and who was very jealous that I started to walk and he couldn’t walk.</span> <span id="s63">Those are my earliest memories.</span> <span id="s64">And then my next earliest memories are that the years of 1924, ‘25, ‘26 were terrible for business people because it was the inflation.</span> <span id="s65">And money wasn’t worth anything.</span> <span id="s66">And my parents used to have money that was sufficient to fill a bathtub—paper money.</span> <span id="s67">And each day the money was worth less.</span> <span id="s68">And my father started to deal in shoe laces because shoe laces was the best currency to have.</span> <span id="s69">It was better than money, and it was easy to keep, and easy to trade.</span> <span id="s70">And I remember that I had as a child a savings account.</span> <span id="s71">And one day the savings account in 1926 was suddenly closed and opened with the new German Mark, which became a currency situation that I am not familiar with now but I know that all of a sudden the money was good again.</span> <span id="s72">And up until then, millions of Marks were used as paper, wall paper.</span> <span id="s73">The...</span></p> <p><span id="s74">LL: Can you tell me your father’s name and your mother’s name, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">HF: Mmm hmm.</span> <span id="s76">My father’s name was Nathan Froehlich, and my mother’s name was Liesl, like yours.</span> <span id="s77">And her last name was Raphael, R-A-P-H-A-E-L.</span> <span id="s78">And she was born, and I recently discovered again that her mother’s maiden name was Josephsthal, like your name, Joseph, except with the word “thal” on the end, T-H-A-L.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">LL: Spell the whole thing, Joseph-...</span></p> <p><span id="s80">HF: Josephsthal is J-O-S-E-P-H-S-T-H-A-L.</span> <span id="s81">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s82">LL: And tell me, did your older brother live?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">HF: Yes, he lived and he was constantly receiving medical attention because as the situation was improved he began to walk.</span> <span id="s84">He began to have use of his hands and legs.</span> <span id="s85">But he could not freely walk and probably ate up most of my parents’ resources because there was, they went to the ends of the earth for, you know, for all kinds of real medications and quack medications and resorts with mud baths and everything else.</span> <span id="s86">And every conceivable method of getting him better was used and they spared no expense to get him better.</span> <span id="s87">And he was, he lived right through the Hitler period and he was killed in one of the euthanasia campaigns in 1943 and we have not been able to find out where, although I have someone working on that today, and for the last two years.</span> <span id="s88">And we have followed up some leads as to where he may have been killed, but we do know that he was killed because someone received his clothing in 1943 in a package.</span> <span id="s89">But that person who received the clothing and told me about this doesn’t live any more.</span> <span id="s90">And I have since read about the euthanasia campaigns that took place, and where they took place.</span> <span id="s91">And there is no question that he was killed there.</span> <span id="s92">But exactly where and how, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s93">There is a conflicting report in the archives of Rottweil, and Stuttgart where we lived last, that he was killed in a town in Poland.</span> <span id="s94">And it has since been discovered that the town in Poland where supposedly there was a death certificate in his name is a town that doesn’t exist, and that that town in Poland, which has been visited, exists, but there was no such home or such address or such place there.</span> <span id="s95">But that the Germans, in order to hide euthanasia did exterminations that took place within Germany did not want to make so many death certificates in the same city and they suddenly picked a town and place in Poland.</span> <span id="s96">And there is a history behind that from which there is a number of books out now.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">LL: Did you have other siblings?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">HF: I had a younger brother named Max.</span> <span id="s99">He was born in 1926 and he emigrated to the United States in 1940 also.</span> <span id="s100">He emigrated in 19-, in February of 1940.</span> <span id="s101">I emigrated in March of 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">LL: What was your life like before the war, or before your life was changed by the Nazi victories in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">HF: I went to my, in my little town I went to school.</span> <span id="s104">It was a Catholic town.</span> <span id="s105">It was 99% Catholic and I was one of the few Jewish children.</span> <span id="s106">We were excused from religious classes because the priests were teaching religion in class and as Jews we were called Israelitische religion, I-S-R-A-E-L-I-T-I-S-C-H-E.</span> <span id="s107">We were Israelitic, we didn’t call it Jewish.</span> <span id="s108">We called it Israelitic religion.</span> <span id="s109">And as such we had our own religious education, I remember, from a Jewish teacher, once or twice a week.</span> <span id="s110">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s111">But the only thing I remember in school is that I was always excused from the, on a daily basis from the one hour of religious instructions by the Catholics.</span> <span id="s112">That did not have any effect from, as far as my schoolmates were concerned, except that they were jealous that I got time off and they didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">LL: Did your family experience antisemitism before the Hitler period?</span> <span id="s114">And if so, please tell us about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">HF: I don’t remember any antisemitic situation that could purely be because we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s116">There were competitive things happening between different dealers, between different stores.</span> <span id="s117">And my father had billboards in town and sometimes the billboards were cut down.</span> <span id="s118">But we found out they were cut down by the carpenter that got the job of setting them up again.</span> <span id="s119">And he arranged for them to be cut down so that he could get some extra work.</span> <span id="s120">But that happened not only to him but to others as well.</span> <span id="s121">And eventually they got rid of the carpenter.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">LL: And did, you had no problems in school at all, then?</span> <span id="s123">You played with Gentile children as well as Jewish children?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">HF: There were no Jewish children that I can think of that I could point out.</span> <span id="s125">I was part of the class.</span> <span id="s126">And I don’t remember anything that specifically had to do with the fact that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s127">But I only went to school there until 19-, from 19-, I was still bar mitzvahed in Rottweil, and that was in 1935.</span> <span id="s128">But I believe that by 1936 we had moved to Stuttgart, to a larger city, because Hitler came to power in ‘33 and I had been in school up to about the eighth grade or the ninth grade.</span> <span id="s129">And after that, in 1933 I was 11 years old.</span> <span id="s130">Hitler came to power in ‘33 and after that, it became very obvious that there was no future for us in Rottweil, in such a small town, because the teachers that were in my school at that time, those who were sympathetic towards the Jews, or those who were not Nazis, as per se—they didn’t have to be sympathetic towards Jews, but if they were not Nazis—they were sidelined and put into secondary positions.</span> <span id="s131">And those teachers who were members of the Nazi Party got top positions.</span> <span id="s132">And one of them, who was an out and out S.S. type person, became the physical education teacher, and he delighted in torturing me.</span> <span id="s133">He made very, very antisemitic statements in school.</span> <span id="s134">If I wanted to answer a question, he would say, “Why does the Jew have to know everything?”</span> <span id="s135">And that shut me up for the rest of the class and made it unpleasant to be continuing in school.</span> <span id="s136">And some sympathetic teachers told me I would be best off if we moved to a bigger city and if I got out of school.</span> <span id="s137">So I never went past the year 1934, no, 1935 about, when I was 13.</span> <span id="s138">And I must have been in about the eighth or ninth grade when I left.</span> <span id="s139">And then I had no further schooling.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">LL: Did you or your family belong to any Jewish organizations, or to synagogues before Nazism changed your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">HF: We belonged to the local synagogue, that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">LL: Not B’nai B’rith or...</span></p> <p><span id="s143">HF: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">LL: Any other?</span> <span id="s145">Did...</span></p> <p><span id="s146">HF: Not that I could remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">LL: Did any men in your family serve in any national army?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">HF: My father was a rank below Corporal in the German Army.</span> <span id="s149">I don’t know what the rank was, but it was a rank, I think it was a rank above Private and a rank below Corporal.</span> <span id="s150">But I have all of his photos in his German uniform.</span> <span id="s151">I know he had been going with my mother during the war and that there’s a lot of exchanges of letters that I became privy to which they wrote to each other while he was in the service.</span> <span id="s152">He did not want to get married while he was in the army and while there was a war going on, so they waited.</span> <span id="s153">And now I remember, they waited until 1919 when the war was over, to get married in ‘19.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">LL: Nine-...</span></p> <p><span id="s155">HF: 1919.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">LL: Do you remember how you, and members of your family, reacted to Hitler’s appointment as Chancellor in January, 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">HF: With great dismay.</span> <span id="s158">My father was probably, either what was it then called, the Christian Democrat or Socialist?</span> <span id="s159">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s160">LL: A Social Democrat, perhaps?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">HF: Social Democrat perhaps.</span> <span id="s162">And we were sympathetic towards the Communist Party, but not to any large degree except that we shared their hatred of Hitler.</span> <span id="s163">The Communists were the most outspoken enemies of the Nazis and as such they had a, we had a great deal of sympathy for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">LL: Did you have any contact with the Reichsvertretung or Council of German Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">HF: Not while I was in Rottweil.</span> <span id="s166">As soon as I came to Stuttgart, I began to do part time work for them.</span> <span id="s167">And when we came to Stuttgart, I had no more schooling.</span> <span id="s168">And I immediately apprenticed with a German, I wanted to learn a trade.</span> <span id="s169">I became entranced with the idea of a Jewish State.</span> <span id="s170">I was reading the Jabotinsky auto emancipation book which is a book that became the Bible for me for Zionism, and for having a State for the Jews, because I could not believe that the Jews could have a future in Europe as long as there was such a situation as Nazis.</span> <span id="s171">And most of the people of my parents’ generation felt that Nazis was a passing situation since there had been something like eight or nine chancellors before Hitler and no chancellor lasted more than two or three years and then they were changed.</span> <span id="s172">And it was not considered to be something that the German public would tolerate for too long.</span> <span id="s173">So they felt that Nazism and Hitler’s election was a situation that you’d have to live through but eventually it’d have to be replaced with someone else.</span> <span id="s174">That attitude did not prevail in my mind because I had this drastic change from a small town schooling into a big city and I wanted to learn a trade so I apprenticed.</span> <span id="s175">And I also had to make money.</span> <span id="s176">I apprenticed with a, my first apprenticeship was with someone who—there’s a German word for it but I’ll say it in English—he did paper hanging in the summertime and mattress making in the wintertime.</span> <span id="s177">So, in the summertime I hung papers.</span> <span id="s178">I was a paper hanger.</span> <span id="s179">And in the wintertime I made mattresses.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">LL: Did your father continue with the shoe business in Stuttgart?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">HF: No, my father had to close his store.</span> <span id="s182">Actually he was boycotted during the first boycott by the Nazis in 1934, I think it was and had to move from, the Germans were told not to shop at Jewish stores.</span> <span id="s183">So therefore he had to take, his customers had to come in through the back door so they wouldn’t be seen.</span> <span id="s184">He had to move to a smaller place and eventually closed the store and started to traveling to small towns, with shoes, and held semi-, not seminars, but he held selling shows at hotels in the small villages.</span> <span id="s185">And when we moved to Stuttgart, he continued that for a while.</span> <span id="s186">But he had no more store, none.</span> <span id="s187">He didn’t have a store any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">LL: Could your mother work in Stuttgart?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">HF: No, she did not work in Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s190">We rented out our rooms.</span> <span id="s191">We had an apartment in Stuttgart and we rented out our rooms because Stuttgart was the headquarters of the American Consulate.</span> <span id="s192">And Jewish people wanting to go to America would have to come, usually the night before they had to go to the Consulate, and they could not stay in public hotels.</span> <span id="s193">So the Jewish community had everyone who was Jewish to open their homes, to rent rooms.</span> <span id="s194">And we rented our rooms.</span> <span id="s195">And we had different people almost every night staying at our house, before they would go to the American Consulate the next day.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">LL: That’s interesting.</span> <span id="s197">That was the boycott of April 1, 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">HF: ‘33?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">LL: Yeah, according to my questionnaire.</span> <span id="s200">It says 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">HF: Hitler was elected in January.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">LL: And this was April 1st.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">HF: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">LL: I mean, it’s easy to...</span></p> <p><span id="s205">HF: Well, it’s, I remember the boycott very well, because my father was not in town, and my mother saw this SA man, and that’s S.A. in the brown uniform, with a sign, “DO NOT PATRONIZE FROM JEWISH STORES.”</span> <span id="s206">And she really fooled him and gave him a chair and says, “You don’t have to stand.</span> <span id="s207">If you’ve got to be here, why don’t you sit down?”</span> <span id="s208">And he was the most ridiculous looking man in a uniform that you ever saw.</span> <span id="s209">And on that day more people came through the back door to buy than on any other day.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">LL: And did he sit down?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">HF: He sat down, and he apologized.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">LL: Between 1933 and the passage of the Nuremberg Laws of September, 1935, how was your life changed, if at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">HF: I was pestered a lot in school.</span> <span id="s214">And my father’s business went downhill.</span> <span id="s215">And we had to move from, we...reluctantly moved from Rottweil.</span> <span id="s216">My father was in love with the town.</span> <span id="s217">I was in love with the town.</span> <span id="s218">It’s a very picturesque town.</span> <span id="s219">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s220">LL: It’s on a river, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">HF: It’s on the river.</span> <span id="s222">It has a lot of charm.</span> <span id="s223">And we had a lot of friends there.</span> <span id="s224">And the idea of being uprooted from something that I thought would, being a newcomer, so to speak, amongst people who had been there for generations, I had hoped to start the new, next generation in that town and have there a lot of generations.</span> <span id="s225">Because we had that kind of feeling for the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">LL: Well, if you say, “I had a lot of friends,” and there weren’t a lot of Jews, most of your parents’ friends were not Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">HF: No, they were not.</span> <span id="s228">We had, the Jewish families were our friends, but we were, most of the other friends were Gentiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">LL: And how did they behave towards you until you moved?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">HF: Apologetically, and some were outright risking their Gentile friends in order to be extraordinarily friendly to us.</span> <span id="s231">There was a so-called group of Bibelforscher, and that’s Bible, Bible...</span></p> <p><span id="s232">LL: Scholars?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">HF: Bible scholars, who had not been Catholic, and who considered themselves to be a very, very active civil rights type people.</span> <span id="s234">And we knew them because we had a maid and the maid was the maid for these people as well as the maid for our house.</span> <span id="s235">And when this, when the Nazis came, they went out of their way to tell us that we should never have to be worried about anything because they’ll stand by our side.</span> <span id="s236">There were young men, young boys in school who went out of their way to be extraordinarily friendly with me.</span> <span id="s237">One of them was the son of a military officer of a fairly high rank who lived in town.</span> <span id="s238">He was a military officer in the First World War.</span> <span id="s239">He hated the Nazis, and his son hated the Nazis.</span> <span id="s240">And his son made an open effort to be friendly to me.</span> <span id="s241">On the other hand there were others who were absolutely mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">LL: During this early period, did you or any member of your family discuss the possibility of leaving Germany?</span> <span id="s243">Please tell me any details you recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">HF: I don’t recall anything in Rottweil.</span> <span id="s245">When we went to Stuttgart, emigration became a topic of everyday conversation.</span> <span id="s246">First of all we had the people coming to the Consulate who stayed in our house.</span> <span id="s247">We were trying to find if we had relatives in the United States.</span> <span id="s248">We began to have meetings with people who were active in the organization, which is what you call before the Reichsvereinigung, the organization of Jews in Germany.</span> <span id="s249">They had offices in Stuttgart and they had meetings and the idea of emigrating became a topic of conversation in many families and it was always a very, very open discussion between suicide and emigration.</span> <span id="s250">People who had no hope of emigrating because the world was basically closed to us, if you didn’t have relatives in America and you didn’t have a lot of money—you could buy your way into Switzerland and you could buy your way into some South American countries—but if you didn’t have money, and we were not wealthy, we were very middle class or lower middle class, and the lower middle class people could not hope to have enough money to go out of the country unless they had sponsorship with direct relatives in another country.</span> <span id="s251">So the conversation of emigrating became the main topic of conversation.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">LL: I think later on it wasn’t a matter any more of lower class or upper class because the Nazis confiscated much of the wealth of the Jews who were still in Germany as we get closer to 1939.</span> <span id="s253">Is that not so?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">HF: That’s right.</span> <span id="s255">But I’m now in ‘36 and ‘37 and ‘38.</span> <span id="s256">Between ‘36, ‘37, and ‘38, those were the years where the people who left were the ones who left with money.</span> <span id="s257">And the, that wave of people leaving, we were envious of their ability to get out of the country, because they were able to take complete lifts which...trailers, packed with furniture and everything else.</span> <span id="s258">And they were able to leave the country, take every, all their household goods with them, take a certain amount of money with them.</span> <span id="s259">And the regulations became more stringent each year.</span> <span id="s260">But from ‘35, ‘36, and ‘37 and ‘38, the topic of emigration showed that if you had money you could get out, and if you didn’t have money, you were probably lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">LL: During the period from 1933 to 1938, did your family have any contact with non-Jews?</span> <span id="s262">If so, would you describe their behavior?</span> <span id="s263">This is the question on my form.</span> <span id="s264">And in a way you’ve already answered that question.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">HF: I’ve answered that, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">LL: What happened to your family during Kristallnacht in November, 1938?</span> <span id="s267">Were you already in Stuttgart at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">HF: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">LL: Would you describe what happened in Stuttgart and to your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">HF: Well when my, after my father could do no more business with the, with shoes, by traveling, he sold out everything we had, and he obtained a job with the Jewish congregation at the synagogue as a..</span> <span id="s271">.</span> <span id="s272">custodian.</span> <span id="s273">The Stuttgart Synagogue was a very large synagogue, had a fairly large congregation.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">LL: Was it the only synagogue in Stuttgart?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">HF: To my knowledge that was the only synagogue.</span> <span id="s276">It was a centuries old building with a cupola, with a huge, the capacity must have been somewhere around five, six hundred people.</span> <span id="s277">And it was well-known as a historic landmark.</span> <span id="s278">And it required a custodian to fire the ovens and to heat it and to clean it and so forth.</span> <span id="s279">And my father was made custodian and earned his money that way.</span> <span id="s280">And he went there every day.</span> <span id="s281">And I had, since I was working for a paper hanger/mattress maker, who has, who was Gentile, he was forced in 1936 to fire me.</span> <span id="s282">He was, they came to him and said, “We’ve discovered that you have a Jew working for you.</span> <span id="s283">You can’t have a, you can’t do any contracts with the city or with the town.</span> <span id="s284">And you have to, unless you fire the, you can’t have Jewish, you’ve got to employ a Gentile now.</span> <span id="s285">You’ve got to employ an Aryan.”</span> <span id="s286">A-R-Y-A-N, Arier, A-R-I-E-R.</span> <span id="s287">And if you, he was almost in tears.</span> <span id="s288">And he says, “I just can’t keep you any more.</span> <span id="s289">You must find yourself another job.</span> <span id="s290">Find yourself a job with a Jewish tradesman of some sort.”</span> <span id="s291">I found the only Jewish firm that was a trade, in a trade.</span> <span id="s292">It was in a company that it was a plumber, a contract plumber, who was, his name was Kahn, K-A-H-N.</span> <span id="s293">And he had a plumbing business with several apprentices and journeymen and masters.</span> <span id="s294">And he had enough Jewish trade to keep him busy from people, having to clean their toilets, to having new construction where he got contracts to build old bathrooms and old installations.</span> <span id="s295">And he took me on as a true apprentice.</span> <span id="s296">And I learned, I became a true German apprentice, which means that you had to work four days a week.</span> <span id="s297">On the fifth day you had a half a day of instructions, technical instructions in school on how to become a plumber.</span> <span id="s298">I got onto the Social Security system.</span> <span id="s299">I filed, I got my pay, paid my Social Security.</span> <span id="s300">And he had about six or eight employees.</span> <span id="s301">I even got to, I had all my tools in the tool kit.</span> <span id="s302">I supposedly became a fairly good apprentice over the next couple of years—this was from ‘36 to ‘38, I think—and had, was on my way to become a journeyman, from...</span></p> <p><span id="s303">LL: Well, when you went to classes, were these classes all Jewish apprentices?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">HF: No, they were all...plumber trades.</span> <span id="s305">I was a..</span> <span id="s306">.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">LL: And you were accepted there?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">HF: I was accepted there, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">LL: Nobody made any problems for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">HF: No, no problems there.</span> <span id="s311">This was strictly trade, a trade union type of Handwerker Gesellschaft.</span> <span id="s312">[Tradesman’s Association] I can’t spell that.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">LL: Yeah.</span> <span id="s314">O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">HF: And this was a, and I don’t know whether anybody knew that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s316">I was in my blue jeans and in my work clothes, and with my tools in my pocket and my tool kit and I just came like everybody else.</span> <span id="s317">And I don’t recall having had any problem on that.</span> <span id="s318">This was not a normal educational process.</span> <span id="s319">This was a..</span> <span id="s320">.</span> <span id="s321">in the trade business, of making, going from apprentice to journeyman to master.</span> <span id="s322">Master plumber.</span> <span id="s323">I had made it to journeyman and I was riding a bicycle which had belonged to the, to me, which had been bought—I don’t know how we bought it, but it was an old post office bicycle, which in the German post office system, the bicycles are all yellow.</span> <span id="s324">The postmen ride on yellow bicycles and they’re known as the postal bicycles.</span> <span id="s325">And we had one of those.</span> <span id="s326">I had one of those.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">LL: With a basket on it or, obviously, some...</span></p> <p><span id="s328">HF: What?</span> <span id="s329">No, my...tool kit was on the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">LL: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">HF: My tool kit was on the back.</span> <span id="s332">And when my father went to synagogue on, in the morning of November 9th, he came back horrified to our house.</span> <span id="s333">And I had not yet left the house.</span> <span id="s334">And he said that the synagogue is in flames, and that the people are standing around and are yelling and screaming that the Jews should be killed because this happened the day or two days after the German Vice Consul in Paris was shot by the young man from, whose parents had been ex-, had been taken to Poland.</span> <span id="s335">What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">LL: Herschel Grynszpan.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">HF: Grynszpan, yeah.</span> <span id="s338">This murder of the German attaché at, in Paris became the headline, and of course the entire business of having the Kristallnacht all over Germany and having all of these people arrested was a direct response, claimed in the German press, to have been the spontaneous reaction of the German people against the Jews, who were responsible for this.</span> <span id="s339">I’m going to interject something here.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">LL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">HF: One of my workers in my shop was a Polish Jew, from a Polish-Jewish family, who also was a plumber’s apprentice.</span> <span id="s342">And one morning in October he didn’t show up.</span> <span id="s343">And when he didn’t show up we went to his house.</span> <span id="s344">And we found out that his door was locked, and it was padlocked by the police.</span> <span id="s345">And the people that were next door neighbors said that he, they were...</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s347">LL: ...side two, of interview with Henry Froehlich.</span> <span id="s348">And we will start again about your fellow apprentice in the plumbing business, that when you found out that he had been sent away.</span> <span id="s349">Continue, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">HF: Yeah, and...I don’t want to do injustice to him.</span> <span id="s351">He was one grade ahead of me.</span> <span id="s352">He was already a journeyman.</span> <span id="s353">He was...my boss.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">LL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">HF: In the sense he was my instructor and had been a little older.</span> <span id="s356">And we, well we worked very well together.</span> <span id="s357">And when he did not show up that morning we went to his apartment with, I went with someone else, because we couldn’t understand why he didn’t show and then the apartment was padlocked by the police.</span> <span id="s358">And the neighbors told us that they had come during the night and that they were taken away.</span> <span id="s359">And we made inquiries with the police, I believe, and also with the Jewish organizations in Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s360">And we were told that all people whose passports were Polish, and who were residing in Germany as visitors or not, or did not have German citizenship, or did, excuse me, or were stateless—stateless Jews and Polish Jews—were all rounded up during the night.</span> <span id="s361">And this was in October before the Paris situation.</span> <span id="s362">And they were all shipped to Poland.</span> <span id="s363">And basically nobody knew where they were shipped.</span> <span id="s364">At that time, I had already done, been working part time for the Oberrat, O-B-E-R-R-A-T, which was an affiliation of the roof organization of the German-Jewish organization which you called the Reichsvereinigung.</span> <span id="s365">I can’t spell that now.</span> <span id="s366">But the, it was a...quasi-governmental office, because the Jewish religious community had theoretically the same status as the Catholic community and as the Protestant community, and as such taxes in Germany were levied for all religions.</span> <span id="s367">And the taxes that were, each Jew, each religious organization was allowed access to the income tax records of the citizens.</span> <span id="s368">And if they were Jews, then a portion of their tax went to the Jewish organization, to support schools, hospitals, etc. and a portion of the taxes went to Catholic or Protestant.</span> <span id="s369">But the religious organizations by laws that had not yet been abrogated by Hitler continued to go on the basis whereby this organization was allowed to levy against the Jews.</span> <span id="s370">There was no need for any charity of money or any raising of money.</span> <span id="s371">A fixed amount of money was coming in every month, into this organization, and it took care of the Jewish interests.</span> <span id="s372">And this organization in Stuttgart was called the Oberrat and it had its jurisdiction for all of Würtemberg.</span> <span id="s373">But it had additional jurisdiction over the Emigration Assistance Office, which was affiliated with HIAS, H-I-A-S, and affiliated with the Joint Distribution Committee.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">LL: And does this have any reference to the Polish Jews being sent back?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">HF: No, it had no reference to that except that they were constantly being kept informed.</span> <span id="s376">Whatever was happening to Jews in Stuttgart, the police organization still had to inform the Oberrat what’s happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">LL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">HF: The Oberrat kept the, had to keep the police informed on what’s happening in the Jewish community and vice versa.</span> <span id="s379">There was a relationship between the police, the Gestapo, and this organization.</span> <span id="s380">So it was very easy for them to say, “What the heck happened here?</span> <span id="s381">Why, where are all the Jews that were taken away during the night?”</span> <span id="s382">And they said, “Well, don’t you know, they were not Germans so they had to be deported.</span> <span id="s383">And because they were not Germans they were deported.</span> <span id="s384">And as far as we know they were deported to Poland.”</span> <span id="s385">There was a difference between three different organizations.</span> <span id="s386">There was the city police of Stuttgart, which is the civil police, with very little power.</span> <span id="s387">Then there was the Gestapo and then there was the Sicherheitsdienst, S.D. the Security Services.</span> <span id="s388">The Security Services were above the Gestapo and they were above the local police.</span> <span id="s389">And there were certain hierarchical relationships with jealousies.</span> <span id="s390">So the Police Commissioner would prefer to give the Jewish organization the information that he had before the SD would give it to them, because he also had to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">LL: I see.</span> <span id="s392">Getting back to Kristallnacht...</span></p> <p><span id="s393">HF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">LL: How did it affect you personally?</span> <span id="s395">Your father found the synagogue ablaze and came home.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">HF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s397">My father found the synagogue ablaze and I had already been on the way to work when I saw what was happening and that’s why I wasn’t home.</span> <span id="s398">And I saw trucks being loaded with people, in different streets.</span> <span id="s399">Jews lived all over Stuttgart in different sections of the city, and I saw trucks with the black [black-shirted] S.S. people knocking on doors and bringing people out and loading them onto these lorries, onto the trucks.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">LL: When you say black you mean with black uniforms?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">HF: Black uniforms, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">LL: Yes.</span> <span id="s403">And were these people all men or men and women?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">HF: All men.</span> <span id="s405">And when I saw that some of them were people I knew, and I saw they were...it didn’t take much deduction to see that they were burning the synagogue and they were rounding up Jewish men.</span> <span id="s406">So I bicycled home on my yellow bike.</span> <span id="s407">And I told my father to get out of town.</span> <span id="s408">And he had a sister in Frankfurt who was married to a Gentile, a painter.</span> <span id="s409">And he said that he was going to go to Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s410">And I don’t know how he got to the station.</span> <span id="s411">I think he took the streetcar to the railroad station, bought a ticket, and went to Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s412">And we knew where he was going.</span> <span id="s413">And I told him to stay out of town until we could tell him that the coast is clear.</span> <span id="s414">And we made a quick code that he is going to talk about Tante Erna, an aunt that didn’t exist.</span> <span id="s415">And that if he talked about an Aunt Erna and we said she is not well, then he would stay away.</span> <span id="s416">And when we tell him that she is well, then he could come home.</span> <span id="s417">That day I bicycled all over town and warned everybody to get out of town, everyone that I knew.</span> <span id="s418">Which, the people I knew I called, rang their doorbell if they weren’t already, if there was no truck in the street I would ring the doorbell and say, “Get the hell out of here.”</span> <span id="s419">And in some cases they did and some cases they didn’t, but I was running around on that bike all day long.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">LL: Weren’t you afraid for yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">HF: I was never, not really suspected.</span> <span id="s422">With a yellow bike you were a postman.</span> <span id="s423">You were a government person.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">LL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">HF: At least that’s what I felt.</span> <span id="s426">And I felt that with a yellow bike I had absolutely been, nobody would ever touch anybody on a yellow bike or they wouldn’t get their mail!</span></p> <p><span id="s427">LL: Now, what happened with your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">HF: Well, let me give you the first day.</span> <span id="s429">At the end of the first day, I was coming home and I, my mother told me that they had been at the house and looked for my father and she said, “He’s not here.”</span> <span id="s430">And they looked for my brother and he is crippled.</span> <span id="s431">And they didn’t do anything to him.</span> <span id="s432">And they looked for me and I wasn’t home.</span> <span id="s433">But she said, “They came in the house and they took away two other people,” who happened this is an apartment house with about ten or twelve apartments.</span> <span id="s434">Two more apartments were Jewish people.</span> <span id="s435">And they took the men from these two, from these apartments and put them on the truck and loaded more people on the truck in the street that we lived on.</span> <span id="s436">So we, my mother knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s437">And she was almost afraid they were going to take my brother, because they were very rough.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">LL: Your younger brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">HF: My older brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">LL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">HF: Because they thought that he was pretending not to be able to walk.</span> <span id="s442">And in the evening my father called and my mother told him, “The aunt is sick.”</span> <span id="s443">And then we knew the telephones was not a safe thing to do, but that’s the call that apparently was run through.</span> <span id="s444">I was then told by my mother that the bicycle isn’t going to hold me forever, and that if I had been home, I would have been gone.</span> <span id="s445">So I had a woman in another part of town who was my teacher in English.</span> <span id="s446">I had private lessons.</span> <span id="s447">I had taken private lessons in English from a teacher, a woman teacher, once or twice a week.</span> <span id="s448">And I bicycled to her apartment, to her small home, in a completely different section of Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s449">And I told her what’s happening.</span> <span id="s450">And she said she heard about what’s happening.</span> <span id="s451">And if I want to stay with her, I can stay with her.</span> <span id="s452">So I put my bike in the house and I went in there and I stayed there.</span> <span id="s453">So that if they would ever come back in our house, I wasn’t going to be there.</span> <span id="s454">I did that for the three days.</span> <span id="s455">I did not stay home.</span> <span id="s456">But each day I would ride around and start looking for people.</span> <span id="s457">Some of them had gone.</span> <span id="s458">Some of them hadn’t gone.</span> <span id="s459">I could not go to my office.</span> <span id="s460">I could not go to the repair shop.</span> <span id="s461">Because that had also been totally smashed.</span> <span id="s462">The repair shop had been totally smashed, and we couldn’t do business there.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">LL: You’re talking about the plumbing.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">HF: The plumbing shop, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">LL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">HF: The plumbing.</span> <span id="s467">The plumbing supply house was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">LL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">HF: And they had smashed it all, thrown the tools all over the yard and everything else.</span> <span id="s470">And where the boss went, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s471">Or whether he was taken, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s472">But it was impossible to continue to go there.</span> <span id="s473">So I was riding around on the bike.</span> <span id="s474">I was stopping in at home if I saw there were no truck on the street.</span> <span id="s475">I would ride home and check with my mother.</span> <span id="s476">And she said that they were back again, looking for me.</span> <span id="s477">And I didn’t think it was safe for me to be home.</span> <span id="s478">She also said that my father was calling from Frankfurt and that everything was all right.</span> <span id="s479">And she told him that the aunt is sick.</span> <span id="s480">On the third day, I had, on the second, actually, on the first and second day, both days, I had seen them round up the Jews that, and take them to the central police headquarters where they were told to stand in the courtyard.</span> <span id="s481">And I saw them standing in the courtyard.</span> <span id="s482">And I saw that they were being guarded.</span> <span id="s483">But they were not molested.</span> <span id="s484">But they were all being assembled for something there.</span> <span id="s485">And I didn’t know what was going to happen to them, but they were, all the people that were rounded up in the trucks were first taken to that central courtyard and they were standing there.</span> <span id="s486">And I was driving, riding by and saw them.</span> <span id="s487">When I came home on the third day, my mother told me that the, my father had called and said that he was terribly worried about my crippled brother, and about me, and he couldn’t stand being away.</span> <span id="s488">And that afternoon he came home.</span> <span id="s489">And within two hours someone knocked on the door—two S.S. men—and I was there, and he was there.</span> <span id="s490">And he showed them his military pass and his decorations and his pay book and everything else.</span> <span id="s491">And they told him, “No, come with us.”</span> <span id="s492">My father gave me his wallet and a few other things of his personal belongings, and said, “Take good care of the family.”</span> <span id="s493">And they took him away.</span> <span id="s494">And he came home one day too soon.</span> <span id="s495">They did not take me.</span> <span id="s496">I don’t know why not.</span> <span id="s497">I have a plumber’s tool, which is a very heavy wrench, and I was terribly tempted to hit them with the wrench.</span> <span id="s498">And it took me all my powers not to hit them because I didn’t know whether, I didn’t really care what would happen to me.</span> <span id="s499">But for them to take my father was just such an outrage, and to treat them that way, and to go through the house and march in every room.</span> <span id="s500">I had that wrench and I was going to hit them.</span> <span id="s501">And I know I could have killed one of them with that wrench.</span> <span id="s502">I don’t know, I have the wrench to this day and I don’t know why I didn’t do it.</span> <span id="s503">But I think I’m glad I didn’t!</span> <span id="s504">[pause] The temptation was great.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">LL: I can imagine.</span> <span id="s506">How long was your father in...</span></p> <p><span id="s507">HF: We got one postcard from him from Dachau.</span> <span id="s508">And the next thing we received was a phone call in, on December the 12th, which was one month after they took him away.</span> <span id="s509">And the phone call was from the western, well, the tele-, the post office telegraph, telegraph office.</span> <span id="s510">And my mother screamed and said, “They killed him!</span> <span id="s511">They killed him!</span> <span id="s512">They killed him!”</span> <span id="s513">And the telegram said [German].</span> <span id="s514">Which means...</span></p> <p><span id="s515">LL: Just translate.</span> <span id="s516">Never mind spelling.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">HF: Which means, “If you want the corpse transferred to Munich, you have to send 500 Marks.”</span> <span id="s518">That was the first news.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">LL: And what was your mother’s reaction?</span> <span id="s520">Did she do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">HF: She screamed.</span> <span id="s522">She screamed.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">LL: Did she do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">HF: She, no, she screamed, collapsed, and of course they needed to deliver that because there was an address on it.</span> <span id="s525">The address was the Jewish Community Center in Munich, to whom you had to send the money.</span> <span id="s526">I had friends in the, on the street, the woman who was a fairly well-to-do Jewish...family, whose brother was taken away.</span> <span id="s527">And I went to her and told her what happened.</span> <span id="s528">And she shoved 500 Marks in my pocket.</span> <span id="s529">[tape off then on] We went to Munich, and I think it was around the 13th or 14th of December.</span> <span id="s530">And had never been to Munich.</span> <span id="s531">And we had to report to the Jewish Community Center, or the cemetery.</span> <span id="s532">And the area in the cemetery where there were funerals taking place was filled up.</span> <span id="s533">They were being, there were people being buried every day, by the hour, who had been shipped in from Dachau.</span> <span id="s534">We did manage to see the casket.</span> <span id="s535">The casket was opened.</span> <span id="s536">I didn’t recognize, but they claimed it was my father.</span> <span id="s537">And there were belongings that they shipped back with him, that were his belongings.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">LL: And you think the person in the coffin was not your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">HF: I think it was.</span> <span id="s540">I think it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">LL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">HF: I mean he was blown up and I did not let my mother see him.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">LL: O.K.</span> <span id="s544">Did she go with you to Munich?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">HF: Yeah, oh yeah, oh yes.</span> <span id="s546">I was fifteen years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">LL: O.K. And you then had the body shipped back to Stuttgart?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">HF: No, we buried him in that Munich cemetery.</span> <span id="s549">And the Munich cemetery had actually, at that point, been a burial factory.</span> <span id="s550">It was taking place every day by the hour.</span> <span id="s551">The caskets kept coming in from Dachau every day.</span> <span id="s552">And the telegram was actually sent by the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s553">But they had thought that Dachau had notified us.</span> <span id="s554">They didn’t know that there was no notification to next of kin.</span> <span id="s555">We had found out later from other people who were in the same bunk as my, Block as my father was, that he had gotten very, very ill, that he reported to the...</span></p> <p><span id="s556">LL: Infirmary?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">HF: Infirmary.</span> <span id="s558">And that he was called a malingerer and he was thrown out.</span> <span id="s559">And it was winter time, of course, and he died after he was thrown out of the, literally thrown out the window, as a malingerer.</span> <span id="s560">And we, after the funeral, a taxi cab driver told us that he had made so many trips to the cemetery and that he felt so bad about what was going on.</span> <span id="s561">And he says, “You should have seen how the Kristallnacht was in Munich.”</span> <span id="s562">He said, “They burned down the department store, [unclear] .</span> <span id="s563">They herded the Jewish people into the department store to the top floor and told them to jump.”</span></p> <p><span id="s564">LL: Just one more horror tale.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">HF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">LL: Were you or any members of your family able to work after this time, and how did you support yourselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">HF: Ah, that’s a good question.</span> <span id="s568">I thought that my father had life insurance as a veteran, and we were not able to collect any of that to my knowledge.</span> <span id="s569">We were of course having some income from renting rooms all the time, for people who came to Stuttgart for their visa and for the American Consulate visit.</span> <span id="s570">And the Oberrat, and I’ll keep repeating that word...</span></p> <p><span id="s571">LL: That’s all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">HF: It’s a..</span> <span id="s573">.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">LL: That’s the Jewish Community...</span></p> <p><span id="s575">HF: Yeah, this was the semi-governmental agency.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">LL: Commit-, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">HF: Semi-governmental agency...</span></p> <p><span id="s578">LL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">HF: Had by then been transformed into an emigration center.</span> <span id="s580">And it had on its premises a representative of the Sicherheitsdienst, the security service, to whom the Oberrat had to make daily reports and who was on the premises talking to everybody.</span> <span id="s581">And he was a Judenkommissar, a Jewish...Commissar for Jewish Affairs.</span> <span id="s582">And he had to make his reports to his superiors of what was going on.</span> <span id="s583">And the people who were being helped by HIAS or by the Joint Distribution Committee to go, to emigrate, if they had to go to the American Consulate, they were told to come to our office the day before.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">LL: You say “our office.”</span> <span id="s585">You’re trying to tell me that you worked in this office?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">HF: At the Oberrat.</span> <span id="s587">I immediately got the job in the Oberrat.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">LL: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">HF: I immediately got a job there as soon as my father was killed, and as soon as I came back.</span> <span id="s590">I went there because the, I had worked there part time and I had helped out on Winterhilfe, [winter aid] Jewish winter relief efforts that were made.</span> <span id="s591">And all the Jewish, everybody was a volunteer there.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">LL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">HF: And after that they told me that I have a permanent job there and they needed me as a file clerk at first and as an assistant.</span> <span id="s594">And they had about 25 to 30 people working there.</span> <span id="s595">This was a very fascinating office, because as a semi-governmental office, it had maintained all the records of all the Jewish communities in this part of Germany for the last 300 years.</span> <span id="s596">And the file room was filled with files that were going back to the 17th and 18th Century.</span> <span id="s597">I had to file current material onto files that consisted of an old piece of cardboard with a string at the bottom and a string at the top, and the bottom paper was yellow from 1670 or 1870 or whatever.</span> <span id="s598">And then the latest paper on top was 19-, and it all had to do with the same building or the same institution or the same hospital or the same school or the same community.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">LL: Did this job sustain you and your mother and brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">HF: Definitely, yeah.</span> <span id="s601">I was getting a reasonably nice salary.</span> <span id="s602">I don’t remember how much, but it was very helpful.</span> <span id="s603">And between renting our rooms and having the salary from there, this was, we, I don’t recall having any financial troubles, any financial problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">LL: And by this time it was 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">HF: 193-, this was November, 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">LL: Still 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">HF: Now, I started working there right around the 15th of November.</span> <span id="s608">[He must mean December, 1938.]</span> <span id="s609">We had to reconstruct all the records from this, from the burned- out synagogue.</span> <span id="s610">They had to reorganize themselves as an emigration office because by now it became obvious that you couldn’t stay in Germany and that everybody, and the people who applied for help at this office, or help with the American Consulate, help with emigration to any other country, were lining up in the morning between 7:30 and 8:00 from all over Germany.</span> <span id="s611">And when I came to the office I felt like a hero because here I was going past all these people who were snaking up the stairway and going, walking right in.</span> <span id="s612">And they wanted me to help them come into the office where they have an appointment.</span> <span id="s613">It was an ego building thing that was undeserving.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">LL: And did this office also handle the quotas...</span></p> <p><span id="s615">HF: No, the...</span></p> <p><span id="s616">LL: Or distribute quota numbers?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">HF: No, they...the quota numbers, the American Consulate was there to issue visas for entry in the United States for permanent residence.</span> <span id="s618">We had to learn the entire immigration law of the United States and we, that was one of the things we had to do every day, learn immigration laws of all the countries.</span> <span id="s619">Now the American immigration law provided for 27,000 Germans, people born in Germany, to come into the United States per annum.</span> <span id="s620">And so many, a much smaller number from Poland and much smaller number from Eastern Europe and a smaller number from Italy.</span> <span id="s621">But there was a quota for every country which, as you know, was based on the ethnic...</span></p> <p><span id="s622">LL: Proportions.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">HF: Proportions of what the United States was when the, so that the ethnic mix would not change in the United States by suddenly having too many Eastern or too many Southern or Balkan people.</span> <span id="s624">And the German quota was 27,000 people, and we had something like 360,000 applications.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">LL: But the quota numbers, were they not issued by the American Consulate?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">HF: They were issued by the American Consulate, not by the Oberrat.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">LL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">HF: And there were addition...</span></p> <p><span id="s629">LL: Did you work with the American Consulate?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">HF: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">LL: And did you work with any German authorities?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">HF: Gestapo, and Sicherheitsdienst, the S.D.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">LL: What was the role of the Gestapo in all this?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">HF: They had to validate that all the taxes were paid, that the people leaving had no criminal records, that they were not on any wanted lists, that all of their personal belongings had been surrendered, that they had clearance from everything else.</span> <span id="s635">There was bureaucratic red tape to the enth degree before someone would get the necessary clearances.</span> <span id="s636">They were needed from every sort.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">LL: And did people have to pay for the certification of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">HF: I don’t think so, no.</span> <span id="s639">I, the quota numbers were interesting.</span> <span id="s640">And I’m going to say this here because you’re putting it on tape.</span> <span id="s641">But it probably is public record anyway.</span> <span id="s642">The American Consulate would take an application that says, “I want to emigrate to the United States and I have relatives in the United States and I am filing this application today.”</span> <span id="s643">And if it was filed on the 12th of September, it got a number that was in line with that, up to that date.</span> <span id="s644">There were exceptions.</span> <span id="s645">The exceptions was that anyone who was a descendant of Lafayette, who was considered to have been very helpful in the Revolution in the United States, had preferential treatment.</span> <span id="s646">That’s in the law.</span> <span id="s647">And we manufactured a lot of descendants of Lafayette.</span> <span id="s648">He was a very profligate person!</span> <span id="s649">And we had...fairly good means of doing some of these things.</span> <span id="s650">That was what our job was.</span> <span id="s651">And finding ways in which to get people out of the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">LL: Lafayette was the only persona?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">HF: That is the only persona that, on record, whose descendants have carte blanche to come into the United States, if they can prove that they are descendants of Lafayette.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">LL: And how did you manage to prove it?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">HF: Don’t ask me.</span> <span id="s656">[chuckles] The other situation which we ran into a lot had to do with essays that children wrote in school.</span> <span id="s657">And we had children who had written as part of their education in grammar school or high school, they were oftentimes asked to write their wish list of what they would like to be and do in life.</span> <span id="s658">And some children wrote letters to President Roosevelt and said, “I would like to come to America.”</span> <span id="s659">And when such a letter was in the school, the school teacher—this can be back in 1926 or 192-, any time during the period from 19-, that I remember, when people went to school and were given these essays to do.</span> <span id="s660">If such an essay was written and the schoolteacher was inclined to do something with it, as part of the school program, they would put the letter in an envelope and send it to the White House in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">LL: Now wait a minute.</span> <span id="s662">You’re saying this is in the 1920’s?</span> <span id="s663">This...</span></p> <p><span id="s664">HF: Whenever.</span> <span id="s665">In other words we had...</span></p> <p><span id="s666">LL: But I mean, it wasn’t just Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s667">It was any president...</span></p> <p><span id="s668">HF: Any president, any...</span></p> <p><span id="s669">LL: Then in the White House.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">HF: Any president in the White, and to the President of the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">LL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">HF: If there’s someone as a child would write that.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">LL: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">HF: And if the letter was sent to Washington, the White House would generally send it on to the Immigration and Naturalization Office.</span> <span id="s675">And it would get a number there.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">LL: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">HF: And these numbers were valid.</span> <span id="s678">And they would say, and they would, these people would get a nice thank you letter.</span> <span id="s679">These children would get a nice thank you letter from the White House saying, “We are delighted that you want to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s680">Your interest in immigrating has been recorded under number such and such.”</span></p> <p><span id="s681">LL: And that was a quota number?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">HF: And that was a quota number, and it was transferred to the respective Consulate in Germany.</span> <span id="s683">So the Consulate in Stuttgart had the number of very low numbers, for certain people, many of them not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">LL: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">HF: But when we discovered that any were Jewish, we would notify them.</span> <span id="s686">And we had cases where the entire family came in, and the only person that got a visa was the son or the daughter who had written such a letter.</span> <span id="s687">And the parents had to wait.</span> <span id="s688">They couldn’t, they didn’t have the same number.</span> <span id="s689">And we had heartbreaks.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">LL: I would imagine so.</span> <span id="s691">This is something that I don’t think anyone has heard before.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">HF: No.</span> <span id="s693">This is...</span></p> <p><span id="s694">LL: Is this, it is known that...</span></p> <p><span id="s695">HF: It’s not, it was never...publicized, and nobody, the Consulate as I know now, was interested in keeping as many people out as they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">LL: Definitely.</span> <span id="s697">We know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">HF: So therefore they had medical examinations and they had other reasons for keeping people out.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">LL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">HF: And they had, they were looking for ways of keeping people out.</span> <span id="s701">But we discovered that there were, when we asked for the numbers, we needed to integrate the numbers that the Consulate had, (a) to find out which ones were Jewish and which ones were not and (b) if they were Jewish, could we find them?</span> <span id="s702">Because that was our job.</span> <span id="s703">And the Consulate cooperated with us on that.</span> <span id="s704">So when we saw these very early numbers of people who never left Germany, who just happened to have a low number, we tried to locate them.</span> <span id="s705">And that’s, some of the people got out that way, but they were mostly very young children, whose parents did not have the same low numbers.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">LL: Did, were you able to transfer any of the numbers assigned to non-Jews to Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">HF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">LL: No, you couldn’t do that.</span> <span id="s709">But you thought of it perhaps.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">HF: I don’t think so, no.</span> <span id="s711">We wouldn’t monkey with the Consulate.</span> <span id="s712">But we, what we tried to do, which was very difficult, is to settle the question of birth place.</span> <span id="s713">Because many people who were considered Germans, had a birth place that no longer was Germany—Danzig was not Germany—so if someone was a Jew in Danzig at the time when he was born, it was not Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">LL: And what did that mean as far...</span></p> <p><span id="s715">HF: They fell under the Polish quota.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">LL: Was that better or worse?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">HF: People, much worse.</span> <span id="s718">If they, much worse.</span> <span id="s719">Anyone whose residence changed countries, he was always considered to be born in the country that it was at the time of birth.</span> <span id="s720">So, it was, the numbers game was a horrendous game.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">LL: Tell me, when did you leave Germany?</span> <span id="s722">And not only that, please mention on which ship, what was your destination, and what was your impression when you arrived in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">HF: I’m going to go back in a minute for, because, since you explained a few other things to me before we started taping, I am working off memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">LL: Fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">HF: And as I say to you about the story of Lafayette, and the story of the school children writing numbers [letters], I know of specific cases.</span> <span id="s726">I do not know, it would require verification, in some way, shape or form, before you make this a final status report.</span> <span id="s727">Because I have never really re-checked it back, because I only knew of people who got these Lafayette quotas and I know of...a specific case where a child got through because I interviewed him.</span> <span id="s728">And he got through and his parents didn’t get through and it was based on an essay that he had written in school, in this case to President Roosevelt.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">LL: Please elaborate.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">HF: Well, I, before we make something on tape that becomes a historical fact, I would like to have, I will try to have this re-checked myself.</span> <span id="s731">I haven’t been in touch with Immigration and Naturalization.</span> <span id="s732">I don’t know the statute as it was about Lafayette.</span> <span id="s733">It was as it was told to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">LL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">HF: And as my people, I was not the, I was 15 years old.</span> <span id="s736">It was my superiors who did all this...work.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">LL: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">HF: So, before it becomes a fact on record, it needs to be verified.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">LL: O.K.</span> <span id="s740">We understand that.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">HF: I don’t want to go down in history books as the worst liar in...</span></p> <p><span id="s742">LL: Did you want to elaborate on this one case?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">HF: No.</span> <span id="s744">On the one case, it’s a very interesting case.</span> <span id="s745">This one case was a man who was a distant relative, his parents were distant relatives of mine.</span> <span id="s746">And Father and Mother, their name was Strauss.</span> <span id="s747">They had two children, a son and a daughter.</span> <span id="s748">And they were about a year apart.</span> <span id="s749">Helga and Sigmund, or Siegfried.</span> <span id="s750">Siegfried is the one who wrote the letter to President Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s751">And he had the letter which said that, “Your number is 1626,” whatever it was.</span> <span id="s752">And he applied.</span> <span id="s753">He had an affidavit from an American sponsor, and his family had affidavits and they had relatives here.</span> <span id="s754">And the parents applied for immigration and they got number 25,626—I don’t know the number, but they got a huge, a much, much later number than what the son had.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">LL: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">HF: And when they submitted their affidavit to the Consulate, the affidavit was for the whole family.</span> <span id="s757">And the family was called to the Consulate to examine them for eventual visas.</span> <span id="s758">And when it came to interviewing them the night before, the father took me aside and he said, “I have to make a confession.”</span> <span id="s759">Is this coming in?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">LL: Yes, just speak toward the mike.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">HF: “I have to make a confession and I want to tell this to you.</span> <span id="s762">My son is my son.</span> <span id="s763">But my daughter is not my daughter.</span> <span id="s764">I lost my wife in...” [tape ends] Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s765">LL: ...interview with Henry Froehlich.</span> <span id="s766">You were saying when these people were...</span></p> <p><span id="s767">HF: When these people...the night before they had to go to the Consulate the father confided to me that the son is his son but the daughter is not his daughter but is his wife’s daughter who was a widow and that when they now have to present the birth certificates in front of the Consul, the children might find out that they’re not brother and sister.</span> <span id="s768">And how do we handle this?</span> <span id="s769">Could I speak to the Consulate and tell them not to disclose this to the children?</span> <span id="s770">And the mother spoke to me in the same fashion and told me also the children don’t know this.</span> <span id="s771">The same evening, the son said could he speak to me alone?</span> <span id="s772">And he said, “My mother and father don’t know this, but I know she is not my sister.”</span> <span id="s773">And then the sister spoke to me and said the same thing, “My brother doesn’t know this and my parents don’t know this, but he is not my brother.”</span> <span id="s774">So we had a very interesting family situation.</span> <span id="s775">I got them all together and I told them, “You have no longer any more secrets.</span> <span id="s776">You know, you all know what’s what.</span> <span id="s777">As far as that concerns, you can go with good confidence to the Consulate.”</span> <span id="s778">They went to the Consulate the next day.</span> <span id="s779">The son had the low number as a result of having written to President Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s780">He was given a visa.</span> <span id="s781">He was told that he can leave and go to America and the parents were told to come back a year-and-a-half later.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">LL: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s783">HF: That’s the story of the numbers.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">LL: Did you ever follow up on this?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">HF: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s786">They’re all here.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">LL: They did manage to come out, thank God.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">HF: They did, they all came.</span> <span id="s789">They all managed to come.</span> <span id="s790">Yeah, they all managed to come out.</span> <span id="s791">The son became a very rich man.</span> <span id="s792">The daughter is, has been in touch with me from time to time.</span> <span id="s793">But the story was fascinating at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">LL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">HF: And it was fascinating to the Consulate.</span> <span id="s796">My work at the Oberrat and Consulate and the Immigration Services was fascinating and I was far, I had a position far beyond my age.</span> <span id="s797">And I became very emaciated as a result of the work there.</span> <span id="s798">And when my number came up and I was supposed to be coming before the Consulate for my visa, everybody knew me.</span> <span id="s799">I knew the Consulate, the Consuls and the Vice Consuls, and I had no problem, and no worry that I wouldn’t pass.</span> <span id="s800">Except for one thing.</span> <span id="s801">I had never told them about my crippled brother.</span> <span id="s802">And in fact, we never told anyone about my crippled brother, simply because that would have been the immediate excuse of having to look into the medical history of the family and finally reject me because there might be something hereditary.</span> <span id="s803">So we absolutely declared that we had only one brother, that we had a father who was killed, and then had a mother.</span> <span id="s804">And we made no information to the Consulate about my brother.</span> <span id="s805">And the time came in January that I was called to the Consulate to go there in February or in early March.</span> <span id="s806">And I think it was March the 5th that I was supposed to go to the Consulate.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">LL: This is 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s808">HF: 1940.</span> <span id="s809">I jumped into 1940 now.</span> <span id="s810">I had already been working for a whole year there, these two years, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">LL: In other words, you were working there...</span></p> <p><span id="s812">HF: For two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">LL: When the war had begun.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">HF: Oh yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s815">Jumping around a bit...shortly after the war began and when Poland was captured—I don’t know if you were in Germany at the time; no, you were gone—after Poland was captured and we had the big map on the Central Square in Stuttgart in front of the castle where they every day showed the position of the German Army and they showed how, then, all of a sudden, they announced by mail through our office—the Gestapo used our office to send a letter to all the Jewish families in Stuttgart—that they must turn in their radios.</span> <span id="s816">And the letter was sent out deliberately to arrive on Yom Kippur, 1939.</span> <span id="s817">And we had instructed, we had been instructed to send it out the day before Yom Kippur or two days before Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s818">And it was from the Gestapo and it said, “Because of the tendency of Jews to be helping the enemies of Germany, they cannot have any radios and they must surrender the radios on the Schlossplatz,”—it means on the main square in Stuttgart—“at 9:00 on Yom Kippur day.”</span> <span id="s819">On that day, which happened to be Yom Kippur.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">LL: Well, Yom Kippur was after the beginning of World War II.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">HF: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">LL: And by the way, there obviously were no services because the synagogue had been bombed.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">HF: No, we had services in makeshift classrooms and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">LL: Was it allowed or was that...</span></p> <p><span id="s825">HF: That was, there was no allowance needed.</span> <span id="s826">Services could be held.</span> <span id="s827">But the letter went out.</span> <span id="s828">We knew what the letter contained.</span> <span id="s829">We knew that it would arrive on Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s830">And we knew that the very Orthodox people would not go open the mail, let alone carry a radio downtown.</span> <span id="s831">To my absolute disgust, I was delegated to go to the Schlossplatz and see who shows up.</span> <span id="s832">Because we told people, “You don’t, you really, you maybe have a risk, but you don’t go.</span> <span id="s833">It’s Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s834">It’s your holiest day.</span> <span id="s835">You don’t go.</span> <span id="s836">You go the next day if you want to.”</span> <span id="s837">To my disgust, the most Orthodox people that I could think, look up to for Orthodoxy were the first ones fighting in line to turn their radios in.</span> <span id="s838">And it is an unhappy experience for me because from then on I dropped all interest in religion until many, many years later.</span> <span id="s839">It happened to be Yom Kippur day, and as a result of having seen what was going on there—and I did not take my radio in at the time—and as a result of having seen what was going on there, I became so un-Jewish and so upset that I went to a nearest restaurant and had something to eat on Yom Kippur, which I never did before!</span></p> <p><span id="s840">LL: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">HF: It’s an unhappy story to tell, but it’s...it has to be told.</span> <span id="s842">When I, when my day came in March to go to the visa, to go to the American Consulate, my people at the office said, “You’ll never pass.</span> <span id="s843">You’re too weak.</span> <span id="s844">You’re too emaciated.</span> <span id="s845">You must get some rest and some relaxation.</span> <span id="s846">And here, somebody has to feed you...something.”</span> <span id="s847">And there’s a home that the Oberrat owns, which is in Herrlingen near Ulm.</span> <span id="s848">Herrlingen is H-E-R-R-L-I-N-G-E-N, and Ulm is U-L-M.</span> <span id="s849">And that’s in, that has been made for this, used to be a school, a special school, for special education.</span> <span id="s850">It is a Landschulheim.</span> <span id="s851">I don’t want to spell that, but it’s, it was a special education...</span></p> <p><span id="s852">LL: A country school.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">HF: Well, a special, there was people interested in a special method of education who then transferred that entire school to England.</span> <span id="s854">Not just for Jewish children, but for general public.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">LL: It was a certain educational method.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">HF: Like Pestalozzi and people like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">LL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">HF: It was a certain teaching method.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">LL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">HF: And also it was teaching agriculture and the sciences and everything else, in a communal environment.</span> <span id="s861">And that school was very famous but it was evacuated completely and taken to England.</span> <span id="s862">And it became, it was owned by the Jewish community, by the Jewish Central Community, Oberrat, and we turned it into an old age home, for old age people.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">LL: For Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">HF: For Jewish people.</span> <span id="s865">That home was in an idyllic part of the country, and it was...</span></p> <p><span id="s866">LL: Good climate?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">HF: Excellent climate, and excellent caretakers there.</span> <span id="s868">Excellent kitchen, excellent surroundings.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">LL: In spite of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">HF: In spite of the war.</span> <span id="s871">The, they sent me there.</span> <span id="s872">They said, “You spend the time there.</span> <span id="s873">Forget about the Immigration Office.</span> <span id="s874">Forget about the Consulate.</span> <span id="s875">Eat, eat, eat.</span> <span id="s876">And make yourself healthy so that you’ll pass when you come up to the office.”</span> <span id="s877">I was there for four weeks, and I passed with flying colors.</span> <span id="s878">But the Herrlingen community entranced me and I became enchanted with the people there and the servants there.</span> <span id="s879">I became friendly with one of the girls who was a housekeeper there.</span> <span id="s880">And she is now one of the few survivors.</span> <span id="s881">All the people in that old age home were eventually transported to Auschwitz or to some other places where they were...</span></p> <p><span id="s882">LL: Theresienstadt, perhaps?</span></p> <p><span id="s883">HF: She went to Theresien-, this girl came to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s884">A few people went to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s885">Most of them were killed.</span> <span id="s886">And subsequent, when all of the people were gone from the home, the townspeople rummaged the home for all the belongings that were left there, and the German government seized the home and made it the home of General Rommel, when he was retired from the army.</span> <span id="s887">And he was in, already had been partly disgraced by Hitler because he was suspected to have been in on the July plot to kill Hitler.</span> <span id="s888">But they couldn’t easily tie any evidence to him.</span> <span id="s889">But he was put in that home, in that house, and it became his villa.</span> <span id="s890">And from there he was taken at one point by the visiting Generals who had accused him of being in on the plot.</span> <span id="s891">He was given the choice of committing suicide or going under trial, becoming, being tried for the attempt on Hitler’s life.</span> <span id="s892">They took him in to the forest and they gave him a pill and he came back.</span> <span id="s893">The ambulance had already been sent up there before the soldiers arrived, and they took him to Ulm.</span> <span id="s894">And in Ulm they examined him and he had died; he was reported of having died of a hemorrhage and got a State funeral.</span> <span id="s895">They promised him a State funeral if he commits suicide.</span> <span id="s896">I met some of the people that were witnesses to this afterwards.</span> <span id="s897">And I’ve been back to the town.</span> <span id="s898">And there is a historian who has been together with me wrote the history of this entire home, from the Landschulheim to the old age home to the Rommel situation and who has traced every Jewish person that was in that home, down to the last person, as to where they were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">LL: Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">HF: And I have helped find...</span></p> <p><span id="s901">LL: And you were one of those that survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">HF: And I and the young girl that was the housekeeper there are the survivors.</span> <span id="s903">Her husband was one of the people there that was a caretaker.</span> <span id="s904">He disguised himself as a Nazi and went to the nearest military camp, saluted the people there and said he came to collect potatoes and onions and vegetables and loaded the truck up and said, “Heil Hitler!”</span> <span id="s905">And everybody stood at attention and he loaded the truck up and took all the belongings for them, to keep feeding the Jewish people in the old age home!</span></p> <p><span id="s906">LL: Brave person.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">HF: Unfortunately he has been, he is very, very old now and very sick.</span> <span id="s908">But he also lives in Connecticut.</span> <span id="s909">And he was a very brave person, a very courageous person.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">LL: Yes, certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">HF: And she is one of the survivors.</span> <span id="s912">I am one of the survivors, and I helped the historian there to make this book project.</span> <span id="s913">And I was made a citizen of the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">LL: I see.</span> <span id="s915">Honorary citizen, yes?</span> <span id="s916">Now let’s get back to when you left Germany.</span> <span id="s917">On which ship did you come?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">HF: Well I’m, on the 28th of...I left on the 20th of, 22nd of March from Italy, from the Conte Dis-, on the Conte Di Savoya.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">LL: You went by train?</span></p> <p><span id="s920">HF: By train over the Brenner Pass.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">LL: From, was it a sealed train?</span> <span id="s922">Were there other Jews on that train?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">HF: No, no, no, no, no, a regular.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">LL: Just regular train.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">HF: A regular train from...Stuttgart over the Brenner Pass to Genoa on a regular ticket.</span> <span id="s926">And the train stopped at the Brenner Pass for four hours before it could cross the border.</span> <span id="s927">And then at that...</span></p> <p><span id="s928">LL: Were you nervous?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">HF: Very.</span> <span id="s930">And at the time after the train was let go again, the next day I was in Genoa.</span> <span id="s931">I saw it in the paper that Hitler and Mussolini were meeting that night on the Brenner Pass.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">LL: Oh my goodness!</span></p> <p><span id="s933">HF: That was causing the four-hour holdup.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">LL: And you were traveling alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">HF: Alone, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">LL: You left behind...?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">HF: My mother and my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">LL: Your younger brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s939">HF: No, my younger brother left four weeks before as a [on]children’s transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">LL: To?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">HF: To America, to Philadelphia.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">LL: I see.</span> <span id="s943">And your older brother and your mother were still in Stuttgart.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">HF: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">LL: O.K. And how did you find conditions here, and what was your impression?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">HF: I was met on the ship by my cousin of mine who had come here five years earlier who was working at some factory and who had helped get an affidavit for me from someone who was a very, very distant relative and who issued the affidavit on the condition that I would never lean on him and never want to see him.</span> <span id="s947">And I never saw him.</span> <span id="s948">I thanked him by mail and that is the only reason I’m here, because he issued the affidavit.</span> <span id="s949">My cousin lived in Queens.</span> <span id="s950">He already had a small apartment where every little bed was taken, and I got the bathtub as my first place to sleep in.</span> <span id="s951">And I spent the first four weeks with a little black book, where I had written all the names of people that I had helped in Stuttgart who had settled in New York.</span> <span id="s952">And I visited every one of them [weeping]...</span></p> <p><span id="s953">LL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">HF: To raise money for my mother.</span> <span id="s955">[weeping; tape off then on] My cousin still lives in Queens, and he tells me stories that I can’t believe to this day, but he was there.</span> <span id="s956">He said that I set out every morning to visit people whose addresses I had, and I told them I needed $390 for my mother’s ship ticket, to come because I, before I left I had arranged for the, with the Consulate that she would have a specific date on which she can come to the Consulate.</span> <span id="s957">And they set this specific date for May.</span> <span id="s958">And they promised me they would take good care of her.</span> <span id="s959">O.K., when I tried to raise the money, I found out that everybody was willing to give me two or three dollars...</span></p> <p><span id="s960">LL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">HF: If I needed it at the end.</span> <span id="s962">So after the first week I went to everybody back and I said, “I have $390.</span> <span id="s963">I need two dollars more.</span> <span id="s964">I need five dollars more.”</span> <span id="s965">[chuckling] And with that I raised the $392 dollars.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">LL: Did you really?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">HF: Yeah!</span></p> <p><span id="s968">LL: It’s amazing.</span> <span id="s969">What a very ingenious way of doing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">HF: Well there was no other way.</span> <span id="s971">Everybody was willing to give something if it’s the last dollar that I needed.</span> <span id="s972">Some people said, “I can get you ten dollars...if you’re short of ten dollars at the end, come to me.”</span> <span id="s973">I said, “I am short of ten dollars.”</span> <span id="s974">[chuckles] I paid them all back.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">LL: Yeah.</span> <span id="s976">And you, and so your mother was able...</span></p> <p><span id="s977">HF: Was able to come here.</span> <span id="s978">And before she left, she had to take care and find a home for my brother.</span> <span id="s979">And she found a Catholic Home for the Crippled Children and they took him in.</span> <span id="s980">That’s what she told me.</span> <span id="s981">And they put...</span></p> <p><span id="s982">LL: Did they know he was Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s983">HF: Oh yes, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">LL: But they took him in.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">HF: And they took him in.</span> <span id="s986">And then he was in this Catholic Home for Crippled Children.</span> <span id="s987">The address I don’t have.</span> <span id="s988">And by 1943, I had a chance conversation with William Schirer, who wrote a book about the Third Reich.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">LL: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s990">HF: And he told me about the euthanasia program, because we had no way of finding anything out about my brother.</span> <span id="s991">And he said, “There is no question that that’s what happened, to all the cripples, all the crippled people in Germany.”</span> <span id="s992">And he later on verified it all.</span> <span id="s993">But I have not found out to this day where it happened, and how it happened.</span> <span id="s994">My mother arrived in May, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s995">LL: Had you found a job by then?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">HF: By then I was already out of New York.</span> <span id="s997">I was, as soon as I had the money raised for my mother, I went to the employment people and they said that the best thing for me to do is to join a CCC Camp.</span> <span id="s998">It’s the Civilian Conservation Corps.</span> <span id="s999">Under Roosevelt there was a Civilian Conservation Corps in the United States and you could trade, you could learn a trade and get paid.</span> <span id="s1000">And the place for the Civilian Conservation Corps, I said, “I’d like to have a place outside New York.”</span> <span id="s1001">They said, “How is Berlin, New Hampshire?”</span> <span id="s1002">I said, “That’s fine.”</span> <span id="s1003">I’d never been to Berlin, Germany.</span> <span id="s1004">I might as well go to Berlin, New Hampshire.</span> <span id="s1005">And I went to Berlin, to New Hampshire, and I was housed in a house with about 40 other young men, all of whom were there to learn to become automobile mechanics.</span> <span id="s1006">And I did not know much English.</span> <span id="s1007">And I learned my first English there, a very colloquial English and very rough English, and roomed with a young fellow whose secret passion was to become an undertaker.</span> <span id="s1008">And he had a mummy in his room with me!</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">LL: As long as he didn’t mix the two of you up you were O.K.!</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">HF: That’s right!</span> <span id="s1011">Yeah, right!</span> <span id="s1012">But I did not last very long in Berlin, New Hampshire, because as I told you before, I was suspected of being a German spy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">LL: Explain that a little further.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">HF: Berlin, New Hampshire is very close to the Canadian border and the Jewish newspapers, there was a small Jewish community in Berlin and I tried to become acquainted with them because I was the first refugee they’d ever seen.</span> <span id="s1015">And they wanted to take good care of me and help me.</span> <span id="s1016">And then there was a whisper campaign going on, that some people had written in the papers that the Germans were trying to sneak their spies through the Canadian border into the United States disguised as Jewish refugees.</span> <span id="s1017">And I fit the pattern very easily because I also had a camera and I was taking pictures all over town.</span> <span id="s1018">So, they said I should prove to them that I am Jewish by reciting some Jewish prayers and going to synagogue and doing certain rituals, like laying tfillin.</span> <span id="s1019">And I couldn’t do that.</span> <span id="s1020">I didn’t remember it from my bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1021">I hadn’t done it since my bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1022">And they thought that for a German spy I wasn’t doing very badly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">LL: And this was in 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">HF: This was in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">LL: Before we came into the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">HF: Oh yeah, before we came into the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">LL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">HF: And they, one family there that had a store, general store, in Berlin, had a young man who was very sympathetic towards me and he said that he had a, his in-laws had a grocery store in Bethlehem, New Hampshire, and some other relatives had a hotel in Bethlehem, New Hampshire.</span> <span id="s1029">And that’s further away from the Canadian border and I don’t have any of the repercussions.</span> <span id="s1030">So I should try to go to Bethlehem.</span> <span id="s1031">He’ll give me a letter to his in-laws, and he’ll give me a job in a grocery store.</span> <span id="s1032">So I hiked my way out of Berlin, New Hampshire by way of the daily delivery bread truck who went to the grocery store.</span> <span id="s1033">And he delivered me to the grocery store.</span> <span id="s1034">And they had been informed that this greenhorn was coming in, and they should give him a job.</span> <span id="s1035">And I got the job and I made some extra money bell hopping at the hotel.</span> <span id="s1036">And I corresponded with my mother who was by then in Philadelphia, and my brother.</span> <span id="s1037">And they said that the situation was not very, very pretty.</span> <span id="s1038">My mother worked as a house, as a domestic in a house.</span> <span id="s1039">My brother was in a home for children where they were being properly fed, but used as laborers, doing car washing and other odds and end jobs to have more income for the house, for the people who took them in.</span> <span id="s1040">And it was not a very pleasant place for them to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">LL: How old was your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">HF: In 1940 he was 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">LL: He was not going to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">HF: He went...to school, I believe he went to school in Philadelphia, yes.</span> <span id="s1045">He must have gone to Philadelphia, this must have been after school.</span> <span id="s1046">He definitely went to school in Philadelphia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">LL: And your mother came to Philadelphia because he was already there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">HF: Because he was already there, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">LL: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">HF: And there were friends of friends of friends who gave her the job as a domestic...in a very nice home of some attorney firm, of an attorney who had a nice home in Germantown.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">LL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">HF: The Bethlehem situation was one whereby the town is open only for the summer.</span> <span id="s1053">It’s a resort town for the summer.</span> <span id="s1054">But, by September it closes up.</span> <span id="s1055">And I saved every penny I made in the store.</span> <span id="s1056">I learned a good deal of English.</span> <span id="s1057">I learned how to drive a car.</span> <span id="s1058">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">LL: How old were you by then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">HF: 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">LL: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">HF: 18.</span> <span id="s1063">There were people to whom I delivered groceries who lived in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s1064">And I saw their license plate with Pennsylvania and I made myself acquainted with them and they liked the idea that there was a refugee applying himself to all these things.</span> <span id="s1065">And I said, “I have to find a way of coming to Philadelphia when the season is over.”</span> <span id="s1066">And they said, “We’ll take you there.”</span> <span id="s1067">And they gave me a home when I first came here and the next thing I did, I found a job in Philadelphia in...a company that made photographic lights, on Arch Street.</span> <span id="s1068">And as soon as I made some money, we rented, I rented an apartment with, and brought my brother and my mother into the apartment and we were then, had started the beginning of a household.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">LL: And you were back to being a family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">HF: We went back to being a family, and that’s when I probably met Liesl Joseph, a little later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">LL: Did you feel strengthened in your experiences by religious faith after a while again, or by an ideology such as Zionism or Socialism or any such feelings?</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">HF: I definitely continued to feel Zionistic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">LL: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">HF: I felt very much that America is a way station to Israel, or to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1075">In Stuttgart I belonged to a youth group, called Hashomer Hatzair.</span> <span id="s1076">And this youth group was planning to move en masse, as a total group, to Palestine, with the intention of settling there and forming a kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1077">I was part of that, and I was planning to go with them.</span> <span id="s1078">The certificates that the English authorities issued for people coming to Palestine—I don’t know what they called them at the time; do you remember what they called those certificates?</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">LL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">HF: They were issued one certificate per family.</span> <span id="s1081">So if a person who was single was going to use up a certificate, we absolutely forbade them to go, we being the Oberrat.</span> <span id="s1082">We said, “You’ve got to get married and take somebody with you.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">LL: Ah, I see.</span> <span id="s1084">Even if those marriages would be dissolved again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">HF: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1086">So I was ready to get married to a very nice girl in Stuttgart, and so was everybody else in the group.</span> <span id="s1087">They were all going to use up half the number of certificates, to go as couples.</span> <span id="s1088">And at the last minute—this was before my father was killed—my father said, “No, you can’t go.</span> <span id="s1089">If you go to Palestine, there’ll be no chance for us to ever get any place else.”</span> <span id="s1090">You asked me about whether I believe in it.</span> <span id="s1091">I had a very, very fundamental faith in the sentence that became from my name, that was imbedded in me because of my name, Hans.</span> <span id="s1092">Everybody said, “Der Hans-derKann’s.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">LL: Which means?</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">HF: You can do.</span> <span id="s1095">You’re the can do person.</span> <span id="s1096">And I had an absolute strong faith in that I can do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">LL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">HF: That with optimistic belief in that it can be done.</span> <span id="s1099">And it has followed me all my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">LL: I want to thank you for a very interesting and informative interview.</span> <span id="s1101">Thank you very much.</span> <span
