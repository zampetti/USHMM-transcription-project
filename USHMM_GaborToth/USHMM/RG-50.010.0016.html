.</span> <span id="s8">January 17, 1920.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: How old were you at the time of the liberation of the camp?</span> <span id="s10">A: I was 25 at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: At that time, what were your vocational plans?</span> <span id="s12">What was your prospective profession?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: The Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: You had planned to make the military your career?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: Yes, when I initially joined the Army, I wanted to be a surgeon, but during the war I decided I'd also like to stay in the Amy

id="s18">Q: How long did you stay in the military?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: Twenty-one years.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: So you did follow up on your career plans.</span> <span id="s21">What military unit were you in at the time of the liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: I was the company commander of headquarters and service company of the 180th Engineer [unintelligible] battalion.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: And your rank?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: I was a Captain at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: You can tell me which camp or camps you liberated and whatever you want to tell me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: We really were involved in three particular incidents that would relate to your investigation.</span> <span id="s27">We had heard of these things as we were coming across Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: What had you heard?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: We had heard that there were these slave concentration camps where some of the people worked the factories.</span> <span id="s30">We had come through the Essen-Dortmund area in the Ruhr when we crossed the river.</span> <span id="s31">As we were getting on into Germany, we began to pick up rumors both from prisoners of war and from other intelligence areas that there were these concentra- tion camps where there were slave laborers and incarcerated persons, and that we were to be on the lookout for them so that military government teams could get food in to them and medicine and whatever they needed.</span> <span id="s32">And it wasn't until April that I observed any of these things first hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: April of 19....</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: ‘45.</span> <span id="s35">We had been bivouacked down at Gettinging, Germany for several days.</span> <span id="s36">I don't remember the exact dates.</span> <span id="s37">We left there and were sent north to Braunschweig, and it was there that I first saw the train loads of bodies.</span> <span id="s38">We were hit by some sniper fire in the middle of town and there were probably 20 or 30 carloads of bodies.</span> <span id="s39">Some artillery fire came in and blew the doors off of these trains and the bodies were stacked up, six or eight feet deep.</span> <span id="s40">What had happened was the Air Force had bombed the area and broken the rail line, and the German guards had just locked these DP's in the trains and took off.</span> <span id="s41">When we were going through, there was some sniper fire.</span> <span id="s42">I was going through on the advance because I normally picked out the bivouac areas for the unit and I was near this railway.</span> <span id="s43">I seem to recall that it ran right through the center of the town.</span> <span id="s44">Then some more artillery came in and blew the doors off.</span> <span id="s45">Some of these people were still alive, and, as near as we could tell, they had been in there between five and ten days without water and food and they were just skeletal individuals.</span> <span id="s46">Probably 98% of them were dead.</span> <span id="s47">But we weren't there long enough to do anything about it other than to send in a report that there were potentially some victims that were still alive there.</span> <span id="s48">From there we went on into the little town of Fallersleben, Germany, and there was a prisoner camp that supported the Volkswagen plant that built the Volkswagen for the German Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Do you remember the name of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: No, all I know is that it was at Fallersleben and it was right next to the Volkswagen factory.</span> <span id="s51">We were only there about 24 hours, but when we got there the German guards had run and the prisoners broke out of the camp.</span> <span id="s52">They broke open the arsenal, broke into the food stores, and a considerable number of them were dead just from eating raw flour.</span> <span id="s53">Near there there was a vermouth factory and they got into the vermouth.</span> <span id="s54">A military government came up.</span> <span id="s55">I don't recall its number.</span> <span id="s56">There was a major in command of it.</span> <span id="s57">He came to us and asked us if we could disarm some of these people.</span> <span id="s58">[He said] they had gotten drunk on the vermouth and they all had tommy guns and were just scattered over the countryside and were killing some of the German civilians.</span> <span id="s59">They set fire to several of the houses there and I think they did kill the town mayor.</span> <span id="s60">We got in around 2:00 or 3:00 in the afternoon and they asked us for help about 4:00 or 4:30.</span> <span id="s61">We spent most of that night trying to round these characters up and get these guns away from them.</span> <span id="s62">We had to disarm the German civilians; they were scared to death but we were under orders to pick up all the weapons there which we did.</span> <span id="s63">Then the next day we were ordered on out and we had to leave so how it all came out I don't know, but I can never forget that camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Let me ask you a couple of questions.</span> <span id="s65">One is, when you arrived, how long before had the guards left?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: To the best of my recollections, they had been there within 24 hours of the time we had gotten there; but as soon as they left, these prisoners broke out and got to that vermouth factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: You arrived within 24 hours of that point in time?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: I'd say yes because we were right on the point at that time; we were ordered up with the 5th Armored Division and the 102nd Infantry Division.</span> <span id="s69">We were going for the Elbe River.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: When you went to the camp, what did the prisoners do when they saw American troops coming in?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: They were not in good physical co ndition, but neither were they in extremely poor physical condition.</span> <span id="s72">I say extremely poor.</span> <span id="s73">The majority of them were on their feet.</span> <span id="s74">They were starved.</span> <span id="s75">There was no doubt about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: They looked malnourished?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: They were thin, emaciated.</span> <span id="s78">Those tha t died from eating this raw flour were very emaciated so I presumed that they must have been fairly well cared for while they were working in the factory; enough to keep them on their feet and yet starved enough so that they really weren't too able to resist.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: So they were pretty drunk at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s81">This was a problem that we had with DP’s from after we passed Hanover until we got to the Elbe River.</span> <span id="s82">There were a lot of vermouth factories in that area, and, as the Germans ran away, they seemed to go for it.</span> <span id="s83">We passed them all in [unintelligible] down the road.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Do you know anything about the particular population that was in that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: I was trying to recall.</span> <span id="s86">It seemed to me like it was somewhere between five and ten thousand.</span> <span id="s87">The factory was a pretty large factory.</span> <span id="s88">I really didn't have enough time to investigate much of anything while we were there because we were moving in and moving up.</span> <span id="s89">But the Volkswagen plant was a major builder of Volkswagens for the German Army at that time, so I would imagine the figure of 5,000 would probably be closer to it.</span> <span id="s90">I know that we rounded up at least three 2 1/2-ton truckloads of arms that we took from these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: From the displaced persons themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s93">Some of them were so drunk they'd stand on dikes or up on buildings and fire a gun and it'd knock them flat on their backs and we'd just walk up and take their gun away from them.</span> <span id="s94">We tried not to hurt any of them; we tried to round them up and get them back so the military government team could handle them, but I'd say that we met with only partial success.</span> <span id="s95">They had scattered all over that particular area.</span> <span id="s96">I imagine that we screened around a 5 to 6 mile radius of the camp itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: What were your feelings toward these drunk prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: There was a lot of compassion for them, but there was little that we could do personally or individually.</span> <span id="s99">I felt very deeply toward them, but our job at that time was still fighting.</span> <span id="s100">That was my primary mission.</span> <span id="s101">The military government teams were the ones that had to pick up the humanitarian work for us.</span> <span id="s102">They were the ones who went in and settled these areas after we had taken them in fighting.</span> <span id="s103">I was with the forward elements at that time.</span> <span id="s104">And you didn’t have much time to think of compassion then.</span> <span id="s105">It was a method of self-survival, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: And then you went on to another camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: It wasn’t a camp.</span> <span id="s108">Let me show you on this map here.</span> <span id="s109">In blue, this is the area, the actual roads that I traveled.</span> <span id="s110">When we left Fallersleben we were ordered north to Ousterburg, which is just off the Elbe River.</span> <span id="s111">As we hit this town of Klotz, there were a lot of Germans in the area to the east of it and there was another road that bypassed in there that doesn't show on this map.</span> <span id="s112">We could not go through that road because the Germans were there, and we saw fire back in the distance, back to the southeast toward this town of Gardelegen.</span> <span id="s113">There was a lot of machine gun fire and some tank fire.</span> <span id="s114">So we went on north up to another intersection and again there were Germans to the south of us.</span> <span id="s115">We had again to divert north and come across this road and finally get into Ousterburg, where there were some elements of the 5th Armored.</span> <span id="s116">Right after we had passed, there was a German counterattack that cut us off and we were in there with the 5th and the 102nd.</span> <span id="s117">A combat team of the 5th went back and they got into a tank fight at Klotz.</span> <span id="s118">In the meantime, we started to investigate what this fire was, and we found out.</span> <span id="s119">Those are the pictures I have.</span> <span id="s120">There were probably 500 to a 1,000 DP's that were being evacuated back from the interior of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Do you know where they were being evacuated to?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: No, we never did find out.</span> <span id="s123">They were herded into a barn and there was a 16 year old Nazi who got on the roof and poured gasoline onto them, and they set up machine guns outside it for when they tried to....</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: It's difficult to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: They machine gunned them when they tried to get out.</span> <span id="s126">[voice breaking at this point] That's all I had.</span> <span id="s127">My photographer took those pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: It's pretty gruesome.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Somebody took some of them.</span> <span id="s130">I had some close-ups of where under the edges of the wall you can see, on this picture of the warehouse, they tried to dig out and some of them were caught.</span> <span id="s131">They had gotten their heads outside, and the Germans machine gunned them.</span> <span id="s132">This is the kind of thing I could see no reason for.</span> <span id="s133">It was my understanding that most of these people were French, Lithuanians, Polish, Czechs.</span> <span id="s134">I think a few Jewish people were involved.</span> <span id="s135">But they had been in a camp, and apparently this SS unit was moving them, and when we hit Klotz there was no way that they could get them on wherever they were going.</span> <span id="s136">So they just decided to eliminate them.</span> <span id="s137">This report was given in to Corps and I know we sent the photographs on forward.</span> <span id="s138">I had my own company photographer and I sent him over and we took these pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Even talking about it today, it still seems to bother you.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: That kind of stuff you never get used to.</span> <span id="s141">We moved in on Ousterburg, and these pictures were taken the day after.</span> <span id="s142">We were in Ousterburg about 3 days or 4 days before President Roosevelt died.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: So that pinpoints it pretty close.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: That's as near as I can get it at this late date.</span> <span id="s145">Unfortunately, it was after the war when I started putting these pictures in and I didn't have the dates.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: That's close enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: These are the little things that I think people don't realize can happen, but it did.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: It did.</span> <span id="s149">Earlier you had told me about having heard about the camps as you were coming across Germany.</span> <span id="s150">Did you expect anything like this?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: I never expected anything like that.</span> <span id="s152">I expected people to be in a prison but not starved to death or beaten or in the condition that we saw them.</span> <span id="s153">That was something that was beyond your imagination.</span> <span id="s154">We were used to seeing dead people.</span> <span id="s155">Dead people are one thing, but people who are alive and yet they're dead is something that is almost beyond earth, at least beyond my imagination.</span> <span id="s156">I later saw much more in the Orient, but nothing like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Did you have any difficulty after this experience with any nightmares?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: I was pretty uncomfortable for a couple of years after the war.</span> <span id="s159">I couldn't talk much about it.</span> <span id="s160">I didn't used to talk much about it the first year or two, and gradually over the years, I loosened up a little bit.</span> <span id="s161">Every once in a while, I sit down and look at these and feel how lucky we are that we got</span></p> <p><span id="s162">out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Did any of these other soldiers in your unit talk about this at all while you were still there?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: They were pretty incensed about it right after it happened.</span> <span id="s165">As a matter of fact, they went out looking for the kid.</span> <span id="s166">I think the 5th Armored picked him up -- the one who set the gasoline on fire.</span> <span id="s167">The war ended then on May 8th, so we were there in that area about two weeks.</span> <span id="s168">My soldiers were pretty hard-nosed by then, and yet they were not unkind to the German prisoners that we picked up and we were picking them up by the truckload every hour at that time.</span> <span id="s169">We were living in Ousterburg, but up on the river at Sandau our job was to try and keep them [the German prisoners] from crossing the river to get away from the Russians, and we were having units as large as a regiment drive up and swim the river and fall in and surrender to the first soldier.</span> <span id="s170">My GI's didn't have any malice toward the Wehrmacht soldiers we picked up.</span> <span id="s171">They were not quite so kindly toward the SS troops, because this was done by an SS unit.</span> <span id="s172">I had a couple in there who had no sympathy with an “SSer” at all.</span> <span id="s173">We had fought them all the way across, and they had had some bad times from them and so they never were too sympathetic toward “SSers.”</span> <span id="s174">But there was no undue animosity toward regular Wehrmacht soldiers.</span> <span id="s175">They treated them under the Geneva Convention.</span> <span id="s176">I presume there were some incidents where they weren't treated under it but I didn't witness it.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Did you have any specific orders concerning treatment of the SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: No.</span> <span id="s179">Any enemy in uniform was to be treated under the articles of the Geneva Convention.</span> <span id="s180">This was a thing that we continually reminded our men.</span> <span id="s181">Non-fraternization with any German was in full effect at that time.</span> <span id="s182">We very closely adhered to that.</span> <span id="s183">They were not allowed to sit down in our presence.</span> <span id="s184">We were not allowed to fraternize with them in any way.</span> <span id="s185">[We could] speak with them only in the line of our duty, whatever that</span></p> <p><span id="s186">happened to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: What were your feelings about these SS officers that you saw after this incident?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: I had a great admiration for all the German officers, whether they wore an SS uniform or not.</span> <span id="s189">I think that any officer corps of any army is going to have some bad apples in it.</span> <span id="s190">It may be that these officers were taken advantage of, the same as sometimes American officers are taken advantage of by some of their enlisted men.</span> <span id="s191">Somebody may have panicked.</span> <span id="s192">We don't know what happened because we weren't there until after it was all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: I'm not sure I understand what you meant by taken advantage of.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Sometimes a non-com will do something and an officer will either ignore it or the non-com might think he is doing right while the officer knows that what he has done is dead wrong.</span> <span id="s195">But if he's a good non-com, normally that officer is not going to burn him over a mistake.</span> <span id="s196">You can't afford to.</span> <span id="s197">It's a peculiar thing.</span> <span id="s198">Sometimes you may not observe some things that happen.</span> <span id="s199">You may hear about it later.</span> <span id="s200">By the time you hear about it, it's too late to do anything and they are going to cover up anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: You're thinking that maybe that's what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: I'm thinking this may have happened in this incident.</span> <span id="s203">I don't know.</span> <span id="s204">Who ordered the 16 year old to throw the gas on them?</span> <span id="s205">Who ordered the machine gun set up to try to kill them if they tried to get out?</span> <span id="s206">I don't know whether it was a non-com or an officer.</span> <span id="s207">All we know is that somebody either panicked or told them to.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: But you know for sure it happened?</span> <span id="s209">A: Yes, that's petty evident.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: You talked about not talking about this for a long time.</span> <span id="s211">Right after the incident happened, you didn't talk with any of your men?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Most of our officers went over to see it.</span> <span id="s213">We all knew it had happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">We turned the information over.</span> <span id="s215">Most of this was handled by the Operations and Intelligence Officer of the unit, and whether or not the 5th Armored was the one that ran the report on it into Corps or the 102nd Division, all three of us were there and we were only a small battalion just attached for river crossing operation.</span> <span id="s216">What we did discuss in regard to it for several days was that we were just horrified that a thing like this had happened.</span> <span id="s217">And, as I said, had they caught the perpetrators of it and specifically known it, I imagine they would have killed them outright.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Feelings ran pretty high.</span> <span id="s219">We had to sit there and smell it for a week.</span> <span id="s220">Dead, burned bodies are not the most pleasant smell in the world - it's one you never forget.</span> <span id="s221">I think this is one reason why I just didn't care to discuss it for a couple of years after it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: You say you and some of your follow officers did talk about it right then?</span> <span id="s223">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Do you remember some of the kinds of things you talked about?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: First, we couldn't understand why people would do this kind of thing.</span> <span id="s226">I mean, why kill these people just because they were caught in a trap, that we had penetrated them and there was no getting away with it.</span> <span id="s227">We didn't know whether or not they might have done something worse some place else and they were destroying the evidence of what had happened, but it was just a wonderment as to why a thing like this would occur.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: It seems so senseless.</span> <span id="s229">A: It’s ridiculous.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Now you said that as time went on you began to talk about it from time to time?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: What prompted that?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s234">I guess after two years of fighting in a war, you initially don't want to talk about it at all and then I guess people keep asking you questions and wanting to know.</span> <span id="s235">Finally you just loosen up and begin to talk about it a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Do you think it is important that your wife and your children know about these kinds of things?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: They know.</span> <span id="s238">We were in Korea when that war started, too.</span> <span id="s239">She was on the boat that evacuated out with three babies.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: I’m making a distinction between....</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: My children are fascinated by this book.</span> <span id="s242">Every once in a while they will get it out and they'll want me to explain it to them again, and I have no hesitation in doing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: I feel that they should understand t hat these things happened, that often times things happen that we have no control over and we have to live with it.</span> <span id="s245">Every once in a while, they will bring one of their friends in and ask me to show them, which I have done.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: What do you think people can learn from this kind of thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: I would hope that they could learn a lot of compassion and a great amount of love for your fellow man.</span> <span id="s248">Whether or not they do depends on how they accept it.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Did you watch the Holocaust TV show?</span> <span id="s250">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: What did you think of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: I thought that was a great movie.</span> <span id="s253">I thought everybody should have been able to see it.</span> <span id="s254">Yes, my wife and I were very, very interested in it.</span> <span id="s255">I thought it was well presented.</span> <span id="s256">There were one or two little technical things I noticed at the time, but it didn't detract a bit from what the story was.</span> <span id="s257">I had recalled many different incidents as we went through the Bulge and other places where we saw evidence of the Jew-baiting that was done by the Hitlerites.</span> <span id="s258">I saw evidence of the underground and some of their retaliation, like writing [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s259">I think I have a picture some place of one of those buildings where that was written on.</span> <span id="s260">We billeted with some people in Tongeren, Belgium who told us a little bit while we were there of how life had been under the Germans and the Gaulletiers over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Anything specific from these people that you would like to share with us?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Mainly, they talked about the difficulty of visiting and associating with their friends, of various shortages of food, of the treatment of their Jewish friends by the Germans, how they were awakened and deported away in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s263">This sort of thing.</span> <span id="s264">Almost right back to your Holocaust story.</span> <span id="s265">That’s a very, very good description of what I heard from them.</span> <span id="s266">By the same token, I billeted with a family of a German soldier in the town of Filstraf, just east of Metz, before the Bulge happened, and those people mentioned that some of the stories that were being told about the actions of the German soldiers they found hard to believe themselves.</span> <span id="s267">As a matter of fact, one family we stayed with had a son who was a lieutenant in the German Wehrmacht, and we were billeted with them for about a week right on the German/Alsace-Lorraine border.</span> <span id="s268">They were no different than the average American family, really.</span> <span id="s269">They had a son that was in the service because he had been called to serve his country.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: And they were saying it was hard to believe?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Some of the things that had come out during the war were hard for them to believe had happened.</span> <span id="s272">Their communications, I guess, weren't great as far as really knowing what was going on.</span> <span id="s273">I think probably they were limited in what they were told.</span> <span id="s274">But parents are always more loyal to their own children, so we don’t know.</span> <span id="s275">Maybe their son is a fine, upstanding officer doing his duty, which is all he was supposed to be doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Is there anything else about your contact with the German people that you think you might want to share with us?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: I had very little contact with them.</span> <span id="s278">The only other thing that I know, the only one that made me furious enough to want to personally kill was a man who had been a taxi driver in Chicago for 16 years and had gone back to Germany.</span> <span id="s279">When I was getting ready to move our equipment back to France, I had to go to this rail head and this guy was working for the German national railway.</span> <span id="s280">He was a smart-mouth, and I could call him an overbearing Kraut.</span> <span id="s281">He kept bragging about all of his knowledge of the</span></p> <p><span id="s282">U.S. I finally just about lost my patience with him and I told him if he didn’t shut up and interpret what I was telling him to interpret, I was going to kill him.</span> <span id="s283">And he straightened out and I got my stuff moved out, but he was one of the most irritating people that I had met.</span> <span id="s284">People that I spoke with primarily were either prisoners we had taken or the town mayor.</span> <span id="s285">When we got into a new town, I usually would go to the town mayor and get him to round up all of the weapons, which we were under orders to pick up and turn into ordnance.</span> <span id="s286">Again, most of those officials, to my recollection, were no different that an official in one of our own</span></p> <p><span id="s287">towns or cities.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: They had nothing to say about the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Very few of them seemed to know what was going on.</span> <span id="s290">In Fallersleben I talked to some people there in the town hall and they weren't too aware of what was going on out at the camp.</span> <span id="s291">The only thing they were aware of was that the people were out and drunk and killing everybody and setting fire to buildings.</span> <span id="s292">They were in dire fear of their lives and, as I said, I understood.</span> <span id="s293">It seems to me like they said that the mayor and his wife and family were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: The POW’s killed them?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s296">Those prisoners that had been there drunk and they set fire to several homes.</span> <span id="s297">Whether or not they had killed the occupants I don’t know.</span> <span id="s298">I don't recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Before we leave that and go on to another section, I want to ask you if you can describe the camp at Fallersleben?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: There is very little that I can describe of it.</span> <span id="s301">I was only in it when we first got there.</span> <span id="s302">As I recall, we went through a gate, and to the left there was a kind of office building or guardhouse, and just beyond that was a warehouse where they had their food stores.</span> <span id="s303">There were several bodies laying out there and the flour sacks were torn open and laying all over the ground.</span> <span id="s304">These people had flour all over their faces.</span> <span id="s305">Then there was another building.</span> <span id="s306">I don't know whether it was the arsenal or guardhouse or what.</span> <span id="s307">Then there were some of these shacks with the wooden rack beds on them.</span> <span id="s308">I don't remember how many there were or their exact location, but all I can remember seeing really clearly is that warehouse with the flour and the people with their mouths full of it, who had suffocated on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Everything else sort of became unimportant.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: There was a gate in that buildin g, the warehouse, another building -- apparently sleeping quarters.</span> <span id="s311">That's all I can remember.</span> <span id="s312">The Volkswagen plant across was a 2 or 3 story red-brick building.</span> <span id="s313">I remember that.</span> <span id="s314">That’s the best I can do.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: That's very good.</span> <span id="s316">That's a very descriptive thing that you had to say about what you really remember, that one part.</span> <span id="s317">Did you consider yourself a religious person at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: I would have to say yes, but probably not as religious as I feel now.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: When you went into the camp and saw this sight that you just described, did you have any conscious thoughts about God or religion at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s321">At that time, with drunks out there shooting machine guns, you think of God before this happens.</span> <span id="s322">When it's actually happening, you’re back to why you do everything over and over in training.</span> <span id="s323">It's automatic then.</span> <span id="s324">Every time we got ready to move up, we normally had the chaplains in and we made our peace with God before we moved because we didn't know what was going to happen two minutes after we moved out.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: You say you feel that you are more religious now than you were at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: Do you think this experience had anything to do with it?</span> <span id="s328">A: I think it had a lot to do with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Do you want to share something about that with me?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: As I said before, I think that seeing things like this makes you a little more fully understanding of the necessity for love and compassion.</span> <span id="s331">And the more you think about it, as you grow older, the more vivid this thought becomes to you.</span> <span id="s332">And you get to a point that the more you see of this kind of fighting and this kind of suffering and everything, the more you begin thinking about your God.</span> <span id="s333">After I went through Korea, I really felt that I got to know God a lot closer.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: I'm going to turn this tape over and then we'll do the rest on the other side.</span> <span id="s335">[End of tape.</span> <span id="s336">Conversation continues on new tape as follows.]</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: I don't believe it has.</span> <span id="s338">I don’t believe the Korean War -- although I was pretty well involved in that for a while -- or the Viet Nam thing or what is really happening now affects my political opinion.</span> <span id="s339">I think that it does affect my feelings toward morality and, possibly, religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: More so than political.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: More so than politically.</span> <span id="s342">I don't agree with a lot of the political decisions that are made.</span> <span id="s343">I think they’re stupid, but neither do I disagree completely with some of them.</span> <span id="s344">I just can’t correlate fighting and politics, although I know that they are intertwined.</span> <span id="s345">The way I've always looked at the job as an Army officer is that if the boss says go do it, then you do your best.</span> <span id="s346">I may not agree with the boss, but this is what he says, that’s what you do.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: From what you know about what happened in Nazi Germany, what would you say to one of your children if he said to you that he wanted to be a Nazi?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: I think I’d be giving him a number of good reasons why not to be.</span> <span id="s349">Q: Such as?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: In the first place, I think the first thing you have to do is have the respect for human life.</span> <span id="s351">I don' t believe that a real deep, dyed-in-the-wool Nazi ever had such a respect.</span> <span id="s352">I think that an individual’s right to do what we are allowed to do under our freedom here in the U.S. is the most precious thing there is.</span> <span id="s353">They didn't have this in Nazi Germany.</span> <span id="s354">They were dictated to in practically everything they did.</span> <span id="s355">A lot of the people over there might not say they lived under that severe a dictatorship, and many of the non-Nazis who existed over there might not have felt they were under too severe a dictatorship, but when you begin to really examine the depth of their freedom, it was pretty shallow.</span> <span id="s356">They didn't realize it.</span> <span id="s357">A lot of it probably depended upon the attitude of the local Gaullitiers in the different areas.</span> <span id="s358">Some of them were strong Nazis, others were weak, and others were just fence-rider types.</span> <span id="s359">It also probably depended on what type of production work was affecting a certain area, where they might be more stringent than in other rural areas, for instance.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: What else would you tell your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: I could recite to them a little bit about the attitudes of the people.</span> <span id="s362">I think I could also work on them in so far as their own personal beliefs and strengths.</span> <span id="s363">I think the rise of the Nazis, to a great degree, was contingent on the weaknesses of some of the other world leaders that let them get away with things that they never should have.</span> <span id="s364">I think this is the thing that is important to be pointed out to them.</span> <span id="s365">I think that many of the world leaders at that time were either pacifists or frightened, but I think there were quite a number of the more influential ones that just didn't want to make a decision.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Do you see this thing that happened in Germany, in relation to the camps and killing of people, as primarily a Jewish persecution?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: No, I think that probably you would put it on a percentage basis that it was higher in that, but here there were very few Jewish among them.</span> <span id="s368">They were importing from all occupied areas people who they felt could do their slave work.</span> <span id="s369">They even were taking Russian prisoners and inducting them into the Army.</span> <span id="s370">Some of the first dead I saw in Normandy after D-Day were Asians -- Mongolians -- who had been with the Russian Amy and had been captured and the Germans offered them all the looting and shooting they wanted and they'd feed and clothe them if they would fight for them.</span> <span id="s371">So it was real weird.</span> <span id="s372">I remember some of the troops saying, "I didn't know we were fighting the damn Japs over here."</span> <span id="s373">They didn't realize that these guys were Russian Mongolians.</span> <span id="s374">Some of these were almost black, Negroid looking Mongolians we fought.</span> <span id="s375">And they had quite a number of them in the Normandy area.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: So from your perspective, you didn’t see the prisoners that you saw at the camps as predominantly Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: No.</span> <span id="s378">Most of them that I had occasion to see probably were not.</span> <span id="s379">Now those dead in the trains may have been.</span> <span id="s380">They may have been transporting them to Dachau or some place else, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s381">But this group here I know was practically all ethnic nationalities.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: One last question.</span> <span id="s383">Do you feel a need to do something today to make sure that something like this never happens again?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: I do, but I certainly wouldn't know what it would be.</span> <span id="s385">It’s difficult to say, but when you get involved in a conflict like this, it's difficult to say what will or what can happen.</span> <span id="s386">Things can happen so fast that you react with an instinct.</span> <span id="s387">So I would say that it would go back to the way you are trained to do your job.</span> <span id="s388">If you basically have good, clean thinking action drilled into you time and time again, that is the way you are going to react under stress.</span> <span id="s389">If it's not drilled into you that way, then how are you going to react?</span> <span id="s390">Do you get what I'm trying to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Ninety-eight per cent of what a soldier does is because he has repeatedly done the same thing over and over.</span> <span id="s393">He doesn't even have to think about it.</span> <span id="s394">So if his basic thoughts are proper, there shouldn't be these sorts of things happening, in spite of the fact that you, you might say, can be trained to a keen edge, that there may be some trigger that can go wrong and the thing will happen that an individual might over react.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: You have difficulty believing that anything like this could have been done by orders.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: I do.</span> <span id="s397">I really do.</span> <span id="s398">The more I've thought about it over the years the more I think somebody just panicked.</span> <span id="s399">They may have done something wrong with those people before.</span> <span id="s400">A couple of the prisoners that we interviewed indicated that they had been told that the Americans showed no mercy to troops who were involved in this sort of work.</span> <span id="s401">I talked to one lieutenant that came out of a unit that had been in Berlin.</span> <span id="s402">He came up at Sandau when we crossed the river.</span> <span id="s403">He was a good looking young soldier, first lieutenant.</span> <span id="s404">I don t remember what unit he said he was in.</span> <span id="s405">But he told me that one of the things that their propaganda people had told them was that the Americans had absolutely no mercy with German soldiers who had handled or guarded or taken care of any of these displaced persons.</span> <span id="s406">So maybe it was out of fear of this when they knew that Americans were coming in and had cut them off at Klotz.</span> <span id="s407">They figured, well, they are going to kill us anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: So maybe they should got rid of the evidence.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: In thirty years it hadn't crossed my mind again, but this recalled that one incident.</span> <span id="s410">Generally, I don't know really what could be done.</span> <span id="s411">Things can trigger off so fast.</span> <span id="s412">You try not to think about these things; you try not to think about what can happen.</span> <span id="s413">Your major job is to keep your unit alive and yourself alive and, based on whatever occurs, you take an action from that point, whether it's right or wrong; I don't know.</span> <span id="s414">You recall that Mai Lai incident.</span> <span id="s415">I don't know what happened over there; maybe he flipped.</span> <span id="s416">I could imagine a dozen different ways that thing could have happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: You thought about that in the same kind of puzzle that you have thought about this incident.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s419">I mean a lot of times, if you’re under a heavy tension and you go into an area, you know that there are people in there that are going to be shooting at you.</span> <span id="s420">I’ve see it almost happen where maybe one follow would step on a stick and break it and everybody would start shooting.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: For no reason.</span> <span id="s423">You're just keyed up to that point, and something like that could have happened; I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Have you read very much about what's been written since the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s426">I read all the time.</span> <span id="s427">I've got a whole library down there - everything from World War I on through today.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Is it difficult for you to believe some of the things that have been written about what went on in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: No.</span> <span id="s430">I read The House of Krupp; I don't know whether you have read that.</span> <span id="s431">Q: I'm familiar with it, but I haven't read it.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: That's an excellent book.</span> <span id="s433">He pretty well outlines his involvement.</span> <span id="s434">I read a lot of Tolbert, books by [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s435">I enjoy history very much.</span> <span id="s436">I'm currently reading five, but I've got about eight that I haven't read yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Reading five at the same time?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: I get involved in one, and I get half through it and I start another one.</span> <span id="s439">Q: I'm going to say thank you for this for the tape and turn it off.</span></p></body></html>
