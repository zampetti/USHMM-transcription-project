Now, it is Istanbul.</span> <span id="s16">It was Constanilopal.</span> <span id="s17">It was a very exciting time and I will never forget it, even so I was very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q.</span> <span id="s19">When you came back to Budapest, what did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A. Well, he went back again and he worked in textiles.</span> <span id="s21">Not on his own, but it went.</span> <span id="s22">I can't even remember it.</span> <span id="s23">It was a very tough time, quite a tough time.</span> <span id="s24">But honestly we did not feel anti-semitism as other countries because my father himself he had so, so many Christian friends and we never heard "Hey, you're a Jew because your name is Mandle."</span> <span id="s25">Nothing, and I was growing up in a Protestant school and I was the only Jewish child for four years, the first four years and the Hebrew and Judaism I learned from my Protestant teacher.</span> <span id="s26">It was very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q. Was there any anti-semitism going on in the city directed at your friends, anything you heard on the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A. Not then, you see this was still before Hitler, in the 30s and I constantly traveled and my last trip -- or my first trip alone was to go to Berlin, the olympic games in 1936 and of course Hitler and Goebles and everybody was there.</span> <span id="s29">I was supposed to go the year before because I had dear friends there who thank God I saved, but it's a long story not for you maybe and I was supposed to go as my graduation present and I got scarlet fever so I couldn't go.</span> <span id="s30">So, they said then you come over for the olympics and during the olympics Hitler did not do anything to the Jews.</span> <span id="s31">They even had still a Jewish tennis club, where my friends belongs.</span> <span id="s32">It was interesting, and I saw Jesse Owens, flying by, flying, not just running, you know, he won, and he gave the dirtiest look up to Gerring, to show that me, the black man, I'm going to win, and he sure did.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">So, that was my last time over there, but then I started to travel and I was going to England, to Italy, I'm a Montessori teacher and I learned from Mother Montessori herself in 1937, before she died in Rome, so I was a whole year in Rome, which was absolutely wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Then I went to England and I lived there for a year.</span> <span id="s35">Then I went back to Switzerland because I have a big family, and I also wanted to learn French.</span> <span id="s36">I was a house -- how do you call them here, too?</span> <span id="s37">I was helping in the house with two children in the house, but they were wonderful with me.</span> <span id="s38">They became good friends and I lived in Geneva until 1942 when very dear friends of our said, "go home, nothing is going to happen in Hungary and you're the only child and be home."</span> <span id="s39">I went home.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q. Were you hearing anything about what was going on in the rest of Europe even if it wasn't directed --?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A. Well, I tell you, I was not a zionist and I"m still not but there was a zionist congress in Geneva in 1939, in September and to relax most of the people were Polish and they were all out on the bach and one day on the ninth of September, the radio was blaring that Hitler moved into Poland and I will never forget, that was in my book too, you probably read it, it was horrifying to see the faces of these people and whether their family is still alive by the time they go home, whether they can go home at all.</span> <span id="s42">I was standing there and I said oh my God if I could just help.</span> <span id="s43">I never thought the time will come that I was going to help.</span> <span id="s44">I couldn't believe it that this can happen.</span> <span id="s45">None of us believed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">When I came back to Hungary they still showed American films in 1942, and I was teaching English at that time.</span> <span id="s47">I spoke the King's English, really without an accent.</span> <span id="s48">Everybody thought I was a British lassie, and we were forbidden to talk English on the street, but we could say that we were foreigners.</span> <span id="s49">I was teaching Congressmen Lantosh's wife.</span> <span id="s50">She was nine years old and she looked like Shirley Temple and I was teaching her English.</span> <span id="s51">Then suddenly from Romania, from Czechoslovakia, from Poland people escaped to Hungary and they told us all these stories.</span> <span id="s52">We didn't believe either that it was possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">It's funny that you don't believe.</span> <span id="s54">Why don't you believe?</span> <span id="s55">We should have and we could have all stood up for it, but we just couldn't imagine.</span> <span id="s56">So, our house was really full constantly with Rumanians or Czechoslovakians who somehow we knew from the old times.</span> <span id="s57">They came to our house, those who very few of them could go on somewhere else, but most of them got stuck in Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q.</span> <span id="s59">What were they telling you that you couldn't believe?</span> <span id="s60">What were some of the things that you couldn't believe?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A.</span> <span id="s62">That they just walked in and took their house away.</span> <span id="s63">They killed some of their families and that they had no rights anymore.</span> <span id="s64">There were no people anymore and they had to wear the yellow star, what they took off as they came to Hungary.</span> <span id="s65">But it was unbelievable that anybody can come to your house and say get out.</span> <span id="s66">Something you worked all your life for.</span> <span id="s67">In America, too, I think nobody ever believed that Hitler was doing things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q.</span> <span id="s69">Did you talk to your parents about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A. Not really.</span> <span id="s71">No, we didn't.</span> <span id="s72">We didn't have the stars yet, because the Hungarian Nazis weren't yet there, and they came in '43 and then my father was taken to a labor camp and we were frantic but one of his Christian friends went and brought him right back.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q. Tell me about that?</span> <span id="s74">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A.</span> <span id="s76">We don't know.</span> <span id="s77">He just walked in and said "You can't take this man.</span> <span id="s78">He's helping everybody in Budapest and I am so and so," and they gave him Papa back, and he came home.</span> <span id="s79">But he never went out on the street again.</span> <span id="s80">He was scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q.</span> <span id="s82">When was he taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A.</span> <span id="s84">In '43, right when the Hungarian Nazis arrived.</span> <span id="s85">Their name was the Arrowcross, but he stayed home and we still been in the same house.</span> <span id="s86">We had the apartment where we lived and we knew every neighbor.</span> <span id="s87">Life sort of went on, except that as I said we had these foreign people living with us and then two Frenchmen arrived, who only after the war we found out that they were French underground.</span> <span id="s88">Through some friends they found us and so they stayed with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q. Let me go back and ask you just a little about your dad again.</span> <span id="s90">Were you at home when he was taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q. Tell me about what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A. Well, they just said you have to come to a labor camp.</span> <span id="s94">Papa looked at us with tears in his eyes.</span> <span id="s95">We couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s96">What can you do?</span> <span id="s97">Shoot the man?</span> <span id="s98">Then we would have been shot ourselves.</span> <span id="s99">Immediately I picked up the phone and called his friends and he brought him home almost the next day.</span> <span id="s100">It was lucky.</span> <span id="s101">Oh, the Hungarians were even worse than the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">We didn't have too much money, because if you have, in Hungary, you could pay the police, you could pay them off in many ways.</span> <span id="s103">Raoul did that many times.</span> <span id="s104">He came with liquor and champagne and money and just paid them off.</span> <span id="s105">That's how they helped him.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">It was rotten.</span> <span id="s107">I worked, at that time I worked in the famous Ritz Hotel where Hilton learned there how to run the hotel.</span> <span id="s108">I remember the morning, that was March 1944 already, when a very excited neighbor came to us -- I think you read that in my book, maybe I shouldn't repeat it.</span> <span id="s109">He said that he just heard by the BBC, we were not allowed to listen to the BBC but of course everybody did, and I had a big short wave radio, so that's how we knew what was happening in the world because I listened to that radio.</span> <span id="s110">That Admiral is coming on the air and he's going to tell the world that he's not with the Germans anymore, he's now with the Allies.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">My father ran for the champagne and the glasses and I said, Papa don't believe what you hear.</span> <span id="s112">Oh, you're too young.</span> <span id="s113">You don't know this.</span> <span id="s114">Okay, he pours it in, ____________ comes on the air and he went as far as saying and now we happily tell you that we are now with the Allies.</span> <span id="s115">In that moment, a German _____________ comes on the air.</span> <span id="s116">His voice is cut off.</span> <span id="s117">I drop my champagne glass and suddenly we hear airplanes, and I was sure it was the Americans and the British.</span> <span id="s118">I run out.</span> <span id="s119">I dropped my drink, and I ran all the way -- it was a gorgeous sunny day, and I looked up and all these black things.</span> <span id="s120">I said here the Americans and the British are coming, so I was running all the way to the hotel, and as I walk in the porter says, the manager wants to see you, who was a darling man.</span> <span id="s121">He was a Yugoslavian, quite an old gentleman.</span> <span id="s122">He spoke 12 languages, perfectly, no accents.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">I ran into him and he took me in his arms and he said in English, "Child, these are not the British and not the Americans.</span> <span id="s124">These are Germans.</span> <span id="s125">I want you to go home.</span> <span id="s126">I don't want you to be taken from here."</span> <span id="s127">He wished me all the good luck and we kissed and I went.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">I made it home, and then we were waiting and we thought what the people told is probably true and maybe tomorrow we have to be out of here.</span> <span id="s129">We got the star and we didn't go out very much, because it was frightening.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q.</span> <span id="s131">What was it that made it frightening?</span> <span id="s132">Were you hearing about people --?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A.</span> <span id="s134">What we heard from the other people.</span> <span id="s135">The Rumanians and all, so we knew that at any moment we will be picked up and taken too.</span> <span id="s136">But somehow, I don't know why, I can't answer you that because it was a miracle that we were not taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q.</span> <span id="s138">If you couldn't get outside, how did you get food?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A. Well, we still had a wonderful maid who was Christian and she wouldn't leave us.</span> <span id="s140">She lived not there, but she went shopping.</span> <span id="s141">She did everything and she did come all the time.</span> <span id="s142">I did dare to go out, you know, because I was always a little _______ kid.</span> <span id="s143">I said nobody can tell me what to do, and I go.</span> <span id="s144">But not as much then after I met Raoul, then I became much much stronger and I wish that the whole world would understand too that the Jews too shouldn't have just gone up to the people but they should have stood up and fighted, but they didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">So, well, we waited and waited.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q.</span> <span id="s147">You met Raoul Wallenberg very soon after you arrived in Budapest, it seems?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A. Yes, if you remember in my book, I was the guest of the Swedish government for three weeks so I knew Pat Unger.</span> <span id="s149">He was minister.</span> <span id="s150">I was guest up there and I felt very guilty because I left my parents down in the apartment, but they promised they would look after my parents and they will help them, so they keep an eye on them.</span> <span id="s151">After three weeks my friend, who took me up there, who was also a Christian and he was in love with my cousin and he said, she has to go home.</span> <span id="s152">The parents had to be moved out of the house, so they took them out, because the Hungarians thought if every second house in Budapest is going to be a house with a _____________ then the Americans won't bomb the city.</span> <span id="s153">How stupid.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Just as many Jews died as Christians because they didn't see number one, the _____________ on the house, but my parents had to move out but thank God my grandmother's house became a house with a __________ and they moved in there.</span> <span id="s155">There was no elevator in the house or anything so there was my mother, my father, my aunt, my cousin, the very best friend with her Christian boyfriend at that time.</span> <span id="s156">What was funny he wouldn't move away either.</span> <span id="s157">There they were.</span> <span id="s158">It wasn't comfortable.</span> <span id="s159">It wasn't good.</span> <span id="s160">Grandma wasn't, thank God, not alive anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">So, Mr. Dan Olsen said she can't go, we are responsible for her, and Is aid I already feel guilty that I had these three weeks of heaven, but my parents can be killed because the Hungarian Nazis came every day with the list of people and they were reading.</span> <span id="s162">My name was still on, and Mike, the friend of my cousin said that if she's dead, maybe they'll kill the whole family because they can't find her.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">So, I went home with these diplomats because he wanted to see which house I am in and he put down the number and he said every time we were allowed one hour a day to go out to do our shopping and he said when you go out the telephone still works, please call.</span> <span id="s164">And I called almost every day and after three weeks suddenly they said come up at once, something happened, and there was Raoul Wallenberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Because I ha been there and lived there naturally I was his first helper.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q. Let me ask you, too, when you would go out to go shopping was there enough to eat, and if you were in the house all the time, what did you do to keep busy?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A.</span> <span id="s168">You know what we did, listen to beautiful recordings of Gilli.</span> <span id="s169">That was, as you probably remember in the book, too, that there was this wonderful song "Mama" that I still sing many times.</span> <span id="s170">I was crying, because after all I left my parents for three weeks by themselves, which was very selfish I think, but I was young and I wanted to live.</span> <span id="s171">I think it's sort of a natural thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">But now we were together and we always listened to this, and then the short wave radio said that Gilli is dead.</span> <span id="s173">When I came to Rome I walked into a place because outside it said Gilli is going to play and I walked in and I said Gilli is dead.</span> <span id="s174">He said No, no, he was not dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q.</span> <span id="s176">Who is Gilli?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A. Gilli was one of the most famous opera singers of Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q. So, you would listen to music?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A. That's all, and reading and writing because I was always a writer.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q. And your parents, what would they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A. Nothing.</span> <span id="s182">Just sitting, nothing.</span> <span id="s183">What could they do?</span> <span id="s184">Talking to eachother, listening to the BBC.</span> <span id="s185">There was nothing we could do.</span> <span id="s186">Nobody could do anything, and that was the horrifying thing too.</span> <span id="s187">Trying to strengthen each other, that was about all we could do.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">So, after I met Raoul and Raoul and Pat Unger looked at me and he said here is a piece of paper -- you read that too, I think, so I shouldn't repeat this.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q. Let me ask you, sort of on a daily basis, what was your work like?</span> <span id="s190">What did you do when you were working with Wallenberg?</span> <span id="s191">Not the specific things like the rescue in the river, but on a more day to day basis?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A. Well, it was sort of hostessing because there were thousands of people outside who came with their pictures so that we can put it on the passes.</span> <span id="s193">Did you see the passes because I have the real ones here and my passport too.</span> <span id="s194">The real ones, not fakes.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">That's what I did.</span> <span id="s196">I talked to the people, and that too is probably exactly what you want.</span> <span id="s197">One afternoon, you now, if you ever worked for a foreign diplomatic place, you know that three o'clock in the afternoon they close, never mind the war or not, and at three o'clock there is this banging on this door outside.</span> <span id="s198">I opened it and there is a gentleman standing with four pictures.</span> <span id="s199">He said, please just give us four more passes and I said sorry sir, but the minister is leaving.</span> <span id="s200">Oh, please, please, please.</span> <span id="s201">I said, okay, I'll talk to him, give me the pictures.</span> <span id="s202">I walked in and I said, "Minister Dan Olsen,--" they realized that Raoul never, never signed not one.</span> <span id="s203">It was his idea, but it's only Dan Olsen who signed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">I went in and he said I have a date at 3:30 and I said, "Sir, four more people's lives" He said okay okay and he signed these papers.</span> <span id="s205">And I gave it back to these gentlemen and he thanked me very much and 50 years pass and who thinks of the war.</span> <span id="s206">I had a Hungarian doctor here.</span> <span id="s207">I had tonsillectomy and he was up at Riverside.</span> <span id="s208">He had a beautiful townhouse there and his living room was his waiting room.</span> <span id="s209">One day I'm sitting there waiting and reading a paper and down the steps comes an elderly gentleman and starts screaming.</span> <span id="s210">You saved my life, you saved my life.</span> <span id="s211">I didn't think he talks to me and I looked around what is this man talking.</span> <span id="s212">Suddenly he's down on his knees kissing my hands and right away I said politely I said uncle.</span> <span id="s213">In Hungarian I said what are you doing?</span> <span id="s214">He said don't you remember, four people, I gave you the pictures, and this was the man and this was his brother in law.</span> <span id="s215">It's a small world.</span> <span id="s216">It was very embarrassing also because everybody looked at me.</span> <span id="s217">That's what happened and somehow he survived with those passes.</span> <span id="s218">But if I don't talk to Dan Olsen, just these four more, all four of them survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">So, that was a nice feeling.</span> <span id="s220">Raoul only had one meeting like that.</span> <span id="s221">I don't know if you heard about it because everybody said he was just taken, but that's not true.</span> <span id="s222">After a week he came back and the only one who saw him was the Swedish Red Cross head, who was a lovely gentleman.</span> <span id="s223">Raoul said look behind me, there are two Russian officers on the motor bike and I'm invited to go back to ___________, but I don't know if I'm going as a visitor but I want to give you all the money that I have so that you can help the people that we already helped.</span> <span id="s224">I keep $1,000 and I tell you that because when they were finally allowed to go in there five years ago when Gorbachev allowed the sister and the brother to come, they found this $1,000 and they gave it back.</span> <span id="s225">They never took it from him.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">But in any case he said to Langlett, but I have to tell you a wonderful story.</span> <span id="s227">As we come in the car I see a little old lady still wearing a star and she was carrying a basket with bread and I stopped the car and I went out and I said you speak some German and she said yes.</span> <span id="s228">Almost all Hungarians did.</span> <span id="s229">He said I just want to tell you I'm so terribly happy to see you alive.</span> <span id="s230">My name is Raoul Wallenberg, and the old lady pulls out the passes and says, I know Mr. Wallenberg and thank you.</span> <span id="s231">So, at least he had one whom he knew that he did save.</span> <span id="s232">And Herr Unger had the same thing happening.</span> <span id="s233">He was already a consul in Vienna in 1956 and the only ones who escaped then through the Danube were Jews and the big Nazis who were not caught before.</span> <span id="s234">So, he decided he will do the same as Raoul.</span> <span id="s235">He goes down with lights and food and dry clothes and he goes down to the river side and suddenly a boat comes in and a lady comes off and she runs to him.</span> <span id="s236">She said Mr. Unger you saved me from the Nazis, now you're saving me from the Soviets.</span> <span id="s237">So, he also had -- because we don't remember these people, but the remember us because we were so few.</span> <span id="s238">It was a wonderful feeling, but it's also an embarrassing feeling.</span> <span id="s239">I don't know why, it's a funny feeling, but it's wonderful and I wish Raoul would know every one of these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q.</span> <span id="s241">That he saved Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A.</span> <span id="s243">They don't even call us.</span> <span id="s244">Years we advertised in every newspaper that any one who was saved or worked with him, please call.</span> <span id="s245">Nobody does.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q.</span> <span id="s247">Why do you think that is?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A. People don't like to remember.</span> <span id="s249">But still I think they should, I mean after all this man saved 100,000 human lives.</span> <span id="s250">Not just Jews, because especially Budapest was very much intermarriages.</span> <span id="s251">He never asked that if you're the Christian I won't save you, and those people wanted to stay together so he saved everybody.</span> <span id="s252">100,000 human lives, most of them of course were Jewish.</span> <span id="s253">I remember when we had our very first benefit concert.</span> <span id="s254">Did you ever hear the name of Andros Shiv?</span> <span id="s255">Well, Andros is our best friend.</span> <span id="s256">He's also there.</span> <span id="s257">My little Andros.</span> <span id="s258">I called up a friend of mine, he's now dead, who was the head of the Hungarian Jewish Congress.</span> <span id="s259">Three quarters of those people, doctors and lawyers were all saved by Raoul and I said we have this concert and the tickets are $18.</span> <span id="s260">That's not much and he says what is there of Israel in it?</span> <span id="s261">I said Tibor, nothing, this is to save Raoul.</span> <span id="s262">We need money to get him out somehow.</span> <span id="s263">Not one bought a ticket.</span> <span id="s264">We were very disappointed.</span> <span id="s265">The only two Hungarians who came was my mother's two Christian friends' sons with their two Jewish girlfriends.</span> <span id="s266">Would you believe that?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">If I would have said the tickets were $150 and they said no, but $18 and all lawyers, doctors, pharmacists, all saved by Raoul.</span> <span id="s268">I never get a penny for my committee from them, never.</span> <span id="s269">I don't know why people are like.</span> <span id="s270">Are people forgetting so fast, or they don't want to think of it, but it's better that he's still 50 years in the _____________ and nobody ever thought to help him.</span> <span id="s271">It was a horrifying thing.</span> <span id="s272">This was a 32 year old young man who absolutely had no business to do what he did.</span> <span id="s273">But he had a heart, and his idea was the young people, like you, like me -- I was only in my 20s then, that we will make peace in the world.</span> <span id="s274">But we don't.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q.</span> <span id="s276">How old were you when you were working with him and how long did you work?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A. I think 24 I must have been.</span> <span id="s278">I was born in '18 and that was 1944.</span> <span id="s279">So what is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q. Twenty-six.</span> <span id="s281">How long were you working with him at the embassy?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A. Five months.</span> <span id="s283">The whole thing was only six months, but after the Danube, I got pneumonia and I really never saw him and then all the bridges were down and I only spoke on the telephone.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q.</span> <span id="s285">Did it seem much longer?</span> <span id="s286">Did the five months seem that it went on for a long time?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A. No, because it went so terribly fast.</span> <span id="s288">Don't forget that we were constantly moving.</span> <span id="s289">Raoul never slept in the same place for two nights, and constantly moving and moving the office and moving everything and then go back to the embassy.</span> <span id="s290">So, the time went very fast because we didn't have time to count days or whatever.</span> <span id="s291">I think it went very fast, but of course not fast enough because thousands and thousands of people died.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">So mainly I was a hostess and you know this was an enormous work because we had thousands and thousands of people coming.</span> <span id="s293">One of us had to put the picture on and then we had to run it to the person who gave it to us to sign and then it's coming back to our ambassador and everything was running around.</span> <span id="s294">I was what they call it here the gopher.</span> <span id="s295">Actually, that's what I was but they needed a gopher, go here and go there and do this and do that.</span> <span id="s296">That was my job.</span> <span id="s297">But it was wonderful to see how we could save people.</span> <span id="s298">Like you probably read that last little portion there when we were at the __________ mountain and because the radio said that all women between the ages of 15 and 25 have to go to such and such a sports palace and then clean up Hungary.</span> <span id="s299">We knew exactly that they're going to Aushwitz so Raoul turned to everybody and said you all must have young sisters and so forth.</span> <span id="s300">Go and get the pictures.</span> <span id="s301">We sat on the Buddha side that night and of course Dan Olsen was there and he signed every one of them and we had to deliver it by I believe 3:00 in the morning, and it was curfew.</span> <span id="s302">No one was allowed out on the street.</span> <span id="s303">It was a gorgeous night, very snowy and icy, but the moon was out and I thought why are they not bombing Budapest.</span> <span id="s304">This is a gorgeous night to do it.</span> <span id="s305">Raoul arrived around midnight and he asked how far are we because we have to go and he also said he wants to tell us something.</span> <span id="s306">We have new neighbors in the other house, the villa, and we all looked up and he said don't look up, it's just a German headquarters.</span> <span id="s307">He always made a joke out of it, and we didn't care.</span> <span id="s308">I was the first who was ready with 500, but there I have to tell you, I don't think I wrote that in the book.</span> <span id="s309">He walked in when I was hitting one of the boys there.</span> <span id="s310">I hit him so hard.</span> <span id="s311">He opened a big mouth right then and said I sold quite a few of these passes and I started to hit him on the head.</span> <span id="s312">I could have killed him.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q. So, you were hitting him and Raoul --?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A. I told him because he sold the passes, and he said you didn't and he said yes I did.</span> <span id="s315">He said outrageous but he said Agnes don't hit him.</span> <span id="s316">I was so angry.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">So, I was the first ready with about 500 on the pass side and I remember myself going out and all I could hear on the ice was my feet and I looked dup and I said what a gorgeous night.</span> <span id="s318">It was a curfew and we were not allowed, and I delivered every one of the passes including my two best girlfriends and other places where I rang the bell a friend of mine came out and said what are you doing out on the street.</span> <span id="s319">I said never mind, an angel sent you these papers.</span> <span id="s320">I hope you will live.</span> <span id="s321">When I got home it 4:00 or 3:00 and I sat down on the bed and Danny told me what I had done and I said to myself, oh my God, I could have been killed but then I felt like Raoul is hitting me and I said oh, of course not, the Germans and the Hungarians are cowards, they wouldn't dare to be out on the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">I fell asleep and at 6:00 in the morning my two best girlfriends arrived.</span> <span id="s323">They were kicked out because of the paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q. Kicked out of where?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A. From that sports palace because they had the pass.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q.</span> <span id="s327">Once people got the pass how did that protect them?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A. Well, as I said, Raoul asked the Germans to put it out on the walls of Budapest,and this was made big and was hanging on the walls.</span> <span id="s329">On that morning when my girlfriends arrived six o'clock, they were like daughters to my father and papa was starting to cry he was so happy.</span> <span id="s330">He put on over his pajamas his overcoat and he said I'm going down to buy bread.</span> <span id="s331">A few minute after our super came up.</span> <span id="s332">We were back in the Christian house.</span> <span id="s333">It's a long story, I got them back, never mind if you have a passport or not you're coming home, back.</span> <span id="s334">I got the apartment back, thanks to Raoul.</span> <span id="s335">A little note I am at the police station, get me out.</span> <span id="s336">So, I called up immediately Raoul, but Raoul was on the way to the railway station on the Austrian border, but he said I'm going to send you two diplomats immediately.</span> <span id="s337">So, we went eight hours looking for papa and we couldn't find him.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">The next morning they picked me up at six in the morning and finally we come to another sports palace, quite out of Budapest and I see my Swedish diplomat go in and say Hail Hitler, what else can they do and say something and they turn around and run.</span> <span id="s339">They said Father is home, do you have a phone.</span> <span id="s340">I said yes we do have a phone.</span> <span id="s341">I called home and papa was home.</span> <span id="s342">Now, he told us the story, and that just shows you how the Hungarians were so much worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Papa went down and one of these Nazis kids came up, the Hungarian, and he says, "Hey you bloody Jew, do you have any papers?"</span> <span id="s344">And papa pulled out the passes and said that's nothing.</span> <span id="s345">There it was hanging on the wall.</span> <span id="s346">Took him into the police station.</span> <span id="s347">A couple of minutes after, a German Nazi walked in and my father spoke to him in German and he says, look the Hungarian took me.</span> <span id="s348">He kicked him out.</span> <span id="s349">The other Hungarian brought him in.</span> <span id="s350">It happened four times.</span> <span id="s351">Finally the Hungarian won and walked my father and another, many many hundred -- it was raining and cold and he still had the pajama on, for about six hours they walked to that place.</span> <span id="s352">In the morning, Papa was standing there with the bread and the young man beside him and suddenly again a German officer walks in and my father saw them telling a joke to each other so he figured they are in good mood maybe I can hit them.</span> <span id="s353">So, he went up again and said in German, "Look what the Hungarian did to me."</span> <span id="s354">He says, out, and the young boy besides him also pulled out the pass and he was kicked out, and Papa quickly gave the bread to the old gentleman who stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">So, how and why it saved some, not everyone, because what the Hungarian Nazis, not the German Nazis, of course it was on Eishman's order, they came in.</span> <span id="s356">We had the same houses.</span> <span id="s357">We had about 30 houses on the two sides of the Danube, and that too, Raoul didn't buy them.</span> <span id="s358">It was given by the aristocrats and by the Jews because they thought it was in better hands with the Swedes, then they would have taken it away.</span> <span id="s359">We put these people with the passes into these houses.</span> <span id="s360">It was not comfortable, but they had a Raoul who came out every day with medication, with -- he had to be there to see that his people are all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">But the Hungarian Nazis came in through the basement and took the people out.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q.</span> <span id="s363">You saw them?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A. Oh yes, but then we went to Raoul and Raoul get his help and many times he brought the people back and then we had a couple of wonderful young men already who became little Wallenbergs, and there were already a lot of Germans who died so we had uniforms and one day they took about 60 of these old people through the basement and the boys put on a Nazi uniform and went after them.</span> <span id="s365">They both spoke good German and they started to scream on that German.</span> <span id="s366">He said how dare you are taking these people.</span> <span id="s367">We have to take them to General so and so and this normal German soldier had no idea who the generals are.</span> <span id="s368">They faked the name, you know, and they said and besides that you have a fake identity and they took away their real identification paper from the Germans and they told these people turn around and march and then the one young man came up to one old gentleman and said we are the Wellenberg kids, we're taking you home.</span> <span id="s369">And they brought them all home.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Raoul went down to the Danube and many times brought people back home from there.</span> <span id="s371">So, it was a pure luck the ones who survived and the ones who didn't.</span> <span id="s372">It wasn't a security, it was just a better feeling because we also had a hospital, and we had an orphanage.</span> <span id="s373">In that hospital too, the doctors always said we don't know how Raoul do it, but when we say we need aspirins, then the next day we have aspirins.</span> <span id="s374">If we need blankets, the blankets were there.</span> <span id="s375">They were never in want of anything.</span> <span id="s376">He was amazing, and yet we didn't have any American or British Red Cross.</span> <span id="s377">We only had the Swedish and help we got from the Portuguese.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q.</span> <span id="s379">You mentioned the orphanages?</span> <span id="s380">There were two orphanages?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A. Two, and one 79 kids were killed and in one of them this Dr. Goodkin was in.</span> <span id="s382">That was the second time she was saved.</span> <span id="s383">She had scarlet fever so Raoul had to give her some force papers and put her in a Christian hospital and that's why she survived.</span> <span id="s384">The other one was a little boy who was separated from his mother and thought she was dead, but the last words the mother said always hide if you can.</span> <span id="s385">When these boys came in and shot, he went under a chair.</span> <span id="s386">Of course they didn't look under the chair and the poor little kid came out all dazed and walks out on the street and the first person he meets is his mother who was saved by Raoul in one of the safe houses.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q. Were you there after that massacre in that orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A. No.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q.</span> <span id="s390">But you heard about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A. Oh, we all heard about it.</span> <span id="s392">I met Raoul then and he went down on his feet and he cried.</span> <span id="s393">I never saw him crying but for him, to kill children, innocent children, and there was no reason, it was just fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Like the hospital, that story I don't think that is in my book.</span> <span id="s395">I was delivering that to the gopher, delivering medication and mail to the hospital, but by that time we had people who were hurt on the street who had nothing to do and nobody but we put them in the hospital, they needed help immediately and Raoul suddenly came.</span> <span id="s396">It was a very snowy day.</span> <span id="s397">Now, you have to know that he as magnificent mind for learning names.</span> <span id="s398">I forget in five minutes but he never forgot anybody's name and never made a mistake.</span> <span id="s399">He wouldn't call me Elizabeth and the other one Agnes.</span> <span id="s400">He would never make a mistake in names.</span> <span id="s401">Nothing, he was a magnificent person, what comes once in a life time.</span> <span id="s402">So, he learned all the Hungarian officer's name and where they run their offices around Budapest.</span> <span id="s403">That was very important for him.</span> <span id="s404">And he knew exactly who was where.</span> <span id="s405">So, anyhow he arrives a little bit after 12:00 noon, unshaven and evidently hungry too, and he sees all the doctors and me and the patients with their hands up and three little punks, 14, 13 and twelve with a gun.</span> <span id="s406">Of course we had the Swedish flag hanging outside on every one of these houses.</span> <span id="s407">Raoul, and I never saw that before him doing, he hit these three kids, and they dropped their guns and he kicked them and he said half Hungarian, half German, "Get out of here and bring me your officer.</span> <span id="s408">How dare you to come into a Swedish territory."</span> <span id="s409">The kids got so frightened they went.</span> <span id="s410">Three minutes after a Hungarian officer walks in and Raoul looks at his watches, "Simon, what took you three minutes to get here."</span> <span id="s411">The man looks and says, "how do you know my name?"</span> <span id="s412">And Raoul says, I know everybody's name and I am very angry that you dare to send the Swedish territory three little punks to frighten all the people here and the sick people.</span> <span id="s413">I said now you better go out and help me because I asked for medication and I haven't gotten it yet because you need big help.</span> <span id="s414">You killed a German high officer and Simon looks at him and says I never killed anyone, and he said oh yes you did because he died here in our hospital, but before he died, he sent you name up to the headquarters.</span> <span id="s415">Simon left, and the doctor -- he found his voice first, and he said, "Raoul, what did you just do?"</span> <span id="s416">And Raoul was hysterically laughing.</span> <span id="s417">That was him.</span> <span id="s418">He said, well, how did you know his name?</span> <span id="s419">He said I only knew that office next door, that the head officer was Simon and we were lucky it was Simon and he said all right I understand it, but I never had a German officer who died here, and he says of course not, but he killed so many people one of them could have been a German officer.</span> <span id="s420">You see, that was his mind.</span> <span id="s421">He had to trick himself.</span> <span id="s422">He could have been in trouble but that was the only way to save people.</span> <span id="s423">So, he saved the whole hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q.</span> <span id="s425">You were there when those German --?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A.</span> <span id="s427">That happened, yes, I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q.</span> <span id="s429">You must have been terribly frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A.</span> <span id="s431">We never even knew anymore what is to be frightened, because there were only two choices, either you get killed or you live.</span> <span id="s432">I don't even think we were frightened.</span> <span id="s433">The only thing we all were frightened and I know that Raoul was the only thing he was frightened, was the bombing, because there you could do nothing.</span> <span id="s434">You didn't know where, and I do remember when the sirens were still working and the bomb comes and his car was already by Eishmen, and the other one was stolen, he got on a bicycle and he went to see if the children in the orphanage are all right.</span> <span id="s435">He would pick up the children who were crying and start making animal noises and tell them stories to get them out of frightening.</span> <span id="s436">That kind of a person we don't find today.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q.</span> <span id="s438">What about your parents, though, weren't they terribly worried about you?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A. Yes, they were constantly worried but also they understood by that time that if you don't do that then all of us will be dead, my parents included.</span> <span id="s440">I remember when I finally got all these papers and my working papers from Raoul and they handed me these passes for the parents and also Raoul they gave me a paper there was a house commission.</span> <span id="s441">Because what happened in Hungary as soon as you got out of your Christian house, then you made usually the supers daughter took over the apartment and the fur coats and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">So, there was a housing commission and Raoul gave me the paper and said go and get your apartment back, and by that time we were so -- I was Raoul Wallenberg and I was strong and I believed that I can do anything.</span> <span id="s443">It's funny.</span> <span id="s444">It's very hard to explain this because I was an only child and I was always lots of friends but I didn't think I had the strength to do things like that, but who will think.</span> <span id="s445">We are not heroes.</span> <span id="s446">Raoul would always say I was not a hero to someone stupid he said nobody is born a hero.</span> <span id="s447">A hero comes at the moment, the spur of the moment.</span> <span id="s448">You don't do these things.</span> <span id="s449">I remember I put on my best suit, I thought to myself, what the hell can happen to me and my nose up and there sits this horrible guy, Hungarian Arrowcross and I threw him that paper.</span> <span id="s450">I figured either he kills me or I live.</span> <span id="s451">He gave me the dirties look, so Raoul must have given them a fortune I'm sure they paid and with this dirty look he gave me the paper back with an okay.</span> <span id="s452">So, I walked out on the street and I said "God, why, how come I'm not killed?"</span> <span id="s453">I couldn't believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">So, I walked to my old home and the super's wife she started to cry, Aggi you're alive, you're alive, and I said yes of course and now I want to have my apartment back.</span> <span id="s455">Whereby he says to me, he says my daughter already has that apartment.</span> <span id="s456">She says our daughter already has another apartment.</span> <span id="s457">I don't know what he had done to her after that, so he said yes, but I have nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s458">You will have to go to the house's lawyers.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">So, again I picked myself up and I walked to this lawyer and I told him I want this back.</span> <span id="s460">He said well I will give it back to you under one condition and I stood like the Americans with my hands back, like I think Raoul did all the time, I said what is your condition.</span> <span id="s461">He says when the Soviets are coming in, you will tell them how much I help people.</span> <span id="s462">I said sure I'll tell them.</span> <span id="s463">I even forgot his name by the time I went out, but he gave me the papers and I walked back to the super, and he was quite shocked and I didn't know that he speaks Russian and he was living on my father for all those years, my father kept them.</span> <span id="s464">He sent the kid to school, I mean it was us who did everything.</span> <span id="s465">That's why the wife was so happy, but he was an s.o.b. and he came up with me to the apartment.</span> <span id="s466">The apartment was empty and I thought to myself oh my God, they have stolen everything, but we had the maids room and we opened the maids room and everything was in there, even the paintings.</span> <span id="s467">So, at the moment, I thought well maybe he isn't that bad until I heard him saying, "I get even with you yet."</span> <span id="s468">But he had no choice.</span> <span id="s469">He gave me the apartment.</span> <span id="s470">Raoul helped me to get our phone back and then I run to the Jewish house and I said to my parents, "Out" But Papa said we are not so and so, I said I don't care.</span> <span id="s471">You're coming home.</span> <span id="s472">This is our home and you're coming home.</span> <span id="s473">And I came home.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q.</span> <span id="s475">Did you tell you parents what you'd been doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A. Oh yes, they knew, but a couple of things I didn't tell them.</span> <span id="s477">When December came I didn't tell them about my jumping in the Danube.</span> <span id="s478">But I got in the morning -- but that was the first time I almost died because there was no doctor available.</span> <span id="s479">I was sick and we didn't know it was nerves.</span> <span id="s480">Naturally you get a little down, so the super said he has a doctor and the doctor came and I have never seen -- I don't remember either, a needle that big.</span> <span id="s481">That's for animals, you know.</span> <span id="s482">And he put sulfa in it and he gave me a sulfa injection.</span> <span id="s483">But all this -- he just said this is a sulfa injection and I went into a coma.</span> <span id="s484">So, this was one of his little jokes on me.</span> <span id="s485">He wanted me to die, so my mother was frantic and somehow we called a friend and she had found a Jewish doctor who was hiding, who later on thank God worked for Raoul in the hospital.</span> <span id="s486">He came out and he said to my mother, what happened and mommy said well, now I found out she was jumping in the Danube and she probably has pneumonia.</span> <span id="s487">But his man came and Mommy showed the needle and he said, my God, that's for animals and sulfa is no good.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">So, he gave me something else and my friends found I don't know where, grapes so they brought me back to life somehow.</span> <span id="s489">But that was frightening because I didn't want to die yet.</span> <span id="s490">It was too early.</span> <span id="s491">But then I never saw Raoul again, because in the meantime they bombed everything out.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">And the third time this s.o.b. what he did to me as by that time the Soviets were in and our apartment was bombed out and that's why you see these things here.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q.</span> <span id="s494">What is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A. All our books -- that was a Russian bomb and the Russian bomb never went all the way down to the basement like the American and British.</span> <span id="s496">They only took the top and we were living on the fourth floor and the whole fourth floor went down with all my books.</span> <span id="s497">I had a wonderful library in Budapest too, and everything fell down with these pictures.</span> <span id="s498">And my father with his life went and he rescued all my books.</span> <span id="s499">That is the bombs whatever fell on it and made the scratches.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q.</span> <span id="s501">How old are you in this picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A.</span> <span id="s503">Here I was seven.</span> <span id="s504">I think just seven.</span> <span id="s505">So, we didn't have that and then an uncle of mine lived in that house too so we all moved into one place.</span> <span id="s506">I gave my aunt and my uncle, my other aunt with her daughter and my parents and me and we slept on the floor.</span> <span id="s507">It didn't matter we had the apartment.</span> <span id="s508">So, that the old folks can have a little sleep in the afternoon, we went down to the basement where we used to be before when they were bombing.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Now, there was a fantastic general there who ran away from the Hungarians and the Nazis and the son committed suicide because he didn't want to work for the Nazis either, but they saved him and he and his wife and his mother-in-law and his son they all lived in the house and somehow I felt that -- this was new people there of course and we became great great friends and when they found out about them the Russians took them for 24 hour questioning and thank God they came back.</span> <span id="s510">The son fall in love with my young cousin.</span> <span id="s511">She was the only one who died from our family.</span> <span id="s512">She got polio after the war, so it wasn't because of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">So, in any case we were down in the basement and I was sitting against the wall and we were playing cards and I never knew how to play cards but there was nothing else to do while the old ones are sleeping.</span> <span id="s514">Suddenly a terribly drunk Russian soldier walked in and he started to say gold, gold ____________, and I turned around and I said we don't have gold but my super was there and whatever he answered I don't know.</span> <span id="s515">But again, how miracles happen.</span> <span id="s516">One card fell down and I just put my head down to pick it up when he shot and my two friends suddenly they didn't know whether I was shot or what but the thing went into the wall.</span> <span id="s517">I was down there to pick up the card.</span> <span id="s518">In one split second and it happened so fast that really my cousin and the boyfriend they couldn't figure out.</span> <span id="s519">They run out, I killed her, but Aggi came out so still my super couldn't get even with me because I did not get killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Then they called an officer and he reprimanded the drunken soldier but these things were more frightening than the Nazis.</span> <span id="s521">They were terrible, horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q. Let me take you back just a little bit before the Russians arrived, did you see -- you must have been seeing deportations in Budapest?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A. No, actually.</span> <span id="s524">That was only Raoul and the men who went to these stations and brought people back.</span> <span id="s525">But what we see was the killing in the Danube and how they carried people out but you couldn't do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q.</span> <span id="s527">How they carried them from the safe houses?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A. Of course, that's what I told you.</span> <span id="s529">And we were bombed enough.</span> <span id="s530">We should have been bombed by the Americans far more, and of course everything turned out much worse when finally they shot down one of the American bombers and he fell into the Danube and the Hungarian Nazis took him out and they hanged him right there.</span> <span id="s531">From then on it was for the Jews even worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q.</span> <span id="s533">At one point you ended up leaving for Romania?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A. Yes, I wanted to leave anyway.</span> <span id="s535">As I said, there were no bridges, everything was down, so my very best friend whom I saved, she was saved by a wonderful Jewish friend of ours who she eventually married.</span> <span id="s536">That's how I found out he came over, but he looked very Christian and he had Christian papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Anyhow, he came over first and that was wonderful to see.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q.</span> <span id="s539">When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A.</span> <span id="s541">That was right after -- let's see the Russians were not quite in it.</span> <span id="s542">It was the end of December.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q. 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s545">And then January 17, I believe it was on the 15th that the General who was with us in the house said Aggi come with me and look out the street and we went to the big door we had and the German guns were on the ground like this.</span> <span id="s546">The Germans went to Buddha.</span> <span id="s547">Have you ever been in Budapest?</span> <span id="s548">Well, they went to Buddha and they were still shooting over here and they were fighting all the time and that was terribly dangerous because a friend of mine told me that their little daughter they wanted to save and would I take her to the nuns and they were fighting on the streets and I said of course I take the child.</span> <span id="s549">I picked up the child and they were shooting on the street.</span> <span id="s550">So,she was frightening and I was telling her stories and you had to get your head down because they were shooting.</span> <span id="s551">Somehow we managed we went to the nuns and I gave the little girl to the nuns.</span> <span id="s552">The next day the parents went and got her back.</span> <span id="s553">They couldn't be without her, but it was a dangerous time and we had very little water and I wanted my father to be able to shave and make some tea so the next house had a courtyard.</span> <span id="s554">There are in Budapest, they have a courtyard and they have a well and as I told you they were shooting from both sides and I walk to get a pail of water for Papa and an old gentleman comes down from a house and says you're picking up water too, and I said yes and you couldn't see these bullets, only you got hear it.</span> <span id="s555">Suddenly I hear and the old gentleman falls dead beside me and I hear the wife screaming up there.</span> <span id="s556">I have no idea if he was dead or what happened after because I got terribly frightened but I ran and got the water and ran home and I said an old gentleman but I didn't.</span> <span id="s557">Why I didn't you can't answer these things.</span> <span id="s558">The bullet could have hit anyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">We had a wonderful lawyer friend who was in Auschwitz for I don't know how long and he came home.</span> <span id="s560">Somehow he escaped Auschwitz or Birkenau, I don't know where he was, and he found his parent's apartment without windows of course and he just sat down suddenly to thank God that he's home and this bullet from the other side came in and killed him right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">So, I think you have to fight for yourself, but then there is nothing you can do.</span> <span id="s562">If it's written to you that you live, then you live, and if it was written to you that you die, then you die.</span> <span id="s563">But we try to live and try to help others but it's not easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">So, in any case, in January there was still the fighting and sort of the fighting stopped and the Germans were still on the Buddha side when suddenly Raoul, one of the lawyers who was a Czechoslovakian he came over and he came to us because he knew where I lived and he said to me I still blame that he never told me that Raoul wasn't with him.</span> <span id="s565">He just said that the Swedish ligation has been taken by the Russians and they are in ______________.</span> <span id="s566">I said oh my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q. So, these were the people that you had been working with?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A. That's right, Herr Unger, Dan Olsen, Raoul and so forth and he said did you know that Romania is free.</span> <span id="s569">I said no I didn't.</span> <span id="s570">And he said that is the only ligation in the whole of Europe there.</span> <span id="s571">We have a Swedish ligation and the Rumanians are allowed to repatriate.</span> <span id="s572">I think you read that in the book and you have to go there and tell ___________ that they are in ________________ and he should bring them out.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q.</span> <span id="s574">Now why did he come to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A.</span> <span id="s576">Why?</span> <span id="s577">Because I was the gopher and I don't even know.</span> <span id="s578">Maybe I as the only one unmarried.</span> <span id="s579">That's possible too, I don't know why.</span> <span id="s580">I was there, because they knew I already had a Swedish passport and I was single and I was a guest of the Swedish government for three weeks.</span> <span id="s581">I guess that's why.</span> <span id="s582">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s583">So my parents of course, no she can't go.</span> <span id="s584">She can't be killed.</span> <span id="s585">And I turned to my parents and I said Mommy and Daddy I know that but they saved us, how we not.</span> <span id="s586">I said by the way how do I get there.</span> <span id="s587">He said Rumanians are allowed to repatriate.</span> <span id="s588">I said well how do I repatriate.</span> <span id="s589">He said I'll get you the false papers, just promise me that you'll carry no Hungarian papers with you and the Swedish ones put in your behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">End of Tape 1</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q.</span> <span id="s593">So you were telling me about getting ready to go --?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A.</span> <span id="s595">So anyhow my parents were beside themselves and I was also told that it's a very dangerous trip because we don't know how long it takes and in any moment the Russians can pick us up.</span> <span id="s596">I didn't tell that to my parents but they told it to me and they can take me to Siberia or they can bring me back home.</span> <span id="s597">But if I can do it, please get to Bucharest because the people have to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Finally the day came and I had knapsack and little food, what Mommy made.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q.</span> <span id="s600">What month are we in now?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A.</span> <span id="s602">We are in February because we were completely occupied by February 10, that's when the Russians and I was already March 1 in Bucharest.</span> <span id="s603">So, sure enough on the train nobody talked to each other because we didn't dare.</span> <span id="s604">Nobody knew who speaks what language and we were first in a real train sort of.</span> <span id="s605">And we went and at one point the evening they said so we can't go anymore we have to sleep over.</span> <span id="s606">So, you know you're young and tired you can sleep anywhere.</span> <span id="s607">We went to a school and on the floor each of us slept.</span> <span id="s608">In the morning they woke us up that we have a new train and there it was, the same cattle train what the Jews were taken to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s609">The very sweet Hungarian soldier told us all that when we go to the Rumanian border please don't get under the hay.</span> <span id="s610">There was lots of hay in there.</span> <span id="s611">He says don't sneeze, don't cough, because the Russians are coming in and they go with a light and if they find you we don't know what happens and they are always drunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">So, you can imagine how we survived two and a half days already and here we are all on here and we hear these drunken Russians singing at the top of their head and they open the doors and thank God nobody coughed and they went around with a light and they couldn't find anything, banged the door and the train was moving and we were in Rumania.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">We arrived there in the night and I had a friend who was at the music academy and she lived with us and she was from Rumania and I knew hopefully they are alive.</span> <span id="s614">This is a small time, Arid, have you ever been there?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">It's a small town and there was another friend of mine who was a baroness, a real baroness, but she was half Jewish of course, and I didn't know whether she was alive but I had her address because we met in Budapest, we learned cooking in the gas company.</span> <span id="s616">She became the big philanthropist and a miserable cook and I became the good cook, but we became friends, Miraka.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">So, I thought I have these two friends, let's see what's happening and there is this dark station and you are in a town you don't speak the language.</span> <span id="s618">Suddenly a young man came up to me and my stomach went like this right away, he said are you alone and I said me too.</span> <span id="s619">Where are you going?</span> <span id="s620">I said who are you?</span> <span id="s621">He said he was a Hungarian concert pianist and he escaping.</span> <span id="s622">So I said walk with me and let's see if my friends are up or alive.</span> <span id="s623">So, it must have been around 11:00 at night we come to this house and there is a huge grand piano out in the yard.</span> <span id="s624">I said look it's made for you.</span> <span id="s625">They have the grand piano there, and I ring the bell and my friend opened it and she screamed.</span> <span id="s626">I mean it's not funny that I am alive and they brought out every food they had in the house and I shouldn't have eaten, we all swell up after because we had nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s627">We had all our injections thank God from typhoid to whatever, they gave us in Budapest, so it wasn't so dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">The next day she says we have to go to the health department so they gave us this hot bath and all that and we had the papers that we got all the shots.</span> <span id="s629">Then I said I'm going to find my other friend.</span> <span id="s630">The funny part was we came away and this was the first time I had high heel shoes on and I didn't know how to walk, because for years we had only boots on.</span> <span id="s631">Now, suddenly I put high heel shoes on and I can't walk and I'm not a sweet eater, but I went into every store there to eat something that was sweet.</span> <span id="s632">You know your body needed all this.</span> <span id="s633">It was wonderful to see my friends again.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">So, I found the house and I rang the bell and there was my girlfriend and she was screaming too like crazy that I'm alive.</span> <span id="s635">I said how about your family.</span> <span id="s636">Well, the brothers were taken away but somehow they came back and they were not killed.</span> <span id="s637">They are all on the way hopefully they can get to America eventually and what am I doing.</span> <span id="s638">So, I said I have to go to Bucharest.</span> <span id="s639">She said nobody can go Bucharest.</span> <span id="s640">Only officials, why do you want to go there?</span> <span id="s641">I said Marika, even for you I cannot tell.</span> <span id="s642">She got me the papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">So I said I am without money and I just met a concert pianist, could we do something and she said of course we could do something.</span> <span id="s644">I have a big room here and people are so hungry for music and at that time the boy played beautifully and we gave a concert and we made good money.</span> <span id="s645">We halved the money.</span> <span id="s646">Half for him and half for me so I could buy myself a pair of stockings or something because we had nothing, and I think we had three or four other concerts and I don't know why suddenly I felt so bad about this man.</span> <span id="s647">I said I'm leaving for Bucharest and he said are you going to still be my manager.</span> <span id="s648">I said no, it's finished.</span> <span id="s649">You got your money now you do it yourself.</span> <span id="s650">He was so upset.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">But I just somehow felt that's enough.</span> <span id="s652">I am not a music manager.</span> <span id="s653">We got our money and that was wonderful.</span> <span id="s654">So, Marika got me the papers and that you read in my book too, I don't have to tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q.</span> <span id="s656">You can tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A. Anyhow, I go into this one place and there is two Russian officers sitting and I felt awful and frightened and the one said are you Rumanian and I said yes, of course I knew that I don't speak Rumanian and I said I'm just coming home.</span> <span id="s658">We talked a long time and they gave me a drink and I tried not to drink it.</span> <span id="s659">I was scared stiff, so finally we came to ___________ and they both got off and I got off too.</span> <span id="s660">When I came back they weren't there, but the coats were still there, and I said strange.</span> <span id="s661">Suddenly they came back and they looked around and quickly closed the door and sat down.</span> <span id="s662">I said this is strange.</span> <span id="s663">So, the one turned to me in German and he said can you speak German.</span> <span id="s664">I said, a little.</span> <span id="s665">He said, I am Jewish and we are trying to escape from the Russians.</span> <span id="s666">They were Russian officers.</span> <span id="s667">The one was Christian from Kiev and he was a Jew and they were friends for many years.</span> <span id="s668">He was from Odessa and he was Kiev.</span> <span id="s669">So, they told me their whole story that eventually they wanted to get to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Then I told them the truth too, that I'm not Rumanian.</span> <span id="s671">They were the ones who helped me to get a room first and they said if you need us call the Jewish so and so.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">So, it was interesting because we ended up on the end they helped my parents.</span> <span id="s673">They went back to Hungary and then they helped my parents to get to Czechoslovakia and from there out.</span> <span id="s674">But what happened to the two men, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s675">The Christian wrote a fantastic book how bad in Russia the communists are and what's happening there, and they asked me if I would take it to Europe and sell it.</span> <span id="s676">We were told if we leave Rumania that the Russians will make a big look and I didn't dare to take the book.</span> <span id="s677">Now, I'm sorry because I didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s678">I could have taken the book, but I didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">So, it was interesting, so I got there --</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q.</span> <span id="s681">You are where now?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A.</span> <span id="s683">In Bucharest.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q. And it's what month?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A. March 1 or March 2 and I was quite sick too and I needed a doctor's appointment and all that and I was very skinny and Marika came and I had to go to the Swedish embassy.</span> <span id="s686">So, whom can I ask a taxi driver.</span> <span id="s687">And the taxi driver spoke some German and some English and he told me that he was -- why do I go to the Swedish embassy, it's so dangerous.</span> <span id="s688">I said why is that dangerous.</span> <span id="s689">He said because it's right besides the Russian headquarters.</span> <span id="s690">No wonder that the poor ambassador was like this.</span> <span id="s691">He was an elderly man, that ambassador, a wonderful man.</span> <span id="s692">I walked in and I didn't want to tell the secretary why I was there, and she says, why are you coming.</span> <span id="s693">I said I can't tell you, I want to speak to the ambassador.</span> <span id="s694">So, she wouldn't let me in.</span> <span id="s695">About three o'clock in the afternoon finally she got tired of me and says all right before he goes now you can go in.</span> <span id="s696">I walked in and told him who I am.</span> <span id="s697">That poor ambassador, he screamed why didn't you come in before and he goes to the machine and they're looking -- I got a list from this lawyer of the other seven Swedes who were there and they had to be helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q. From the ligation you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A. From the ligation, yes, because those people who got the passports but there was only a few left.</span> <span id="s700">I was the eighth Swede so we were eight Swedes.</span> <span id="s701">One was a real Swede, two were married to Swedes, two little girls parents, they were Hungarian but they lived in there and me and who else was, oh, yes, one German woman who was married to a Swede, but she was a widow.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">So, I had that list that they are all okay, and that they are the ones already at the ____________.</span> <span id="s703">And then he said your fiance is looking for you, are you Aggi?</span> <span id="s704">Yes, so it was wonderful so right away he said I'm going to give you money so you have something but when you're walking on the street, please never open your mouth.</span> <span id="s705">You don't speak Rumanian, you don't speak Hungarian, try not to speak German.</span> <span id="s706">All you speak is Swedish.</span> <span id="s707">I couldn't not a word of Swedish.</span> <span id="s708">That's in my book too, you know, because that's what saved my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q.</span> <span id="s710">Why did he not --?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A. Because he knew how dangerous it is because if they have any suspicion of me they can take me to Siberia, back to Hungary.</span> <span id="s712">That was a much more dangerous time I think than it was there and I became a freelance writer.</span> <span id="s713">I wrote for the newspapers.</span> <span id="s714">I needed food and that and one lady told me that I can go down to the river and get frogs and she taught me how to make frogs and I had frogs every night because that was cheap.</span> <span id="s715">I had a very nice room, by a very lovely lady and she taught me how to eat frogs.</span> <span id="s716">And my Marika came up every Friday from Arid to Bucharest.</span> <span id="s717">There was a wonderful hotel, it's still there.</span> <span id="s718">The Hotel Palace, and they have, like we have the icecream parlors there, they had caviar parlors and you could chose your caviar and they had everything from beluga to so and so.</span> <span id="s719">Then you went down to the basement and they brought you your caviar and the toast and the champagne and Marika did that every week because she knew all week I don't eat, just the frogs.</span> <span id="s720">So, she treated me every week and then one day it was tremendous because I went in to buy a soap in the store of the hotel and suddenly I hear a French accent, a man talking and I turned around and we screamed.</span> <span id="s721">That was the one underground French boy who was always in my house and I didn't know what happened and he was alive and he told me he's on the way home and that is friend already went.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">So, here he was invited by Marika and we had our caviar and champagne together.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q.</span> <span id="s724">How did you catch these frogs?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A. Run into the water and just caught them.</span> <span id="s726">It was dreadful, but when you're hungry, what do you care.</span> <span id="s727">I was very sorry for the frogs but they were good.</span> <span id="s728">Since then I don't really like to eat frog legs or anything, but it was all right then.</span> <span id="s729">When you're hungry, you're hungry.</span> <span id="s730">That's it, it doesn't matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">But then, you know I didn't speak any Swedish and the ambassador was quite right because I think one day I walked on the street and he said only carry your Swedish papers, nothing else.</span> <span id="s732">That's all I had was my Swedish paper and one I guess he was a Russian or a Rumanian and he started to talk to me and I smiled very nicely and couldn't answer.</span> <span id="s733">He tried every language and I just smiled.</span> <span id="s734">He tried Hungarian, I could have answered of course, German, English, but I just smiled so he took me into the police station and I scribbled down the phone number of the Swedish embassy.</span> <span id="s735">Poor _____________ came with the car and the driver and he walked in.</span> <span id="s736">All I spoke in Swedish at that time was thank you, bread, and one more word.</span> <span id="s737">I can't remember.</span> <span id="s738">But as he walked in I started to scream these same words over and over and I could see him relaxing sort of because he couldn't laugh.</span> <span id="s739">I went over and over and so they kicked me out and on the way to car he turns to me he said, how did you come up with this idea?</span> <span id="s740">And I looked at him and said, Mr. Ambassador, I'm a Wallenberg child.</span> <span id="s741">That's what saved my life, those five words in Swedish.</span> <span id="s742">Then he said you are never walk alone and you need more money.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q.</span> <span id="s744">At this point did you think you'd be going back to Budapest?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A. No, never.</span> <span id="s746">But I could -- I was very lucky the Red Cross came around there, the Swiss Red Cross and one of my Swiss cousins had been a red cross driver so he delivered mail to my parents to Budapest, but it was very funny.</span> <span id="s747">Around the world it goes.</span> <span id="s748">So, the parents knew I was all right and I told them that they will be so.</span> <span id="s749">But the Swedish embassy in eight days, that's right, in eight days ____________ had them down there mine was Raoul Wallenberg.</span> <span id="s750">The twelve employees my was Raoul and then I asked Ambassador Unger how come Raoul isn't here, because I didn't know what happened to him and he said don't worry about Raoul, you know him.</span> <span id="s751">We'll get him.</span> <span id="s752">Well, we never got him.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">And then we were supposed to leave all together, the eight Swedes and the twelve embassy people and ______________ was the big oil place and the railway station is at _____________ and the trains via Russia were where we had to go.</span> <span id="s754">And we were all there with all our baggage and said goodbye to our new friends and first I put the embassy on all the people and suddenly the Russians said no for us.</span> <span id="s755">I remember Ambassador Dan Olsen looked and said Aggi, Aggi, don't worry.</span> <span id="s756">You'll get out.</span> <span id="s757">You will all get out.</span> <span id="s758">But it took us that was they left at the end of March and we left in June.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q.</span> <span id="s760">So you were there for several more months?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q. Working?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A. Working, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q.</span> <span id="s765">What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A. First of all I got money from the Swedish embassy constantly and I did free lance writing.</span> <span id="s767">They asked me for articles and I sent it to Budapest and I don't know.</span> <span id="s768">I got very little money but it was money and I eat the frogs.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q.</span> <span id="s770">What did you do with your time?</span> <span id="s771">Did you know people there?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A. By that time yes, we had quite a few friends.</span> <span id="s773">But there was nothing really, just the waiting time and how when you're young and maybe you too, you believe that 13 is a bad day and black cats are not bringing you luck and we were brought up with this idea and finally we got a phone call from the embassy that we will leave on a British military plane and the one thing I can't remember when the war was over in May we were still in Bucharest and I have no idea if we celebrated or what we did.</span> <span id="s774">Absolutely no recollection.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q. Do you remember how you heard about the war being over?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A. No.</span> <span id="s777">Isn't that funny.</span> <span id="s778">This is the one thing I don't remember at all.</span> <span id="s779">I only remember that I had this beautiful room and I was sleeping because the next morning the embassy car was picking me up to go to the airport and I was sorry that I couldn't take my friends book.</span> <span id="s780">I was afraid they were going to not let me on with it or something.</span> <span id="s781">In the middle of the night I wake up that something is against my body and I look and it's a black cat.</span> <span id="s782">I screamed and the cat jumped out.</span> <span id="s783">I had a little terrace and she jumped all the way to the terrace and disappeared.</span> <span id="s784">I said oh my God, that's the end.</span> <span id="s785">We are not leaving again.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">But it was not true.</span> <span id="s787">In the morning we were picked up.</span> <span id="s788">All eight of us wherever they were and we were taken to the airport and the Russians were quite polite and it turned out it was a South African military plane so there were really no seats, just where the ammunition used to be that's where we were sitting and what we didn't know, we were the eight of us and then there were two Frenchmen and one big fat gentleman whom we didn't know who he was but he spoke only English.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">My one friend, the one who was German and was married to a Swede, she couldn't speak very well anything but German so the two of us sort of spoke German.</span> <span id="s790">Then we went out and the pilot told us where we are and how we go through the Adriatic what was absolutely fascinating and just the thought that we are going to freedom.</span> <span id="s791">That was something I couldn't believe.</span> <span id="s792">When we went to Barre, during the war Barre was the airport for the Allied forces and it was the most colorful thing you have ever seen and it was really a British military, American, Greek, whoever was with the Allied forces.</span> <span id="s793">It was very colorful and they invited us for sandwiches, the real English sandwiches, very wet, but when you're hungry, you're hungry.</span> <span id="s794">You don't mind and then they said we were supposed to go in a hotel because that's what the Swedes were paying for and we went into a big truck and we were driven and I said we are not going into the city.</span> <span id="s795">Oh Aggi, you're always thinking the wrong way, of course we're going in.</span> <span id="s796">Of course we didn't.</span> <span id="s797">We went in a transit camp number one, what was for suspicious people, but it turned out the funny part, the gentleman, the big fat one in the plane was a Scotland Yard man and when the two of us spoke German because the old lady couldn't speak anything else, he was sure that we were two Nazis running away making ourselves out that we are Swedes.</span> <span id="s798">But this we didn't know, and we had one young man with us whose father was a very famous parliamentarian in Budapest and I didn't know that he worked for the Scotland Yard and he didn't know nothing much about me either.</span> <span id="s799">But in any case we were all there and so we went in and they put us in this camp.</span> <span id="s800">The only nice thing in this camp was that there were German war prisoners and other British were walking outside.</span> <span id="s801">This was a place where they put the people before they took them to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s802">Now it's the other hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">But they separated us from all the other people and for a little while the first day that we went in there the British went with his gun all around and I saw a big hole and I wanted to get out.</span> <span id="s804">The little Britisher with his wonderful cockney English said to me I'll shoot you if you come out.</span> <span id="s805">So, I pulled my foot back and I was hysterically laughing and I thought to myself how funny.</span> <span id="s806">I wasn't killed by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s807">I wasn't killed by the Soviets, now I'm going to be killed by my own Allies.</span> <span id="s808">So, I said I want to speak to your officers, but no they were playing what the English play all the time, but I was mad but I pulled my foot back.</span> <span id="s809">I thought it's not worth getting killed right here.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Then we got food and nobody eat but me.</span> <span id="s811">I was crazy and then we were interrogated the next morning and that was very funny because they started to ask me questions about this man who was with us and I said I know nothing about him just that he's Hungarian, very famous minister's son and that he's married to a Swede.</span> <span id="s812">So they were very pleased that I didn't know that he was a Scotland Yard man.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Then he was questioned about me but with me what I did I was very funny.</span> <span id="s814">Suddenly one of the Scotland Yard men says to me in 1938 when you left England you never told the police that you left.</span> <span id="s815">And I looked at him and I said may I ask you why you interrogate me if you know everything more than I do that I've done.</span> <span id="s816">You know everything about me why are you asking questions.</span> <span id="s817">So, we became very good friends.</span> <span id="s818">So, they helped us then, my friend who's a Scotland Yard man and he and me were the only ones who spoke English.</span> <span id="s819">They picked us up many times and we went into town because finally we could take a bath at the American headquarters and they ask us how the British are handling us and we said not very good.</span> <span id="s820">They were constant fight who was giving more, the Americans brought us field beds and we could sleep outside, so the British gave us the blankets.</span> <span id="s821">Then the Americans brought us food extra so we became very good friends, all of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Then we had to get out and I said well you have to wait, we have to find out the truth about all of you whether it's so finally it took them three weeks before they found out, almost four, here they found out all the truth about all of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q. I want to take you back to Bucharest for one second before we go on.</span> <span id="s824">In your book I think you mentioned a friend of yours who was attacked by a Russian soldier.</span> <span id="s825">Do you remember what happened there?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s827">She was attacked and she got syphilis and I gave away my fur coat and everything so that she could be healed and she got healed.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q.</span> <span id="s829">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A. I don't know what happened after.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q.</span> <span id="s832">Did she tell you about the attack itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q. Will you tell us?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A.</span> <span id="s836">It was very frightening.</span> <span id="s837">It was more frightening that fighting the Hungarian Nazis and the Germans.</span> <span id="s838">It's funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q.</span> <span id="s840">Why was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A. Because these are all so terribly uneducated people.</span> <span id="s842">You see, when the Russian soldier came all the way from Siberia and it was winter time, they came without shoes and they never saw a bathroom in their life.</span> <span id="s843">They made their business in the bathtub and washed their face in the toilet and they went to bed with everyone.</span> <span id="s844">They had to put us under the heavy beds so they don't find us, because they attacked everybody, except children.</span> <span id="s845">They loved children.</span> <span id="s846">So, it was very dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">And the officers that came in in American jeeps and wore American boots and whatnot but the soldiers were so that they never saw a watch.</span> <span id="s848">They stole everybody's watch and some of them had watches from here to here and they come to you and say _________________.</span> <span id="s849">They loved it like kids.</span> <span id="s850">They never saw a watch.</span> <span id="s851">Soap, they don't know what soap was.</span> <span id="s852">All they knew was drinking, so they were more dangerous because there was no way to talk.</span> <span id="s853">And many -- do you know how many thousands of people we still don't know what happened.</span> <span id="s854">They just picked them up on the street and took them to Siberia, so that at least by the Germans and the Nazis you know it's only the Jews they pick up but now anybody.</span> <span id="s855">And they didn't do a thing they just walked, maybe they went down to shop and they disappeared.</span> <span id="s856">Nobody knew what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q.</span> <span id="s858">Did that happen to friends of yours, people you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A. Yes, one man and I still don't know what happened to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q. From Bucharest?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A. No, that was in Budapest.</span> <span id="s862">But it was nice to get out of Bucharest too, because only the Russians had the big word there and there were British and French there, but they were the only ones.</span> <span id="s863">It was a dangerous time, but a game.</span> <span id="s864">It was luck.</span> <span id="s865">Not everybody was lucky and also something else was terrible.</span> <span id="s866">We met a lot of people that were in Auschwitz and they hated me and the other ones too that we probably worked with the Germans and that's why we are alive and that's why we have never been in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s867">It was a terrible thing to be hated from your own people and it's no use.</span> <span id="s868">We tried to explain that we worked with this wonderful man -- I worked at least -- and it's just the luck that I am alive, but they didn't believe.</span> <span id="s869">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s870">And you really couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s871">I didn't have money to give them or nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q.</span> <span id="s873">So these were survivors that had been sent back?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s875">Some of them escaped, some of them sent back, some of them survived, let's say that, and they came back to their own country.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q.</span> <span id="s877">Did they tell you about what had happened to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A. No, nobody liked to talk.</span> <span id="s879">Only later on in Sweden then I found out.</span> <span id="s880">So, you see but then we were still nowhere and my letters still went to my parents so they knew that we were in jail sort of but we had a wonderful time there.</span> <span id="s881">They wouldn't allow the other people there, they were so jealous of us because we were all alone in that outside with field beds.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q.</span> <span id="s883">Who else was at this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A. Well, there were lots of misplaced persons who were waiting to go back to their own country.</span> <span id="s885">It was very funny that the Scotland Yard man suddenly said to me I don't believe that you are a Jew.</span> <span id="s886">I said why don't you believe me and he said look outside and there was a gorgeous girl with dark hair like you, a big behind and she walked and her behind went back and forth and he said that's a Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s887">You don't walk like her.</span> <span id="s888">I said come on fellows, that doesn't mean a bloody thing how somebody walks.</span> <span id="s889">That doesn't make one a Jew or not a Jew.</span> <span id="s890">That was in their head.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">So, there were Jews, Czechoslovakians and they were waiting to be released and it was a transit camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">It was a lot of fun in Barre anyhow because we were allowed -- we stood at the road and put up our hands and usually a British or an American truck picked us up and took us into Barre.</span> <span id="s893">That was very nice.</span> <span id="s894">Finally we got the word that we are allowed to leave.</span> <span id="s895">Now they had to find somebody how do we leave.</span> <span id="s896">They found for us an American soldier who got they told him he can have three days off if he takes to Rome.</span> <span id="s897">This was in 1945, June or July.</span> <span id="s898">July, it was a short while after _____________ where we had the most horrible fights and a lot of Japanese Americans died there, and this soldier had a voice the most gorgeous voice.</span> <span id="s899">He was a negro and he sang all the way and it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s900">When we came to ______________ we still saw the dead animals all over but the mimosa trees were out and the orange trees were blossoming like the nature wanted to give us back something.</span> <span id="s901">I have that it in my book, but he didn't sing there.</span> <span id="s902">We were all weary with our heads down because it was the most horrible feeling a few weeks before there was big fightings.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q.</span> <span id="s904">Did you stay there at all or did you just drive through?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A. No, we just drive through, but we stopped because it was shocking, but we didn't get out of the bus.</span> <span id="s906">None of us, and then we went to ____________ where the Popes usually have their summer vacation and I lived in Rome for a year so I know the place and then we came to Rome and Rome didn't change.</span> <span id="s907">Have you ever been in Rome?</span> <span id="s908">Isn't that a wonderful city?</span> <span id="s909">I think it's the most fascinating place.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">But before we went to Rome I think we stopped in Naples and he took out his water bottle to drink and immediately the M.P. came up because he was black naturally.</span> <span id="s911">What are you drinking?</span> <span id="s912">You are not allowed and he got so angry he threw all the water on the M.P.</span> <span id="s913">They found out it was pure water.</span> <span id="s914">But I was very angry because then I found out how the Americans are so against their own people there, but he drove us there to Rome and he was wonderful and then in Rome I have lots of friends still and they were beside themselves that I am alive, of course.</span> <span id="s915">Then this wonderful the British officer who was at the Barre station who first met us and then this Scotland Yard, they took off a week so that they come and see us in Rome and we went together to the opera to hear Benjamin Gilli and it was wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">I went to all the places I had been in Rome and I was so excited about being in Rome again.</span> <span id="s917">It was wonderful.</span> <span id="s918">Then we finally we were whole month in Rome but the Swedish government paid for all eight of us.</span> <span id="s919">I was supposed to give that money back after and Rome was just Rome.</span> <span id="s920">We roomed everywhere and I had this wonderful -- have you been in the place where Moses is?</span> <span id="s921">Oh, you have to go back just to see that.</span> <span id="s922">There is a sculpture -- what I remember is there is always a siesta in Italy so from 12 to two everything is closed and if you get there at two you are the first.</span> <span id="s923">So, I went there at two o'clock when they just opened and I walked into Moses and honest to God Moses talked to me and it was such a fantastic feeling because it looks like a real live man even his veins on his hands, it is a magnificent monument.</span> <span id="s924">So, I came out a different person after I talked to Moses.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q.</span> <span id="s926">What did you talk to him about?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A.</span> <span id="s928">About the whole thing how we survived and what we did and he should look after Wallenberg if he meets him, but I said Wallenberg isn't there yet.</span> <span id="s929">I just talked, it was stupid but it was a marvelous feeling.</span> <span id="s930">I felt like a different person because this is the most fantastic monument you ever see.</span> <span id="s931">And of course I went to the Vatican and I went to the church there and see -- I walked around everywhere I did before.</span> <span id="s932">It was nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">From Rome already the ambassador's girlfriend was with us.</span> <span id="s934">She was a Hungarian countess too, and unfortunately she died in tuberculosis in Stockholm.</span> <span id="s935">Would you believe that?</span> <span id="s936">She was with us.</span> <span id="s937">She was the one who came with us.</span> <span id="s938">She and that Swedish lady who was the former Swedish consul's wife then everybody left by airplane except the three of us and that was the German woman, one Hungarian who was married to a Swedish girl and myself.</span> <span id="s939">We were the only ones who stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q.</span> <span id="s941">You wanted to stay?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A. No, but that's how they managed.</span> <span id="s943">These people were very important.</span> <span id="s944">The two girls, the parents were waiting.</span> <span id="s945">The other one was with the Scotland Yard.</span> <span id="s946">The other one was a girlfriend of -- so they had to go.</span> <span id="s947">All right, that doesn't matter because I was not in danger and in Switzerland I have this enormously big family.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">So, it was very exciting to see my family because I have a very famous aunt and uncle.</span> <span id="s949">She was a concert pianist and my uncle was a conductor and so forth.</span> <span id="s950">So, they picked me up and all my cousins and it was a great thing that I am alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q. Where was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A.</span> <span id="s953">In Zurich.</span> <span id="s954">We went on an overnight train to Zurich from _____________ or somewhere.</span> <span id="s955">I don't know.</span> <span id="s956">It was quite a long way from Rome to the station.</span> <span id="s957">Except that maybe we shouldn't put down on there that my family didn't believe a word I told them.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q. Tell me about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A. My uncle turned to my aunt and he said, the war must have done something to her mind.</span> <span id="s960">She's lying and every time the phone rang then he said, that's maybe the Swedish ambassador.</span> <span id="s961">It was a very bad four weeks and when the phone rang and it was the Norwegian ambassador they couldn't believe that I was told that the three of us will leave a Norwegian Red Cross bus to Denmark and then from there we go to Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q.</span> <span id="s963">So you tried to explain to them --?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A. Oh, I told them what Wallenberg did but they weren't interested.</span> <span id="s965">Not at all, such a man doesn't exist.</span> <span id="s966">It's all a lie.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q.</span> <span id="s968">Why do you think they weren't interested?</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A. Not interested because that's how the Swiss were.</span> <span id="s970">I have a cousin whose parents were killed in the Danube.</span> <span id="s971">He was the only one that survived somehow, but then he was taken to either Bergen-Belsun or Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s972">I don't know which one was liberated by the Russians and then the Russians wanted to take him to Siberia and he figured he has an uncle and an aunt in Switzerland he's going to jump train, and he did.</span> <span id="s973">What they did to him and they could see the number, the Swiss had hit him so badly he still has cuts on his head for three days.</span> <span id="s974">It was incredible.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">So finally, somehow somebody felt sorry and somebody finally called my uncle and then my uncle brought him home.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q.</span> <span id="s977">Why were the Swiss attacking him?</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A. Because that's how they were.</span> <span id="s979">They had too good a life all their life.</span> <span id="s980">They did that to us too.</span> <span id="s981">When we were about to leave the Swiss had everything.</span> <span id="s982">They had enough food but even home I wanted a little more butter.</span> <span id="s983">My uncle said that's on coupons, you can't have more butter.</span> <span id="s984">I hadn't seen butter for the past six years.</span> <span id="s985">In Rumania they had not much butter at that time either.</span> <span id="s986">But in any case we were standing in a long line together on the bus and had to go through customs and I was the last one, thank God, and I see the custom officers knew that we had to go through the town up Germany, through Nuremberg and all.</span> <span id="s987">There was no food, no nothing.</span> <span id="s988">They took all the food away from everyone.</span> <span id="s989">They took all the money away from every one.</span> <span id="s990">So, while there was such a long line I went into the bathroom, I took the money and put it in my shoe.</span> <span id="s991">I figured at least I have a few pennies.</span> <span id="s992">Could you imagine that the Swiss took everything away and they knew that we're going through a country where there's no food for three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q. Had your family in Switzerland heard anything about the camps, about the deportations?</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A. Oh, they probably had but they didn't believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q. None of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A.</span> <span id="s997">Now of course because suddenly when Lutz, the ambassador from Switzerland I don't know if you know that he was taken with Raoul.</span> <span id="s998">They have their name down everywhere and the Swiss government picked up the phone and called the Soviets and said we have three spies of yours here.</span> <span id="s999">Do you want them back?</span> <span id="s1000">We want Lutz back.</span> <span id="s1001">Lutz was home in a week.</span> <span id="s1002">We called the Swedish prime minister, we had at that time a Swedish spy for Russia ______________.</span> <span id="s1003">He was the biggest spy and he was in a Swedish jail and we suggested to give him back to the Russians for Raoul and they said it's not worth it to get into war with the Russians for one man and international law wouldn't allow us.</span> <span id="s1004">So, Raoul stayed.</span> <span id="s1005">Lutz was home in a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Now, about ten years ago, finally they made a committee for Lutz and the committee mentioned that he helped Raoul and so forth.</span> <span id="s1007">His wife just died and then they started to believe that these things really happened.</span> <span id="s1008">But in the mean time my family, my uncle and aunt died and now they're helping me.</span> <span id="s1009">I'm waiting for that letter maybe it will come eventually that a little boy, who was my cousin teaching, he wrote a wonderful thing about Raoul and they want to send me.</span> <span id="s1010">So, we will see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">It was amazing.</span> <span id="s1012">It was hurting me terribly because I needed all the being with us, and the other thing in Geneva -- I went off to Geneva for a couple of days because we had very, very dear friends there.</span> <span id="s1013">He was an orthodox Jew and she wasn't.</span> <span id="s1014">She was Swiss.</span> <span id="s1015">He was Hungarian.</span> <span id="s1016">They actually lived together.</span> <span id="s1017">They were not married.</span> <span id="s1018">And that was what Raoul always said, that he's color blind and religious blind.</span> <span id="s1019">He only knows two people, the good and the bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">During the years when Papa knew what's going to happen we took all our jewelry and fur coats out to Switzerland and left it with this friend in Geneva, not with our family in Zurich but in Geneva.</span> <span id="s1021">Fur coats and money and then because in Hungary when you left you always had to go to the bank and if you're going for two weeks then so much money you can take.</span> <span id="s1022">So we'd go over there and in three days we'd come home that we spend all the money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">So now I am in Zurich and I call up Aunt Nelli, this is Aggi.</span> <span id="s1024">You're alive, you're alive.</span> <span id="s1025">I said I am.</span> <span id="s1026">Wonderful.</span> <span id="s1027">I said Poppy said I should ask you to please give me some money because I'm going to get married in Sweden and I need money.</span> <span id="s1028">Quiet in the phone and he comes to the phone and he said your father wrote us during the war and we have given back all the money.</span> <span id="s1029">I said Uncle Otto, we couldn't correspond during the war, how could Poppy ask you for the money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">So, suddenly I said I'm coming to Geneva and so he says when and I said I don't know but I'll come.</span> <span id="s1031">I thought if I tell them -- so the first trip I did in Geneva was a darling friend of ours who was a Swiss whose wife now lived with him too.</span> <span id="s1032">He left him and now lived with him too.</span> <span id="s1033">He had a big clothes factory and I walked into Andre and Andre started to cry.</span> <span id="s1034">In French, too, you're alive, you're alive.</span> <span id="s1035">I said Andre what happened to our friends.</span> <span id="s1036">He said you won't believe it, but they stole everybody's money away.</span> <span id="s1037">They played poker.</span> <span id="s1038">Now, you see these are Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1039">Every penny we had.</span> <span id="s1040">Everything we had.</span> <span id="s1041">I asked for the fur coat, they looked at each other, oh the fur store burned down.</span> <span id="s1042">Those girls whom I saved I told you their mother was our best friend and she was very rich and she left her money in Germany with a Christian lawyer and she left.</span> <span id="s1043">About she was here two years already in '51 or '53 when finally she gets a note from the lawyer that finally I found you.</span> <span id="s1044">I tripled your money, come and get it.</span> <span id="s1045">So, you see, it's not because one is a Jew and one is a Christian.</span> <span id="s1046">There are bad people.</span> <span id="s1047">Here are our best friends and they steal everything because they're going to die anyhow.</span> <span id="s1048">They're the ones who sent me home.</span> <span id="s1049">They said go home, nothing is going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Funny, heartbreaking and I remember I went then to Sweden, it was already October and I was called and ________________ it means you are very capable and I wrote her a letter and I said could you please send me some money I need a winter coat and the answer was you are so capable you will get it yourself.</span> <span id="s1051">So, this is life.</span> <span id="s1052">I guess my uncle and aunt sort of behaved the same way.</span> <span id="s1053">It wasn't interesting, it's not true.</span> <span id="s1054">Now it's too late.</span> <span id="s1055">Now they believe in it, but so what.</span> <span id="s1056">It was a heart break.</span> <span id="s1057">It was a heart break because I couldn't believe it that they don't believe me.</span> <span id="s1058">And of course later on they started to believe but it was too late.</span> <span id="s1059">So, I was happy when I left Switzerland, but then it took us three days through Germany and we saw the Germans come like this and the Americans are -- they just walk because they were prisoners.</span> <span id="s1060">The Germans were prisoners.</span> <span id="s1061">But the funny part was that you read in my book too that the bus drivers for this Norwegian Red Cross were all German war prisoners and they still had the swastika besides it.</span> <span id="s1062">None of the Norwegians would open their mouth in German.</span> <span id="s1063">So, they asked everybody who speaks German and I stupidly said I do and I sat with these German war prisoners, the Jewish kid, and everything was written in English.</span> <span id="s1064">Be careful, no road, be careful no bridge and I had to translate and I thought to myself if you would know that it's a Jewish girl who tells you what to do.</span> <span id="s1065">But we made it to Denmark and the Danes were absolutely incredible.</span> <span id="s1066">What they did they built us a camp there, there must have been a thousand showers with the hot water running like crazy and they made us food and they told -- the Norwegians they didn't eat much in the years before, don't give us so much food we'll get sick.</span> <span id="s1067">But you could not eat when you look at the lox and the cheeses and I mean they were incredible.</span> <span id="s1068">The Danes were absolutely fantastic.</span> <span id="s1069">Then the next day they showed us a little bit and then we were put ont he same boat where they get the Jews from Denmark to Sweden and when we got to Sweden these two people were still with me, this one man who was married to a Swede and this German woman, and the three of us when and when we arrived there suddenly the detectives who came said you cannot get into the country.</span> <span id="s1070">I said I cannot go into Sweden, why no?</span> <span id="s1071">No, we got the report that you can't get into Sweden.</span> <span id="s1072">I said to myself, oh my God, what kind of a stupid thing is that and the two people said well if she can't go then we don't leave either.</span> <span id="s1073">We stay here with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">So, in any case that too turned what happened.</span> <span id="s1075">People do things and they still do it.</span> <span id="s1076">In Geneva one of my friends got married and this guy has written to the Swedish newspapers.</span> <span id="s1077">He was a newspaper man and he interviewed me.</span> <span id="s1078">I was the first one, and he was fascinated by the story and I didn't know that these people twisting the words and write what they feel like.</span> <span id="s1079">So, in any case I told him the whole story about how wonderful and how very thankful we are to the Swedish government for what they done for us because without them we wouldn't be alive and here and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">And so they said okay they let me in and we had to go to a ______________ and all three of us went because they said they won't let me alone, and in the morning very early a knock on the door and it's one of these detectives with a big smile.</span> <span id="s1081">I'm inviting you for breakfast and I said they changed their mind and sure enough we had a fantastic breakfast with the three of us and then we were invited to the police chief who couldn't speak much English or German but he was crying.</span> <span id="s1082">He took me in his arm and he kept on showing me from the Swedish newspaper an article and I had no idea that that's the article we made in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1083">What I found out where the whole mistake come from is that this idiot instead of saying I'm going to Sweden and get married, he said in government business I'm going first to Oslo.</span> <span id="s1084">So, they though, oh, she's a communist.</span> <span id="s1085">She's coming here from the communist government.</span> <span id="s1086">Can you believe that?</span> <span id="s1087">We never even talked about Oslo, nothing, but that was in his mind, why not.</span> <span id="s1088">That was very hard because even when I got to Stockholm that was funny because first they asked me if I want to go to my fiance first or where and I said I want to go to his mother's first and his mother was a darling and we couldn't speak each other language but we fell in love with each other.</span> <span id="s1089">It was funny, and she showed everybody the newspaper article and she came with me on the train and on the train she showed everybody who am I and everybody gave me a big smile and a handshake and I had no idea what is in that newspaper.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Until I arrived and there was my so called fiance and other gentlemen and they greeted me like this and I don't know if you know this is the communist greeting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q.</span> <span id="s1092">The fist?</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A.</span> <span id="s1094">The fist but I didn't know, and I said what's this?</span> <span id="s1095">Don't you know this is the communist greeting and I said oh you must be joking.</span> <span id="s1096">I thought they were just making a joke with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Anyway, it turns out in the parliament in Sweden there are communists sitting and the other man was the head of the communist party and my fiance was the second in command, but I didn't know that until sort of a few days.</span> <span id="s1098">It was a very -- it's in the book so I don't want to tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">So anyhow I cried and then the old lady cried because the room they reserved was given away because we came late or something like that and we had to walk for almost half of the night to find a place to sleep, the two of us, the old lady and me and I'd be holding hands and we kissed each other.</span> <span id="s1100">We were lonely.</span> <span id="s1101">So, the next day when I called up the Swedish embassy they were all happy and they made me mad.</span> <span id="s1102">The first question was why did you go to Oslo?</span> <span id="s1103">Then I found out what was in the newspaper.</span> <span id="s1104">I said I never said that and then I cried very bitterly.</span> <span id="s1105">Finally here I am arriving and everything is a misunderstanding.</span> <span id="s1106">And I said, do me one favor, could you please find out about my fiance.</span> <span id="s1107">I know I have to marry him and I will, but if he is a communist I am not going to get married.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">In one day I find out and they said yes and you don't have to marry him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q.</span> <span id="s1110">So you really had expected to marry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A.</span> <span id="s1112">After all he saved my life, but I also found out he was never in love with me.</span> <span id="s1113">It was just nice that he could save me, and I wasn't in love with him but that's all I could do for my Swedish government to marry the man, and if he wouldn't have been a communist I would have married him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q.</span> <span id="s1115">You would have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A. Yes, because that was what I had to do.</span> <span id="s1117">They paid me all those months to be alive and to do things and Raoul saved 100,000 so how can I say no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q.</span> <span id="s1119">So it wasn't just to protect you while you were in Budapest?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A. No, I thought that a decent thing to do if a man goes in all this trouble to do that, but I found out and they found out that he's a communist.</span> <span id="s1121">Thank God that let me off.</span> <span id="s1122">For years they wanted the money and then suddenly I got a letter after maybe ten years that I don't have to pay anything back, thank God, because I could never afford it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">But you know life is not easy.</span> <span id="s1124">So anyhow from Switzerland as I said you went to Denmark and from Denmark to Sweden and finally on October 1945 I was already in Sweden.</span> <span id="s1125">That's fast.</span> <span id="s1126">That is in my book too that now I needed a job and of course the former Swedish embassy was looking for a____________ and the first thing they said that the Hungarian embassy wants me to work for them and I looked at them and I says hey, you cannot work for the communist but go find out at least what they want and I said if you're staying downstairs in the car I go.</span> <span id="s1127">So, they did naturally.</span> <span id="s1128">It was a very wonderful gentleman there and he spoke to me in Hungarian and he said that the Hungarian government offered me to be the cultural attache and I must have felt like Raoul when he became a so-called diplomat, because he wasn't first in my head he said oh my God, I'm going to be a cultural attache and then the same thought are you crazy to work for the communist government and I turned around and said thank you sir, it's wonderful, but no thank you.</span> <span id="s1129">So, he shook my hands and I left.</span> <span id="s1130">Two days after he dissated himself, this ambassador.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">So, then I needed a job and then I got this job.</span> <span id="s1132">There is, maybe you heard about this, a Swedish institute is an exchange for foreign students but what happened is Prince Bernadat went to Auschwitz to Bergen-Belsen to everywhere and he brought these terribly sick people into Sweden.</span> <span id="s1133">You should have seen the hotels in the country what they made over for rooms for these people.</span> <span id="s1134">They dressed them four times a season and they were allowed to get well there.</span> <span id="s1135">They got all the medical and then they could choose whether they want to go home to their home or if they want to stay in Sweden they can stay in Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">So then they turned to me and they said we do need someone who can go out because I spoke at that time, not any more, German I still speak perfect but French, and what language, French, German and Hungarian that I should speak about Swedish literature and culture.</span> <span id="s1137">I thought to myself, how the hell will I do that?</span> <span id="s1138">I know nothing.</span> <span id="s1139">But they said we're giving you a key to the royal library and the books are all translated into German.</span> <span id="s1140">So, I don't know if you ever did and if not then you should read _______________ books, so I took them and I enjoyed every minute.</span> <span id="s1141">They were lovely, lovely books and _______________, two very famous Swedish people.</span> <span id="s1142">Three languages I spoke about these people and their stories and first I thought with sick people they said don't talk long because these people can't stay but they would never let me go.</span> <span id="s1143">Tell us more, tell us more, so I told them more.</span> <span id="s1144">I went over all Sweden and here you can read it in English and Swedish what I done.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q. Do you want to read it to us?</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A. Yes, I want to read it to you.</span> <span id="s1147">It says, "From November 15, 1945 to the expiration of the ___________1945 Miss Agnes Mandel had been commissioned by the Swedish Institute to visit different camps of repatriande and has there given lectures in all 62."</span> <span id="s1148">That's quite a lot.</span> <span id="s1149">"At first when Ms. Mandel was newly arrived in Sweden these lectures treated the Swedish rescuer which in Hungary was directed by Attache Raoul Wallenberg --" do you know I had to go down on my knees to be allowed to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1150">I explained to them that those Hungarians may have some families saved by him and you don't let me talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q.</span> <span id="s1152">Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A.</span> <span id="s1154">The same reason why they didn't help him for 50 years.</span> <span id="s1155">"In this work Ms. Mandel took an active part, when it appeared that she acquired a good knowledge of life and condition in Sweden in a very short time she was commissioned to give lectures on Swedish, especially literary subjects.</span> <span id="s1156">Ms. Mandel has given lectures mainly in Hungarian but in French and German through doing so she has shown great ability to keep people's interest alive and fascinated and often difficult audience."</span> <span id="s1157">That's true.</span> <span id="s1158">I will tell you what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">"On carrying out her commission Ms. Mandel was shown great care and attention, concienciousness and ingenuity as our lecturing activity in the camp has ceased for the present and consequently we can not any longer employ Ms. Mandel, we are delighted to give her our very recommendations.</span> <span id="s1160">Stockholm the 5th of June 1946."</span> <span id="s1161">And he just died shortly.</span> <span id="s1162">_____________, he was one of my bosses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">End of Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q.</span> <span id="s1166">So tell me about that work, you would travel all over the country?</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A. All over the country and that's how I learned Swedish because in one place I missed a train and I had to be there and there was a -- they always transporting wood and they said if I don't mind to sit on the top of all the logs with all the workers then I can go.</span> <span id="s1168">And I was delighted and these workers were adorable and they were speaking Swedish to me and they were teaching me Swedish songs and we had a wonderful time, me on top of the logs.</span> <span id="s1169">There was a couple of wonderful things and I went all over.</span> <span id="s1170">The Hungarians, they always asked me what do I hear from Budapest I said look you are still sick so wait until you're very healthy because right now my parents write there is not enough food, there is no medication.</span> <span id="s1171">So, the Swedes are looking after you so beautifully so just hold on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">One day I come back from one of the speeches and ___________ calls me and says you can't go anymore and speak and I said why.</span> <span id="s1173">He said you were speaking anti-communists speeches.</span> <span id="s1174">The damn Hungarians did that.</span> <span id="s1175">So, they went around and asked every camp director and they all said she did not.</span> <span id="s1176">These people were asking her and she just said the truth.</span> <span id="s1177">There is no food.</span> <span id="s1178">There is no medication.</span> <span id="s1179">That's nothing anti-communistic in that.</span> <span id="s1180">So, they were very gracious, they paid me back.</span> <span id="s1181">But that month was a horror because I had to eat and I had no money really to speak of so I went to a curtain shop and I had to make the things the things that you're hanging up and I cut all my fingers and I got 25 cents an hour.</span> <span id="s1182">It was horrifying and then they called me back and they paid me back those months I was out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Then I got a wonderful partner whose family became my best friends and he was showing Swedish films so the two of us went and one day the boss said that he wants to come with me and hear me and I said okay but I am a person when I start talking I forget the surroundings and the only problem was that my dear partner was outside and he was making faces at me and I didn't know whether I should start laughing or doing my job.</span> <span id="s1184">He was naughty.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Sure enough I stopped after 20 minutes and my boss looks at me and says can you talk longer.</span> <span id="s1186">I said sure, sir, I said because they don't move.</span> <span id="s1187">So, I spoke for an hour and that's how I became -- 62 speeches was not bad.</span> <span id="s1188">And then it ceased all together and I needed a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q. Let me ask you before you go on, were the people who were in the camps who you were talking to, would they tell you what had happened to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A. No, but there were a couple of wonderful surprises for instance there was a German boy, boy, by that time he was 25 or 26, and he lost everybody.</span> <span id="s1191">Suddenly he comes up to me and says in German, would you like me to quote some ____________ poems to you and I just stood there and I cried because a man who went through what he did, that he still had the heart to tell me _________ poems.</span> <span id="s1192">So, they never talked what happened there.</span> <span id="s1193">They didn't want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1194">They rather hear what is going to happen to them now, some of them were happy to be able to go home.</span> <span id="s1195">Some of them had no family to go to and some of them just wanted to give me a beautiful poem for what I have done for them so many times it was a very emotional trip.</span> <span id="s1196">Also, in one day I had to go in one place and it was heavy snow and we had to go through the woods and when the taxi driver picked me it -- it was actually a big car, not a taxi, and it was snowing and gorgeous moonlit night and yet it was snowing too and he looks at me and he says do you speak a little Swedish.</span> <span id="s1197">I said by now I do.</span> <span id="s1198">He said do you like Beethoven.</span> <span id="s1199">I said yes, he said because the Beethoven ninth symphony is starting and our trip is as long as the Beethoven ninth symphony.</span> <span id="s1200">I never forget that I cried all the way because it was such an incredible feeling to listen to this and go through those magnificent trees and that quietness that there is no car coming forward or backward.</span> <span id="s1201">You're just going with Beethoven's ninth and sure enough when the last note came out there we were and I was like that, shaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">This was all miracles, it was like God wanted to give me something beautiful because he knows I like it.</span> <span id="s1203">There is a driver, a wonderful man who thought that I would like it.</span> <span id="s1204">He was lucky because maybe I'd say I only like rock and roll, but no I did like it.</span> <span id="s1205">It was a wonderful feeling and that gave you the satisfaction of what you're doing that you get a little extra emotional good for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q.</span> <span id="s1207">What did you think when you were in those camps?</span> <span id="s1208">Were they mostly men, women?</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A. Men and women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q.</span> <span id="s1211">What were you thinking as you met them and saw them.</span> <span id="s1212">How did they look?</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A.</span> <span id="s1214">How did they look?</span> <span id="s1215">By now many of them looked satisfied because they lived through it.</span> <span id="s1216">There was a couple who were married and lived, but most of them didn't know what's going to happen to them because they didn't know if they have a family anywhere.</span> <span id="s1217">Nothing you could tell them, all you could is hug them and kiss them and they thanked me that these stories I'm telling them it's such a wonderful way that they can live in a dream now.</span> <span id="s1218">It was incredible in each of them.</span> <span id="s1219">Even the French, they said they don't know if they'll go home to France if they find anybody.</span> <span id="s1220">But most of them stayed in Sweden, and it is interesting how you eventually meet people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">How many years have gone since '46.</span> <span id="s1222">I went back to Sweden with my husband when I took the book with me to the medical meeting and in the hotel downstairs there was an Orefers store, you know the Orefers glassware and I had broken a few.</span> <span id="s1223">I got that from my Swedish friend as a wedding present.</span> <span id="s1224">They sent it to me.</span> <span id="s1225">I walked in and there is a middle age lady who speaks very good Swedish selling me these things and she went out of her way and I also felt something.</span> <span id="s1226">Sometimes you have these feelings and she said I send everything to you.</span> <span id="s1227">The next day I came down, I somehow couldn't forget her and I come down again and I saw an ice bucket the same thing and I thought why don't I buy that too.</span> <span id="s1228">I walk in again and I tell her and I said may I ask you a question.</span> <span id="s1229">Are you Swedish?</span> <span id="s1230">She says, no I'm not, I'm German, but I was here in camp and I married a Swede and I have two sons.</span> <span id="s1231">I looked at her and I said by any chance would you remember me.</span> <span id="s1232">She said I have the feeling I do.</span> <span id="s1233">I said I was the one who came and spoke and we found out that I was the one and she was the one and it was also such a magnificent feeling that she would be the one who is there.</span> <span id="s1234">Then I come back and tell my _________ who are old friends of mine and the woman said, this is my cousin.</span> <span id="s1235">Small world.</span> <span id="s1236">Since then she went back to Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">So, they don't forget because after all I had a story and that's why she was so nice to me that she had the feeling that somewhere somehow she met me and I had the same feeling with her so I just had to buy that one more thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q.</span> <span id="s1239">Now you stayed in Sweden for several years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A. Three years and what was wonderful when this ceased in '46 I needed a job and I didn't know yet and I was sure that the ligation would come along with something and it was a Sunday afternoon and I will never forget and I was boarding with someone, I had a room.</span> <span id="s1241">She wasn't home and I was in the bathtub.</span> <span id="s1242">I enjoyed just to rest and the phone rings and I said should I pick up the phone it won't be for me anyhow.</span> <span id="s1243">But I figured I put on the towel and I answered the phone and somebody asked me if it's me and I said yes.</span> <span id="s1244">It turned out it was a director of a Swedish bank.</span> <span id="s1245">Now, in retrospect I found out it was the Wallenberg bank.</span> <span id="s1246">They said would I come in on Monday morning, the next day -- oh in the meantime, I forgot, I have been a maid in a big hotel because they paid very well and after a week they wanted to make me a supervisor.</span> <span id="s1247">Well, that's all I need all my life is to be a maid and a supervisor.</span> <span id="s1248">I was very tired and Sunday I wasn't in and I thought this has to end somewhere even though I earn very nicely but who wants to stay a maid.</span> <span id="s1249">When this phone rings, would I come in on Monday morning they have a job for me.</span> <span id="s1250">So, I called up the hotel and I said I'm sorry I'm sick and I got a job in the foreign check department and I was there almost two years.</span> <span id="s1251">Fabulous salary and they were absolutely magnificent to me.</span> <span id="s1252">I taught them English and they taught me Swedish and it was a wonderful bank.</span> <span id="s1253">We had the restaurant upstairs with white gloved waiters giving us food.</span> <span id="s1254">It was just wonderful and I got myself a little apartment and one day I came home and I look up and there are curtains.</span> <span id="s1255">I said that's not my apartment.</span> <span id="s1256">The whole apartment was furnished.</span> <span id="s1257">It turned out my colleagues did that.</span> <span id="s1258">Usually when a VIP comes they can sleep over in an apartment, there's an apartment in the bank, but there is also a vault with all kinds of furniture and they went to the management and they said could we take out some furniture and furnish Aggi's apartment and he said yes.</span> <span id="s1259">By the time I came home it was completely furnished.</span> <span id="s1260">They were wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q.</span> <span id="s1262">Now your parents were still in Budapest at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A. Papa came out once and that was when I first came to Sweden and I made the friend, I told you the publisher who tried to help me.</span> <span id="s1264">They were Protestant and they had sort of a religious thing and I told them about the Protestant churches how much they did for the Jews.</span> <span id="s1265">In my book, if you remember, that he came to my house and he said I want my seventh daughter here to be baptized and he baptized me.</span> <span id="s1266">Later on he became the Bishop of Hungary so my father went to him and said Aggi has good connections, maybe we could get some money for the church.</span> <span id="s1267">If you help me to get a passport I will go out.</span> <span id="s1268">So, Papa came first and sure enough I took him to __________ and _________ got a magnificent check that Papa took back to Hungary.</span> <span id="s1269">Just before they closed the curtain, I managed to get them their visas to come to Sweden, and they did.</span> <span id="s1270">The last minute, and those two Russians helped them and my other friend whose money was in Germany and they got it back, she and her one daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q. I think it was right around then that you moved from Sweden?</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A. Now, then suddenly overnight everyone in Sweden started to learn Russian.</span> <span id="s1273">It was terribly disturbing, so I thought well maybe we can all go to America.</span> <span id="s1274">The American quota for Hungarians were closed for 11 years.</span> <span id="s1275">So, the only place I could go was Australia and I thought Australia would be a wonderful place to go and I can bring my parents up.</span> <span id="s1276">I'm sure I will make a fortune over there.</span> <span id="s1277">Nice little dreams.</span> <span id="s1278">But again, do you know the Swedish government helped me with money although I almost became a Swedish citizen and they helped me so I can get on the boat and get out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">I had to leave my parents behind which was terrible, but we had friends in Australia and as I said we were hoping that I will make a fortune.</span> <span id="s1280">Well, it didn't work.</span> <span id="s1281">It's the first time in my life in Australia that they almost committed suicide because nothing worked.</span> <span id="s1282">I couldn't get a good job, I mean it was horrifying.</span> <span id="s1283">It's also in the book I think.</span> <span id="s1284">So, then miracles always happen and the miracle was that suddenly after six years the American embassy called and said I get the visa and I said you people said that the visa is closed for 11 years and the ambassador looked at me and said yes but in the mean time we found out about Wallenberg and you.</span> <span id="s1285">I said thank you, but you have to be there by June and this was April and I had not a penny to my name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">So, I have a cousin here in this country and they helped and I went on a cargo boat, seven weeks from Australia to Boston.</span> <span id="s1287">I become -- did you ever here the soroptomists.</span> <span id="s1288">I was working, at one time it was quite a good job, as a hostess in a restaurant in Sydney and these ladies always came in there and they saw me working and how I worked and they knew that I was the head or the supervisor there.</span> <span id="s1289">One day the one lady said to me, gee I would like you to be a soroptamist.</span> <span id="s1290">I said what is a soroptimist.</span> <span id="s1291">I was never very much a woman's woman.</span> <span id="s1292">So, she explained to me what an international club it is, and it's only 75 years old.</span> <span id="s1293">The Rotary club did it, and I said no.</span> <span id="s1294">Would you like to be one?</span> <span id="s1295">I said well if you take me.</span> <span id="s1296">So, this is the first time that I suddenly got friends and that also saved me, so I became a soroptomist there.</span> <span id="s1297">So, then just shortly before I left I had one penny to my name and seven weeks on a boat where we probably have to stop and I said how can I go completely without anything.</span> <span id="s1298">Suddenly out of the blue this lady says to me one of the soroptomists that she is coming to America and there is a new law -- I don't think that doesn't exist -- if you come as a tourist you have to have $500 in the bank.</span> <span id="s1299">Would I take the $500 and put it in the bank.</span> <span id="s1300">So, in the seven weeks I spent $20 out of that $500 and I arrived at Boston and these people who stole all our money, their son lived there with his wife and they knew the whole story and of course they wanted to do everything for me, but he's a darling man.</span> <span id="s1301">Unfortunately he died a few years ago and there was a lot of ladies there, 8:00 in the morning in Boston.</span> <span id="s1302">First one officers comes to me and says Aggi, do you smell it?</span> <span id="s1303">I said smell what?</span> <span id="s1304">He said Boston beans.</span> <span id="s1305">So help me God I could smell the Boston beans.</span> <span id="s1306">When you arrive in the station somehow you are way up with the boat and everything else is all the way down and there is these elegant women with hats and gloves and somebody looks up and says Agnes is that you?</span> <span id="s1307">I said yes, who are you?</span> <span id="s1308">We are the soroptimists.</span> <span id="s1309">They followed the boat for seven weeks the president of Sydney wrote them and for seven weeks they followed it and they were there that morning.</span> <span id="s1310">June, windy June morning, I think the 10th I arrived 1951 and there they were and there was a British soroptimist who were just going so they turned to my friends and they said would you allow her to come with us tonight as cocktail party we want to make a good bye party for the British and a hello party for Agnes and he said yes.</span> <span id="s1311">That was the first time I saw t.v. in my life.</span> <span id="s1312">There was no t.v. and the one I saw was -- what was every Sunday afternoon -- Ed Sullivan.</span> <span id="s1313">And I always watched him until he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q. Is that the first thing you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q. I wonder who was on the show.</span> <span id="s1317">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A.</span> <span id="s1319">That I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1320">I only remember him and the show and the t.v. and what a bash these people put on.</span> <span id="s1321">My God, the best lox you can have and -- it was gorgeous.</span> <span id="s1322">Champagne and all that.</span> <span id="s1323">But the funny part was that I felt like I was the queen of Sheba.</span> <span id="s1324">You arrive in Kier as an immigrant and besides me was an Australian young woman with her Canadian fiance or opposite.</span> <span id="s1325">They opened every little bag of theirs they have, and I come out with two of these ladies and the custom officer gives me a big smile.</span> <span id="s1326">Welcome to our country and he did just like this and I was out.</span> <span id="s1327">I said what, they didn't even open nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">So, it was funny.</span> <span id="s1329">Then these women said that I should stay in Boston and they will help me to get a job and I have to be the soroptimist there and I called up my best friend and their little daughter was three years old by that time and the little one was six months old and I called up and I said I'm here and I'm going to stay in Boston.</span> <span id="s1330">They offered me big jobs and the little one comes to the phone and said I washed my teeth and you're not coming to New York.</span> <span id="s1331">I left next morning for New York because I never disappointed a child.</span> <span id="s1332">And that's what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Q. Now, I'm wondering during this time did you talk once you were in Sweden, Australia, here in New York, did you talk to anybody about what happened during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A. Only with the speeches, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q. Not to your friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A.</span> <span id="s1337">But my friends all knew.</span> <span id="s1338">Most of the people don't like to talk about it, would you believe that, actually refused to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1339">Now about ten years ago I made the speech before the American Jewish Women's Congress and I said you people didn't help us at all.</span> <span id="s1340">Oh, we sent packages.</span> <span id="s1341">I said what packages.</span> <span id="s1342">We didn't have any Red Cross, only the Swiss.</span> <span id="s1343">We never heard from you people.</span> <span id="s1344">We never heard that you might want a child out or something so the president got up and I was very surprised and she looked at me and she said I'm embarrassed to tell you we did not help.</span> <span id="s1345">We were afraid that when those foreigners coming in here they will take our job.</span> <span id="s1346">I just read a book now from a man who is now in Jerusalem and he wrote about this whole time.</span> <span id="s1347">Not one Jew helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">So how can you talk to people.</span> <span id="s1349">They're not interested and they feel guilty today because I think many, many thousands of people could have been saved.</span> <span id="s1350">Do you remember the St. Louis, the boat?</span> <span id="s1351">I have a friend today, he's a professor here and he was on that boat, but he lucky he jumped the boat in France and then he came back another way.</span> <span id="s1352">Now, those were not right things, so people don't like to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1353">No Christians or Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q. Tell me about meeting your husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A.</span> <span id="s1356">This was very funny.</span> <span id="s1357">When I came here on the way my parents were going to Argentina.</span> <span id="s1358">So, I came here in '51 and of course I got jobs immediately and that was very funny because when I said Stoffer's is looking for a hostess that my girlfriend said they don't take Jews.</span> <span id="s1359">I said why?</span> <span id="s1360">Oh, you will see.</span> <span id="s1361">So, I went to fifth Avenue and they asked questions, the interview, and this wonderful woman asked me did you ever do this job before and I said yes, in Australia but I also had to do the waitress job besides.</span> <span id="s1362">He said you're hired.</span> <span id="s1363">She didn't ask me what religion nothing.</span> <span id="s1364">She only wanted to know if I know what I'm doing.</span> <span id="s1365">So, I've been there.</span> <span id="s1366">Then while I was working at Stoffer's a lot of people came in from the airlines and they were eating there because it was right at grand central and they were at 42nd Street.</span> <span id="s1367">There's a lovely, the concession people who sold the newspapers and all they always came and we talked and one day I said could I get a job with the airlines?</span> <span id="s1368">He said sure we'll bring you the papers out and they even brought me a typewriter because the afternoon we always had two hours time and I typed it.</span> <span id="s1369">Then I came home and said to -- I was already having the apartment I think, I said hey, it looks like I'm getting a job with the airlines.</span> <span id="s1370">They don't take Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1371">I said you said that when I went to Stoffer's and nobody every asked me.</span> <span id="s1372">I said I can try.</span> <span id="s1373">They never asked me anything.</span> <span id="s1374">They just said would you like to work for us and I said yes and I worked 12 years for TWA.</span> <span id="s1375">Nobody every asked me.</span> <span id="s1376">If you don't work you're kicked out never mind if you're Jewish or Christian.</span> <span id="s1377">But you can't talk to the people, they don't want to hear it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Even this friend's sister, who I also call my little sister, she came to my speeches, she said don't talk so long, just cut it down.</span> <span id="s1379">I said Olivia, they have to hear about everything.</span> <span id="s1380">Don't tell me to cut it down.</span> <span id="s1381">So, is it right to speak about it is should we shut up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q. You're speaking about it now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A. Yes, but is it right or should we not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q. I think you should</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A. See, because everybody took this differently but most of the people who went through it they either take it with a smile and say hey I'm going to work and I make a life out of it, like I did.</span> <span id="s1386">My cousin here, the ones who helped me to pay, the first thing he said, I came on a Wednesday and Sunday they came to my friend's house and he said he has a big chemical factory and he wants me as a bookkeeper and I looked at him and I said well thank you but may I say no and they all looked at me that I say no to a job.</span> <span id="s1387">I said I'll tell you why Bobby, because I never made bookkeeping, so if I don't do the right job you can't put me out because I am family.</span> <span id="s1388">If I don't like it I can't leave you because I'm family.</span> <span id="s1389">Do me one favor.</span> <span id="s1390">If I can't get another job may I come back to you?</span> <span id="s1391">He was shocked, but he said well yes, and I got myself the jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q. Tell me how you met your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A.</span> <span id="s1394">So finally the first week that I was at my girlfriend's place the phone rang and somebody said that they needed a mother's help for Fire Island.</span> <span id="s1395">My friend said I don't know anybody and I kicked her and oh, that's right, Aggi's here.</span> <span id="s1396">She wants to come.</span> <span id="s1397">So, they paid $25, that's in 1951 was a lot of money for the week.</span> <span id="s1398">I went to Fire Island and I was shocked out of my life because I had never seen two men kissing and that was the park they had two little boys.</span> <span id="s1399">I said how can you bring your boys around here?</span> <span id="s1400">Oh, nothings going to happen.</span> <span id="s1401">So, twenty-five dollars it was a fortune so from that $25 the first thing I did was buy the Philadelphia Symphony season ticket for myself and my cousin's son because he liked music.</span> <span id="s1402">And I bought my first papers because at that time, today when you come you just get the green card, but at that time you have to get the first paper.</span> <span id="s1403">So, I remember going there and I was here a week and tell the lady that I would like to have my first papers and that $10 and she said when did you come to this country and I said last week.</span> <span id="s1404">She looks at me and says I am working here 25 years.</span> <span id="s1405">You are the first one who comes, other people are here two or three years before they asked for it.</span> <span id="s1406">I said well not me, I want it now, and I got it.</span> <span id="s1407">So the $25 went, but it was lovely.</span> <span id="s1408">So, then I got it from my other friend and then the parents arrived in '57 and Daddy didn't really like music but he loved us and he came with us and we all the way up on top because they were cheap.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">Q. Where was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">A. Carnegie.</span> <span id="s1411">At that time they had ten concerts a year and it was delightful and at that time you could go on the subways or it was okay for us to come home in the night.</span> <span id="s1412">My parents also had an apartment on Burn Street.</span> <span id="s1413">I paid that for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">And in 1958 I think it was, -- '59 or '60 season Papa said don't buy me a ticket dear because it's very hard for me to get on those steps.</span> <span id="s1415">I said okay, I'll just buy it for Mommy and me.</span> <span id="s1416">This was a very short -- we were only Mama, Papa, and a lady whom I'd known for many, many years and we were very good friends.</span> <span id="s1417">It was an old lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">So, anyhow, my husband he was a big music lover.</span> <span id="s1419">He himself was playing the flute, he plays quite a good piano.</span> <span id="s1420">He almost became a pianist but he said if you don't know how to write music then it's no use so he became a doctor.</span> <span id="s1421">That's his story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Anyhow he also wanted to ___________ because he liked the Boston Symphony and he wanted the Philadelphia Symphony.</span> <span id="s1423">He had no idea that he can't just call up and he gets a season ticket.</span> <span id="s1424">One day he's with a friend in a car and they had to stop for the red light and he says you go to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1425">I'll go in and try to buy a season ticket and he bought my father's ticket.</span> <span id="s1426">Papa said it was written in the stars.</span> <span id="s1427">Isn't that funny?</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">At that time he had a crew cut, well he was Oriental.</span> <span id="s1429">There was Mommy and me and there was him and then the old lady.</span> <span id="s1430">We always went early with Mommy in the evening and so he was always there.</span> <span id="s1431">He found out we're coming early so he got up and he said good evening.</span> <span id="s1432">That's all he could speak, almost no other English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">About the second month or the third month the old lady turns to him which is unusual and he said young man are you Chinese?</span> <span id="s1434">So I listened and he said no, I'm Japanese.</span> <span id="s1435">So, now I knew two things he's Japanese and he likes the same music I like.</span> <span id="s1436">The next month again the old lady turns to him and says young man, what are you doing in this country?</span> <span id="s1437">He said I am a doctor and she says medical?</span> <span id="s1438">And he says medical.</span> <span id="s1439">Good, so he knew nothing about me.</span> <span id="s1440">Now, February came.</span> <span id="s1441">It was the coldest horrible February.</span> <span id="s1442">It was snowing, raining, both Mommy and me had a cold.</span> <span id="s1443">My tongue was swollen, but immigrants can't lose money and I said Mommy I'm going with the subway and sell the tickets and come right home.</span> <span id="s1444">So, I went in feverish, and I'm standing in -- at that time it wasn't fixed yet, now it's changed, Carnegie Hall, and it was pretty cold and I'm standing with the two tickets and suddenly in my mind I said gee that little Japanese doctor will be so disappointed if I don't come and besides that it was _______________ who played and a young man comes up and says do you have two tickets and I said no only, and I sold him Mommy's and I go to the phone and I said Mommy ______________ is playing, it's just as well I'm here now I'm going to listen.</span> <span id="s1445">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">So, I go up.</span> <span id="s1447">The whole place is empty.</span> <span id="s1448">I couldn't make the steps.</span> <span id="s1449">I was really sick.</span> <span id="s1450">He came down and he said, "Are you sick?"</span> <span id="s1451">I said to myself, good doctor, he can figure out that I can't make it.</span> <span id="s1452">That was it.</span> <span id="s1453">After that --it's not there anymore --it's the peacock Alley.</span> <span id="s1454">It's down in the village now I think.</span> <span id="s1455">We went in there and we talked until 1:00 in the morning.</span> <span id="s1456">My tongue disappeared, my fever gone.</span> <span id="s1457">It was very funny, but we didn't have time to meet because he was working in the Lebanon Hospital in the Bronx and I had to open my office at 7:00 in the morning so our love affair went over two telephones what he paid at that time.</span> <span id="s1458">Now he wouldn't.</span> <span id="s1459">We were listening to ______________ on two telephones and two radios.</span> <span id="s1460">We drove the family crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">We went on two dates.</span> <span id="s1462">One we went to see The Mouse that Roared, and the second number was Can Can and neither of us had much money so we went to the Brass Rail, right on nd Street and after Can Can we went over there.</span> <span id="s1463">He likes corn beef, a good Jewish boy and I like roast beef and at that time you got a sandwich like this for $1 and that's all we could afford, $2, in the middle of his sandwich he says will you marry me?</span> <span id="s1464">And I thought to myself, yes.</span> <span id="s1465">I had no idea if he's going to go away from here, back to Japan, or what, nothing.</span> <span id="s1466">And he knew nothing about me then.</span> <span id="s1467">But everybody always said, why don't you get married?</span> <span id="s1468">I had a wonderful job with TWA and I earned good money and I could travel around.</span> <span id="s1469">Who needs a husband.</span> <span id="s1470">But this was fascinating to me.</span> <span id="s1471">I thought Oriental, it could be fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">So, we had our engagement in March and then we had a concert and it was awfully funny because the old lady was sitting there and now my husband to be turns around and says excuse me and she was so surprised and he says we are getting married.</span> <span id="s1473">She says what because his English is awful still, and he said we are getting married thanks to you.</span> <span id="s1474">And sure enough she came to the wedding.</span> <span id="s1475">We married in April 27.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q.</span> <span id="s1477">Did you talk to him about the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">A. Oh yes, he cried three weeks.</span> <span id="s1479">The whole honeymoon I told him the Wallenberg story and he told me about their story, the atom bomb and all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q.</span> <span id="s1481">He had been in Japan then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A. Yes, he came here -- he was invited by -- there was a very famous doctor who invited him and he went to England and he got a heart attack in England and then Doctor Goodmacker, you must have heard he's the one who's making the family tree, and he took him over and he came.</span> <span id="s1483">First he was at Mt. Sinai for many, many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Q. Do you think the fact that you both had a history in the war, did that bring you together in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">A. No, because we didn't talk about that.</span> <span id="s1486">We talked about music and this and that.</span> <span id="s1487">We had an absolutely wonderful time so I don't know how a man can change that completely and wholly.</span> <span id="s1488">Constantly all he can say is you will find yourself out in the s street.</span> <span id="s1489">And you should be happy you live under this roof.</span> <span id="s1490">This man lived on me for four years first because he earned $80 a month in the hospital and I earned $500, so whom do you think paid for everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">Then we had the children and I still went to work after, not at TWA but something that I could be home when the children come.</span> <span id="s1492">Everything, I thought that's what a married life should be, to give away, to share.</span> <span id="s1493">My mother was killed, I told you I think and finally after three years got $45,000 which is nothing, $35,000 I built him a ______________ because he likes to paint, he did.</span> <span id="s1494">I build a library for him and I kept $10,000.</span> <span id="s1495">And today, nothing.</span> <span id="s1496">I will find myself out on the street.</span> <span id="s1497">He won't give me for buying a pair of socks.</span> <span id="s1498">It's funny, and yet we had so many beautiful things living.</span> <span id="s1499">He would never have gone to Europe if it's not for me because we went for TWA courtesy $75 for three weeks on our honeymoon.</span> <span id="s1500">Then we went to Rome again for $75.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q. So, he did believe your story?</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">A. Oh, yes, very much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">Q.</span> <span id="s1504">What made you decide to become so active in speaking and talking about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">A. Because it turned out I was the only one who would come out and say I worked with Wallenberg.</span> <span id="s1506">They didn't believe me.</span> <span id="s1507">IT was funny, but after I brought these real papers out, ___________ was the first one who made a Wallenberg committee, and it was a lovely Swedish woman by the name of Lena Kaplan who went with Rabbi Kohl, who was with the Christians and Jews and they made the first Wallenberg committed.</span> <span id="s1508">Then they were looking and advertising for someone who worked so I said I did and they said do you know how many people came and it turned out it wasn't true.</span> <span id="s1509">I said well I have some papers to show.</span> <span id="s1510">Oh, you're the first one with papers to show.</span> <span id="s1511">So then I showed them and they believed but yet you cannot imagine what they did to me, all of them.</span> <span id="s1512">It's incredible.</span> <span id="s1513">The same as with poor Raoul.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">Then maybe you heard the name of the Wallenberg Committed of the U.S.</span> <span id="s1515">That young woman was born after the war.</span> <span id="s1516">She's a Jewish girl from the south and whose house it was forbidden to talk about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1517">She came to New York with her husband and her children went to the same private school where Lena's kids and Lena came in one day to speak about Wallenberg because her parents and Raoul's parents were friends.</span> <span id="s1518">So, she thought to herself she can make a lot of money out of that.</span> <span id="s1519">I would be interested to work with you.</span> <span id="s1520">So, they make her the president and she sat down with me and we had a two hour talk.</span> <span id="s1521">She learned everything from me, and then she says, oh Aggi, you're going to be the secretary of the Wallenberg committee and I looked at her and I said what?</span> <span id="s1522">Secretary?</span> <span id="s1523">No way.</span> <span id="s1524">She says oh, the trouble is you don't speak English and you don't know what you're talking about.</span> <span id="s1525">Do you know what the Secretary of State is?</span> <span id="s1526">I said, yes, I do and certainly there is a huge big difference between a Secretary of State and a secretary of a committee.</span> <span id="s1527">So, we fought and fought and they finally made me a vice president.</span> <span id="s1528">It's a lot of other things, I don't want to get into it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q.</span> <span id="s1530">When you go, you talk a lot to schools, to young people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">A. Yes, I speak to schools, colleges, churches, synagogues, clubs, Rotary, Kiwanis, Lions, whoever invites me I go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">Q.</span> <span id="s1533">What do the young people say when they hear your story?</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">A.</span> <span id="s1535">It depends again where you're going.</span> <span id="s1536">Most of the time the kids are extremely excited and they all want to be Wallenbergs because you have to learn -- first of all when you go to any school, the kids already have a face like this, oh my God I have to listen to another Holocaust story.</span> <span id="s1537">Only about ten years ago it struck me that I can do something about this and I would walk into any big class or something and I said are you kids all dreamers and they look at me and say yes.</span> <span id="s1538">I said, ok then dream that I don't have this grey hair and I was your age.</span> <span id="s1539">It doesn't matter.</span> <span id="s1540">They don't have to know that I was already 26.</span> <span id="s1541">You can't imagine the psychology of this oh we're going to listen to a young person not an old one.</span> <span id="s1542">Already they listen different.</span> <span id="s1543">They all sit like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">Then when you finish telling the story, you don't reach every child, and this is impossible too, but most of the time you do and you're surprised what you get back.</span> <span id="s1545">Because I spoke out in Long Island in a big high school where two young girls from the senior class called me, somebody heard me speaking and told them and they went to their principal and they said we would like to make a remembrance day.</span> <span id="s1546">Thank God they had a principal who wasn't stupid and knew what they're talking about and he said good, let's get people together.</span> <span id="s1547">So, I was the first choice and I was the first speaker in the morning for I don't know how many of the seniors, they have three classes I think, and they invited two wonderful gentlemen who were soldiers who got the people out of these camps so they had the real story because nobody else believes.</span> <span id="s1548">One was a Christian one was a Jew and there was a lady who came out with the children from Germany and so forth.</span> <span id="s1549">So, I was the first speaker in the morning and the kids were just marvelous and they gave marvelous questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Now, somebody brought me home one teacher and so I said now I would like to listen what they talk and sure enough I went in and these two old gentlemen were wonderful and they explained to these youngsters that you are the last people we're talking now so you have to understand that this did happen and don't ever let it happen again, for no one, because what these people suffered and what they will in the future, just remember we are all the same people.</span> <span id="s1551">Now, do you have any questions, and this one tall black boy who was in the class where I spoke, he got up and he took this mike and he said, "Sir, I can hardly talk.</span> <span id="s1552">I listened to Mrs. Adachi, and I hope she's here and he turned around, to these fantastic stories of Mr. Wallenberg, and now I am hearing you telling us the things that the whole United States doesn't believe that it happened.</span> <span id="s1553">I promise you right here that me and all my friends an I hope also those who are not my friends, from now on we will work together and we will make this country as big as you want it, and thank you for all of you speaking to us."</span> <span id="s1554">Do you know what a fantastic feeling that is that the kids feel that yes we can do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">Now, we have the Wallenberg school, you know, the only Wallenberg school in the whole country and today's principal is not that good but the older principal we are now since '82 we are the Wallenberg school and I was always invited to speak to the incoming kids and the outgoing kids.</span> <span id="s1556">The outgoing kids are already in Junior High and High School.</span> <span id="s1557">One of the music teachers went with them and one day I got a call already from the Junior High School, Aggi the kids, mostly the Wallenberg kids are going to play Fiddler on the Roof and they want you to come so they can honor you.</span> <span id="s1558">I said I'd be delighted and I'm sitting there and there is this little boy four feet, blonde blue eyed playing ____________.</span> <span id="s1559">I haven't heard anybody playing ________ like this kid.</span> <span id="s1560">He was adlibbing.</span> <span id="s1561">He talked Hebrew but in my back I'm thinking what I remember about that child.</span> <span id="s1562">Something I remember, I'm sure that he's not a Jewish kid.</span> <span id="s1563">And he was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1564">Two hours they had no intermission.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">When it is all over of course they always brought down the house and the teacher comes to me and says Aggi do you remember Johnny.</span> <span id="s1566">I said yes, but what do I remember?</span> <span id="s1567">She said Johnny has the worst asthma condition.</span> <span id="s1568">I said that's right, and besides he's a Christian who has to learn Hebrew and he came up to me and he said Mrs. Shapiro, I want to be Taviar.</span> <span id="s1569">So, how do you tell a wonderful child that he might not be able to and I tried and I said Honey, first of all you have to learn some Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1570">Okay, that's easy, you are young.</span> <span id="s1571">Secondly, what happens if you suddenly get an attack because there will be no intermission.</span> <span id="s1572">Two hours you will have to be there.</span> <span id="s1573">He said Aggi, Johnny was Wallenberg.</span> <span id="s1574">He was not five foot, he was eight foot tall.</span> <span id="s1575">And this kid was not four but six.</span> <span id="s1576">He looks at me and he says if Raoul and Agnes could do what they did, I can do it.</span> <span id="s1577">Do you believe that.</span> <span id="s1578">And he did it, without ever stopping or coughing because the mind plays enormous tricks and this is a wonderful feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">Then Governor King, who is not a governor anymore he's now the president of Drew College in New Jersey, he invited me when he was a governor to come and speak with him together to high school students and he invited three high schools, all the seniors.</span> <span id="s1580">He was speaking first and then I did and there was always question and answer and I finished my who Raoul story and one boy gets up and says Ms. Adachi, Raoul Wallenberg must have been full of drugs and alcohol to be able to do what he done.</span> <span id="s1581">I looked at the kids and said boy are you stupid and King gave me a big kick in the foot.</span> <span id="s1582">He thought I'm going to be killed from one of the kids, but I am a Wallenberg child and nothing can stop me and I look at this boy in the eye and I said Honey, I am sure you are on drugs aren't you.</span> <span id="s1583">And he did like this and I said then you know what happens to you.</span> <span id="s1584">You know that you take the drugs and you feel in heaven, wonderful maybe an hour or two and then the drug goes and all you can think of is how can I get more drugs more alcohol to feel like I feel before.</span> <span id="s1585">Now, if Raoul Wallenberg would have done that, then he would have lost out helping the people.</span> <span id="s1586">He looks at me for a minute and says I didn't think of that and he sits down and I thought that's the end, but three weeks after I get a phone call from the principal of that school and he laughs but he says oh Agnes what did you do to the boy.</span> <span id="s1587">I said oh my God, did he commit suicide?</span> <span id="s1588">He said hell no, he walked into my office that afternoon and he said Sir I am very highly on drugs and alcohol, can you please take me to a withdrawal place.</span> <span id="s1589">I want to get out of everything.</span> <span id="s1590">He said not only did he get out in three weeks but now he's going around all the schools in New Jersey teaching other youngsters never to get into anything.</span> <span id="s1591">That was another, I looked up and said thanks Raoul.</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q. Do you say that a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s1594">My friends who are in the committee, there is an international committee who goes into find Raoul because we think he is still alive and she says you are a bad influence because all of us feel that Raoul talks to us and it is true, I have gorgeous pictures all the way up in my bedroom of Raoul and the Wallenberg School had the tenth anniversary and it was a whole day affair, morning and evening and I was naturally supposed to be one of the main speakers and I had the worst cold you can imagine and a fever.</span> <span id="s1595">I called dup the school I said, I'm sorry I can't come.</span> <span id="s1596">Aggi, it's impossible we can't do it without you.</span> <span id="s1597">I said I'm sorry, I have a high fever.</span> <span id="s1598">I went to sleep, the middle of the night I wake up so help me God that picture was talking to me.</span> <span id="s1599">It said Aggi get out.</span> <span id="s1600">We did it when we were sick, we did everything, those kids need you, get up.</span> <span id="s1601">I got up, I called the phone I said I'm coming.</span> <span id="s1602">I could hardly speak, but they were very gracious they took a motel around there they took a room for me so after the morning session was over I had three hours sleep and then I went back.</span> <span id="s1603">The other day, this woman who is with ARK and she already got other Americans out of Russia and she's one of the persons and she calls me from Washington and she laughs.</span> <span id="s1604">I said what's the matter.</span> <span id="s1605">She says I'm getting as crazy as you are.</span> <span id="s1606">I said, why what happened.</span> <span id="s1607">I'm sitting here in the Washington Library, the FBI library uncensoring papers and I came to a story what is absolutely incredible and I laughed loud, everybody looked at me, and I said that's it, that's it, and suddenly I feel a hand on my shoulder and Raoul says, that's it, Susan, go.</span> <span id="s1608">That's my story.</span> <span id="s1609">So help me God he talked to me and they went off to Moscow and they found out that this is all true.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">But he was a person -- I have never met anyone like him.</span> <span id="s1611">He was true.</span> <span id="s1612">He never lied but yes, he constantly lied, but not lying to us but that I also tell the children that we are grown up to learn that we shouldn't lie, we shouldn't cheat and we shouldn't bribe anyone, but if you can save a person's life, the lie cheat and bribe because that's what Raoul did and that's how he saved the people.</span> <span id="s1613">And children understand it now and when you reach the kids it's a wonderful thing and I'm sure it will hurt Raoul that every year I'm writing about 500 New York State schools for a senior person and that includes all the Hebrew schools, Jewish schools and catholic schools.</span> <span id="s1614">In seven years I haven't had even one Jewish school answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">Q.</span> <span id="s1616">What are you writing them about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A. I'm giving every year a Raoul Wallenberg Humanitarian Award to a senior high school student who did outstanding humanitarian work during their four years in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">Q.</span> <span id="s1619">So you've never given out the award because no one writes back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">A.</span> <span id="s1621">The Jewish I never give, and it's hurting me.</span> <span id="s1622">Here on Main Street we have a big, wonderful Hebrew school and I know the principal who's a lovely woman and I called her up and I said Dr. Blough how come we don't have a child.</span> <span id="s1623">She says, they don't care.</span> <span id="s1624">I said then teach them to care.</span> <span id="s1625">You never invited me to come and speak.</span> <span id="s1626">The other schools don't even answer.</span> <span id="s1627">It's a heart break.</span> <span id="s1628">After all the man saved 100,000 Jews and we don't have a child.</span> <span id="s1629">I had Indians, I have catholic school kids, quite a lot, Scottish, Irish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">Q. Is it important to your own children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">A. My own children, yes.</span> <span id="s1632">My own children are following, especially this one over there, the younger one.</span> <span id="s1633">They were up with his wife as I told you, in Colorado and Easter come and they both love to bicycle.</span> <span id="s1634">So we couldn't go there, they wouldn't come home for ten days vacation and I said to him sweetheart are you going on a bicycle trip with Amy?</span> <span id="s1635">He said no Mommy we're going to build a road.</span> <span id="s1636">I said I beg your pardon.</span> <span id="s1637">He said a man walked into the university and my son was teaching already, not just taking classes and he said young people I want to build a road from Boulder to the Canyon for people in the wheelchair so they can go and see the canyon.</span> <span id="s1638">How many of you will come and work.</span> <span id="s1639">So my two of course right away put up their hands.</span> <span id="s1640">Ten days they were building a road and the man and his workers supervised it.</span> <span id="s1641">He fed them like crazy.</span> <span id="s1642">He got them tents to sleep in and blankets.</span> <span id="s1643">Then I asked him, were you written up in the newspaper?</span> <span id="s1644">He said Mommy, we are Wallenberg kids.</span> <span id="s1645">It's wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">And my older one who is a big doctor now and makes money, he still goes to soup kitchens and places and helps.</span> <span id="s1647">But they used to lie down beside me and say Mommy, tell us stories, like little dogs, even the two wives.</span> <span id="s1648">And my older son, they just adopted a little Korean girl.</span> <span id="s1649">She's gorgeous.</span> <span id="s1650">She's wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">Both of them married Jewish girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q.</span> <span id="s1653">So they would ask you to tell them stories about --?</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">A. My whole life.</span> <span id="s1655">It's always exciting for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">Q. I wanted to ask you, all that time during the war, during the time in the camps or when you were going up to Sweden, was there any time for romance?</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s1658">Actually, romance, I was terribly in love with an Italian who was in Budapest almost until the Germans came in, but he was married and his wife had a lover and what he knew, he died.</span> <span id="s1659">But we were terribly in love, and for me I knew that I was going to have to marry this Swedish guy, but my dream was always him.</span> <span id="s1660">That was everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">When I got to Sweden I tried to find out if I could find him.</span> <span id="s1662">I didn't know the address and they told me that the aristocrats in Italy was killed by Mussolini and I said my God, my friends might be killed because she was a _____________ girl.</span> <span id="s1663">Anyhow, that was always in my mind that maybe I might meet him once again, and his children loved me, especially his younger son.</span> <span id="s1664">He was crazy about me, but it didn't work.</span> <span id="s1665">Otherwise I had no time, really, for any.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">In Australia there was a Polish guy who fell in love with me, but I left very fast to here and a few years after he went to Canada and my best friend's mother whom I told you she got all her money back and her girls are my two little sisters, she said go and see him in Canada and I said Mommy, I don't think I want to see the man again.</span> <span id="s1667">How do you know, it's about time you get married.</span> <span id="s1668">I went up there but it didn't work for me.</span> <span id="s1669">He was a funny guy by that time, but I never forgot my Italian.</span> <span id="s1670">A year before we got married, before I ever met ___________, I went to Spain and from Spain I went to Italy and in the hotel I asked them if they could tell me if ____________ had a phone and we found my friend's name there and I called up and they both got _______________ and his wife and when I came there he said to me you are like a meteor coming down.</span> <span id="s1671">All the time he was thinking of me and he died six months ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">So, I don't have him anymore.</span> <span id="s1673">He wouldn't like what he hears now about what happened to me because my husband met him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">Q.</span> <span id="s1675">But you were in touch with him over the years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">A. Oh yes, he congratulated us, to our wedding and we stayed friends, but he was the only big love in my life, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">Q.</span> <span id="s1678">What also strikes me is that music played such a tremendous part in your life.</span> <span id="s1679">All the stories you tell, music --</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">A. Music and especially you see because my one aunt was an opera singer but in Hungary I don't know in other countries, when she married her husband wouldn't allow her to be an opera singer anymore because that was official at that time.</span> <span id="s1681">She gave up, she had a big contract with the Hungarian opera house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">My other aunt was a ___________ student.</span> <span id="s1683">You like music yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">Q. Yes.</span> <span id="s1685">So it was always part of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">A.</span> <span id="s1687">So much so that if you're interested I'll tell you that that also helps when you have a big problem or trouble, music helps.</span> <span id="s1688">When I was still a little girl like this or a year older when the first short wave radios came into being and Grandma was very sick, so the family bought her a little radio and on that night when she was really sick they said _____________ that was the daughter, is going to play the Greek piano concerto.</span> <span id="s1689">So Grandma gave a big smile in bed and she listened to this concerto and then the applause came and Auntie knew that she was sick and she had a microphone and she said Mama I love you and grandma gave a big smile and she closed her eyes and she was dead.</span> <span id="s1690">And this concert stayed with us all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">End of Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">Tape 4</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">Q.</span> <span id="s1694">That was the Greek piano concerto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">A.</span> <span id="s1696">The Greek piano concerto.</span> <span id="s1697">Now, when Mother was killed my older son was already in pre-med or a senior in high school, and he wanted to make the eulogy for Mommy and he turns to me and he says to me, Mommy what do you think, the last portion of the Greek piano concerto I said yes, and we did play it out at the funeral home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">Then a few weeks ago, I suddenly felt very, very down, I don't get invitations to speak, I can't sell my books, and my marriage is on the rocks and I was really bad and I couldn't turn my neck.</span> <span id="s1699">When I went to bed I had to hold onto my neck and put it down and I sit there and WQXR is going and I just felt sorry for myself and I said this cannot go on.</span> <span id="s1700">I am a strong woman.</span> <span id="s1701">I have to get out of this.</span> <span id="s1702">I sort of talked to myself and I said Mommy, would you please massage my neck so I can at least turn around and I am feeling miserable.</span> <span id="s1703">The announcer said and now _________________ is going to play the Greek piano concerto.</span> <span id="s1704">I sit there and I says thank you and at that moment I could turn my neck.</span> <span id="s1705">I felt much better and I said I have to go on and be strong.</span> <span id="s1706">Is that interesting?</span> <span id="s1707">And there are miracles like that.</span> <span id="s1708">There are lots of miracles in life.</span> <span id="s1709">When you think that everything is lost like as I told you I have these books and I just can't sell it and one was six weeks in a place and I said that's good news they didn't send it back.</span> <span id="s1710">They sent it back, it's not for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">So I went, there's a wonderful printer in the city and he's redoing one of my books and I didn't know that he's not editing it all himself and two days ago I went to soroptomists meeting and before that I said when I'm coming in and he said yes it's good you should read through what we worked and I walked in and there is a lady sitting and I said hello and he said hello Agnes and she looks up and she says you're Agnes Adachi.</span> <span id="s1712">I said I am and she says I love your book.</span> <span id="s1713">I am the one who edited it.</span> <span id="s1714">But that's not all.</span> <span id="s1715">So, we go into the little room.</span> <span id="s1716">It turns out that she's Swedish but she was born here.</span> <span id="s1717">She speaks less Swedish than I do, but it's wonderful.</span> <span id="s1718">She's also a clergyman.</span> <span id="s1719">She's a divorced woman, has two kids also and she's a Protestant.</span> <span id="s1720">So, naturally she's a clergyman, so we talked and talked and she said I want just little things in your book what you need because my English is no always the best.</span> <span id="s1721">But she said there is almost nothing I should really do but I love it.</span> <span id="s1722">So we talked and she said where are you going and she sees this 75 year thing on me and I said did you ever hear of the soroptomists and she said no so I explained and I said by the way you would be just a person we would like to have.</span> <span id="s1723">I said by any chance would you have a bio.</span> <span id="s1724">It so happens I have one with me.</span> <span id="s1725">I said give it to me but I didn't have time to read it.</span> <span id="s1726">I made a copy and I gave one to my president and I came home and I lied down with this bio.</span> <span id="s1727">And again, I said oh my God, not a miracle again.</span> <span id="s1728">When I was a little girl I was dancing ballet and my teacher was Anna Pavlovich, a Russian woman.</span> <span id="s1729">She was teaching and I was so good that I remember I always heard go after Aggi, everybody went after me and suddenly the doctor said she's going to die in heart failure because I was dancing four and five hours a day.</span> <span id="s1730">That was all my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">So, I didn't become a dancer, but in 1951 I wrote a beautiful story to ballet and couldn't sell.</span> <span id="s1732">You know how everything is so here I'm taking this lady's bio.</span> <span id="s1733">She's a ballerina.</span> <span id="s1734">She's also teaching.</span> <span id="s1735">She's also involved with every big ballet school in America and I'm reading this and I said I don't believe it that God suddenly sends me this woman who want to help me with my book and she's a ballerina.</span> <span id="s1736">Then it's all her life that she's a clergyman too.</span> <span id="s1737">So next day I called her and I said I don't believe in my luck and I'm telling her and she says oh, I can sell that and in a hurry we can even make music to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">It's sometimes interesting that you can do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">Q. Have you ever run across any of the other Wallenberg people who you worked with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">A. No, they don't want to come along.</span> <span id="s1741">When we did this, we advertised in every Jewish Christian papers, nobody ever answered.</span> <span id="s1742">Even we wrote to Israel, nobody comes along and helps us.</span> <span id="s1743">And those who comes, they -- the very first video the BBC made, have you ever seen that?</span> <span id="s1744">I told you about that lawyer who came over to tell me to go to Rumania and his name was Haggerdish and I'm telling him the story and suddenly he said Haggerdish, at that time I didn't know where he was or what happened to him and he was quite nasty to me because when we finally met in Sweden and I never contacted Wallenberg's mother because I felt as an immigrant they would think I wanted money and I didn't want it.</span> <span id="s1745">I'm stupid I know but I never did.</span> <span id="s1746">Even his sister told me we lost almost 50 years of friendship and I said I'm sorry, but that's how I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">But in any case, he came to Sweden and he said he's going to contact the mother and by that time I said I'd like to come with you.</span> <span id="s1748">No, you're not coming with me.</span> <span id="s1749">It's only me that should go.</span> <span id="s1750">Okay.</span> <span id="s1751">Now, we never saw each other again and the BBC man said to me he said Haggerdish, oh we have a lot of contact with him and he always said how he worked with Raoul and what he did.</span> <span id="s1752">Suddenly the phone rings outside and the secretary come in and says it's Haggerdish from Canada and looks at me laughing.</span> <span id="s1753">I said tell him that I send my love.</span> <span id="s1754">He comes back after and says Agnes thank you.</span> <span id="s1755">I said why.</span> <span id="s1756">It turned out it's not that Haggerdish.</span> <span id="s1757">Suddenly he said I'm sorry I fooled you for years, I never worked with Raoul Wallenberg.</span> <span id="s1758">You see, they just made money on him.</span> <span id="s1759">People pick up names.</span> <span id="s1760">It hurts.</span> <span id="s1761">Like this goddamn Rabbi.</span> <span id="s1762">He knows everything.</span> <span id="s1763">He knows how he died, where he died how.</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">Q. Sounds like you're very protective of his memory?</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">A. I am because I know what he did and when they come up -- we were all embarrassed, we had one young Christian guy in Riverdale.</span> <span id="s1766">His name is Tom Byrd and he was an archeologist his father.</span> <span id="s1767">He spent $2,000 just to make some buttons for Raoul.</span> <span id="s1768">I mean he's a nut.</span> <span id="s1769">But me and he and a lady were invited to Brahms, that New York University right on 42nd Street upstairs and there was a Rosenthal who wrote the book of Raoul and it's quite good and he was one of the guest speakers and he just finished and suddenly a man comes in and he jumps up to the podium and he says my name is Dr. Cherry and everything is a lie what you people are saying.</span> <span id="s1770">And Tom and me, we just sat there.</span> <span id="s1771">We were almost sick.</span> <span id="s1772">He said Raoul Wallenberg came to Budapest with 5,000 passports in his pocket and he gave that out and that was it.</span> <span id="s1773">He didn't do a thing after that.</span> <span id="s1774">I got up and I said what are you talking about.</span> <span id="s1775">You sit down, I'm telling you that is the truth.</span> <span id="s1776">He did nothing.</span> <span id="s1777">He was just in the way of everybody.</span> <span id="s1778">So, I sat down and I was really shaking.</span> <span id="s1779">Tom too, we both looked like we're going to collapse right there.</span> <span id="s1780">Then he gets off and he comes by me and he says you liar and he walks out.</span> <span id="s1781">Then a man comes up to me and says well we think too that you don't say the truth.</span> <span id="s1782">I said who are you?</span> <span id="s1783">He said I am on the committee of Rachel, that's the woman who runs the Wallenberg committee of U.S. and she told us that nothing is true.</span> <span id="s1784">How do you fight this?</span> <span id="s1785">So, there are two of us, really three of us, the photographer too.</span> <span id="s1786">There is Vera, who is like me.</span> <span id="s1787">We go out and speak and speak and speak because she was there.</span> <span id="s1788">She was almost 11 years old so she knows what this man did to her, how he saved the lives.</span> <span id="s1789">And he was there.</span> <span id="s1790">And the other day I saw it in another newspaper where they said that he is a professor at Rutgers and he's running the Raoul Wallenberg --- and he dared to write that Raoul was not sent to save the people, he was sent as a helper for the Swedish ligation.</span> <span id="s1791">Things like that.</span> <span id="s1792">I wrote a very ugly letter and I said how can you keep a man like this to run a Wallenberg committee, and the Wallenberg committee in New Jersey was so upset.</span> <span id="s1793">So, it's terribly hard because we saw what the man did.</span> <span id="s1794">I mean he was incredible.</span> <span id="s1795">That's why nobody ever helped him.</span> <span id="s1796">Look at his own country did nothing for him.</span> <span id="s1797">And Unger almost lost his diplomatic accreditation too because when he went back to Sweden he said he wants to help for Raoul and he was told by his things if you don't shut up you're going to lose your credadation too.</span> <span id="s1798">Try to explain.</span> <span id="s1799">It's a heart break because we are talking about one person, not a Schindler, who didn't do it because he has to do it, he did it because that was the only way out.</span> <span id="s1800">He was a drug addict, an alcoholic, he lived with his girlfriend and his mother, and not only that, a lot of other things disturbing us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">About three years ago I have all those letters you should see, a woman called me.</span> <span id="s1802">She got my number I don't know from whom.</span> <span id="s1803">She's a _______________ and she wanted to talk about Wallenberg.</span> <span id="s1804">I said why are you so interested.</span> <span id="s1805">Well, my mother is so interested.</span> <span id="s1806">I said well, why is your mother so interested.</span> <span id="s1807">It turns out the mother is the daughter of Raoul and when she sends me the mother birth certificate it is an absolute impossible thing because she was born July 1945 and Raoul was already in jail since January and to make this woman then he would have had to leave Hungary in October sometime to go to Hitonia to screw somebody and then, you know.</span> <span id="s1808">All the money he has it belongs to them and all that.</span> <span id="s1809">So, I warned the sister and she said oh we got letters from her too, and then she called me again and she said you have to help us.</span> <span id="s1810">I said I don't want to hear about you people, not even not helping.</span> <span id="s1811">Raoul didn't have a daughter, no where.</span> <span id="s1812">So you're a coward too?</span> <span id="s1813">I said yes, call me a coward, call me anything, but don't call me again.</span> <span id="s1814">Thank God I never met them.</span> <span id="s1815">So now, I thought it's over and these people were on welfare yet.</span> <span id="s1816">They should put them back and that's what I told Nina I said the Swedish government try to get these people back to Histonia.</span> <span id="s1817">We don't need them on our tax.</span> <span id="s1818">So, about three months ago I'm getting a letter again from them that they moved out of their house.</span> <span id="s1819">Now they live in a hotel.</span> <span id="s1820">Now they found out that definitely Raoul is dead and so they want all that money and jewelry.</span> <span id="s1821">Poor Raoul, he doesn't even have any money.</span> <span id="s1822">There's a trust fund for him but jewelry, who had jewelry?</span> <span id="s1823">Even Nina doesn't have any jewelry.</span> <span id="s1824">So, I didn't answer.</span> <span id="s1825">And I promised myself and I was stupid not to do it when the phone rings and somebody said could I speak to Agnes Adachi I should ask who it is and if their name comes up I will put on an English accent and I said they sold the house they left, but I didn't do that, and she called me.</span> <span id="s1826">Now, she comes up with other things because Raoul was in school here for four years and there was a girl who was in love with him but he wasn't in love so they never married.</span> <span id="s1827">She's dead too.</span> <span id="s1828">That he has a child from that woman.</span> <span id="s1829">It is incredible what people are doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">Q.</span> <span id="s1831">But for you the memory is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">A. For us, for Vera too, it is a clear memory of a man who did nothing else but saving other people and try to do his best for everybody, but it was not always possible to do it.</span> <span id="s1833">Like when __________ he was 15 years old and he was his photographer and he came to him and said Raoul they're taking my parents so Raoul left everything and run with the car, but the time he went to the Danube they killed him.</span> <span id="s1834">So, you couldn't always, and the same thing with the railway stations when he went all the way.</span> <span id="s1835">He yelled and he bribed the Hungarians and at least 1,000 people he could and then he went and he heard in the mean time they shot the other ones.</span> <span id="s1836">It was an impossibility but they could shoot him at any moment but he just didn't care.</span> <span id="s1837">The main thing was to save innocent people especially children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">I had a good friend of my mother's.</span> <span id="s1839">She just died in this country she was 103.</span> <span id="s1840">She told me the story about him too.</span> <span id="s1841">There was a mason factory outside Budapest and they wanted to make a gas chamber out of it but there wasn't enough time so they made a big hole so people fall in.</span> <span id="s1842">There was no food, no latrines, nothing, and in one of them I don't know if you heard her name, Susan Tabor.</span> <span id="s1843">She also died a few years ago.</span> <span id="s1844">She was there with her husband and her mother.</span> <span id="s1845">Raoul heard about it suddenly that they have people there so he took the red cross trucks and hot soup and bread and medication and screamed at these people.</span> <span id="s1846">How dare you, these people are protected by us and so forth.</span> <span id="s1847">Please get out of here, get out of here and before the Germans could move he took the people out.</span> <span id="s1848">But Susan came up and said sir, we don't your papers.</span> <span id="s1849">He said never mind just walk out and she walked out with her mother and husband and that's how they came eventually here.</span> <span id="s1850">But then he walked into this 300 old people and she told me that story and they were cuddling on the floor there.</span> <span id="s1851">Cold, it was winter time and suddenly Raoul Wallenberg became a completely different man.</span> <span id="s1852">He was like a child.</span> <span id="s1853">He excused himself that he steps on people but there is no way to go.</span> <span id="s1854">He said please, just be quiet.</span> <span id="s1855">I'll come back.</span> <span id="s1856">I bring you medication and I take you and he took all 300 old people out of there and that's why she came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">So where is another man like this, and he was in constant danger and he had to - there was also another young lady.</span> <span id="s1858">Where is she living now?</span> <span id="s1859">I don't know, but she never wants to help either.</span> <span id="s1860">She was sick and she was lying on the floor and Raoul came with the Red Cross and he said these people are our protected people and I take them out.</span> <span id="s1861">The guy says you can take 25.</span> <span id="s1862">So, he looks down at this woman and says do you speak German?</span> <span id="s1863">She said yes.</span> <span id="s1864">He said I'm counting very fast and if I come up to 15 can you get up she said maybe.</span> <span id="s1865">He said I'll help you.</span> <span id="s1866">He counted so fast he took 30 out instead of 10 and he got these woman out.</span> <span id="s1867">He had to chance every minute.</span> <span id="s1868">As I said the only thing he was afraid of was the bombs because there he couldn't do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">He was an incredible human being and he didn't have to do all this, but now that I'm reading through all these letters what he wrote to his grandfather, you see did you know that his father died three months before he was born of cancer so he never met his father but on the father's side the grandfather was the ambassador to turkey, before that to Japan and then to Turkey.</span> <span id="s1870">He adored his grandfather and as I can read these letters, the grandfather manipulated him all the time because all he wanted is being an architect and the grandfather wanted him to get involved in business and in the bank and the other Wallenbergs didn't want him in the bank.</span> <span id="s1871">So, he had a very, very hard time to please his grandfather but please himself and he came out with flying colors from the college here as an architect.</span> <span id="s1872">That was his dream.</span> <span id="s1873">It is terrible when you can take somebody's life like this.</span> <span id="s1874">He was 32 years old, but that _____________ did you ever hear that name?</span> <span id="s1875">That was the Japanese consul in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1876">He was forbidden by the Lithuanians by the Germans and by his own government to help anybody.</span> <span id="s1877">And he and his wife gave 10,000 visas to go to Tokyo and to Shanghai and I was with my husband in Shanghai six years ago and I happened to run into people who Mr. _____________ saved and in Tokyo quite a few, whole families.</span> <span id="s1878">And this man too, his government took away his diplomatic credentials immediately.</span> <span id="s1879">He didn't get his pension.</span> <span id="s1880">Eventually he died.</span> <span id="s1881">Now the family gets everything back.</span> <span id="s1882">It's a little bit late.</span> <span id="s1883">10,000 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">And the other one was the Portuguese ambassador, who also saved people, also 10,000.</span> <span id="s1885">He died an old man.</span> <span id="s1886">But Schindler, 15,000 people and they make a big deal out of him.</span> <span id="s1887">I didn't see the film and I'm not going to.</span> <span id="s1888">But Raoul Wallenberg it is terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">Conclusion of Interview Agnes Adachi page \* arabic111</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">October 14, 1995</span></p></body></html>
