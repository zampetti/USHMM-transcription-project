Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection.</span> <span id="s4">This is an interview with Esther Dezube and her dog is also in the room, conducted by Regina Baier on December 7th, 2000, in Mrs. Dezube’s home in Boston.</span> <span id="s5">Mrs. Dezube is the daughter of Amalie and Norbert -- Norman Salsitz, Holocaust survivors who have been interviewed for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum’s oral history collection.</span> <span id="s6">This interview is part of the USHMM’s post Holocaust interview project.</span> <span id="s7">The US Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible.</span> <span id="s8">Oh, be quiet.</span> <span id="s9">This is tape number one, side A.</span> <span id="s10">We are off to a good start here.</span> <span id="s11">So as I said, there is a dog with us in the room, but I think if we put her outside, it would be even louder, so hopefully our listeners will understand and even enjoy at times.</span> <span id="s12">My first -- my first question is, give us your full name, and when and where you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Answer: My full name is Esther Cylia Salsitz Dezube, and I was born in Newark, New Jersey at Beth Israel Hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: Were you named after someone who has been murdered during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: What does that mean to you, and what do you know about these people?</span> <span id="s17">Can you bring them to life a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: Well, it’s hard to bring them to life, because I really never met them.</span> <span id="s19">But my first name is Esther, which is my father’s mother’s name.</span> <span id="s20">And I don’t know a lot about her.</span> <span id="s21">I know a lot more about my father, and how he survived the war, but not so much about the personality of the mother, or the father, for that matter.</span> <span id="s22">My middle name is Cylia.</span> <span id="s23">That’s after my mother’s sister Cylia.</span> <span id="s24">I know a little bit about her.</span> <span id="s25">I know all the good qualities about her, and my mother seemed to adore her.</span> <span id="s26">I don’t know a lot about her otherwise.</span> <span id="s27">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s28">I actually -- my kids are named after survivors as well.</span> <span id="s29">And we did one other thing for our children.</span> <span id="s30">All their names equal 18, all the letters.</span> <span id="s31">They have 18 letters in their names.</span> <span id="s32">And 18 is a very special number in the Jewish religion, because it means chai, it means life.</span> <span id="s33">So we try to continue that on.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Okay, we’ll talk about your children a little bit later.</span> <span id="s35">I would like to now go back to you as a very small child, and to see the first memories of stories, of bits of stories that you now know were related to the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: I -- I can’t tell you the age, because it was always there.</span> <span id="s37">My -- and you can tell a little bit when they started, because I could see when they started with my older son.</span> <span id="s38">My bedtime stories were probably Holocaust stories.</span> <span id="s39">My father would sing me Yiddish songs, I remember that.</span> <span id="s40">My mother didn’t read to me at night, my -- it was my father’s -- not job, but that’s what he liked to do.</span> <span id="s41">It -- it just didn’t start, it was always there, they always talked about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s42">Their friends were always Holocaust survivors, they didn't integrate into the American society.</span> <span id="s43">So that was always the topic of conversation, I can’t tell you when it started.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Let’s -- i-if you can -- I mean, I know it’s really difficult, and especially if it started very early, to remember, but are there bits of stories that you remember that came up at what occasions, how did they talk about it?</span> <span id="s45">Is there anything that sort of comes to mind, that gives an impression of what it was.</span> <span id="s46">So their father sang to you, what -- what -- what else?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Oh, he would tell me the -- I mean, that’s what he would tell me, he would tell me about Hitler, and -- and -- and children being killed in the war.</span> <span id="s48">I think he learned actually to temper his stories as he got older.</span> <span id="s49">He would tell me, you know, the children’s fats were made into soap.</span> <span id="s50">He would tell me that -- you know, his -- his n-nieces and nephews were killed and they were my age.</span> <span id="s51">He would say that -- it would even start with food.</span> <span id="s52">I was a very fat child, and they were very proud of it.</span> <span id="s53">They were proud that I was fat because they had enough food to give me and children were starving in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s54">That I remember very distinctly, I was not allowed to leave the table without finishing all the food, because the children in the Holocaust were s -- would starve, and I should appreciate all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: They would say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s57">Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: How did -- how did -- how did you feel, I mean what was your reaction?</span> <span id="s59">How young were you, roughly, that -- I mean, when the father told you, for instance, about the --</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: I could be three.</span> <span id="s61">I mean, I was very young when they would s -- tell me these stories.</span> <span id="s62">You know, I just remember the stories were always there.</span> <span id="s63">How, you know, he lived in the woods.</span> <span id="s64">My mother did not tell me stories.</span> <span id="s65">My mother didn’t tell me very much at all.</span> <span id="s66">It was always my father’s stories, how he survived, and how they met, and how all the kids were killed.</span> <span id="s67">Not my mother.</span> <span id="s68">My mother would cry.</span> <span id="s69">She would -- she would start to tell me these stories, and then she would cry, and I didn't want her to cry so I’d always change the subject.</span> <span id="s70">I mean, I never let her tell the stories, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Did -- did your father make them into stories for children?</span> <span id="s72">How -- how do --</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: -- you remember them?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: No, they were not made for stories for children.</span> <span id="s76">They were as gruesome as he could remember them.</span> <span id="s77">He would tell me -- he didn’t go through the concentration camps, so he didn’t tell me those kind of stories.</span> <span id="s78">He told me how his father was killed in front of him, how his sisters were killed.</span> <span id="s79">I knew the story about my grandfather, I can’t tell you what age I -- I knew that he tried to -- my mother’s father, how he escaped, and how he tried to come back and find her.</span> <span id="s80">I -- I can’t tell you when these started, but I-I always had these stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Do you remember how you felt when you -- when you heard that?</span> <span id="s82">I mean, wa -- was it -- was it a -- was it fear, distance, curiosity, wha -- how did it make you feel?</span> <span id="s83">What was your response to --</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Well, you’ve got to understand something, is that one, I was an only child, so I had no one to bounce it off except my parents.</span> <span id="s85">Again, my parents really only associated with Holocaust survivors.</span> <span id="s86">I didn't know another world.</span> <span id="s87">It was the only world that I had.</span> <span id="s88">I was not a giggly kid.</span> <span id="s89">I never was a giggly kid.</span> <span id="s90">The kids used to play with -- I ne -- I didn’t play with dolls very much.</span> <span id="s91">I played with maybe trolls, later on in life.</span> <span id="s92">Make-believe was very hard for me, because I guess I had a taste of reality -- harsh reality first.</span> <span id="s93">I wa -- I drew a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: What di --</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: I drew animals.</span> <span id="s96">I drew animals.</span> <span id="s97">I could relate to animals better than I could relate to people.</span> <span id="s98">I know that.</span> <span id="s99">I always drew animals.</span> <span id="s100">I have actually even difficulty, probably, drawing people.</span> <span id="s101">Again, how did I know it affected me?</span> <span id="s102">Only because later on.</span> <span id="s103">When you’re growing up and it -- you really don’t know how it affects you.</span> <span id="s104">I just thought this was the way in -- in that regard how everybody was.</span> <span id="s105">It affected me in other ways that I didn’t have a family.</span> <span id="s106">It affected me that, you know, I saw my friends with grandparents and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s107">But the actual stories?</span> <span id="s108">I never heard Winnie the Pooh.</span> <span id="s109">I never heard any of these, Snow White.</span> <span id="s110">I didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Did you have friends as -- as a young -- as a younger child?</span> <span id="s112">Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: I didn’t have a lot.</span> <span id="s114">I had some friends.</span> <span id="s115">I had -- I had some girlfriends, but not a lot, because in a sense, almost like my older one, I was a little -- I call my youngest kid a little old man, and I probably was a little old woman.</span> <span id="s116">I just couldn’t relate to them.</span> <span id="s117">I couldn’t understand the -- the sparkling dresses and the fancy hair and clothes.</span> <span id="s118">My parents weren’t into that, she never took me to malls.</span> <span id="s119">She never did any of these things, so I didn’t.</span> <span id="s120">Did I resent it?</span> <span id="s121">Only a little, when I was older I resented it, not when I was young.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Did you make -- did you make a connection to those stories that were told and to the songs sung, to your parents?</span> <span id="s123">When -- when did that happen?</span> <span id="s124">I mean, did it -- were they s-sort of difficult to deal with stories [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Well, you gotta understand that they were never told to me as stories.</span> <span id="s126">I didn’t have to take a fairy tale and try to then say oh, I’m going to transfer this fairy tale to something that happened in real life.</span> <span id="s127">These were presented as real life stories, that really happened to them.</span> <span id="s128">So I knew it was my parents.</span> <span id="s129">I knew it -- that everything belonged to them, that I was part of that history.</span> <span id="s130">And they kept telling me I was part of that history.</span> <span id="s131">That I should be a good Jew, I guess, because I am a -- because I was born, it was their fight against Hitler.</span> <span id="s132">I mean, I had to maintain that.</span> <span id="s133">That is something that I was brought up constantly.</span> <span id="s134">And I do tell my kids that, a -- a little bit, is that because I sur -- I -- I was born, and I survived a Jew, and I maintain it that I am victory over Hitler.</span> <span id="s135">So this was something that I grew up, all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: That’s a heavy -- pretty heavy burden, potentially, for a smaller child to feel that much --</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Probably was.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: -- responsibility.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: I left the house at 16 and a half.</span> <span id="s140">I just turned 17 when I left the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Let’s -- let’s -- let’s -- I would like to sort of stay there just for a little bit before we -- we move onto that.</span> <span id="s142">Gi-Give me a sense, a little closer sense of what was family life like, the s -- the social occasion.</span> <span id="s143">How did you experience th-the home?</span> <span id="s144">And did you make comparisons to other homes that you saw, when you visited friends, for instance?</span> <span id="s145">Was -- I mean, you said that was a -- sort of the normality, that you feel -- that’s what you thought it was.</span> <span id="s146">Did you have comparisons to other homes, or -- gi-give us a little better sense of what it was like [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: Well, you gotta understand, everybody has a dysfunctional family as far as I’m concerned, there is no perfect home.</span> <span id="s148">I mean, you watch on TV, that’s where you make your comparisons.</span> <span id="s149">And you always wanted to be like the family on TV, not so much like your friend’s family, but the family on TV.</span> <span id="s150">Cause they always complained about their parents, too.</span> <span id="s151">I didn’t have a close home life.</span> <span id="s152">My mother -- I was closer to my mother than my father, only cause my father wasn’t home.</span> <span id="s153">My father is a very driven man.</span> <span id="s154">Probably is why he survived.</span> <span id="s155">But also, he was an immigrant in a country and he had to prove himself.</span> <span id="s156">So he would get up at 10 o’clock in the morning, which means I’m already in school.</span> <span id="s157">He would come back from meetings at 10 o’clock at night, and when I was young I was already in bed.</span> <span id="s158">He loved to listen to Yiddish mo -- music, which is not something that I liked.</span> <span id="s159">And on the weekends they would go a lot with their friends.</span> <span id="s160">I was a tagalong only because they didn’t have a babysitter, and they would speak Polish, which is a language that I never learned.</span> <span id="s161">So I had to create my own world.</span> <span id="s162">I mean, I used to have dinner with my mother.</span> <span id="s163">She’d u -- have the -- she loves the radio.</span> <span id="s164">So either she had music or news in the background.</span> <span id="s165">And she’s very political oriented.</span> <span id="s166">And so she would always talk all about all the political situations and I had to always be a-abreast about it.</span> <span id="s167">And that would be our pul -- our -- our life.</span> <span id="s168">My parents didn’t really integrate with me.</span> <span id="s169">Maybe it’s part of the inte -- European culture.</span> <span id="s170">But we didn’t do -- we went on vacations.</span> <span id="s171">We’d travel a lot.</span> <span id="s172">We didn’t do a lot as a family, not that I can recall.</span> <span id="s173">My mother, again, she wouldn’t take me shopping.</span> <span id="s174">She laughs at me when I say that.</span> <span id="s175">Oh well, you know, I took you on these trips instead of shopping.</span> <span id="s176">We didn’t do the normal family stuff.</span> <span id="s177">My mother liked to read, and that’s what she did.</span> <span id="s178">I don’t recall us ever engaging in board games.</span> <span id="s179">I don’t ever a -- we nev -- it was as if they were tired of life.</span> <span id="s180">And I couldn’t relate.</span> <span id="s181">I mean, again, that’s also fantasy.</span> <span id="s182">You know, board games and playing with a little kid.</span> <span id="s183">And they didn’t know how to deal with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: When I interviewed your parents, and especially your father though, there was such a -- you called him a driven man?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: There wa -- there seemed to be, when he talked to me, a great life spark in him though, at the same time.</span> <span id="s187">Tired of life, and at the same time very -- seemingly had life --</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: He’s very driven.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: It -- it -- try to ex -- to try to -- for listeners who haven’t heard -- who haven’t heard the interview with your parents, and from your perspective as a -- as a younger person, because maybe that has changed over the years, how did you see your mother and how did you see your father in the earlier years?</span> <span id="s190">How -- how were they to you?</span> <span id="s191">How did you see them as persons?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: My mother was reality, my father was fantasy.</span> <span id="s193">My mother is not a ha -- in my perception is not a happy woman.</span> <span id="s194">In a sense kind of bitter, but down to earth.</span> <span id="s195">I was never showered with compliments.</span> <span id="s196">She may disagree with me, but that’s my perception.</span> <span id="s197">I -- I always liked to draw and she always felt that that was beneath her as an occupation.</span> <span id="s198">I was accepted to art school, she was very angry.</span> <span id="s199">She said, as a vocation, not a -- as an advocation, not vocation.</span> <span id="s200">She wanted me to be a doctor, it was it, black and white, you’re a doctor or you’re -- or you’re a failure.</span> <span id="s201">She called me a failure when I was in college.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Do you know why --</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Yeah, oh --</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: -- it was so important for her to -- that you become a doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: -- yes, and she explained that to me.</span> <span id="s206">She said that a doctor -- and again, this is her perception because she was a survivor.</span> <span id="s207">A doctor can take their skills and go from one country to another and start again.</span> <span id="s208">And if I wasn’t a doctor I wouldn’t have those transferable skills.</span> <span id="s209">And that’s why it was so important, even though math was never a strong point.</span> <span id="s210">And it was just not a subject that I excelled in.</span> <span id="s211">I was always on the debating team, I was on the speech team.</span> <span id="s212">It was very interesting, I mean, when I was young, that’s where I lean.</span> <span id="s213">And you know, yet I agreed to be a pre-med student the freshman year of college.</span> <span id="s214">And then I realized it -- I loved taking care of people, but I couldn’t get through the chemistry and the -- the physics and the trigonometry to get there.</span> <span id="s215">I mean, if it was just lab work, I got A’s in biology lab work and stuff.</span> <span id="s216">So that’s the freshman year of college she called me a failure.</span> <span id="s217">But when you have no other siblings, y-you have to achieve all the goals that your parent want.</span> <span id="s218">And that’s what they wanted.</span> <span id="s219">I mean, they didn’t see me as almost a person, but an extension of all their goals.</span> <span id="s220">I can see that now.</span> <span id="s221">Maybe when I was younger I resented it.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Maybe, or did -- what -- what -- how did you feel when -- ho-how did you feel about yourself at that time, and how did you -- did -- did you have anger?</span> <span id="s223">Did you have --</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: I had --</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: -- compassion, did you have --</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: No, I didn’t have compassion when I was younger, I have much more compassion now.</span> <span id="s227">Confusion, I think was the better idea.</span> <span id="s228">I knew enough -- it wasn’t anger.</span> <span id="s229">It’s one of the reasons I left home, because I didn’t want to have anger, I didn’t want to have resentment, and I knew that distance would take care of that.</span> <span id="s230">They tried to totally dictate -- my mother, not my father -- cause she just was around more -- dictate my life.</span> <span id="s231">In a sense I had -- she had to relive her childhood, her concept of a normal childhood through me.</span> <span id="s232">If I had boyfriends she would write a script what to say to these boyfriends.</span> <span id="s233">She would go through their mail to me, you know, judging them either fit or unfit.</span> <span id="s234">But yet, you know, she did give me freedom.</span> <span id="s235">I -- I dated early.</span> <span id="s236">So -- but I-I could see that she was more controlling in a way to give herself control over life.</span> <span id="s237">She needed control so that she could feel control, because the war didn’t -- not let her have control.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: How about your father?</span> <span id="s239">He was fantasy, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: He was fantasy.</span> <span id="s241">My mother didn’t yell and scream a lot, but she would keep a grudge.</span> <span id="s242">She would keep it in her.</span> <span id="s243">My father, you can just spark him and he’ll scream and rant, but on the most part, it’s done and over with, you know?</span> <span id="s244">And you want to hide sometimes.</span> <span id="s245">I remember going into it -- he would -- he would pick fights, even when there were fights not even there.</span> <span id="s246">We’d go to a store and he would pick a fight with a salesman, or if he didn’t like something a woman said, he would pick a fight.</span> <span id="s247">But it would be done.</span> <span id="s248">It would fester with my mother.</span> <span id="s249">We had a neighbor who was German, and they would always have fights, always have fights.</span> <span id="s250">My father would take him to court, or they would -- screaming at each other.</span> <span id="s251">But the odd thing is that his oldest daughter was my babysitter.</span> <span id="s252">So it was an interesting relationship.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: About the other family, did you get to meet his older brother, Leibush, do you remember him?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: No, no, there was a feud in my family.</span> <span id="s255">Okay, I don’t know the feud very well.</span> <span id="s256">The feud started, I heard, when I was born.</span> <span id="s257">From one of my cousins, a first cousin, I heard that my father would -- and my father still is a very generous and giving man.</span> <span id="s258">And he was probably very generous and giving to them.</span> <span id="s259">And when I was born -- cause they had waited 10 years for me and they were going to adopt, I guess they realized that the fortune, or whatever my father had amassed wasn’t going to go to them, and it was going to go to me.</span> <span id="s260">This is what I was told.</span> <span id="s261">And there were conflicts and jealousy because my father made it in life and the brothers really didn’t.</span> <span id="s262">So I didn't meet them, at all.</span> <span id="s263">I mean, I never met Leibush at all.</span> <span id="s264">I met -- I met David, oh, maybe a couple years before his death.</span> <span id="s265">Al I met only once.</span> <span id="s266">When I was very small he gave me a book by Edgar Allen Poe.</span> <span id="s267">Why I remember this I don’t even know.</span> <span id="s268">But -- and he was very tall, and I don’t really have any other memories of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: So you never really had any kind of relationship to the New York part of -- of your fa -- I mean, to the -- to the --</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: To the brothers, no, no.</span> <span id="s271">Absolutely no relationship whatsoever.</span> <span id="s272">There was a cousin named Benny, who was my first cousin, who -- maybe when I got married, came to my father and said, I’m not -- I’m not my father’s son, I want to start having a relationship back with you.</span> <span id="s273">And we became very friendly with him, and I liked him, and -- but they moved to North Carolina and distance has its, you know, way of cutting into family ties, so I don’t see him any more.</span> <span id="s274">But I have good memories of him later on in life.</span> <span id="s275">My father has a first cousin name -- a nephew named Eddie, who I have not a re -- really a relationship with at all, but he is friendly to my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: What about your mother’s part of the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: They were close.</span> <span id="s278">They -- I -- I -- there was a cousin Leo, who -- my parents never made a Passover, which is -- I don’t know if you want me to explain it, but it -- it -- Passover is the time when the Israelites left Egypt, and they lived in the desert.</span> <span id="s279">And the actual name started when God -- after the 10th -- or the last plague, God said to put lamb’s blood on the door of the Israelites, and then he would pass over their house, and we should retell the story in -- in the -- we call it the Bible, we don’t have a fir -- a first testament and a second testament.</span> <span id="s280">Old Testament and New Testament, excuse me.</span> <span id="s281">But your equivalent of -- of the Old Testament, it’s in there, and it says, you shall remember.</span> <span id="s282">So that is an very big holiday an-and it’s a unique holiday because it’s family oriented in the home.</span> <span id="s283">You don’t go to temple, necessarily, for Passover.</span> <span id="s284">So my cousin Leo would always make it, even as a small kid I would go to his house.</span> <span id="s285">There was a cousin named Harold Anglestone, who is much older, but I heard he made the wedding for my parents.</span> <span id="s286">We didn’t cup -- keep up with his children, but I do recall him.</span> <span id="s287">I am friendly with Leo’s children, and Leo has a twin sister, and I’m friendly with their children.</span> <span id="s288">Not extremely close, but definitely friendly with them, they’re come -- we go to each other’s family occasions.</span> <span id="s289">But I was always considered the outside -- I always felt like the outsider, even when I went to these occasions.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Why?</span> <span id="s291">Or in what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Maybe I was al -- I wasn’t so much younger, but I -- I ca -- it’s like they would talk and I would always be in a separate group.</span> <span id="s293">I was always considered the outsider.</span> <span id="s294">Once I asked them, when I grew up.</span> <span id="s295">They said, your mother always said you were perfect, and that you, you know, you were always the best and the greatest.</span> <span id="s296">And so we really didn’t want to have anything to do with you.</span> <span id="s297">And I said, well that’s nice for me to know, but I don’t really perceive myself as that.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Why did your parents not want to celebrate Passover?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Oh, they wanted to celebrate it, they just never actually -- oh no, they wanted to celebrate it, but just -- they didn’t do it at our house, because it would only be three of us.</span> <span id="s300">We always went to their house because he knew how to do it and it was a family situation.</span> <span id="s301">My father had only one cousin that was here in America that we were friendly with, that I have memories of, and that is -- he’s a rabbi, Shapiro and his wife, Martha.</span> <span id="s302">They always tried to include, but they were much more religious -- always tried to include us.</span> <span id="s303">So I remember going there to Sukkot and some other holidays.</span> <span id="s304">But I always felt like an intruder.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Because you couldn’t -- also because you --</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: They had many children, it was like there was their family and here I was, alone.</span> <span id="s307">So you felt it like an intruder.</span> <span id="s308">It was just a different world.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: The -- your -- your -- your mother also has family in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Did you go often?</span> <span id="s312">What kind of relationship did you have with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: My mother had a good relationship with her sister, and still does.</span> <span id="s314">In it --</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: That’s -- that’s the older sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: The younger sister was killed, whom I was named after.</span> <span id="s319">We -- we’d go every two years when I was young, to Israel.</span> <span id="s320">Was a big trip.</span> <span id="s321">I remember once going on a propeller for like 36 hours to Israel.</span> <span id="s322">Then we would go on a cruise boat, cause I couldn’t take planes very well when I was young.</span> <span id="s323">It was a big deal, but I was much younger than her children, they were 10 years older than me.</span> <span id="s324">So I was always, again alone.</span> <span id="s325">And they would talk Polish.</span> <span id="s326">The kids would have nothing to do with me, because I was so much younger, and I was in my own world.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: What did you do in that own world?</span> <span id="s328">What was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: I turned to art.</span> <span id="s330">It was my solace.</span> <span id="s331">I drew all of the time.</span> <span id="s332">And I was never alone when I did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: You never actually had animals though, at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Yeah -- no, we had a dog.</span> <span id="s335">But my mother’s -- you know, my concept of the dog is right now I’m sitting on a bed and the dog is next to me.</span> <span id="s336">And my mother’s concept is the dog stays downstairs.</span> <span id="s337">Only once did the dog -- was allowed to go upstairs and she shredded one of my animals -- he, actually -- because I went to camp.</span> <span id="s338">And that was like my favorite animal.</span> <span id="s339">He knew which one it was and shredded it.</span> <span id="s340">So it was a different kind of relationship with animals.</span> <span id="s341">I was -- my father loves animals and he would pick up all these strays.</span> <span id="s342">And once we had three or four dogs at one time.</span> <span id="s343">My mother was not too happy.</span> <span id="s344">I would pick up stray birds, we had stray rabbits that I would pick up, and I would take care of the animals, too.</span> <span id="s345">I always had animals.</span> <span id="s346">Part of -- my husband laughs that when we got married, you know, the condition was that we had dogs.</span> <span id="s347">That was it, we’re going to have dogs, when we could, and we did.</span> <span id="s348">But -- so art, and -- and dogs.</span> <span id="s349">I used to read, also, but not as much as my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: What did you read?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: Animal books and science fiction.</span> <span id="s352">I read the classics, but they were okay.</span> <span id="s353">I still read.</span> <span id="s354">I don’t like -- my mother likes to read really heavy books and I don’t.</span> <span id="s355">I like to escape in my books.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: She said she likes to read a lot but she doesn’t like non-fiction.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: No, she doesn’t like fiction, only non-fiction.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: Only non-fiction, yes, right, exactly, and I read fiction.</span> <span id="s360">I’m tired at the end of the day and I like to escape.</span> <span id="s361">And I think that’s a sense of just [indecipherable] with us, because she can’t understand where I’m coming from.</span> <span id="s362">That’s part of being a child of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s363">Since I grew up in America, still acquired a lot of the American ways, and she can’t understand them.</span> <span id="s364">She can’t understand why I want to read fiction, why I don’t want to have to -- why don’t I -- I have my ears constantly up, listening for things that might affect me.</span> <span id="s365">And I have my ears up, but not the same way.</span> <span id="s366">My mother is hyper about it.</span> <span id="s367">And I want to be -- I want to have a -- a -- a semi-normal life.</span> <span id="s368">But I --</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: Maybe this -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Esther Dezube.</span> <span id="s371">This is tape number one, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: You know, I was just thinking about when you were saying my father was very dynamic, it’s his way of escape.</span> <span id="s373">You know, he tells all these stories, but they’re mostly in the past, and they’re not the present.</span> <span id="s374">He has some, but they’re mostly -- he dwells totally in the past because he feels comfortable there, and it’s his way to escape.</span> <span id="s375">If you lock yourself in these stories, if you’re constantly telling the stories, it’s like an actor.</span> <span id="s376">If he’s in a role, he doesn’t feel his own pain.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Your mother said to me in her inter -- did you ever listen to their tapes, by the way?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: You did.</span> <span id="s380">She said that your father is a ham with other people, and at home he’s very quiet --</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: -- very silent, so that would fit into it -- what --</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: -- what you just said.</span> <span id="s385">You said you left home very early.</span> <span id="s386">Tell me more about that, the decision to do that, and where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: I actually didn’t make that decision.</span> <span id="s388">To this day I have no idea how it came about, but it appears when I was in high school, I was put in a program, it was an accelerated program that I only had three years of high school, and I went to summer school one summer, and then I went to college early.</span> <span id="s389">I don’t know who put me in that program, I have really absolutely no idea.</span> <span id="s390">I wouldn’t recommend it, to be honest, to anyone.</span> <span id="s391">But I -- I think they basically said that I was too mature to stay in high school and I just didn't fit in, which is an interesting way, I suppose, to put it.</span> <span id="s392">And so I went to college early, and I didn’t apply home.</span> <span id="s393">My mother recognized that we were starting to fight, I mean, I was hitting puberty.</span> <span id="s394">If I -- if I lived -- college at 16, then you know, puberty starts 14 - 15.</span> <span id="s395">I wa -- I was one, in the throes of it, but I don’t know if my mother really knew how to deal with it.</span> <span id="s396">One, children weren’t supposed to talk against -- back to their parents, weren't supposed to argue with their parents, they were supposed to be little mannequins.</span> <span id="s397">My mother always told me how wonderful she was.</span> <span id="s398">My mother would tell me how -- a good student she was.</span> <span id="s399">My mother always said how she listened to her parents, and I was not like that.</span> <span id="s400">So I guess what she was doing is trying to avoid, one a fight, and dealing with puberty.</span> <span id="s401">And I left home and I only came back one summer, first summer.</span> <span id="s402">Because after college they tried to put me, I remember, on a 10 o’clock tur -- curfew, and they didn't want me to grow up.</span> <span id="s403">They wanted me to go away, but not to grow up.</span> <span id="s404">And that was difficult.</span> <span id="s405">And I think it was difficult for them, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Explain that a little bit more, they wanted you to go away, but not to grow up?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Right.</span> <span id="s408">Because if I grew up, I came bi -- my own person, which is not exactly, one, the way they saw me, or two, the way they could control me.</span> <span id="s409">They -- they -- a -- they -- every time we went into a room, the first thing they would do is talk about the Holocaust to my friends.</span> <span id="s410">First thing.</span> <span id="s411">And they would tell the stories.</span> <span id="s412">I mean, it was just everywhere.</span> <span id="s413">My first dates, my first friends, the first thing they came into the house, they would always -- they would tell the stories.</span> <span id="s414">And my friends were scared.</span> <span id="s415">They just didn’t want to hear them all the time.</span> <span id="s416">So one, it limited your friendship, but two, when i -- you know, they were offended that my friends didn’t want to hear it.</span> <span id="s417">What kind of person are you if your friends don’t want to hear it?</span> <span id="s418">They were afraid because it was a test, also, whether or not I would keep Judaism.</span> <span id="s419">And you know, I was away from home.</span> <span id="s420">What would I do?</span> <span id="s421">You know, I -- I -- I -- I dated people who were non-Jewish, but honest I could say that I would never marry anybody who was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s422">It was too much integrated in part of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: So what did that mean to you then, to be -- you were so trained to be Jewish, in certain ways, it was -- no, it -- wrong, it was so important -- the emphasis was very [indecipherable] what does --</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: It wasn’t religious emphasis.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: -- that’s -- what [indecipherable] at that time --</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s427">My parents did not light candles when I was home.</span> <span id="s428">They had ham in the house.</span> <span id="s429">They still have ham in the house.</span> <span id="s430">They still have a -- a -- kielbasa and all these Polish delicacies.</span> <span id="s431">It was a heritage.</span> <span id="s432">That’s what it meant to them.</span> <span id="s433">They eat bread on Passover.</span> <span id="s434">I -- I -- I -- I didn’t go to a Jewish day school.</span> <span id="s435">I went to Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s436">I was not really Bat Mitzvahed.</span> <span id="s437">I had a party in Israel, but I never went through the formal training of a Bat Mitzvah in th -- in the United States, to this day.</span> <span id="s438">They had to -- and it was difficult for them, to be religious, with what they went through.</span> <span id="s439">I don’t know if they hated God, but they were resentful.</span> <span id="s440">But they still wanted a connection to heritage, and that they instilled in me very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Did that become different for you, though, the religious aspect?</span> <span id="s442">Do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: I am actually more religious than my parents.</span> <span id="s444">We -- do you want t -- I mean, I never had a -- a sukkah when I grew up.</span> <span id="s445">It’s like a little hut that you put together and for seven days you stay in it, and it’s a harvest festival.</span> <span id="s446">We have one.</span> <span id="s447">Every year we put it together, the kids, we have a dinner, we have a -- friends who come over.</span> <span id="s448">I’m not Shomer Shavas, which means that I don’t -- I ride on Shabbat, and go places on shab -- on Saturday.</span> <span id="s449">But on Friday night all the kids get together and we have our Friday night dinner.</span> <span id="s450">To the point that my son works as a waiter and told them that he will not work on Friday night because he has to be home for the Friday night dinner.</span> <span id="s451">We celebrate the holidays, I change my dishes on Passover, we get rid of all the bread, I change the dishes, and we keep it -- actually, that’s kind of an interesting story, because the year that I decided to change the dishes, I had to look for plates.</span> <span id="s452">And I went into this store and there were a set of plates that had Egyptian pyramids on it, and had the slaves.</span> <span id="s453">And I thought that was almost like, you know, God’s telling me something.</span> <span id="s454">I bought those dishes, and they don’t make them any more.</span> <span id="s455">They discontinued them after the year I bought them.</span> <span id="s456">And we still have them.</span> <span id="s457">So that way I’m much more religious.</span> <span id="s458">My kids go to a Jewish day school.</span> <span id="s459">Part of it is heritage.</span> <span id="s460">A lot of it is heritage, to be honest.</span> <span id="s461">But I’m a lot more religious because I’m not as angry with God as they are.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: It’s -- it’s all right to jump back and forth a little bit --</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: I don’t have a [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: -- when things come up.</span> <span id="s465">I would like to keep some kind of chronology --</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: -- so let’s go back to, so you never really fit in.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: No, I never fit in.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: How did you fit into college life?</span> <span id="s470">So we are now -- you are now what, 17?</span> <span id="s471">Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: I went to Boston University, and my freshman year I probably, using the vernacular, blew it.</span> <span id="s473">I didn’t do very well in school.</span> <span id="s474">I remember I was in a pre-med program because my parents wanted me in -- to be in a pre-med program.</span> <span id="s475">I was a goody two shoes, basically when I grew up, in high school.</span> <span id="s476">I never cut.</span> <span id="s477">I never did anything really wrong.</span> <span id="s478">My mother didn’t like my clothes and she would constantly tell me how I was inappropriately dressed.</span> <span id="s479">But I didn’t do anything really majorly wrong.</span> <span id="s480">I was in the only kid in driver’s ed when the teacher would say, drive faster.</span> <span id="s481">And here I was in college.</span> <span id="s482">I still, I never smoked -- I-I smoked once, cigarettes, when I was in law school.</span> <span id="s483">I didn’t smoke, didn’t drink, didn’t take drugs, never took marijuana to this day.</span> <span id="s484">I didn’t have a need to.</span> <span id="s485">But my -- blew my grades.</span> <span id="s486">I really blew my grades.</span> <span id="s487">I wanted to have a social life and they don’t mix.</span> <span id="s488">And the math was difficult and I didn't probably put an effort in it -- to it, but there was another aspect to it.</span> <span id="s489">I didn’t want to go in -- I -- I realized that medicine wasn’t for me.</span> <span id="s490">If I did well, I would have to continue.</span> <span id="s491">So I got a D in chemistry.</span> <span id="s492">Not that it was difficult, but I did.</span> <span id="s493">Can’t go to med school with a D. My parents -- that’s when she called me a failure, and I switched.</span> <span id="s494">She didn’t sol -- I don’t think my mother spoke to me for a couple of months.</span> <span id="s495">My father did.</span> <span id="s496">It was very interesting, my father later on became much more supportive of what I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Wh-Why do you think that is?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Cause he was probably a very rebellious r -- youth, and you know, he really -- a little bit of himself was shining through through me, and I don’t know whe -- he probably smiled and was outraged at the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: It’s kind of interesting, I didn’t want to interrupt you, but I did bring the interview with your mother and when I asked her in the very beginning how she would describe herself before the war, she said this, Amalie Petranker was very happy go lucky child with shiny eyes.</span> <span id="s500">She couldn’t carry for a long time a grudge or hatred.</span> <span id="s501">She loved people, but she was also a fighter, because she was a middle child.</span> <span id="s502">So she learned to fight for her rights.</span> <span id="s503">She was a little mischievous, she was rebellious, she questioned her parent’s judgment.</span> <span id="s504">Did you ever meet that person?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: No.</span> <span id="s506">I didn’t meet that person.</span> <span id="s507">Parts of it I’ve met.</span> <span id="s508">My mother questions a lot of people, you know, and -- and their positions on life.</span> <span id="s509">No, I can’t see my mother as a rebellious person.</span> <span id="s510">Maybe she was happy go lucky, but you know, she was much older when I was born.</span> <span id="s511">I didn't see that real happy go lucky person.</span> <span id="s512">She may have been when she first got married, but they had a love/hate -- they still have a love/hate relationship.</span> <span id="s513">They came from very different worlds.</span> <span id="s514">And they’re at each other’s throat for that, even in the way they speak Polish.</span> <span id="s515">My mother will correct my father, totally.</span> <span id="s516">No, you don’t say it this way, you don’t say it that way.</span> <span id="s517">My father had a sixth grade education.</span> <span id="s518">He did well, and he was very proud, and he ca -- he hid his report cards in the war because he was very proud, but he only went to the sixth grade and it had nothing to do with his ability, it had to do with that was the fact of life, he was the youngest child of nine and he had to go work.</span> <span id="s519">My mother was educated woman, very proud of her education.</span> <span id="s520">And she would let my mo -- father know that she was a very educated woman, and he was not.</span> <span id="s521">That would have a problem.</span> <span id="s522">My father had a girlfriend named Rozia, who he could never let go.</span> <span id="s523">And I heard that they really never dated very much, but he was -- she was probably his fantasy of what would have been.</span> <span id="s524">And he let -- he always -- he talks more about, sometimes, Rozia than my mother.</span> <span id="s525">So that hurts.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: Let’s go back to your freshman year that you blew.</span> <span id="s527">What -- what happened afterwards?</span> <span id="s528">So you did get a [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: I switched majors to political science and teaching.</span> <span id="s530">And I loved it.</span> <span id="s531">And I -- and -- and I have a teaching degree as well.</span> <span id="s532">I did my student teaching in -- in -- in high school government, which was very interesting cause I had the sweathogs.</span> <span id="s533">And I had a great teaching supervisor.</span> <span id="s534">And I brought my father in, talked about the war to these people, and about guns and violence.</span> <span id="s535">And that was one of the few days that they were silent.</span> <span id="s536">Was -- it was -- it was very good.</span> <span id="s537">Besides they made the bully of the class the leader.</span> <span id="s538">He was in charge.</span> <span id="s539">Cause maybe they wouldn’t pay attention to me, but they weren’t going to cross the bully.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: Did you see your father different in that situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: He loves people.</span> <span id="s542">Yeah, he shone -- he -- he was shining.</span> <span id="s543">He -- he was animate, he was full of life.</span> <span id="s544">It’s an odd way to put it, but I think he almost enjoys telling the tales.</span> <span id="s545">Again, I think it gives him a sense of purpose.</span> <span id="s546">But sometimes he gets choked up, he got choked up at my wedding, he got choked up when he blessed my -- my older son at his Bar Mitzvah, but he usually doesn’t get choked up.</span> <span id="s547">So, yeah, he liked it.</span> <span id="s548">I think maybe he liked the idea that I thought of him, to ask him to come and -- and -- and speak.</span> <span id="s549">Maybe it was an acknowledgement that, you know, I never turned my back on the Holocaust, but I don’t live it day in and day out like that.</span> <span id="s550">And I know that hurts them.</span> <span id="s551">I do.</span> <span id="s552">But I didn’t forget it.</span> <span id="s553">It’s still part of who I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: How did the students respond to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: They were silent.</span> <span id="s556">They gave him an amazing amount of respect.</span> <span id="s557">Probably admiration that he -- he survived and he was a soldier and that he made it, and oh, he fought the Germans, or the Nazis.</span> <span id="s558">So they respected him, cause a lot of these kids were street kids, and they have a re -- respect of the pecking order.</span> <span id="s559">And he was, you know, lieutenant governor of Kraków, and that was pe -- you know, prestigious position.</span> <span id="s560">And I hope they walked away from that with some knowledge.</span> <span id="s561">We also did a trial where -- we did a rape trial and I made the boys the victim, and had the women of the class on the jury and the judge.</span> <span id="s562">I reversed entire roles.</span> <span id="s563">And that was interesting because I’m very attuned to victims.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: You just -- you just said that, I was -- I was just thinking, did that -- do you think that you brought a different perspective to that profession?</span> <span id="s565">I mean, not to stereotype it, but to bring somewhat different experiences, and perspectives to that, because of --</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: That incident?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: No, because of your own experience --</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: [indecipherable] came from --</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Oh, absolutely.</span> <span id="s571">It’s probably the field -- why I chose this -- bec -- became a lawyer.</span> <span id="s572">Absolutely, I bring my perspective of the victim, I was always for the underdog.</span> <span id="s573">Even when I was in high school, they were -- they were called inedgibles, the mentally retarded children in the class, and you know, they were segregated.</span> <span id="s574">Not so much now, but -- I used to be the one to help them, lead them around, or take care of them, or be assigned to them.</span> <span id="s575">Cause I understood what the underdog was, because I never put myself as saying that I was going through the Holocaust, but I wa -- could always associate myself still close to my parents that it could happen to me, and that I had to protect other people because of that.</span> <span id="s576">That’s very strong, I try to make sure that my kids are survivors, so that if ever it should happen to them, that they could survive.</span> <span id="s577">But I -- and I make them very attuned to that -- or I try, and also very proud of who they are, and respect others.</span> <span id="s578">Very important to me.</span> <span id="s579">But I still keep food downstairs, a little extra food, in case something should happen, my husband laughs every snowstorm, you know, why you stock up like for years?</span> <span id="s580">And he doesn’t understand.</span> <span id="s581">I mean, I can explain it to him, but he doesn’t understand.</span> <span id="s582">Just this mentality that if anything should happen, I am prepared.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: We’ll talk a little bit more about that too, I just want to one more time go back and just ask you --</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: High school.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: -- when you go -- well, I sort of --</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: I mean college.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: -- well, basically, eve -- even a little earlier, di -- when you look back, did the Holocaust feature in schoolbooks at that time?</span> <span id="s588">Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: In -- only in hi -- only in Hebrew school, but no, not in the public school, this just not spoken.</span> <span id="s590">I was probably looked at as a very odd person that my parents were survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Did they know of -- di-did you talk about that at school?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: I personally, I talk probably more about it now than I did when I grew up, but no.</span> <span id="s593">But my parents always talked about it, I didn’t have to, you know?</span> <span id="s594">And it’s also -- and if you have an accent, somebody’s gonna go, where are you from?</span> <span id="s595">Even to my parents, it’s the first thing out of their mouth.</span> <span id="s596">And they’ll say, I’m from Poland, and my father jokes, I’m from, you know, the south -- south Poland.</span> <span id="s597">[indecipherable] a little -- and they’ll -- he’ll say then they’re survivors.</span> <span id="s598">So it comes out very, very quickly, where they’re from.</span> <span id="s599">I went back during my college years to Poland.</span> <span id="s600">I went with my mother on a trip.</span> <span id="s601">And that was an interesting experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: Because you wanted to go, or because she wanted to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: She wanted to go.</span> <span id="s604">Well, she wanted to go because there was a man who helped save her life, his name was Mundek, and I -- he was very ill at the time.</span> <span id="s605">And my mother said that he was always in love with her.</span> <span id="s606">He never married.</span> <span id="s607">He’d saved 12 girls.</span> <span id="s608">And she wanted me to meet him.</span> <span id="s609">And so my sophomore year of college I went to Poland, and at that time you couldn’t go as a Jewish group to Poland.</span> <span id="s610">Didn’t exist.</span> <span id="s611">You had to go with a Roman Catholic group, led by a priest to Poland.</span> <span id="s612">And that’s how we went, and that’s -- it was very interesting because I never told them in the group that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s613">I mean, I never brought it up.</span> <span id="s614">My mother didn't bring it up either.</span> <span id="s615">She basically said, you know, let us blend in right now.</span> <span id="s616">And I remember the priest took a liking to me, and he always tried to make me go to confession to all these different churches.</span> <span id="s617">And I kind of bowed out.</span> <span id="s618">And we had one week that we were spending with our friends, with the people that helped save my father, and the people who helped save my mother.</span> <span id="s619">But while we were in the tour group, there was also a -- a group, they were the fir -- there was a group of first Christians or something like that, they were from Ohio, and they don’t cross themselves either, and they don’t go into confession.</span> <span id="s620">So I kind of said I -- I can’t do that, or whatever.</span> <span id="s621">And he had no clue that I was Jewish, none.</span> <span id="s622">And there was a woman there who right away everybody knew she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s623">She also had a -- she was from Auschwitz, so she had the symbol.</span> <span id="s624">But even before, they kind of knew.</span> <span id="s625">They used to tell Jewish jokes on the bus, and they still made fun of Jews.</span> <span id="s626">Hardly any Jews in Poland at the time and they still made fun of us.</span> <span id="s627">And I -- and I knew then how my mother felt.</span> <span id="s628">I used to wear a Moses holding the 10 commandments.</span> <span id="s629">I wore it on the inside.</span> <span id="s630">It was very interesting.</span> <span id="s631">Then we spent a week with the families.</span> <span id="s632">And I met Mundek, but we couldn’t talk to each other.</span> <span id="s633">But he was if -- there was like a light in his eyes.</span> <span id="s634">He was a very interesting, very nice man.</span> <span id="s635">But I spent -- we stayed at the house that -- of the woman who saved my father, because she had a house in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s636">And she had two children my age.</span> <span id="s637">We couldn't speak very well, but they all kind of -- if they knew that I was Jewish, it was just never brought up.</span> <span id="s638">Holocaust was never brought up, never discussed it.</span> <span id="s639">There was a language barrier.</span> <span id="s640">But there was one boy who came over who did bring it up.</span> <span id="s641">And -- and we liked each other.</span> <span id="s642">And I said to him, by the way, do you know that I was Jewish?</span> <span id="s643">I had to tell him, I don’t know, it’s -- something compelled me that I had to tell him who I was.</span> <span id="s644">And he said to me, we’re all children of Moses.</span> <span id="s645">But he was the only one of the group who went to the university.</span> <span id="s646">So it was very different, but I felt very strange there.</span> <span id="s647">You know, you would o -- go with other pe -- I would not -- I mean, he knew I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s648">And of course, I thought the other children knew because of what their parents told them.</span> <span id="s649">But it’s just not -- I was told in some parties not to bring it up.</span> <span id="s650">And then we went, you know, to see my father’s house.</span> <span id="s651">And I felt -- then I felt anger, because I couldn’t -- here was my father’s house, that didn’t belong to him any more, that was taken from him, and I wanted to go up to these people and say, this is my heritage.</span> <span id="s652">My mother told me, you know, obviously, not to do that, not to bring it up, not even to mention we went to a restaurant to have tea.</span> <span id="s653">No one questioned my mother, whether she was Jewish, no one thought about it, and I guess I don’t look that Jewish.</span> <span id="s654">It was not imprinted across my forehead.</span> <span id="s655">But at the end of the trip was the most interesting part because I sat next to the priest on one of the planes.</span> <span id="s656">And I showed -- he said, where do you go to school, and I said I went to BU, and on my I.D. was the Jewish star.</span> <span id="s657">And he looked at that, and you could see his eyes were widening, and he turned around, and he said, “That -- that looks like a Jewish star.”</span> <span id="s658">I said, “It is.”</span> <span id="s659">He said, “Are you Jewish?”</span> <span id="s660">And I said, “I am.”</span> <span id="s661">And he said, “Well, I like you anyway.”</span> <span id="s662">And I think to him, he thought he was giving me a compliment.</span> <span id="s663">But, you know, there are two ways to approach those kind of people, yell and screaming, butt your heads, not get anywhere.</span> <span id="s664">Shake your head, and be polite.</span> <span id="s665">Show them that you can be better than they.</span> <span id="s666">And then other ways, press your point.</span> <span id="s667">And I -- and I think that’s the way that I usually do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: When was that trip, roughly?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: ’75.</span> <span id="s670">1975.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Have you ever gone back?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: Since ’75?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: No, I went to Auschwitz then, too.</span> <span id="s675">The trip was -- that was also very strange.</span> <span id="s676">We went to Auschwitz, but again remember, we went with a Catholic group.</span> <span id="s677">And now they have tours and say Jews died there.</span> <span id="s678">When we went there, they didn't tell us Jews died there.</span> <span id="s679">The official tour was that many people died there, period.</span> <span id="s680">Not one word that Jews died there.</span> <span id="s681">But you could see that -- the fingernails in the wall -- in the cement walls.</span> <span id="s682">You can see imbedded lines that match fingernails in -- in the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s683">And you just have a chill.</span> <span id="s684">I mean, you know, there’s just a silence and a chill.</span> <span id="s685">And that’s -- you know, you realize that it will never hap -- you’re not going to let it happen again.</span> <span id="s686">But that’s something for the perspective, versus dwelling on the past.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: What was your mother’s response to that -- da -- ha -- and what -- what was your relationship to each other at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: We were close.</span> <span id="s689">That was probably one trip that we were quite close.</span> <span id="s690">I probably was not a very warm child.</span> <span id="s691">My mother wasn’t that warm either, I mean, she would hold my hand, and -- and stuff like that, and I didn't want her to hold my hand cause I thought that was not the right thing to do, you know, women holding hands together.</span> <span id="s692">But she would never come and hug and cuddle and kiss me.</span> <span id="s693">And I in turn was not a huggy, cuddly person either.</span> <span id="s694">I’m much more with my children.</span> <span id="s695">But we were close.</span> <span id="s696">I think that we did hold hands then.</span> <span id="s697">It was almost like the world against us, except for these people that we stayed with.</span> <span id="s698">It tends to bind you.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Did past become a little concreter in some ways then, because so much -- I imagine [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: Well, I saw all the pictures, my parents would always show them to me.</span> <span id="s701">So they became affirmed, but not concrete -- any more concrete, because I think they were already concrete.</span> <span id="s702">You know, if you’re in a ca -- you can see pictures of the gas chamber, and be in a gas chamber, and it’s a very, very different feeling, but they were always in my memories.</span> <span id="s703">I -- I remember once -- this was past college, but I remember once we were with these young people, and again my parents bring the Holocaust up right away.</span> <span id="s704">This woman stepped on a bug, and got upset cause she was a vegetarian, and -- and my mother said, well, that’s how they used to crush children in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s705">You know, there was a moment of silence after that, what do you do?</span> <span id="s706">It’s a very awkward pause.</span> <span id="s707">But that’s -- and -- and they never saw that it would be an awkward pause cause they had to keep telling.</span> <span id="s708">You know, some don’t tell, some don’t let go.</span> <span id="s709">And I think I had one of each.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: I think that’s probably a good place again to switch the tapes.</span> <span id="s711">So this is the end of tape one, side B, interview with Esther Dezube.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Esther Dezube.</span> <span id="s714">This is tape number two, side A. And I promised, in a sense, I wouldn’t go back to your childhood, but I would like to ask you one more question.</span> <span id="s715">Did your parents ever -- how did they respond to sort of the trivial childhood problems that you must have had?</span> <span id="s716">The little problems that loom incredibly large.</span> <span id="s717">Did that have any meaning?</span> <span id="s718">Could they relate to that at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: No, they couldn’t relate to it at all.</span> <span id="s720">They had no patience for it whatsoever.</span> <span id="s721">Basically they looked at me as -- they wanted to ig-ignore that it even existed.</span> <span id="s722">You know, I was studying that the Pilgrims used to dress up their children in adult clothes, because they didn’t realize children were children, didn't want them to be children, but to be miniature adults.</span> <span id="s723">And I think that’s what they wanted me to be, a miniature adult.</span> <span id="s724">I mean, they -- I think my father took pride in -- in that I was a little girl, but no, I don’t think they could deal with the trivial problems of growing up very much.</span> <span id="s725">It -- because, to them, they always compared it to the war, and it was so trivial to the war that how could you even be bothered, you know, by acne, or how could you be bothered with the fact that you’re heavy, until later on, finally I went on a diet, because I wanted to.</span> <span id="s726">And they still tried to push food on me.</span> <span id="s727">I mean, how could you, you know, be bothered by these things, kin -- in comparison to what happened to us during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: Do you recall moments of casualness, of -- was --</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: When we went on trips.</span> <span id="s730">Yeah, when we traveled to different countries.</span> <span id="s731">My mother didn't like to travel a -- my mother liked to travel as much, but she didn’t like to go around as much.</span> <span id="s732">Once we got to the countries, she’s perfectly happy reading in a hotel room.</span> <span id="s733">And my father I would explore.</span> <span id="s734">That was the time that my father and I really got to know each other.</span> <span id="s735">I remember in Paris my mother stayed in the hotel room, we went to the art colony, we went all around.</span> <span id="s736">But when we traveled, as if we were removed from the daily pressures of everyday life, that there was much more casualness.</span> <span id="s737">When we went on cruises, much more casual.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: I would just like to move the microphone just a little bit, so one second.</span> <span id="s739">[indecipherable] get a little closer.</span> <span id="s740">Okay.</span> <span id="s741">And there’s one more question about the family in Israel.</span> <span id="s742">So it was really difficult, we -- we talked about that.</span> <span id="s743">But -- but still, was it important for you to meet, at least a larger -- to have a sense of a larger family there in flesh and blood if you will, was that important since you didn’t have grandmothers, grandfathers in -- in New York?</span> <span id="s744">Did that give you a different feeling of relatedness in terms of family?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: To be honest, no.</span> <span id="s746">It was important that there was a state of Israel.</span> <span id="s747">It was -- it was important that I had a place to go.</span> <span id="s748">It was important that it existed and it thrived.</span> <span id="s749">But I was so used to being alone, and accepting of it, and they were so far away.</span> <span id="s750">So you gotta understand is, if I was going to rely on the fact that I had family in Israel, I would be miserable every holiday, because they weren’t with me during the holidays.</span> <span id="s751">They weren't with me, I couldn’t call them up and say, let’s do something.</span> <span id="s752">They were very far away.</span> <span id="s753">So, it was nice to know that I had family -- it’s the lizard.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: So we are just hearing a lizard here in an aquarium, but -- just as an explanation of the sounds we’re hearing.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: So i-it -- it was a comfort level, but it wasn’t like, oh, I had family, because it didn’t play into my everyday life.</span> <span id="s756">I -- I -- family is very important to me.</span> <span id="s757">I -- it may sound like a -- a strange, opposite approach to it, but it’s extremely important to me.</span> <span id="s758">And it was comforting that they were there, but not that it was a bigger picture and that I had some family.</span> <span id="s759">I tried to instill that in my children, it’s one of the very strong things I try and instill in them.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Well, let’s talk about not your children yet, because you need to meet --</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: We’re not there yet, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: -- your husband first, or at least somebody you love, I guess, first.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: Well, husband I knew since 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: That’s -- let-let’s talk about him.</span> <span id="s765">How did you meet, what did you like about, what -- what -- how did he become important to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: One, I believe that my mother had this all prearranged in many respects.</span> <span id="s767">But I met him at 14, we -- he belonged to a youth group called USY, United Synagogue Youth, and I belonged to that youth group.</span> <span id="s768">I was active in the Jewish movement, I was -- was president of that group, of my chapter.</span> <span id="s769">And we met at a dance, a friendship dance, and we were supposed to give each other keys.</span> <span id="s770">I went with another boy, he went with another girl.</span> <span id="s771">Yet, he gave me the key.</span> <span id="s772">And I didn’t date him after that, either.</span> <span id="s773">We were just good friends for many, many years.</span> <span id="s774">I knew his girlfriends, he knew my boyfriends.</span> <span id="s775">We had a lot in common.</span> <span id="s776">We’re not very similar in personality, but we had common ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Like what?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: Judai -- he came from a family was not religious.</span> <span id="s779">He is, I think, fourth generation, on one side, American.</span> <span id="s780">Israel was very important to him, it was important to me.</span> <span id="s781">Judaism was important to him, it was important to me.</span> <span id="s782">Stability.</span> <span id="s783">I crave stability.</span> <span id="s784">And he was a very stable person.</span> <span id="s785">Regretfully, he isn’t emotional at all, or romantic, or nothing, he’s just not.</span> <span id="s786">Maybe if I was -- hindsight is hindsight, but he is a very stable person.</span> <span id="s787">He’s a kind person.</span> <span id="s788">And he got along with my parents, my parents liked him.</span> <span id="s789">He would listen to their stories.</span> <span id="s790">And he used to like to fix things and my father liked to fix things, so that he fit in our family.</span> <span id="s791">I don’t have an easy family to fit into.</span> <span id="s792">So that was a positive sign.</span> <span id="s793">Has it develop -- it developed when I came back from Poland, and I -- I went to Israel for a winter vacation, and he had taken a year in Israel.</span> <span id="s794">So we met there, and I still was not the apple of his eye, his bicycle was.</span> <span id="s795">He toured Israel all over with his bicycle, and went through Europe all over with this bicycle.</span> <span id="s796">He was more interested in the condition of his bicycle than I.</span> <span id="s797">But when he came back, it was a very hard decision for both of us, because we were always good friends, and once you go past good friends, into a different kind of relationship, you can’t go back.</span> <span id="s798">So we had to decide whether we were willing to risk it.</span> <span id="s799">We were both very young.</span> <span id="s800">And -- and my parents pushed us into marriage, I’m positive.</span> <span id="s801">Cause we -- I got married three weeks after I graduated c-college.</span> <span id="s802">I didn’t plan my wedding, my mother planned my wedding.</span> <span id="s803">I didn’t even get to pick my dress.</span> <span id="s804">She kind of picked my dress, and I wanted to change it, and she kept saying no, no, so I think I changed it a little bit.</span> <span id="s805">I think I picked the colors, that’s about it.</span> <span id="s806">I walked into the wedding and everything was done.</span> <span id="s807">We were young, I was 20 years old when I got married.</span> <span id="s808">And we grew together.</span> <span id="s809">And I must admit, he’s much more stable and I’m much more volatile.</span> <span id="s810">I mean, you know, a lot of times I’d say, I can’t take this any more, you know, go away from me.</span> <span id="s811">And he’ll be the one say, no, we gotta work this out, calm me down.</span> <span id="s812">But we had that bond of Judaism, and of our heritage, which was a very strong bond.</span> <span id="s813">He wanted a ki -- he wanted the kids to go to Schecter.</span> <span id="s814">It’s very important to him.</span> <span id="s815">He still goes to Israeli book clubs.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: What about wanting kids, was that important to both of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: For you?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s820">I wanted kids and I did not want an only child.</span> <span id="s821">That was very important to me.</span> <span id="s822">You know, we had discussed that.</span> <span id="s823">The kids, the dog, and a house with white bricks, he keeps joking.</span> <span id="s824">And that’s why he tells me I always get my way.</span> <span id="s825">Kids were very important to both of us.</span> <span id="s826">Continuation of our heritage.</span> <span id="s827">I basically raised the children.</span> <span id="s828">He’ll concede to that, I think, because he’s gone a lot.</span> <span id="s829">He does a lot of research, he used to do a lot of moonlighting, more -- only this year he stopped the moonlighting.</span> <span id="s830">He wanted children so badly that I had just finished law school -- we were married still when we were in grad school together.</span> <span id="s831">He was -- I was up here, I brought him up here, I liked Boston.</span> <span id="s832">I didn’t want to return to New Jersey, I felt there was nothing there.</span> <span id="s833">Except my parents there was nothing there.</span> <span id="s834">So I -- I went to law school, he went to Harvard graduate school.</span> <span id="s835">Then I -- then he went to med school.</span> <span id="s836">And I took the bar, and I w -- said, we’re not moving.</span> <span id="s837">But when he was an intern, he wanted a child.</span> <span id="s838">I don’t know why, he wanted a child very badly.</span> <span id="s839">And I kept saying look, you’re not going to be around.</span> <span id="s840">But he really wanted a child, I conceded.</span> <span id="s841">We had a child.</span> <span id="s842">And he was gone all the time, so I have a very close relationship with my older son, who has a difficult relationship with my husband.</span> <span id="s843">But it was very important for us to keep up Judaism.</span> <span id="s844">He’s very proud of my parents.</span> <span id="s845">He can handle them very well.</span> <span id="s846">Sometimes better than I can.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: He can handle them well, or he relates to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: Both.</span> <span id="s849">I don’t know if he relates to them, but he can definitely handle them very well.</span> <span id="s850">He’s willing to listen.</span> <span id="s851">Sometimes I get irritated because I’ve heard it so many times.</span> <span id="s852">But he has that kind of patience.</span> <span id="s853">But he’ll -- he’ll listen to them.</span> <span id="s854">He’ll let them vent.</span> <span id="s855">I let them vent now, too.</span> <span id="s856">But I think in that way it’s a good match.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: Was it difficult for you to develop, sort of to give in if you will, or to -- to be intimate with somebody?</span> <span id="s858">I mean, because it seems to me that --</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: Because I was always alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s861">There was a -- there seemed to be so few --</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: I don’t know if I still give up all of myself.</span> <span id="s863">I don’t, I know that.</span> <span id="s864">My mother said she had a difficult -- she had some difficult times with her father.</span> <span id="s865">And I think part of that is also influencing me i-in -- you know, if you don’t give all of yourself to one person, you can’t get all wit -- all that hurt.</span> <span id="s866">So I know that’s part of it here.</span> <span id="s867">I’m much more of a romantic, he’s not, so I resent it.</span> <span id="s868">But no, in the beginning, it wa -- it wasn’t hard, because I was seeking it.</span> <span id="s869">I wanted somebody to care about me.</span> <span id="s870">My parents had -- care about me a lot, but in a different way.</span> <span id="s871">And I wanted a family.</span> <span id="s872">So that was really important, and he wanted that, so it wasn’t that hard.</span> <span id="s873">I’m a strong willed person, but I do give in a lot.</span> <span id="s874">I don’t argue as much.</span> <span id="s875">Bruce says I -- I win all the arguments, I don’t think that’s all that true.</span> <span id="s876">If there’s -- if the both of us are in the room, Bruce will talk a lot more than I do.</span> <span id="s877">I don’t talk on the telephone that much.</span> <span id="s878">I don’t enjoy it much mo -- and that’s part of being alone idea.</span> <span id="s879">I need my time alone at night.</span> <span id="s880">He laughs, you know.</span> <span id="s881">He goes to bed very early cause he gets up very early, cause he’s a physician.</span> <span id="s882">But I need that time from like 11 to 12:30 at night, and I’m alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: You became a trial lawyer --</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: -- too?</span> <span id="s886">So that you have also a very intense, talkative job in a -- in a way.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: I mean, you talk yourself out during the day, in a sense [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: I do, I talk myself out during the day, I’m always on the phone, I’m always with the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s890">I make -- I became a -- that was definitely related to the Holocaust, and actually I think my husband’s vocation is related to the Holocaust, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: What is he?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: He’s an AIDS oncologist.</span> <span id="s893">And I know that he chose to go into AIDS when it wasn’t popular.</span> <span id="s894">I don’t know if it’s still popular, but he had to fight a lot of battles.</span> <span id="s895">Why in the world would a straight person want to deal with these type of people?</span> <span id="s896">And that’s basically what they used to say.</span> <span id="s897">And he said that the hol -- that the Jews were viewed that way too, and if we don’t stand up for these people, who would sta -- who stood up for the Jews?</span> <span id="s898">We have to stand up for these people so that doesn’t happen again.</span> <span id="s899">And that’s why he went into that field.</span> <span id="s900">And I’ve had to write many letters to the hospitals that tried to take his -- his room away, and all sorts of interesting dynamics.</span> <span id="s901">But he fought on and he wrote [indecipherable], and he do -- he loves his field.</span> <span id="s902">Does research and sees patients too, at the same time.</span> <span id="s903">And I went into plaintiff law.</span> <span id="s904">I never in my life considered being defense, ever.</span> <span id="s905">Because the plaintiff was always the underdog.</span> <span id="s906">I never considered -- there’s many different areas of trial law, corporate law, or my father wanted me to be a real estate lawyer.</span> <span id="s907">Just wasn’t for me cause it didn’t involve dealing with people, and protecting victim’s rights.</span> <span id="s908">That was important to me that I protect them against -- and I -- and I view the insurance companies as people who -- or companies who take advantage of people.</span> <span id="s909">And I wouldn’t let that happen to me, it would go against my grain.</span> <span id="s910">So when I try a case, a little [indecipherable] of that is in me.</span> <span id="s911">It makes it easier when you try a case that way.</span> <span id="s912">I won’t take cases that I feel th-the people aren’t trying -- you know, telling the truth.</span> <span id="s913">I -- I -- I -- I really make it a point that I want to be respected in my field.</span> <span id="s914">I can’t be a top trial lawyer, because I have children and you have choices in life to make.</span> <span id="s915">And I made the choice that my family does come first.</span> <span id="s916">And I’m not unhappy with that choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: When you thought about parenting, before you had them, or just when you -- when you just had the -- your oldest son, what was sort of the -- was there some kind of plan, quote unquote, did you want to do something different from what you had experienced, did you have your own dreams?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: What -- what would you -- what was sort of the game plan [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: If you find the parent’s manual, please show it to me, cause I have never read it yet.</span> <span id="s921">There were qualities of my parents that I wanted to continue and there were a lot of qualities that I didn’t want to continue.</span> <span id="s922">I didn't want to be as judgmental, though I must admit I’m judgmental on things, but I don’t think I’m as judgmental across the board as they are.</span> <span id="s923">I didn’t want to live in the past, and I wanted to give them space.</span> <span id="s924">What I wanted to continue is their love of Judaism, love of family.</span> <span id="s925">My parents would probably do anything for me, and give me things.</span> <span id="s926">They’ve done a lot financially and spiritually for me.</span> <span id="s927">I want my kids -- I want to do that for my children.</span> <span id="s928">In a sense that’s a little bit of an argument with my husband, too.</span> <span id="s929">He’s more let them tough it out and I’m not.</span> <span id="s930">But I suppose that was part of the game plan, to create a heritage in a family.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: Did it work?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: I don’t know yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: It’s a work in progress.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: You know -- you know it works only when they have a family, because right now they’re under my roof.</span> <span id="s935">So it’s very hard to see what they’re going to take with them.</span> <span id="s936">I see a little bit more of that now with my older son, because he’s almost 18, but it’s hard to tell with my younger two.</span> <span id="s937">I remember though, control issue, when I’d given birth to my oldest son, I was 27 and my mother called me and said I was too young to raise my child, she was going to take him away.</span> <span id="s938">I think that was the only time I hung up the phone on Mother.</span> <span id="s939">You know, my husband se -- keeps saying, what -- what goes in one ear can go out the other ear.</span> <span id="s940">I’m trying to apply that a lot more as I get older.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Do you think she was serious about -- I mean [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: Oh yeah, she was quite serious.</span> <span id="s943">She didn't act on it, but I -- at the moment I think she was quite serious about it.</span> <span id="s944">I walked my child, it was March, in the stroller, you know.</span> <span id="s945">I didn't keep him in a playpen.</span> <span id="s946">I was obviously -- you know, you don’t know until you have kids that, oh, my parents kept me always in a playpen.</span> <span id="s947">And she would get angry at me that I didn’t do those things.</span> <span id="s948">I held them too much, I cuddled them too much, I spoiled them too much.</span> <span id="s949">And I didn’t believe in those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: Though she craved it so much herself, when she came to this country and didn’t find any of that, that was so strong in her interview.</span> <span id="s951">That she talked --</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: -- again and again, I do not -- I did not find the love and the warmth that I wanted.</span> <span id="s954">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: And so you build a wall.</span> <span id="s956">You have a choice, you can have a nervous breakdown and crack, or you build self defense to those things and go on.</span> <span id="s957">And that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s958">And also, I guess, the European way is -- is that again, kids probably were in playpens, and that’s how she was brought -- she was brought up she had a maid, so I had a maid til I was three.</span> <span id="s959">She didn’t -- I mean, she would take pride in the fact that she used to bathe me.</span> <span id="s960">My father used to read to me, my mother used to bathe me and the rest of the time I was with the nanny until I was three, because she would teach, or whatever, but you know, it wasn’t that si -- close.</span> <span id="s961">I mean, now, you know, people realize how much the bonding is important.</span> <span id="s962">I mean, people didn’t know that then.</span> <span id="s963">But I -- I didn’t -- I did not have an au pair until I had a third child.</span> <span id="s964">I had always somebody come in and help me, but I -- I still to this day don’t work full time, I work part time, so that I’m the one who runs around when they have the plays in the schools and the doctors appointments and -- and all that.</span> <span id="s965">I do that.</span> <span id="s966">My au pair doesn’t do that.</span> <span id="s967">Never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: Describe your three sons a little bit to me, and also you mentioned in the beginning the names, so you chose to name them after --</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s970">Dustin, now we have English and Hebrew names too.</span> <span id="s971">So Dustin’s is -- is -- I mean, you say Dustin’s not a very Jewish name.</span> <span id="s972">It’s a German name, it means victorious, or -- going back, but his name is Dustin Isaac, and he his Hebrew name is David Itzhak, or David Isaac.</span> <span id="s973">David was a -- after my mother’s father, and Isaac was after my father’s father.</span> <span id="s974">You know, that was one thing I must say for my husband is, I mean, obviously he had a family too.</span> <span id="s975">And he didn’t object that I named them after my side of the family.</span> <span id="s976">He kind of understood that it was important to keep their names alive.</span> <span id="s977">And I credit him for that.</span> <span id="s978">And 18 is something they do in their family.</span> <span id="s979">And I felt it was just a wonderful idea, so that I incorporated it, some of -- like the spelling of Isaac is a little off, but it’s 18.</span> <span id="s980">Aaron Richard, and then his Hebrew name is Aaron Raphael.</span> <span id="s981">Aaron is after his grandfather, but even my parents liked his grandfather, and I don’t th -- and he had just died, so it actually fit in very well, but Raphael is -- is after Rachel, my father’s sister.</span> <span id="s982">Richard.</span> <span id="s983">And Michael -- actually we had a little problem with Michael’s name, my mother wanted Frederick, and I just couldn’t see naming my child Frederick.</span> <span id="s984">Now, we thought even Forest, they told me they wouldn’t even call him by name if he -- his name was Forest.</span> <span id="s985">They call my son, by the way, instead of Dustin, Dodson, on purpose cause they didn’t like the name.</span> <span id="s986">But so Michael was actually my idea cause my father has a sister named Malchia, and Fried is Frieda, but it’s spelled a little different.</span> <span id="s987">And his Hebrew name is Simcha Meloch, which is actually -- the translation is happy king.</span> <span id="s988">And that was their Hebrew names.</span> <span id="s989">So it’s interesting in school they dwell a lot on how you got your name.</span> <span id="s990">Ev -- almost every year they ask the kids how they got their name, and they’re supposed to write a report about their heritage.</span> <span id="s991">And they’re kind of proud.</span> <span id="s992">At first Dustin wasn’t proud of Dustin, didn’t like it as much.</span> <span id="s993">But now they’re -- they’re -- they’re proud of how they got their names.</span> <span id="s994">They don’t know these people very well.</span> <span id="s995">My father did write when they were born, about the parents who their named after.</span> <span id="s996">But -- so that was important, to keep that going.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: Did you read your parents’s books?</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s999">But I didn’t -- you know, I read their books, but they would test me on their books.</span> <span id="s1000">You know, did you read this, and -- and if I -- and if I got one thing misquoted they would correct me, and why didn’t you remember this, and why didn’t you remember that.</span> <span id="s1001">And they do it with my kids, too.</span> <span id="s1002">And I have at least the temperance of years behind me, my kids are not diplomatic.</span> <span id="s1003">So, you know, yes, I’ve read their books, but i-it was -- it’s sometimes a little difficult.</span> <span id="s1004">I wanted to read it to understand it, enjoy it, not to necessarily be tested on it.</span> <span id="s1005">But I knew most of it, not all of it.</span> <span id="s1006">I’ve read my father’s vignettes, and I enjoyed those.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: The -- the published ones?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: The ones that are coming out by Syracuse, because that really shows a lot of his character, and his -- and you know, his spunk and his mischievousness, which he a lot of times denies.</span> <span id="s1009">Because that really shows a lot of him, more than a lot of what the situation made of them.</span> <span id="s1010">So yeah, I read the books.</span> <span id="s1011">My oldest son has read the books.</span> <span id="s1012">My middle son has read one of the books, and my youngest son has read a little bit.</span> <span id="s1013">It’s difficult with him because he just hates to read.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: What’s the relation -- I know I asked you before describe the -- the boys a little bit to me, but before we get to that also, what is the relationship, too, of the boys to the grandparents?</span> <span id="s1015">Is -- is -- do th --</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: It’s strained.</span> <span id="s1017">All of -- for all three kids it’s still strained.</span> <span id="s1018">But they’re closest with Dustin.</span> <span id="s1019">One, he was the first.</span> <span id="s1020">And like it or not, even though my mother probably resented the fact that she was a middle child, all the time says, well he’s the oldest so he should get more.</span> <span id="s1021">He’s the oldest, that he should, you know, have this kind of privilege.</span> <span id="s1022">And I would look at her and say, but you used to complain about it.</span> <span id="s1023">But it’s different.</span> <span id="s1024">I don’t know how it’s different, but it’s different.</span> <span id="s1025">I try not to do that to them.</span> <span id="s1026">I-It’s strained because they would love for them to sit there and look at them adoringly and suck up everything they have to say.</span> <span id="s1027">My father started telling the Holocaust stories to my son when he was three years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Repetition of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1030">So that’s why I think he started with me at three -- until we put a stop to it.</span> <span id="s1031">He would have nightmares.</span> <span id="s1032">My older son is a very sensitive child, and I -- I think it warped him in some ways.</span> <span id="s1033">He didn't do it with the younger two.</span> <span id="s1034">We really -- I says, you can tell them you were a soldier, you can tell them that bad things happened to children, but not the gory details, and he went to the gory details with Dustin.</span> <span id="s1035">In one way, he relates to them better for that.</span> <span id="s1036">In another way I think that he’s a little saddened in life by it.</span> <span id="s1037">The younger two he -- he -- because we wouldn’t let him, basically.</span> <span id="s1038">He still tells the stories, but a much more -- not -- not a positive spin, but in the beginning it was a positive spin, you know.</span> <span id="s1039">I was a soldier, I survived, I -- against the bad guys and the Hitler and -- and so they don’t relate as close.</span> <span id="s1040">Now he’s beginning to tell them more of the atrocities, but they don’t want to hear it.</span> <span id="s1041">See, my son -- my older son is willing to hear it, but the r -- the younger two are not.</span> <span id="s1042">They’re just not.</span> <span id="s1043">And it hurts them tremendously.</span> <span id="s1044">I’m the bridge.</span> <span id="s1045">They can’t relate to it as much.</span> <span id="s1046">They’re very proud of them.</span> <span id="s1047">My father, you know, th-the -- that he survived the war.</span> <span id="s1048">They’re ba -- proud of both of them, but they don’t want to hear the constant tales of woe.</span> <span id="s1049">My youngest one when he’s older probably will be more attuned to it, my middle one, no.</span> <span id="s1050">He won’t hear it.</span> <span id="s1051">And they resent him for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: I think we should flip the cassette over again.</span> <span id="s1053">This is the end of tape two, side A, interview with Esther Dezube.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Esther Dezube.</span> <span id="s1056">This is tape number two, side B. I’d -- I want to ask you, and I’m not quite sure how to say it yet, but I -- it’ll come to me.</span> <span id="s1057">Had -- do you remember being punished when you were not good?</span> <span id="s1058">You seem to me ha -- to -- you seem to me to have been a very good, obedient girl.</span> <span id="s1059">I think you called yourself a goody goodshoe, I’m not -- but a-at least very quiet, and -- and - and good, an-and willing --</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: Yeah, I was punished.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: -- what happened, sort of how did it happen, when y -- an-and did -- what did you -- an-and how do you reprimand your own children?</span> <span id="s1062">Is there a difference in some ways?</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: Once I was hit with the belt.</span> <span id="s1064">Most of the time they would either take -- a-and when I was older, I had Barbie’s, they would put them in the attic, they would give them away.</span> <span id="s1065">I had -- once had a Shirley Temple doll that my mother just shattered when I was bad, she was mad at me for something.</span> <span id="s1066">I don’t recall what I did, but she was mad at me and totally shattered it, broke it.</span> <span id="s1067">It was more the isolation treatment.</span> <span id="s1068">You know, they wouldn’t talk to me.</span> <span id="s1069">Or at -- my mother has this look that you just know she doesn’t approve.</span> <span id="s1070">And she would keep looking at you like that.</span> <span id="s1071">There would be yelling.</span> <span id="s1072">I don’t think I was -- except for that one time that I really remember, I don’t know if I was ever really physically punished after that.</span> <span id="s1073">I was slap -- my mother would -- yeah, she -- and I -- and I did do that when it was in the beginning, but I’ve stopped that, she would take my arm and pinch it.</span> <span id="s1074">That she would do.</span> <span id="s1075">How do I reprimand my kids?</span> <span id="s1076">God, I tried the whole gambit.</span> <span id="s1077">I have three very strong willed child -- children and I have, you know, children who have ADHD.</span> <span id="s1078">So they’re a little -- sometimes a little more trying.</span> <span id="s1079">I would slap their hands.</span> <span id="s1080">I would slap their hands.</span> <span id="s1081">But I’d warn them.</span> <span id="s1082">Kind of say, I’ll give you -- and I used the word Hebrew makkah, because I didn’t want everybody to know what I was going to do.</span> <span id="s1083">So they know what that word is, actually.</span> <span id="s1084">And it’s, I’ll give you makkah if you don’t -- so sometimes they’d even give me the hand.</span> <span id="s1085">Once I slapped Dustin, I think, in the face, he did something that was just so rude.</span> <span id="s1086">Slap on the hand mo -- and then -- then we tried this method called time out, which worked, because he knew I was serious, I’d give him time out in the restaurant.</span> <span id="s1087">Put him in a corner.</span> <span id="s1088">It’s called one, two, three time out.</span> <span id="s1089">And they still know it.</span> <span id="s1090">All I have to do is show them my fingers, I’m pointing one finger, two finger, three fingers and they knew I meant time out.</span> <span id="s1091">It’s a little hard when the oldest one is 18.</span> <span id="s1092">Now his method is I take his car keys.</span> <span id="s1093">But that’s -- that’s how I do it.</span> <span id="s1094">That’s my punishment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: How did -- how did you relate -- or how do you relate to your husband’s family?</span> <span id="s1096">Is that a good relationship?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: My husband isn’t close to his own family, so it makes it much easier.</span> <span id="s1098">He’s okay -- my husband isn’t a close, warm kind of person, though his mother tries in -- in -- on her behalf, I must admit, her mother tries to keep the family together.</span> <span id="s1099">His father’s dead.</span> <span id="s1100">His father was a very kind, gentle man who was a hermit.</span> <span id="s1101">He would sit on the couch, you have no clue he was there.</span> <span id="s1102">But he was very fair.</span> <span id="s1103">You know, when he had something to say he would say it, but he was fair.</span> <span id="s1104">I get along with his mother, but his mother likes to talk about his mother.</span> <span id="s1105">I mean, it’s interesting when I go to her house, she’s very nice, she’ll give me care packages, she’ll send things and she tries.</span> <span id="s1106">But when the kids are there, she doesn’t interact with the kids.</span> <span id="s1107">That happened with my parents too, cause they didn’t know how to interact with them.</span> <span id="s1108">And I remember very clearly, Dustin was four years old and told my mother off.</span> <span id="s1109">I would never dream of telling my mother off, but he told my mother off.</span> <span id="s1110">She was mad at me that I brought up my son that way, by the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: And what was it -- what was the situation [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: Oh, I remember it very clearly.</span> <span id="s1113">He said, “You come up here supposingly to visit us, and all you do is read a book.”</span> <span id="s1114">He said, “Why do you bother to come to see us?”</span> <span id="s1115">I think my mother was in shock after that.</span> <span id="s1116">And she tried to make an effort after that, to do like chess with them, or something like that, or walk with them.</span> <span id="s1117">She still doesn’t know how to deal with them.</span> <span id="s1118">I don’t think she knew how to deal with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: You never challenged them in any way, in that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: They’ll say I challenged them all the time, but I don’t think I did.</span> <span id="s1121">Not in any major way, no.</span> <span id="s1122">Again, clothes or whatever, but not in a major way.</span> <span id="s1123">Not in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: How -- how did you feel, or -- how -- how did you feel -- how did you see yourself?</span> <span id="s1125">How did you feel, really feel about yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: I like myself better now than I did then.</span> <span id="s1127">Didn’t like myself that much.</span> <span id="s1128">I always saw myself as ugly.</span> <span id="s1129">Fat, which is probably accurate.</span> <span id="s1130">Not as much self confidence.</span> <span id="s1131">I was willing to take a lot more crap, probably, than I am now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: Did you ever see a psychologist or something, or was that something you would never do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: No, I would -- when I was -- I saw a psychologist once or twice.</span> <span id="s1134">I remember once, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1135">I don’t remember the story, I took a knife out of a -- out of the drawer and said I would kill myself.</span> <span id="s1136">My mother made me see a psychologist and I s -- the psychologist said, she was just acting out, there’s no issue in there.</span> <span id="s1137">I don’t know what started that, I really don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: Did -- did the psychologist know th-the family background?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1140">I was young, so I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1141">Do I see a c -- yeah, I see a psychologist, I have no objections for seeing a co -- psychologist.</span> <span id="s1142">My kids see a psychologist, we have a family psychologist now.</span> <span id="s1143">And we, you know, try -- with my husband sometimes we need to work on our -- we come from different backgrounds, different viewpoints in life, and if we’re going to make this marriage work, sometimes we need a mediator.</span> <span id="s1144">So I have no objections about seeing a psychologist.</span> <span id="s1145">I know my -- I know that my father received shock treatment when I grew up, and he was seeing somebody.</span> <span id="s1146">I -- I found this out later on, I didn't know when I was young that he was receiving shock treatment.</span> <span id="s1147">I -- I don’t think my father really takes care of himself, knowing a lot more about my kids, and the fact that they do have ADHD.</span> <span id="s1148">It’s genetic, and I’m positive my father has it.</span> <span id="s1149">He’s been diagnosed, I think, bipolar.</span> <span id="s1150">That -- I do see a lot of that in them and I think if he had gotten help younger, it -- he would have been a lot better for it.</span> <span id="s1151">But he doesn’t want help in that regard.</span> <span id="s1152">And it’s just like my middle son, you have to acknowledge that there’s an issue in order to get help.</span> <span id="s1153">It’s a difficult thing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: I think in the late 60’s, or even a little earlier, sort of studies about Holocaust survivors came out, psychological studies, did you ever read those?</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: There was a woman who once called me from California and said they were doing a study, would I be willing to be a participant and I said yes.</span> <span id="s1158">So I didn’t mind that.</span> <span id="s1159">I don’t read all the Holocaust books that my parents do.</span> <span id="s1160">I’m not a member of Second Generation, which my parents are extremely upset at me for.</span> <span id="s1161">And it’s not that I turn my back on the Holocaust, because I don’t.</span> <span id="s1162">I tell my kids about it.</span> <span id="s1163">I am proud that my parents are survivors.</span> <span id="s1164">I am proud in a lot of things that they instill me, and I try -- I tell my kids that.</span> <span id="s1165">They know that my father is a holo -- they’re very proud of him, like I said, in many ways.</span> <span id="s1166">But I can’t live it, eat it and breathe it like they do.</span> <span id="s1167">And on top of it, I have three tough cookies of kids.</span> <span id="s1168">I don’t have the time.</span> <span id="s1169">You have to give something up.</span> <span id="s1170">And where my father probably would not think of anything of -- you know, running here and there, and meetings and not really raising me because that’s what he did, I can’t do that.</span> <span id="s1171">And he doesn’t understand that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: Did you read some of the books that were written by children of Holocaust survivors?</span> <span id="s1173">Helen Epstein -- Epstein [indecipherable] in the -- I think in -- in ’79 it was published.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: Never --</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: I read --</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: -- curious?</span> <span id="s1178">You didn’t know about it, you didn’t want to get --</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: I would go to lectures.</span> <span id="s1180">I’d go to bra -- Brandeis has lecture series, I’ve gone to those.</span> <span id="s1181">And to -- there’s a movie series.</span> <span id="s1182">I’ve gone to that.</span> <span id="s1183">I’ve seen, you know, Europa, Europa, I’ve seen some of that.</span> <span id="s1184">It’s not that I’m not curious, but that I’ve had so much of it that I’m not so sure necessarily I’m going to be enlightened about it, because I think I have a pretty good grasp of how these people suffered and the tales may change, but the basic outline is there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: Well actually, the -- the -- the last question was not so much about your -- the survivors, but about the children of the survivors, whether you kind of -- if you read books about the second generation, whether you were interested in it, first of all, to read those, and if you did, did you find yourself in them, or do you feel that you don’t quite fit there either?</span> <span id="s1186">Is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: No, I haven’t read it so much, but it’s very interesting is that you know who another child survivor is.</span> <span id="s1188">If I walk in the room I can tell, and they can tell.</span> <span id="s1189">I can’t explain it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: Try.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: It’s like when I went to a Schecter meeting and there was another woman there and we talked.</span> <span id="s1192">And I found out she was a survivor -- a child survivor, and we just knew that each other were child survivors, it’s some -- maybe our outlook on life.</span> <span id="s1193">We’re a little more serious, maybe.</span> <span id="s1194">Probably a little more warped.</span> <span id="s1195">Family, I think, for child survivors are very important.</span> <span id="s1196">I find that is a unifying fact in every one of the child survivors that I’ve met.</span> <span id="s1197">There’s this woman now from Israel, that we met through another family, child surviv -- you know, survivor, and we’re -- we’re close, it just -- I know what you’ve gone through, I know the stories that you’ve gone through.</span> <span id="s1198">I know that, you know, your parents always say that, you know, we didn’t have this and you do.</span> <span id="s1199">And we’re doing all this for you cause we have no one else.</span> <span id="s1200">You just know.</span> <span id="s1201">And you know that either you’re going to resent your parents for it, or you try to deal with it.</span> <span id="s1202">I don’t resent them for who they are.</span> <span id="s1203">Maybe when I was younger a little bit.</span> <span id="s1204">I can understand that they went through hell, and that I’m just going to have to be accepting of who they are.</span> <span id="s1205">I’m not going to be able to change them.</span> <span id="s1206">You know, for many years you try to change somebody, and you realize you can’t do that.</span> <span id="s1207">So you either respect them, or you distance yourself, or you want to have nothing to do with them, those are the three choices.</span> <span id="s1208">When you don’t have a family, that’s not an option.</span> <span id="s1209">They’re the only things that I have to a family, so it’s just not an option.</span> <span id="s1210">And so that’s why I keep telling my kids, this is all we have.</span> <span id="s1211">We don’t have anybody else.</span> <span id="s1212">You have to stand up for each other.</span> <span id="s1213">You have to stick together.</span> <span id="s1214">That kind of bonding I’m not sure is in a regular family.</span> <span id="s1215">Everybody else is doing their own thing and not -- I tell the brothers, you better protect each other.</span> <span id="s1216">Who else do you have?</span> <span id="s1217">You know, you better understand, you may not like what [indecipherable] have to do.</span> <span id="s1218">They come in and my father will scream at them, they’re not wearing socks.</span> <span id="s1219">And they say, we’re not cold.</span> <span id="s1220">And that we’re bad children because we don’t tell our kids to wear socks when they command it.</span> <span id="s1221">But I tell them, you know, you have to understand from where they’re coming from.</span> <span id="s1222">Put yourselves in their shoes.</span> <span id="s1223">I don’t know whether or not if you’re not a survi -- child survivor that you can understand that.</span> <span id="s1224">Or if you’re not gone through that kind of generation, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: Among your friends, are there any children of survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: No.</span> <span id="s1227">Except for that one friend who is Israeli, yes.</span> <span id="s1228">I -- I -- like I belong to a group of -- Havurah group, no, none of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q: Conscious choice or happenstance, or who knows?</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: I think it was more happenstance.</span> <span id="s1231">I mean I am friendly with this woman who is a survivor, but part of it subconsciously could be I still want -- I want to be an American.</span> <span id="s1232">I want to fit in.</span> <span id="s1233">I don’t know whether I’m co -- more closely to a lin -- aligned to these people be-because they’re Americans, but you know, if you also associate with survivors, you tend to bring it up a lot more.</span> <span id="s1234">That means you’re reliving it and reliving it and reliving it.</span> <span id="s1235">And I don’t want to do that.</span> <span id="s1236">When the articles come out on my parents, I’m proud, I-I show them to my kids, and they read them.</span> <span id="s1237">The little one is proud because his father is famo -- grandfather, you know, is famous, he looks at it that way, and you know -- my father goes, well, that’s not a good enough reason.</span> <span id="s1238">I said, let him bond that way.</span> <span id="s1239">When he’s older he can develop other -- a-and Dustin is much more respective of my parents now as he’s older and understands more.</span> <span id="s1240">So I see that the time is coming.</span> <span id="s1241">They don’t see that.</span> <span id="s1242">They had no parents.</span> <span id="s1243">They had no parents who ever butt into their lives, so they don’t understand when or when not to butt into our lives.</span> <span id="s1244">They just never had any mentors.</span> <span id="s1245">So -- a-and that’s why we sent them to Schecter, to be proud of their heritage, of who they are.</span> <span id="s1246">And again, to make sure that it won’t happen again to them.</span> <span id="s1247">And I think they see that.</span> <span id="s1248">I mean, my -- my middle one will go into a restaurant, very -- very -- and say, hey, there’s Christmas stuff, but there’s no Hanukkah stuff, why?</span> <span id="s1249">I don’t think an American kid would really pay attention to that.</span> <span id="s1250">So it has sunk in a little bit, you know?</span> <span id="s1251">I mean, maybe not the way that my parents -- but he’s very proud of who he is.</span> <span id="s1252">He’s very proud that he’s Jewish.</span> <span id="s1253">It was difficult cause my oldest son was dating a non-Jew.</span> <span id="s1254">I think my mother was much more willing to see -- let’s wait and see, my father went -- still goes bananas over it.</span> <span id="s1255">Absolutely goes banana -- has major battles with my son.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: How do you feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: I -- if it’s on tape and they marry I’m in trouble, but I don’t like her, because I don’t like her.</span> <span id="s1258">I don’t like her personality.</span> <span id="s1259">He knows that I would be very upset if he married a non-Jew and wouldn’t bring the children up Jewish.</span> <span id="s1260">I would -- i-if the -- if the person would convert, I don’t have an issue.</span> <span id="s1261">I don’t.</span> <span id="s1262">Then they’re as good as anyone else.</span> <span id="s1263">Because I think part of our heritage would be lost.</span> <span id="s1264">And I -- and I am very close to that.</span> <span id="s1265">I mean, my son’s Bar Mitzvahs -- you know, when you have a kid who lives in an affluent society and he’s having a Bar Mitzvah, it’s very difficult to have him not focused on what gifts I’m going to get, versus, do you understand what this mean?</span> <span id="s1266">That this is a tradition that you are perpetuating over thousands of years.</span> <span id="s1267">That if you’re not proud of who you are as a Jew, people will step on you.</span> <span id="s1268">Maybe an American doesn’t understand that.</span> <span id="s1269">And I look.</span> <span id="s1270">If somebody’s talking about Jews, or saying something and I hear it in the background, I’ll speak up.</span> <span id="s1271">I’m very proud of this person, his name is Lenny Zakim.</span> <span id="s1272">He died of a brain tumor last year, he was 47 -- t-two years ago, almost.</span> <span id="s1273">They’re actually debating to name a -- the new bridge in Boston after him.</span> <span id="s1274">He was part of the ADL, and he went to law school with me [indecipherable] was -- he was a year ahead.</span> <span id="s1275">I wasn’t socially -- we were not on social basis, but we always used to say hello to each other from the same law school.</span> <span id="s1276">And he would really go around, and make sure about anti-Semitism and stuff.</span> <span id="s1277">But it was only -- not only anti-Semitism, it was anti blacks, anti anybody who had issues.</span> <span id="s1278">And I think I’m instilling that in my kids, about discrimination.</span> <span id="s1279">That’s a product of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1280">It’s not only discrimination that you’re Jewish, and believe me, I’ve had some anti-Semitism, I haven’t had a lot.</span> <span id="s1281">My kids haven’t had so much, so they don’t know yet what it is, but they will, and I want them to be prepared for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: I just have actually a -- a couple of follow up questions.</span> <span id="s1283">Otherwise, I think we have touched on a lot of important things.</span> <span id="s1284">And one is a very practical one.</span> <span id="s1285">I forgot to ask you when, just for the record, when your children were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: Dustin was born March 11th, 1983.</span> <span id="s1287">Aaron was born December 17th, 1987, and Michael was born February 28th, 1990.</span> <span id="s1288">I have to say one thing is though, I’ve had many miscarriages.</span> <span id="s1289">That’s why I have the big gap between the oldest and the middle.</span> <span id="s1290">And because I really wanted a family, I never gave up.</span> <span id="s1291">I had eight miscarriages -- no -- yeah, eight miscarriages, three live births.</span> <span id="s1292">And I think part of that keeping me going, although I would get almost hives when I would go into the op -- the -- the -- the gynecologist’s office was that I really wanted a family th -- to perpetuate our heritage.</span> <span id="s1293">That was very important to me.</span> <span id="s1294">So I just didn’t give up.</span> <span id="s1295">And they know that.</span> <span id="s1296">I mean, I sing Shema to them every night, and even my s -- oldest one still asks for that.</span> <span id="s1297">To understand, you know, that this is where it’s coming from.</span> <span id="s1298">I don’t know -- Shema is an affirmation of one God, but it’s also supposed to be said as the last thing on your mouth before death.</span> <span id="s1299">And then, just you know, make sure that they understand that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: One other question until I remember another one, is sort of political.</span> <span id="s1301">You have gone through, in your teens actually, Civil Rights movement, Women’s movement, all of these things kind of are also part of who you are to some degree at least.</span> <span id="s1302">To what kind of degree?</span> <span id="s1303">What -- what -- what moved you, politically speaking?</span> <span id="s1304">What was important to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">A: Justice.</span> <span id="s1306">I was for the Women’s movement for equality and for justice.</span> <span id="s1307">I don’t go over backwards on it.</span> <span id="s1308">I mean, I don’t want any more rights, but I want to be respected.</span> <span id="s1309">I am -- I’ve dealt with that personally.</span> <span id="s1310">I was a women’s lawyer where they were just starting to have women lawyers.</span> <span id="s1311">I mean, there were men in my class, but the older men didn’t have women in their classes.</span> <span id="s1312">I was called deary during trials.</span> <span id="s1313">And -- and -- and my theory in life, as I handle almost everything with that one is somebody goes -- this one woman that was just outraged that he was calling me deary, aren’t you going to say anything to him?</span> <span id="s1314">And I said, no, because I’m not going to change him.</span> <span id="s1315">But if I’m a deary, I’m stupid, so I’m going to take it to my advantage, and just prepare.</span> <span id="s1316">And I won that trial.</span> <span id="s1317">And my basic thing is I start off with honey.</span> <span id="s1318">Burn me and you’re in trouble.</span> <span id="s1319">And then I’ll y -- rant, rave and scream, but I usually don’t rant, rave and scream first, cause I saw my parents rant -- my father rant, raving and screaming.</span> <span id="s1320">I’m not sure that he was better off for it.</span> <span id="s1321">I had a -- I was pregnant with my first child and they told me I was unfit to try the case.</span> <span id="s1322">Not the judge, but an attorney on the other side, because I would be going to the bathroom too much.</span> <span id="s1323">He was a black attorney.</span> <span id="s1324">The judge threw -- it was Christmas eve, the judge threw it out, and said I’m not touching this -- at least he was wise enough -- I’m not touching this one.</span> <span id="s1325">It’s much better for the younger women attorneys, I guarantee you.</span> <span id="s1326">They didn't have to fight that.</span> <span id="s1327">I campaigned when I was in college, for Scoop Jackson.</span> <span id="s1328">I went around and I did a lot of political planning, but a -- it was a -- politics is a very dirty animal.</span> <span id="s1329">I didn’t like the dirt.</span> <span id="s1330">So I -- and especially for a woman, it’s much e -- more of a dirty animal.</span> <span id="s1331">I fight for justice wherever it is.</span> <span id="s1332">For special education and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s1333">I’m an independent.</span> <span id="s1334">I’m registered as an independent, because then I’m not locked in the primary to vote for a Republican or Democrat, and I wanted to see where my vote counts.</span> <span id="s1335">So I’m more of that.</span> <span id="s1336">I mean, I hear what’s going on with Gore and -- and I’m outraged because I think that there were a lot of shenanigans going on and the people’s votes weren’t counted.</span> <span id="s1337">It’s not so much Gore as a person to win, or Bush, though I think Bush is an idiot.</span> <span id="s1338">But the fact is that these people were turned away from voting, these votes didn’t count.</span> <span id="s1339">And that gets my gall.</span> <span id="s1340">It’s the underdog again, that gets my gall.</span> <span id="s1341">I’ve rallied for Israel.</span> <span id="s1342">I don’t do it so much now.</span> <span id="s1343">I’m a little more laid back now than I used to be, but that’s the only way I can handle my work load and my kids.</span> <span id="s1344">Cause I don’t have three wallflowers.</span> <span id="s1345">I mean, sometimes I wish for three wallflowers, but I don’t have them.</span> <span id="s1346">And I want to make sure that they grow up to be people that give to the community, that’s important to me.</span> <span id="s1347">They give something of themselves to the community.</span> <span id="s1348">My oldest son gave 10 percent of his Bar Mitzvah money to charity, to the Home of Little Wanderers.</span> <span id="s1349">That was -- I didn't care which charity, but it was imperative that he gave.</span> <span id="s1350">My youngest one says, I know, I have to give.</span> <span id="s1351">So at least I -- you know, good.</span> <span id="s1352">You’re going to have to give.</span> <span id="s1353">And he chose -- you know, he’s gonna choo -- he chose that Home for Little Wanderers, so he’s going to give.</span> <span id="s1354">That’s important, for my kids to give back to the community and not always take.</span> <span id="s1355">It’s not easy, especially when you live in an affluent community.</span> <span id="s1356">But my oldest one works at a soup kitchen.</span> <span id="s1357">Third week of the month he cooks and he delivers.</span> <span id="s1358">My youngest one -- my middle one does a little bit.</span> <span id="s1359">My youngest one has to be pushed a little.</span> <span id="s1360">He’s probably not as giving at the others.</span> <span id="s1361">But we’re working on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: I have one more question, but before I ask that final one, is there anything that relates to what we have talked about, and that I haven’t asked -- touched upon, or that’s important for you to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: I think part of the Holocaust children don’t want -- do not want to be seen as different, a-although we are.</span> <span id="s1364">We want to be normal.</span> <span id="s1365">I don’t know what normal is, but we want to be normal.</span> <span id="s1366">And the only problem is our viewpoint of normalcy comes from a different plane than other people.</span> <span id="s1367">I think that we carry -- we’re a bridge, we really are.</span> <span id="s1368">And we carry the torch to our younger generation, our kids, to make sure that they don’t forget.</span> <span id="s1369">And it’s very hard, because unless they’re living with their grandparents, they can’t understand as much, and you do, so you don’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s1370">You understand where they’re coming from, because they’re removed and you understand where you parents are coming from, because you lived with it.</span> <span id="s1371">And so you get battled from both ends.</span> <span id="s1372">And sometimes you feel like the mediator between generations.</span> <span id="s1373">And it’s -- it’s not the easiest thing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: And my last question is why did you agree to do this interview?</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">A: Part curiosity.</span> <span id="s1376">Part my parents, and part that I want people to understand who we are, and to be accepted for who we are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: Well thank you very much for having accepted the interview.</span> <span id="s1378">[indecipherable] This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Esther Dezube.</span> <span id="s1379">Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s1380">Oh, this is the end of tape two, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">End of Tape Two, Side
