I always remember singing and dancing at home.</span> <span id="s36">The parents were very good to us.</span> <span id="s37">They took a big part in our lives.</span> <span id="s38">They cared a lot for us, and we were all, we were very happy then.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Do you remember the character of your father, what your father was like and what your relationship was like?</span> <span id="s40">Were you very close with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: My father was an educated man.</span> <span id="s42">He was - he didn’t mix into our lives, into the kids.</span> <span id="s43">My mother took complete charge of us.</span> <span id="s44">She was like our friend.</span> <span id="s45">She was always interested in every aspect of our lives, and we responded to her that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: And was your father sort of a distant father?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: He wasn’t a distant father, but he didn’t mix into our upbringing.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: So, did you have private time with your father or primarily private time with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Rather with my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: And, since you were the eldest child, what was your relationship with your two younger sisters?</span> <span id="s51">One was two years younger then you and the other is, what, five years younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Yes, five.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: So, were you close with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Well, I was close with them, but they say, I don’t remember this, but they say I was bossy.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: You were bossy?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: That I was bossing them around, but we loved each other.</span> <span id="s57">We were always - we never had any fights unless it’s true what they say that I was bossing them around.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Do you remember - Chris said that you had - you all had to have collars for school?</span> <span id="s59">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Clean collars?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Clean collars.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: So, they had to be washed and then sewn on every day, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Yes, but that was when I was at school in Radom.</span> <span id="s64">I had a girlfriend, and since I was good at writing essays and stuff like that, I was writing her essays and she was washing my collars for me, and attaching them to whatever I wore.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Now, Chris remembers you asking her to do that for her before.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: That’s very possible.</span> <span id="s67">I don’t remember, but it’s possible.</span> <span id="s68">Her things were always neatly hung up in the closet.</span> <span id="s69">I remember, we had a shelf together.</span> <span id="s70">My mother divided it, and she says, “You will have one side, and Chris will have the other side.”</span> <span id="s71">Hers was always neatly put together, and mine was a mish-mash.</span> <span id="s72">So, I remember my mother says, “Why can’t you keep it like your sister?”</span> <span id="s73">I said, “She has a better side.”</span> <span id="s74">So, Krysia says, “Okay, I’ll give you my side.”</span> <span id="s75">And soon enough, this side was all neatly put together and mine was all messy.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: [Laughs.]</span> <span id="s77">What did you like to study?</span> <span id="s78">Did you like studying?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: I was a very good student.</span> <span id="s80">My mother - my mother calls me a genius, and I believed her.</span> <span id="s81">[Laughs.]</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Well, your sisters call you a genius too, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: That’s - my mother was very proud of me because I was very well brought up, like I had very nice manners and since I was a little assimilated and I had a lot of Polish girlfriends, usually the Polish parents did not like the Datastrassas (ph), the Jews, but since I was so well brought up and polite at all time, and I was helping them with school, I was always welcome to their homes, and to me, at that time, it was very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Why was it so important?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: It was important because I wanted to be one of them, because I felt so persecuted as a Jew that I felt that - I just wanted - at that time, when I was a kid - don’t forget, that that was at the time when I was nine, eight, ten, you know - I wanted to be one of them at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: So, explain how to me persecuted as a Jew?</span> <span id="s87">What was it like for you as a Jewish child?</span> <span id="s88">A: Actually, I felt it because I noticed that we had - in our town, there was a lot of religious Jews.</span> <span id="s89">Most of the Jewish people that lived in Wierzbnik were religious, and I always saw Polacks, throwing stones at them, talking to them in a way that it was ridiculing them, and so - I, personally, since I was just a child at the time, I didn’t feel it, and being with the Polish girls, you know, associating with them, I didn’t feel it, but I saw it on the outside, and that’s why maybe I wanted to be one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Did you yourself feel uncomfortable with the very Orthodox Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: To a point, because they - they couldn’t speak Polish.</span> <span id="s92">I mean, they spoke Polish with an accent.</span> <span id="s93">They spoke mostly, among themselves, they spoke Yiddish, and being so very religious, they had a certain mannerism that distinguished them for the other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">They were dressed differently.</span> <span id="s95">They acted differently.</span> <span id="s96">They spoke differently.</span> <span id="s97">So, but I identified with them, but sometimes I felt a little bit uncomfortable with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Do you remember what the population of Starachowice was?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Yes, it was - Wierzbnik-Starachowice were like twin cities, if you can call that that.</span> <span id="s100">That total population was 35,000, and ten percent of it were Jewish people like between 3,200 to 3,500.</span> <span id="s101">And, most of them lived in Wierzbnik; some Poles lived in Wierzbnik, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Starachowice was mostly - in Starachowice, there were mostly - not mostly, I would say almost 95 percent Poles.</span> <span id="s103">They worked there because we had the munition factory there.</span> <span id="s104">They worked there and they lived there.</span> <span id="s105">Some of them lived in Wierzbnik, too, but all Jews lived in Wierzbnik.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: You left?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: I left.</span> <span id="s108">My mother sent me to school in Radom when I was eleven years old.</span> <span id="s109">Q: Was that an ordinary thing?</span> <span id="s110">Why did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: No, because I was a good student and we had what they call Gymnasium, which was a high school in Starachowice, but it wasn’t one of the best.</span> <span id="s112">In Radom, there was - there was one of the best girls’ school, but it was almost impossible to get in for the Jews.</span> <span id="s113">At first, we had numerus klausus (ph), which meant one Jewish girl for 45 students in a class would be accepted, and then in the later years it was numerus nolus (ph), which means none of the Jewish girls could be accepted.</span> <span id="s114">So, I was lucky.</span> <span id="s115">You have to pass a competitive exam, and you had to really be very, very good to be accepted.</span> <span id="s116">So, my mother tried - she sent me there and I passed the exam, and at the end of the year, she found out that I was accepted.</span> <span id="s117">So, for her it was the biggest achievement that she could ever achieve at the time which - and I went to that school there and I lived on my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Like, I had relatives, but my mother placed me in a - like she rented a room, with like there were kids there my age.</span> <span id="s119">So, she rented a room with a family, and that’s where I stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Did that scare you to go away?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: At first it did.</span> <span id="s122">As a matter of fact, I cried for a long time before I went there, and when I found myself there, I also felt a little bit strange, but soon I got used to it, and I got to know all the people my age and a year older or a year younger, because they were several schools in Radom.</span> <span id="s123">It was a big city with 100,000 people there.</span> <span id="s124">They had several different schools.</span> <span id="s125">They even had a Jewish high school, called Pzhiachu Wierze (ph), which meant “friends of knowledge”, if I were to translate it exactly.</span> <span id="s126">So, there were a lot of Jewish kids that were educated in Starachowice, Wierzbnik.</span> <span id="s127">The religious people didn’t send the girls to high school because of the fact that they had to go to school on Shabbat.</span> <span id="s128">You know, because we had six days of school.</span> <span id="s129">So, the parents wouldn’t let them do that.</span> <span id="s130">So, they had a lot of other schools that were connected with the religious movement.</span> <span id="s131">But in Radom, the parents were a little bit - I mean, it was a bigger city, and there was a lot of young people that were going to those different schools, and the schools were much better than in Wierzbnik.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Was it kind of exciting to be in a much larger city?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: Well, once I got to know the people my age, I felt very good there.</span> <span id="s134">As a matter of fact, until today, I have a lot of friends from Radom.</span> <span id="s135">And, as a matter of fact, my husband made a party for them all like at the cottage a year before he died.</span> <span id="s136">There was fifty of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Really.</span> <span id="s138">And, what were your favorite subjects?</span> <span id="s139">A: At the time, languages and mathematics.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Mathematics?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Did that come from your father since he was an engineer?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Yes, that’s true.</span> <span id="s144">[Laughs.]</span> <span id="s145">It was -talking about home, when he counted, he counted in German, because he was educated in German.</span> <span id="s146">I count - no matter what language I speak - if I have to count, I count in Polish.</span> <span id="s147">My husband, no matter what language he spoke, he would count in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s148">And since you are talking about languages….</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: How do you account for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: I think you - like I was used to speaking - we spoke Polish at home.</span> <span id="s151">So, I was used to speaking Polish all the time, and because I suppose that I got used to counting.</span> <span id="s152">I think it’s very normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Did you write home a great deal?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Well, I did write home.</span> <span id="s155">Every week my mother would send me home-baking and stuff like that, a parcel, and then, whoever would travel to Radom, she would send something for me.</span> <span id="s156">So, when this person came I wrote a letter to my parents.</span> <span id="s157">We didn’t have a telephone at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Did you write to your sisters?</span> <span id="s159">Or does the one letter count?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: One letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Did they write to you?</span> <span id="s162">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: No, because we were, you know, for every holy day, I went home.</span> <span id="s165">As a matter of fact, the month of September, since Radom was about sixty kilometers away from Wierzbnik, it was a two hour ride on the train because I had to change trains half way.</span> <span id="s166">So, at the beginning, I didn’t want to go back to Radom because when I was at home it felt so good to be at home.</span> <span id="s167">So, the first month, I was traveling every day to Radom and back.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Every day to get home.</span> <span id="s170">But then, then later when the days became shorter, I stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">But I had a very, very good life in Radom because, as a say, I had lots of friends there.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Do you remember the Paliszewskis?</span> <span id="s173">A: Yes, I remember them very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Were you close to them also?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Very close.</span> <span id="s176">Those were the Polish friends of my parents, and we were very close.</span> <span id="s177">The father was - I mean, we called him a doctor.</span> <span id="s178">He didn’t have an education, but he, I mean, maybe he wasn’t a doctor really, but he was acting as a doctor.</span> <span id="s179">And there were four daughters there and they opened, how should I say, a school.</span> <span id="s180">Since the age of two or so, we went to that school.</span> <span id="s181">It was like a - I don’t know whether to call it a kindergarten or whatever.</span> <span id="s182">And they taught us - they taught us to such a degree that when I went to public school, the transferred me immediately the first day because I could read and write already, and then I skipped again, because they were very good teachers and they were very good friends of our parents.</span> <span id="s183">We went there for Christmas and I enjoyed so much seeing the Christmas tree and she had home baked cookies on the tree.</span> <span id="s184">We really liked it, and they were very, very good friends of our parents.</span> <span id="s185">As a matter of fact, they kept certain things for us, like valuables and they - and this was the only family that returned our valuables after the war because I also had - we also had friends, they were also teachers, that we left some clothes and stuff like this, and when we came back, they wouldn’t give us anything.</span> <span id="s186">Not only that they wouldn’t give us anything, but they said, “If you are need, go to the Jewish congress.”</span> <span id="s187">So, the Paliszewskis were very, very exceptional.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: So, in your experience with Polish Catholics, that’s an unusual experience, the Paliszewskis, the way they were with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Very unusual, but they weren’t - maybe they were, but I thought they came from the Russian side so maybe they were, whatever…</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Greek Orthodox?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Greek Orthodox, I’m not sure, maybe not, but Christmas was Christmas, so maybe they weren’t, but they spoke with a Russian accent.</span> <span id="s192">They weren’t born in Wierzbnik; they came from the Russian side.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Were there other Polish Catholic friends that you had, that you were that close with or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: I had a girlfriend, the doctor’s daughter.</span> <span id="s195">Her name was Helena Lambaska.</span> <span id="s196">She had, her parents were - in addition that he was a doctor, he was also such a Polish aristocrat, and I remember them.</span> <span id="s197">She was a very good friend of mine right through school, right through the public school and then in Radom, as well.</span> <span id="s198">And I remember when she came to us, she rode a horse and I was envious, but I was afraid of the horse.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: So, you never got on the horse?</span> <span id="s200">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: No, did she ever ask you to try?</span> <span id="s202">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Do you remember your dog?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Dog, yes, I think we had a dog called “Lady”, but I was mostly, at this time I was away from home, but I remember it being there.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: So, you left to go to Radom in ’33 or ’34?</span> <span id="s206">A: No, ’35.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: ’35, so you were twelve?</span> <span id="s208">No, you were eleven.</span> <span id="s209">A: Eleven.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: You were eleven.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: So, even though you’re still a kid, do you begin to hear things about what’s happening in Germany, or is that not very conscious yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Not conscious until - as a matter of fact, I had no idea.</span> <span id="s214">I mean, first of all, we knew what was happening in Germany, but we - I, myself, believed that Poland is so strong that we are not going to be afraid of the Germans.</span> <span id="s215">What should I say?</span> <span id="s216">I really believed that Poland was one of the, how should I say it, the strongest countries in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: So, you had no idea what sort of an army they really had.</span> <span id="s218">A: No idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: So, you had no fear?</span> <span id="s220">A: No fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: None.</span> <span id="s222">But, you were conscious in some way about what was happening in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: I was conscious, but I didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s224">Like, my father, who was educated in Germany - not in Germany, in Austria, I think, but he said the German people are so good, that nothing - I mean, not to worry about it.</span> <span id="s225">That, you know, like, that’s what he believed because he himself was brought up in a different atmosphere at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: So, a couple of years later, in ’37-’38, before the war begins and there are German Jews whose ancestors came from Poland, who are sent back to Poland and come into the area of Starachowice, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: So, do you see these people when you come back on vacation?</span> <span id="s229">Do you notice that there are these German Jews who have been sent away?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: But, there weren’t too many yet in Wierzbnik or Starachowice, but they might have gone to other cities.</span> <span id="s231">I don’t remember any German people.</span> <span id="s232">Mind you, when I came home, my mother used to send me to different aunts on vacation, and they all - since I was used not to being at home and my mother felt that my sisters had it better because they were at home and I was away., so when I came home she would send me to a relative for the vacation in another part of Poland.</span> <span id="s233">So, I really was very little in Wierzbnik.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Tell me - I want to go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s235">Tell me about your grandma.</span> <span id="s236">You all seem to have had an extremely close relationship.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Very close relationship.</span> <span id="s238">She lived about - I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s239">It would be about 20 or 30 kilometers from Wierzbnik.</span> <span id="s240">The place was called Ostrowiec.</span> <span id="s241">We had three aunts and a grandmother that we were very close with them.</span> <span id="s242">The aunts were very nice women.</span> <span id="s243">They were running my grandmother’s business, and the youngest one was going to university, and she finished pharmacy.</span> <span id="s244">We were very close with this grandmother.</span> <span id="s245">I was going there very often, and I developed like a friendship with many kids my age there, and I like to go to Ostrowiec, and my grandma liked us to come to visit her all the time.</span> <span id="s246">She was a very - she really loved us.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Did she teach you about Jewish prayers?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Yes, she was very religious, extremely religious.</span> <span id="s249">My grandfather was - I would say, he was wearing the clothes that the religious Jews wore.</span> <span id="s250">And I remember that on her stove, she had a wooden kind of a board that would divide the milk dishes, if she cooked milk dishes, and the other dishes on the same stove.</span> <span id="s251">She had this board so the vapor shouldn’t mix with the other.</span> <span id="s252">My mother was Kosher, because otherwise my grandmother would never eat when she would come to the house.</span> <span id="s253">But we were more traditional and my mother and father were very much involved in the Zionist movement.</span> <span id="s254">So, they were working for Israel all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: You may not remember this or even know this.</span> <span id="s256">Was your mother in conflict with her mother because she wasn’t as religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Never, no.</span> <span id="s258">As a matter of fact, she was very much loved by her mother and grandfather, I was told.</span> <span id="s259">The grandfather was so religious, and his sons - I don’t know whether Renia told you that his sons turned to be Communist.</span> <span id="s260">They had to run away because the grandfather wouldn’t accept them.</span> <span id="s261">Then he sat Shiva after them because he was so religious and they were Communists.</span> <span id="s262">So, how could that be reconciled?</span> <span id="s263">But my mother, regardless of what she was, she was very much loved by her family.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: So, was it odd for you to learn this much about - did she expect that you would become religious?</span> <span id="s265">Was that her hope?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: My mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: No, your grandma.</span> <span id="s268">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: She just wanted you to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Yes, right, and as far as my mother is concerned, I remember she brought in a teacher and she opened - because the Zionists had an organization, we had a room there - so, my mother was instrumental in bringing a Hebrew teacher.</span> <span id="s271">He lived in our house at first.</span> <span id="s272">He was like, you know, they couldn’t pay him much, and she opened the Tarbut school, and we were learning the modern Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: So, your mother opened the Tarbut school?</span> <span id="s274">A: My mother opened it.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: And there were a lot of children who went?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: I would say there was about twenty percent of families that weren’t orthodox, so they would send the kids there.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Because, of course, the orthodox would not go.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: No, they had their own school called Bysiarkev (ph) for the girls, and for the boys they were studying at the schribus (ph) and the synagogue - the religious ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: I think we may be close to the end of the tape, but I’m not exactly sure.</span> <span id="s280">Four minutes, okay.</span> <span id="s281">Did you graduate from high school before the war began?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: How many years was high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: High school and lycée, we had both.</span> <span id="s285">Like before the war, I finished four years of high school, and after the war, I went back to high school, and then I went to university in Poland, what they call Cultural Diplomatic school.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: So, as you’re going to high school, so between ’35 and September of ’39, right, do you feel things getting difficult, or are you still believing, “Germany’s not going to do anything.”</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: No, Germany will not do anything.</span> <span id="s288">I still believed it, because at school they let us believe that Poland is very strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: So, you don’t live with any fear.</span> <span id="s290">A: No fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: So, war must have come as a complete shock to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Complete shock to us and when we had to run away from home because they were bombing the factories in Starachowice, and we had to run away to different villages to just not be - but, Poland was taken in a few days.</span> <span id="s293">So, soon after the Germans came in - I wasn’t afraid of them at the beginning - but soon I learned that we have to be afraid of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Okay, let’s stop the tape and change it please.</span> <span id="s295">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Hania, what happened when the war began?</span> <span id="s298">You were in Radom at school.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: No, I was at home.</span> <span id="s300">I came home for the vacation in June, and I stayed at home, and the war broke out on September the 1st.</span> <span id="s301">As I said, we had to run away.</span> <span id="s302">We ran away to whatever close village.</span> <span id="s303">We stayed with some farmers, and when Poland was taken by the Germans, which was in a few days, we were sent home.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Was that a very frightening experience the evacuation?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: It was very frightening because we did - war was something strange to us.</span> <span id="s306">We didn’t know what war means, but we when we heard the bombs flying and when we heard that people got killed, we got scared.</span> <span id="s307">But when we returned home and the Germans came in, they walked with dogs.</span> <span id="s308">We were afraid of them, and we were told like when we were walking on the same sidewalk, we had to go off the sidewalk when the Germans were walking through.</span> <span id="s309">So, at first we laughed that they are so proud, they are so stupid, but then later we started getting scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: Do you happen to remember the first night you came back after you had been evacuated and you had a very formal kind of dinner, that your father wanted there to be a tablecloth on the table?</span> <span id="s311">Do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: No, I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: So, what is your first memory after you come back from the bombardment?</span> <span id="s314">What is the clearest memory that you have of how life changes for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: That we were afraid, but my father assured us that the soldiers and the government is bad, but the German people are straightforward, good people, that not to be afraid of the civilians, just the soldiers.</span> <span id="s316">But they were like, there were soldiers all over, only soldiers.</span> <span id="s317">I was afraid of them, but we just stayed away from them as much as we could.</span> <span id="s318">So, we didn’t pay very much attention to them.</span> <span id="s319">Like, we did, but when we came home, at first, like in 1939, there were things happening, but not - we weren’t really afraid.</span> <span id="s320">I wasn’t, at least.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Do you remember whether your sisters were afraid?</span> <span id="s322">Do you remember talking with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: I don’t remember this part of my life really that much.</span> <span id="s324">Q: Let me ask you this: you move about three times.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Between the first evacuation, when you come back to your apartment, until the ghetto is closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: Yes, first they moved - we lived on the main street, so, first of all, we were moved away from the main streets, and the ghetto was a little bit bigger, and then they squeezed us.</span> <span id="s328">We had to move because the place where we were, they moved us again a little bit closer to the original ghetto.</span> <span id="s329">So, we moved three times.</span> <span id="s330">I remember all those.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: You remember all those moves?</span> <span id="s332">A: Moves, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Now, was that - what did you think when that was happening?</span> <span id="s334">Do you know how…?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: You know, like, when I think of it now, I didn’t have any idea that it’s going - that it could be so bad.</span> <span id="s336">Like, we didn’t really - we didn’t know what was going on around us, like in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s337">We heard it, but we didn’t want to believe it, to believe in it.</span> <span id="s338">But we were more scared then than at the beginning, because at the beginning we lived a little bit more normal, but now we had to watch every move that we made because we’re not allowed to get out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s339">We were wearing those - we wearing the armband with the Jewish star in it, and if they catch you outside of the ghetto, they would kill you.</span> <span id="s340">I heard that.</span> <span id="s341">I had a case where I was very foolish.</span> <span id="s342">I had a boyfriend at the time who lived in Busko Zdroj.</span> <span id="s343">It was - but that was around ’41 already, and the parents invited me to come there, and Jews weren’t allowed to travel.</span> <span id="s344">So, they had hotels there.</span> <span id="s345">It was a place like where they had cures for arthritis and they owned hotels there.</span> <span id="s346">The Germans took away their hotels, but they worked there as workers.</span> <span id="s347">So, they send me a work order that I was supposed to work in the hotel.</span> <span id="s348">That was just - it was just for the purpose of me being able to go, to travel.</span> <span id="s349">So, I remember I went to Kielce, which was a place where the train stopped, and like when I say stopped, the train line stopped and there were buses going to Busko, and I couldn’t get on this train.</span> <span id="s350">I couldn’t get on the bus because they sent the Jews to the very end, and I was wearing this band, and the Jews to the very end.</span> <span id="s351">So, I was waiting the whole day there, and all the time, the Jews to the very end, I had to stay in line.</span> <span id="s352">So, I decided - I didn’t have any fear at the time - I decided to just hitchhike to Busko, because I figured I couldn’t do anything else.</span> <span id="s353">So, what did I do?</span> <span id="s354">I took off my band, put it in my purse, and then I stood on the corner and a car stopped and it was a guy, a German-speaking guy.</span> <span id="s355">He asked me if I would like a lift, and I said, “Yeah.”</span> <span id="s356">He said, “Where are you going?”</span> <span id="s357">I said, “To Busko.”</span> <span id="s358">So, he says, “Get in.”</span> <span id="s359">So, I get in, and he started speaking to me.</span> <span id="s360">He asked me - I didn’t know who he was.</span> <span id="s361">I had no idea.</span> <span id="s362">It was a German.</span> <span id="s363">I was scared to death.</span> <span id="s364">That’s the first time I was scared, but I was already sitting there.</span> <span id="s365">So, he started asking me where am I going.</span> <span id="s366">I said, “I go there.”</span> <span id="s367">He said, “For what?”</span> <span id="s368">I said, “I’ve got a job there.”</span> <span id="s369">“What’s your name?”</span> <span id="s370">So, of course, I gave a Polish name because I was afraid Laks was a Jewish name.</span> <span id="s371">I couldn’t say that my name is so and so.</span> <span id="s372">So, anyway, what he was, he was like a troihinder (ph) of the Jewish businesses.</span> <span id="s373">What it meant - the Germans took away the Jewish businesses, and he was like - he was checking on all those businesses, and among others, he was checking on this family that I was going to.</span> <span id="s374">So, I told him that I’m going to work there, and that was okay.</span> <span id="s375">So, he stopped in a place called Miernic (ph) because he had some business to do there.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">So, he asked me to sit in the car and he would take me because he was going to Busko.</span> <span id="s377">So, a Polish guy - in each city they had a Polish supervisor, in each town and city like on his way because he was the main one.</span> <span id="s378">He was in charge of it, but the Polacks were supervising those Jewish businesses.</span> <span id="s379">The Polack recognized me that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s380">He recognized me.</span> <span id="s381">He didn’t tell me anything, although I spoke Polish perfectly, and I thought I didn’t look Jewish.</span> <span id="s382">He recognized that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s383">So, when the guy came back, I noticed that he went and he told him, and this fellow - he was so nice to me all the way - he came and he says, “Bist du eiben?”</span> <span id="s384">So, I said, “Yah.”</span> <span id="s385">So, he screamed - do you understand what that means, “Bist du eiben.”</span> <span id="s386">- “Are you Jewish?”</span> <span id="s387">So, I said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s388">So, he said, “Wo hast du die Armband?”</span> <span id="s389">That means, “Where is your band?”</span> <span id="s390">So, I was stupid - at that time I was crystal clear like as far, I was so idealistic.</span> <span id="s391">I never lied, and I was so well brought up.</span> <span id="s392">So, I took my purse, and I took it out and showed it to him.</span> <span id="s393">He took me by the collar, threw my out, threw my suitcase.</span> <span id="s394">The suitcase fell apart, and he took - it’s a good thing he didn’t kill me because he could have.</span> <span id="s395">He was so embarrassed, you know, in front of the Polack, the Polish supervisor that he didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s396">So, he ran to the car so fast, and then the Polish guy comes to me and says, “Do you have anywhere to go in Miernic?”</span> <span id="s397">So, I said to him, “As a matter of fact I do.</span> <span id="s398">I know a doctor here, and his name is Dr. Reichman.”</span> <span id="s399">And I remember and he says, “I can take you.”</span> <span id="s400">So, he carried my suitcase.</span> <span id="s401">He carried my suitcase to Dr. Reichman there.</span> <span id="s402">He wasn’t even embarrassed.</span> <span id="s403">He caused all the trouble, because otherwise I wouldn’t have had any trouble.</span> <span id="s404">I’m telling you only how - not only that I was idealistic, but I was so naïve, and I’ll tell you, stupid to a certain point because, I mean, I didn’t do anything wrong.</span> <span id="s405">I just took a…hitchhiked.</span> <span id="s406">So, I don’t know what I was referring to when I told you the story when you asked me.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: It’s every interesting.</span> <span id="s408">First of all, the Germans could not recognize who was Jewish and who was not; only the Poles could.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: The Poles could, and I never - believe me, by accident, I don’t know how he knew that I was Jewish, and then I had to call my boyfriend from this doctor’s place, that I’m here and he worked for the Germans as a chauffer at the time.</span> <span id="s410">He was a medical student, but he was working for the Germans as a chauffer, so the German - his boss of him came to pick me up, and then from that time on, I was just sitting there.</span> <span id="s411">I was afraid that, because he knew what I was, I thought he would come and kill me.</span> <span id="s412">But, that’s how I trusted people.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: Did this Polish guy tell you why he told the German guy?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: I never told him.</span> <span id="s415">I never asked him, but I thought that it was - like, it was almost cruel because, I mean, the Germans, they all carried guns with them, and if he could kill me, nobody would ask questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Were you surprised that the German guy didn’t ask for your identification, because all of you had to carry identification?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: No, we did, and I did, and I had a letter where I’m going to work.</span> <span id="s418">I wasn’t going to work, as I told you, and he never asked me.</span> <span id="s419">I’ll tell you, whenever I’m late from that time on, whenever I met a German, I pretended that I don’t understand German.</span> <span id="s420">I thought that was the best - that was the best, if I couldn’t - if I don’t understand.</span> <span id="s421">I always said, “No.”</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Why?</span> <span id="s423">Why did you think that was the best way?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Because I figured that if speak German well, he will ask me more questions.</span> <span id="s425">This way they won’t ask any questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: And you being so honest.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: I was so straightforward, my father used to that he didn’t like it.</span> <span id="s428">Q: So, did you go to work at this place?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: No, I never.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: You never got there.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: No, I did get there, but this letter and the request for work was only for me to be able to travel, because otherwise I couldn’t get out, being Jewish, I couldn’t get out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s432">But if I got a permit to work somewhere, I was allowed to - of course, I had to wear my band - but I did wear my band until I couldn’t get on the bus, and if I stayed in Kielce, there was no place I could go anywhere, and I wasn’t sure whether the next bus will take me.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: And, the armband that you wore was white?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: White with the Jewish star, but at the time, when I went hitchhiking, I didn’t wear the band.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: What made…?</span> <span id="s436">You weren’t afraid to take it off?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: I wasn’t afraid because I knew that I looked Polish.</span> <span id="s438">I have no accent that would nobody would recognize me.</span> <span id="s439">I was told so many times in my lifetime that I don’t look Jewish that I believed it.</span> <span id="s440">I just told him a false name.</span> <span id="s441">Like, he asked me what my name was, so, I told him Lisowska, or whatever was a Polish name, the first name that came to my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Did you speak German with him, this guy?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: I spoke German with him, like, to a point, but I did speak German because he didn’t speak Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: He was really embarrassed because he didn’t figure it out.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: If you knew how he screamed at me when he threw me out of this car.</span> <span id="s446">He just took me by my collar and just threw me.</span> <span id="s447">He was so embarrassed.</span> <span id="s448">He wouldn’t have done that if the Polack wouldn’t look at it.</span> <span id="s449">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s450">Maybe I’m wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: When did you start dating?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: I was, like, shortly before the war, when I was fifteen.</span> <span id="s453">Q: Yeah, was that sort of a typical time for young girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Yeah, but when you say dating, it wasn’t dating.</span> <span id="s455">We went in groups.</span> <span id="s456">We never went one by one.</span> <span id="s457">Like, we met - we were going to movies together.</span> <span id="s458">So, there was a whole group of boys and girls, and of course, I had my favorite, or he had his favorite, but we were going always together, not by ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: And did you like going to the movies?</span> <span id="s460">A: Yeah, I loved it.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Any particular favorites?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: The old movies, Jeannette MacDonald and all those, the musicals.</span> <span id="s463">It was really like - every student was going at least once a week to the movies, at least once a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: These were American movies that you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: American movies, yeah, we didn’t have any others.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: I think it sort of surprises people to think about people going to those movies.</span> <span id="s467">A: Yeah, but we had subtitles.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: In Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: In Polish</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: So, Jeanette MacDonald singing.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Singing with - that was one of my most favorite movies.</span> <span id="s472">Her movies were - and Shirley Temple, of course, at the time, because she was so cute.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Did they show you dramatic movies as well and mysteries or was it mainly the musicals that came over?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: No, there were different movies.</span> <span id="s475">As a matter of fact at that time, we were collecting the movie stars photos and we were exchanging them.</span> <span id="s476">This was like a treasure.</span> <span id="s477">We were buying all those photos and putting them into an album, and then if - because they were quite expensive those photos - so if you had some doubles or if you didn’t like some, you could always exchange it with someone else because everybody had an album and photos.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Was this boys and girls?</span> <span id="s479">A: Yeah, both.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Both, and where would you buy - how would they selling them?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: I don’t remember, really I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s482">We often, when we get together, we often talk about the, the albums that we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: Because when I was a kid, people used to buy them, and they were in candy or bubble gum or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: I had no idea where we got them, but we had to buy them like…</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: I understand that, once there was no schooling for Jewish kids, that you became a teacher in your house.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Oh, that was during the war.</span> <span id="s487">Q: Right, that’s what I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: That was during - school’s finished for us.</span> <span id="s489">The war finished, like, we were not allowed to go to any schools.</span> <span id="s490">So, there was nothing else to do, and the people thought that I was intelligent, that I was smart, that I was going to Radom to school.</span> <span id="s491">It was a myth really.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">So, the parents started coming and asking whether I could give them lessons.</span> <span id="s493">So, I had two sisters.</span> <span id="s494">So, I figured I’ll open this - it wasn’t a school - whoever wanted to come, like, people that were more or less on that level, on Renia’s level I had a few, and on Chris’s level I had a few, and Chris was teaching.</span> <span id="s495">She was also teaching, but she was teaching younger kids, and I was good at school because when I was in Radom, I had a French teacher who just, I don’t know, she liked me, loved me.</span> <span id="s496">So, when people had problems with the French language - and I learned very fast - so when people had troubles, she says, she made me a tutor.</span> <span id="s497">So, right from the beginning almost.</span> <span id="s498">And, if I was their tutor, they passed.</span> <span id="s499">No, but most likely, I could do it.</span> <span id="s500">So, you know, I had a little bit of experience from Radom.</span> <span id="s501">So, when I came home during the war, my pupils were very happy with me.</span> <span id="s502">Some of them were until today - as a matter of fact, I went now to the Wierzbnik Society meeting and I met two of my pupils.</span> <span id="s503">They kissed me and went, “My lovely teacher.”</span> <span id="s504">And I was not very much older than them.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: That’s true.</span> <span id="s506">You were fifteen, sixteen years old at this time.</span> <span id="s507">A: Yeah, that’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Do you remember how you treated Renia?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s510">I think that I treated them well.</span> <span id="s511">I thought that, but I was very strict with my pupils, and especially strict with Renia.</span> <span id="s512">Renia says that I was sometimes I’d give her a smack.</span> <span id="s513">I don’t remember it.</span> <span id="s514">Renia must tell you.</span> <span id="s515">As a matter of fact, one day, Renia, like, when we arrived here, we got together the three of us, and Renia says that she remembers that I gave, you know, I smacked her a few times.</span> <span id="s516">So, I said, and I started crying because I didn’t remember.</span> <span id="s517">I said, “Why would I do it?”</span> <span id="s518">So, she wanted to be nice to me, and on the way home they came back out.</span> <span id="s519">She stopped somewhere.</span> <span id="s520">She called me.</span> <span id="s521">She said, “You know what?</span> <span id="s522">I remind myself that I gave it back to you.”</span> <span id="s523">She wanted me to feel better.</span> <span id="s524">She didn’t, but I don’t remember it.</span> <span id="s525">Maybe it’s true, but I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: Was this good for you to be able to teach them, to have that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: I was very, you know, like I was really happy to be a teacher because I noticed that the kids - those kids looked at me with such admiration.</span> <span id="s528">So, I really enjoyed it, and I know that Renia’s friend - the one in Israel - whenever she talks to me on the phone, she recites all the poems, even the Latin poems, that I made them memorize.</span> <span id="s529">I myself remember it.</span> <span id="s530">As a matter of fact, when I was in the university in Toronto after the war, after I came to Canada, and on my first - I took - the first course I took was French.</span> <span id="s531">So, I remember all the French Canadians, they speak perfect French.</span> <span id="s532">I wasn’t - my French was only from school, so I couldn’t speak so fluently, but I remember grammar and everything much better, and one day the teacher comes when we were taking La Fontaine, that’s a French poet, and he says, “Does any of you remember any poems?”</span> <span id="s533">And, remember that this is years and years after; that was when I was already Canada and we came here in 1948, and I didn’t go to school until 1970.</span> <span id="s534">So, that was in 1970.</span> <span id="s535">So, I said to him, “I remember Maître Corbeau,, but I don’t know whether I’d remember it all.”</span> <span id="s536">So, he said, “Would you like to try it?”</span> <span id="s537">So, I said, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s538">So, I closed my eyes like this and I started and I remembered the whole poem.</span> <span id="s539">So, after I finished, the whole class stood up and clapped, and I was so proud that I remembered, because, you know, it’s how many years from 1939 to 1970?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: Let me go back a few years, because I was recalling that Chris said that, prior to you’re going to Radom to high school, you would bring home friends and you would sit around and you would talk about books, and Renia said she also was listening, but she was sort of listening, and Chris said you wouldn’t let them be part of the group because they were children.</span> <span id="s541">Do you have any recollection of your friends coming into the house and talking about books?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: I had a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s543">I always had a lot of friends, but you know, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s544">Q: You don’t remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s547">What do you remember about your parents during this period, ’39 to ’41, when things are beginning to get tougher, but they’re not quite as bad as they become?</span> <span id="s548">Is your father working?</span> <span id="s549">He’s lost his job, I gather.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Yeah, he lost his job.</span> <span id="s551">First of all, he lost his job because he was assessing the forests and stuff like that for the government.</span> <span id="s552">In 1933, he lost the job and he lost his pensions.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: ’33 or ’37?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: No, he lost his - the government job in ’33, and then he started working in the same capacity for private enterprise, which wasn’t the same, and the reason why they let him go because they didn’t want to pay his pension, or because he was Jewish, they didn’t want to pay his pension.</span> <span id="s555">So, my parents went - they struggled but we lived normally like any other, because the Jewish people - the Jewish population, especially the religious ones, they were tradesmen, small businessmen.</span> <span id="s556">They were all poor, like, they weren’t rich people.</span> <span id="s557">So, although we were quite - we lived quite modestly, we weren’t any different than any other people.</span> <span id="s558">I remember, my mother learned a trade but it was, you know, I don’t really remember exactly what - my father was also selling something.</span> <span id="s559">I couldn’t tell you really exactly what they did during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: So, if you would…</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: Riches wasn’t important then.</span> <span id="s562">Q: But, you did have a maid.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: Yes, we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: And a seamstress and a laundress, I believe, before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Yeah, they were coming once a month.</span> <span id="s566">It wasn’t that they were there all the time.</span> <span id="s567">We didn’t have a maid continuously.</span> <span id="s568">We did - there were two sisters where we lived that they were doing this kind of work.</span> <span id="s569">So, like, to wash the laundry, I don’t know if they were coming once a month or every two weeks.</span> <span id="s570">I couldn’t tell you.</span> <span id="s571">I don’t really remember, because during the war, during ghetto we didn’t have any help any more and Renia and Krysia would remember more of what we had right before the war because they were at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: So, one wouldn’t have to be wealthy to bring in some people?</span> <span id="s573">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: So, if you would describe…</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: But, my parents were both educated.</span> <span id="s576">So, that was the difference between them and - I mean, there were a few others that were like my parents, but most of the people were religious, educated only - that’s all they knew: how to pray and how to… You know, that was the type - that’s the type of people that lived in our town.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: When is the ghetto formed, in your view?</span> <span id="s578">I can’t quite understand because it doesn’t become a closed ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: No, at first - I would think that was ’41, maybe ’40 - when they moved us from our first location to the second location, and they were closing on, but it wasn’t closed.</span> <span id="s580">We were not supposed to get out of the camp unless we had a work permit or whatever.</span> <span id="s581">That’s how close to the, how should I say, October the 27th, people were going to work, too, because we had an Arbeitsamt, a German Arbeitsamt that said - enlisting people for work.</span> <span id="s582">And a lot of people from the villages were coming to Starachowice already in the ghetto to look for work, but they had to come somehow, maybe they were brought by the Germans, I couldn’t tell you, but I know that we had an Arbeitsamt, which is a labor bureau, whatever you call it, where people were coming and asking for work because they knew from the other places that only the ones that will work will live.</span> <span id="s583">Because we heard what was going in Warsaw and all over.</span> <span id="s584">So, people - as a matter of fact I was working in the Arbeitsamt, and my father and I we both worked in the Arbeitsamt.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: I think we have to change the tape.</span> <span id="s586">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: …And I think that story about that holiday, that’s a wonderful st-, I mean, it’s a very - I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: But, you know, I cried my eyes out, and, again, the people that I knew in Radom, the Jewish people that were sending their kids to high school there because it was expensive, well-to-do people.</span> <span id="s591">So, at that time, it wasn’t nice to be - you had to be rich.</span> <span id="s592">You wouldn’t admit that you weren’t.</span> <span id="s593">So, let’s say my mother was sending me home baking on Friday.</span> <span id="s594">Every Friday she would send me a parcel with someone who was going that way.</span> <span id="s595">And my girlfriends loved my mother’s baking.</span> <span id="s596">And this was for the whole week for me to eat!</span> <span id="s597">Because I didn’t, you know, it wasn’t that she was, she says, “Oh, today is Friday!</span> <span id="s598">Let’s go to Hania.</span> <span id="s599">She has her mother’s cake!”</span> <span id="s600">And those kids, they didn’t miss anything.</span> <span id="s601">You know, they were rich kids.</span> <span id="s602">They ate all my cakes.</span> <span id="s603">My mother would buy me fruits like oranges that were extremely expensive, but for me, maybe one orange, maybe a few grapes.</span> <span id="s604">You know, she would do the best she could.</span> <span id="s605">And they ate everything and I didn’t have what to eat for the whole week.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: Hania, I want to take us back to your life in Radom, because I think it’s important for us to get a sense of what it meant for you to be that independent, and how different it was for you to be home than for your other sisters to be home.</span> <span id="s607">So, let’s talk a little about what your life was like during that time and some incidences that happened to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: Well, I lived in - my mother used to rent a room for me in a friend’s place or whatever and I lived there for the 10 months; for the vacation I went home.</span> <span id="s609">And she did the best she could.</span> <span id="s610">She washed my laundry every week.</span> <span id="s611">I sent her my laundry to be washed at home because I didn’t have the facilities.</span> <span id="s612">And every week she would send me the home baking and the best she could, she could afford to buy at the time: some fruits that were imported that were so expensive that only the sick ones would get them sometimes.</span> <span id="s613">And I was very good at school, so I had no problem there.</span> <span id="s614">I always had straight A’s.</span> <span id="s615">My parents were very proud of me; they were always bragging.</span> <span id="s616">And I also tutored French, and I was paid for those lessons, so this was my spending money.</span> <span id="s617">We could go to a movie or for ice cream, like, we were going in groups, but it was expensive, so I could afford to pay for it because I was making some money there.</span> <span id="s618">And for holidays, I usually used to come home, but for the Yom Kippur and the Rosh Hashana, I not always could because it was the beginning of school and I didn’t want to miss - don’t forget, I was the only Jewish girl in our class, so I couldn’t afford to miss a week of school at the very beginning.</span> <span id="s619">So, I remember, one year I was living with the professor, the professor’s family, and for the holidays, I also had an aunt living, an aunt and uncle in Radom.</span> <span id="s620">My uncle was the brother of my father, but I didn’t live with them.</span> <span id="s621">I lived with this family.</span> <span id="s622">And the lady of the house asked me what am I going to do for the holidays.</span> <span id="s623">So, I couldn’t say “nothing” because I didn’t want to be invited by them, because it is a family holiday and they had their family.</span> <span id="s624">So, she says, “What are you going to do?”</span> <span id="s625">So, I said to her, “My aunt invited me for dinner.”</span> <span id="s626">So she said, “Oh, that’s good.”</span> <span id="s627">So when they sat at the table, I went out on the street, and you know, that was - all the smells were so, I mean, so inviting everywhere.</span> <span id="s628">And I wasn’t invited to my aunt’s for the holidays.</span> <span id="s629">I was walking the streets until I got tired, and I sat down on a stone somewhere near the road and started crying.</span> <span id="s630">I cried myself to death.</span> <span id="s631">I was so hungry and I was thinking of the house and I was envious of my sisters being there, you know, with the whole family and eating well and all.</span> <span id="s632">So, I really felt very bad and I couldn’t go home until they finished the dinner because I went to my aunt’s officially, so when I came home, and they were already - I heard the dishes being washed and put away - and I went to bed.</span> <span id="s633">I was so hungry.</span> <span id="s634">I was so hungry, so I cried all night.</span> <span id="s635">That’s how I remember one of the incidents of being independent.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: And why, were you not close with your aunt?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: No, my aunt was very envious that I was - from the beginning, when I was accepted, when my mother brought me to Radom and when I passed the exam and the results were being, like, ‘til the end of the summer, the results were unknown.</span> <span id="s638">So, my aunt says to my mother, “What do you expect?</span> <span id="s639">You come from a small town there, and you come from Wierzbnik, that they’ll accept you with open arms?</span> <span id="s640">First of all, she has to pass as the best exam because she’s Jewish.</span> <span id="s641">Secondly, what do you expect?</span> <span id="s642">They have in Radom a lot of people that they know, and they’re prominent people, that they’ll accept you?”</span> <span id="s643">And she says, “The hair will grow on my wrist if she would be accepted.”</span> <span id="s644">So, anyway, towards the end, my mother registered - at the same time, she registered me at the Jewish gymnasium.</span> <span id="s645">And when she came to look at the results, she went by herself because she was sure that I won’t be accepted.</span> <span id="s646">So, she went there and, sure enough, I was accep- my name was there, so she fainted.</span> <span id="s647">And then my aunt and the whole family wanted to be sure that this is true, they all went to see whether it’s true.</span> <span id="s648">But that wasn’t the only - I talked to her many times.</span> <span id="s649">We had many conversations because she was in America.</span> <span id="s650">And she knows that she did me wrong.</span> <span id="s651">But she had two sons and she says that she didn’t want me to live in her house because the sons were my age, and that was her explanation.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: So, you sometimes made decisions…?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: No.</span> <span id="s654">I mean, I had to make decisions the way I could.</span> <span id="s655">I was just a kid.</span> <span id="s656">I couldn’t call my parents; we didn’t have a telephone.</span> <span id="s657">I remember it one time, I was sick, and I was living in another place where, like, I had a girlfriend in the family, so they accepted me, and I shared her room.</span> <span id="s658">And I got sick, so my landlady called my mother to come and pick me up because, I mean, she wasn’t ready to look after a sick child.</span> <span id="s659">So, my mother came and picked me up and took me home for a week or two until I recovered and I came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: And I understand that the packages she would send you…</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Yeah, the packages - every Friday she would - because she baked for - every Friday she baked a babka, and other very - I mean, her baking was very good - and every Friday, she would send me a parcel containing, like, her baking and some imported fruit, a little bit of this, a little bit of that, which was very special and very expensive.</span> <span id="s662">And I had a lot of friends in Radom that visit me many times, and we went out with them to the movies.</span> <span id="s663">And they knew that on Friday night, I would get a parcel with all the goodies, so they say, “Let’s go to Hania because she got a parcel!”</span> <span id="s664">But those kids were at home and they didn’t miss anything, and I didn’t have anything for the week.</span> <span id="s665">I mean, except for the dinner that I was given.</span> <span id="s666">Like, when my mother paid for the room, she paid also for one meal for me to eat, a hot meal, and the rest I was supposed to buy by myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: So, where would you then eat breakfast and lunch?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: In my room, but you know, like, it wasn’t like - I would have a bagel and cheese or something.</span> <span id="s669">And I remember I had a tremendous appetite, and one day my father came to visit me.</span> <span id="s670">And on the way from the train, he stopped to buy bagels - not bagels, I think rolls, kaiser rolls - and cheese, because I really liked the yellow cheese.</span> <span id="s671">So, he bought six rolls for me to have for the week or whatever.</span> <span id="s672">And I remember, he never forgot to mention it that I had all six rolls at one time.</span> <span id="s673">[Laughs.]</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: So, you really had a big appetite!</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Tremendous, because I grew very fast.</span> <span id="s676">When I came to Radom, I was the smallest one in my class, but when I was thirteen years old, I grew twelve centimeters.</span> <span id="s677">I was the tallest one in my class.</span> <span id="s678">And from there on, when we carried the insignia of the school, the tallest used to get it, I used to be the one.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: Tell me, what was it like for you to be the only Jewish kid in that school?</span> <span id="s680">Was that difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: It wasn’t difficult because - I had a few kids that were really ridiculing me, they called me all kinds of names - but they were just a few.</span> <span id="s682">But in general, I tried to be like them.</span> <span id="s683">I helped them out, I stayed after school, did their assignments, helped them with everything, like, for free because I wanted so badly to mix with them.</span> <span id="s684">And certain people, ones, I learned to disregard what they were saying.</span> <span id="s685">They called me all sorts of names.</span> <span id="s686">I’m not saying ‘they’ because there were a couple of such girls.</span> <span id="s687">I remember them very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">So if they called me such names, I just pretended not to hear.</span> <span id="s689">But I had also one case where the parents treated me very badly.</span> <span id="s690">I was sitting at one desk with a girl called Janina Kremska (ph).</span> <span id="s691">Her father was a judge; I don’t know what her mother - her mother was apparently not well.</span> <span id="s692">I couldn’t tell you - I have never before been in her house.</span> <span id="s693">Before we left she offered that she would take me to the station.</span> <span id="s694">We had some time yet.</span> <span id="s695">So, I took my suitcase and - when we got our school certificate at the end of the year, our marks - so, she says, “You come, we’ll have lunch at our house, and I’ll take you to the station, I’ll help you.”</span> <span id="s696">So I went to her house.</span> <span id="s697">She wasn’t a very good student.</span> <span id="s698">Anyway, the mother asked her to show her her report card.</span> <span id="s699">So, the mother looked and didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s700">So, before she set the lunch, she asked me if I’d show her mine.</span> <span id="s701">So, I always had straight A’s, I mean, that was to me - I took it out without even thinking that I could have told her that I don’t want to because I knew Janina Kremska (ph) wasn’t such a good student.</span> <span id="s702">She got so mad, she threw me out of the house!</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: She got mad at you?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: At me.</span> <span id="s705">She got mad at me, but she told me later the father apologized.</span> <span id="s706">He came down later and he apologizes.</span> <span id="s707">He said to me that she’s not - she’s not - that she’s sick.</span> <span id="s708">But I didn’t notice that she should be sick.</span> <span id="s709">She just threw me out, she told me to go.</span> <span id="s710">So, you say, “How did they treat you?”</span> <span id="s711">Well, that was my best friend!</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: And the teachers at the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: Well, that’s also, some - all the teachers were - the French teacher was Catholic, but she was converted.</span> <span id="s714">She was really Jewish.</span> <span id="s715">She loved me - I had no problems with her.</span> <span id="s716">And the teachers in general liked me because I was a good student.</span> <span id="s717">Like, even in Latin, I was getting harder work, like when we had an exam at school, she would put me at the end of the class with a longer exam because she didn’t want me to sit there while the others were still struggling.</span> <span id="s718">So, the teachers liked me because I was a good student.</span> <span id="s719">As a matter of fact, there was a mathematics teacher, her name was Kostetska (ph).</span> <span id="s720">Nobody ever had a - like, we had numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, so 5 was the best, you know, it’s like ‘very good’ here.</span> <span id="s721">I was the only one that, throughout the school, I used to get 5.</span> <span id="s722">My friend still today says, “If you got a 5 from Kostetska (ph), you’re lucky.”</span> <span id="s723">So, the teachers all liked me, but the secretary - the secretary, whenever I went there, she made very bad remarks to me.</span> <span id="s724">One day, she says, “What’s your name?”</span> <span id="s725">I said, “Anna Laks.”</span> <span id="s726">She says, “Your name isn’t Anna.</span> <span id="s727">Your name is Hannah.”</span> <span id="s728">I says, “No, my name is Anna.”</span> <span id="s729">And she says, “No, your name is Hannah.”</span> <span id="s730">And she emphasized the ‘H’ because she couldn’t stand it that my name was Polish while I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s731">And she was mean to me, but I mean, I didn’t come in contact with her too much, only when I had to bring my parents’ check for the tuition.</span> <span id="s732">But I did feel a little bit of anti-Semitism, but I disregarded it completely because most of the girls were really nice to me.</span> <span id="s733">There was 45 of us and we met after school, and then there were dances.</span> <span id="s734">I didn’t have any problem because - there was a similar men’s gymnasium under the same name as ours - so, once a year we had a dance, so they put all the boys in a row and the girls in a row, and whoever you met you had to dance.</span> <span id="s735">So, I never had any problems, but I heard from a friend - as a matter of fact we just talked the other day about it - from a male friend that, he was standing across from one Polish girl and she was so cute, and then she says, “I don’t dance with Jews.”</span> <span id="s736">He says he felt so bad because it never happened before because he was a good-looking boy.</span> <span id="s737">So, there were - but as I said, the few incidents that were happening to me I tried to disregard because otherwise I couldn’t live with them.</span> <span id="s738">I was the only one!</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: Do you know if other Jews applied to the school - other Jewish girls applied to that school as well and couldn’t get in?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: Oh, yes, because I have here - there is how many are we here?</span> <span id="s741">There are about five of us left from that school, and we still meet here.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: Jewish girls, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: Yes, because one year they accepted four girls instead of one girl, and after that it was numerus nolus already.</span> <span id="s744">Why four girls?</span> <span id="s745">Because one of the girls that lives here in Miami, her father had a brick factory, so he built a gymnasium for the school for free, so they accepted the four girls.</span> <span id="s746">When I say gymnasium, like exercise, a big exercise gymnasium for the school.</span> <span id="s747">He donated the bricks and the labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: Tell me something, going back now to the ghetto, when the Germans attach Russian in June of 1941, do you remember that as being a significant change?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: You don’t?</span> <span id="s751">Okay.</span> <span id="s752">So, the ghetto experience up to the end of the ghetto, October, when do you start working in the brick factory with Chris?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Okay, first I worked in Arbeitsamt, and they closed this - maybe I should also not tell you that a German, before we got sent to the camp, that a German under the name Pohl - P-O- H-L - who was the Lagerführer of Majowka, he was coming to recruit some people, like, pick some other new people, you know, to work.</span> <span id="s754">He noticed me working in the office there, and so he was always telling us things, that the ghetto is going to be liquidated.</span> <span id="s755">But he didn’t tell us when; he only told us that it’s going to be liquidated.</span> <span id="s756">Anyway, towards the end, the last time he came to the office, he told us that the ghetto is going to be liquidated the day later than in reality it was.</span> <span id="s757">So, we had an idea.</span> <span id="s758">So, Arbeitsamt - about two weeks before they liquidated the ghetto, they closed the Arbeitsamt.</span> <span id="s759">The Arbeitsamt wasn’t needed anymore because the people that had the war cards already were located.</span> <span id="s760">And Krysia and I…</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: Excuse me, but the Arbeitsamt did what?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: They were assigning people - like, they were employing people.</span> <span id="s763">They were assigning people to different factories</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: In the area.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: In the area.</span> <span id="s766">We had, we had the worker, where they were making bullets, they were making guns.</span> <span id="s767">This was a war kind of factory, a big factory.</span> <span id="s768">Rogalin (ph) was a place where they were making bricks.</span> <span id="s769">So, towards the end, when we knew that we have to work somewhere else, that we have to get our cards, Krysia and I started working - they closed the Arbeitsamt, let’s say, I think it was about two weeks before the liquidation.</span> <span id="s770">It could have been three weeks or maybe shorter, I couldn’t tell you.</span> <span id="s771">But we started working in this factory, on the night shift, Chris and I. Like, when they liquidated the ghetto, we had to find another job.</span> <span id="s772">When they liquidated the Arbeitsamt, I started working for this brick factory and Krysia worked with me at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: And you were doing what?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: We were making bricks.</span> <span id="s775">Like, there were machines, but we stayed in water, I mean, the water was dripping, and we were making those bricks.</span> <span id="s776">We were putting the stuff in those machinery and when the bricks were coming out, we were working…</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Now, your mother was not working?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: No, but I provided her, like, a card, too.</span> <span id="s779">I mean, she wasn’t working just for her to have a card.</span> <span id="s780">Everybody had to have a working card.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: And your father was also working in the Arbeitsamt?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: No, he worked in the Arbeitsamt.</span> <span id="s783">And I don’t remember what - I don’t think that he - or maybe he went to work?</span> <span id="s784">I couldn’t tell you later.</span> <span id="s785">I couldn’t tell you because it was very short-lived.</span> <span id="s786">That was a very hard time for all of us because we heard already that there was that village and this village, and they were bringing the people to Starachowice because, in these villages, they only had a few - not too many Jews, because the liquidation was for the whole district there.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: So, you’re hearing rumors about the killing of Jews.</span> <span id="s788">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: And does it make any connection with you about what…?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: It did, it did.</span> <span id="s791">But we felt that if we worked, we will survive, because that was the - everybody believed that if you worked, you save your life.</span> <span id="s792">Because I don’t think they paid for the labor.</span> <span id="s793">I don’t remember whether we got paid for the work when we were making bricks, but once you worked, you saved your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: So, that was the strategy.</span> <span id="s795">And Renia, what was she doing at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: Renia, I don’t know what she was doing before, because she was, during the liquidation, she was at the marketplace with Mother and Father, and Krysia and I were at work because we worked night shift.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: I wanted to ask you about a story that Chris told, and I wanted to know if you remembered it and how you remembered it.</span> <span id="s798">She talked about all of you being outside - I still don’t know whether Renia was outside - you were outside somewhere where there were bushes.</span> <span id="s799">And some guy came out and used the code word “Amhat” was used.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: Amhut.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: Amhut.</span> <span id="s802">You knew that he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s803">And he said that he escaped from Treblinka.</span> <span id="s804">And Chris tells the story that she really didn’t believe him; she didn’t know what he was really talking about.</span> <span id="s805">She brought him inside the house, or the apartment, or wherever you were staying, to your parents, and your parents kicked you all out and talked with him.</span> <span id="s806">Do you have any recollection?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: I don’t remember, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: So, what recollection do you have of what you’re hearing about what the Nazis are doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: We were scared but we believed, we somehow believed that if we have work, we’ll survived.</span> <span id="s810">So, that was our main - like, we tried to work, to have the proper papers to prove that we work.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: Do you remember the illness, the typhus, that your mother had?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: I remember my mother being very sick.</span> <span id="s813">I remember this, that she almost died.</span> <span id="s814">But she was sick at home.</span> <span id="s815">That wasn’t in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: Yes, this is before.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: It was before.</span> <span id="s818">I remember it very well, and I remember the Paliszewskis were coming to the house to help with that.</span> <span id="s819">Renia will tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: So, in spite of the rumors that you’re hearing about the extermination of Jews, you still think that they’re exterminating Jews who either can’t work or won’t work?</span> <span id="s821">Or you…?</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: We still, we couldn’t believe that things like that could happen.</span> <span id="s823">Although we heard about it, we tried to work in order to save our lives, but we still did not believe that they are exterminating them.</span> <span id="s824">We still believed that they are deporting them somewhere for other work.</span> <span id="s825">But we wanted to stay where we are because we knew already what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: Did you ever get depressed during this period, before the liquidation of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: You know, I don’t - I was so engrossed in saving our lives.</span> <span id="s828">I was always trying to save my life.</span> <span id="s829">And I knew that I will eventually die, whether I will be killed that way or the other way, but life was so precious that we concentrated more on how to live than how… I don’t remember being depressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: But frightened.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: Frightened.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s833">Do you remember the mood of people around you, other than your family, the way people were?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: Other than my family, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s835">But while we’re talking about it, I will tell you, the grown-ups were more scared.</span> <span id="s836">Because, see, when you are young, you’re daring, and you are not so afraid because you think to yourself, “I will run away.”</span> <span id="s837">That’s why we’re thinking of uprising inside the camp already in Starachowice, because we didn’t want to be killed just like we heard that other people are getting killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: All right, we’ll stop the camera here.</span> <span id="s839">End of Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: Hania, let’s talk about the night of the evacuation, or the night before.</span> <span id="s842">You and Chris are in the brick factory doing the night shift, but they don’t let you go in the morning.</span> <span id="s843">So, tell me about that day and what you remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: We are expecting the liquidation of the ghetto a day later.</span> <span id="s845">My mother prepared everyone of us had a knapsack, I mean, whatever, so that when we are going to work anywhere, it was a little bit of clothes, you know, and it was - but a change - some shoes maybe or so.</span> <span id="s846">So, everybody had it ready for the next day.</span> <span id="s847">But, unfortunately we went to work in our work clothes for the night, not knowing that the liquidation would be that night.</span> <span id="s848">So, we didn’t take anything with us, only the way we were.</span> <span id="s849">And at night we noticed on the roof of the factory, like through the window - through the roof - above the roof of the factory, we saw people walking toward the station, walking, and Germans with dogs and we were wondering what happened.</span> <span id="s850">So, we knew that the liquidation is going on, and we tried to - I mean, it wasn’t far from the station, but we couldn’t - we only saw lots of people walking slowly with kids, but we didn’t see any of our relatives or friends.</span> <span id="s851">We tried to.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">They told us that we will go straight to camp.</span> <span id="s853">At that time, we had three ready camps to move in.</span> <span id="s854">Strzelnica, which was the biggest camp, Majowka, which was the smallest camp.</span> <span id="s855">So, just to give you an idea, let’s say in Strzelnica, they could keep a thousand people.</span> <span id="s856">Majowka was about five hundred.</span> <span id="s857">I mean, it’s not exact, but just to give you an idea that Majowka was a smaller camp, and they had a third camp called Tartak (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s858">This camp - it was a sawmill and they only had room for about a hundred workers.</span> <span id="s859">So, some people, as you know, from the marketplace, they all went to Strzelnica, the ones that were chosen to work.</span> <span id="s860">The ones that were chosen to die, at that time nobody knew where they were going, went to the train station.</span> <span id="s861">We were sent direct to Majowka, and in Majowka this Pohl, guy was the Lagerführer.</span> <span id="s862">He was in charge of that Lager.</span> <span id="s863">So, when we arrived there, he right away - I mean, since he knew that I had experience, he put me in his office.</span> <span id="s864">I don’t remember what Krysia was to do.</span> <span id="s865">Then, we found out that - we didn’t know who survived.</span> <span id="s866">We didn’t know whether Renia was alive, whether my father was alive - I didn’t know that, whether my mother is alive.</span> <span id="s867">We had no idea.</span> <span id="s868">We were sent to Majowka, and Renia and Father were sent to Strzelnica.</span> <span id="s869">Of course, my father went to the office right away because they knew him also from the Arbeitsamt.</span> <span id="s870">And I don’t remember whether that day or some other day we found out that my mother didn’t make it, that she was sent out together with the other people.</span> <span id="s871">We believed that they were sent somewhere else.</span> <span id="s872">We never believed that they were going to Treblinka although we heard about Treblinka many times, but in our mind, we couldn’t believe that atrocities like that could happen.</span> <span id="s873">So, life was hard.</span> <span id="s874">Like, the people that went to Strzelnica, started going to work right away.</span> <span id="s875">I don’t remember what Krysia did.</span> <span id="s876">Maybe she was working with… I don’t know.</span> <span id="s877">I don’t remember where she worked.</span> <span id="s878">A few days later, and Vaschek (ph) was in charge of the other Lager, came to inspect what - because he was actually in charge of the two Lagers; Pohl was in the smaller camp.</span> <span id="s879">He came to the office.</span> <span id="s880">He looked at my work, and he says, “You know what?”</span> <span id="s881">I think that because he liked the way I wrote those lists, you know, those - we started - what did we do at the office?</span> <span id="s882">We kept records of all the people that lived there.</span> <span id="s883">Everyone had a card.</span> <span id="s884">On the card, it was his name, the barrack number, because, I mean, the date of birth, and the barrack number, and where he worked.</span> <span id="s885">Then, from those cards, we were making up lists - daily work lists - because they were different departments in the factory and those workers, like, in the morning, you would call the names and they would go to those, and the next day maybe they were changed.</span> <span id="s886">So, I was making all those lists.</span> <span id="s887">So, I remember Vaschek (ph) liked the way I make the lists and he says, “From now on,” he sent my father.</span> <span id="s888">So, Krysia was with my father, and since Renia was in Strzelnica, I was sent to Strzelnica to do the work there, to work in the office.</span> <span id="s889">Now, I’ll just mention it, because if somebody died, was killed, whatever, most of the people were very strong, the ones that committed themselves to work, so they didn’t die the normal way.</span> <span id="s890">Most of them were either killed here or there.</span> <span id="s891">We used to write down in the Polish “deceased”, and we kept the cards separate.</span> <span id="s892">Otherwise, we knew exactly how many people we have in each camp.</span> <span id="s893">Tartak (ph) was a separate unit.</span> <span id="s894">They had their own office and their own people.</span> <span id="s895">They - it wasn’t connected.</span> <span id="s896">But those two camps were connected.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: So, you were making the lists for both camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: I was keeping all the records.</span> <span id="s899">The records to - Vaschek (ph) - maybe I’ll talk about him when I talk about the other Germans - he kept under lock and key; that was in his office.</span> <span id="s900">And in the morning was allowed to go in there, take whatever I needed to do the - to prepare whatever, and I had to put it back in his office and he was the only one that had access.</span> <span id="s901">I didn’t have any access to any of those records.</span> <span id="s902">I was doing what I was supposed to, I put it in the place, and it went under lock and key.</span> <span id="s903">Now, the structure - are you interested in the structure?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: Yes, it’s very important.</span> <span id="s905">It’s very important, yes, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: So, I’ll start with Strzelnica.</span> <span id="s907">The same was in Majowka.</span> <span id="s908">We had a Judenrat - first the Jewish people - we had a Judenrat, we had the police, and we had people that were in charge of the - where they lived in the barracks.</span> <span id="s909">The Judenrat were the elders - do you need the names?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: That would be great.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: Mr. Minzberg (ph), Mr. Billingriecht (ph), Mr. Einisemann (ph), Mr. Wolfowicz (ph).</span> <span id="s912">The police - there were 12 policemen, 12 Jewish policemen, and one in charge, and the one in charge was my husband’s father.</span> <span id="s913">Then there were Ukrainians - guards.</span> <span id="s914">They were…</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: Go back to how the Judenrat was chosen and how the police were chosen.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: I couldn’t tell you because when I came to Strzelnica, that was already a done fact.</span> <span id="s917">What the police were doing.</span> <span id="s918">The policemen had no rights of any sort, just gather together the people in the morning.</span> <span id="s919">They were supposed to keep an order inside the Lager, but people at that time were very orderly, they were doing what they were supposed to do.</span> <span id="s920">So, there was no problem of this sort, but their main job was to bring all those people - they came to the office, got the list, this one, this one.</span> <span id="s921">So, they would round up those people that were going to this department, this department.</span> <span id="s922">The policemen would take them to the gate, and from the gate, the Ukrainians would take over.</span> <span id="s923">And, they were supposed to keep an order, and of course, when the Germans used to come and whatever they had to do, they were using them to do what - what should I say?</span> <span id="s924">They had no arms, no - not only no arms, no sticks, no anything.</span> <span id="s925">Like, there was about 12 of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: Did they wear any special hats or anything?</span> <span id="s927">Did they have any way of identifying themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s929">They must have had, but I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s930">I really don’t remember, to tell you the truth.</span> <span id="s931">Then, there was Judenrat.</span> <span id="s932">They were in charge, you know, of - they were responsible for the kitchen and for the supplies and, you know, in general - the Germans would dump the food and dump it, and they were in charge of all those, I mean, they were running a camp where was a thousand or over people.</span> <span id="s933">So, they had to be fed, they had to be clothed, they were bringing the clothes at one time and just dump it.</span> <span id="s934">And at the office, let’s say, I and maybe another two or three girls to help were giving out the clean stuff for the people, like because, you know, and they were responsible for the inside of the camp.</span> <span id="s935">And there was a lot of - there was a lot of bribery going on.</span> <span id="s936">They had to pay the Germans off for this and for whatever.</span> <span id="s937">They did the smallest favor, they were collecting whatever they could collect.</span> <span id="s938">And a lot of the Germans were only asking for bribes.</span> <span id="s939">Now, what was - so, the guards - I’ll go back now to the guards - the guards were watching the gate.</span> <span id="s940">There was a tower, one tower near the gate where they watching, and as I said, they were taking people to work and from work, and they were transporting whatever had to be transported.</span> <span id="s941">Now, the guards were Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s942">Then there were Germans, heads of the guards.</span> <span id="s943">So, there was three of them.</span> <span id="s944">There was Schrodt - he was famous and notorious and I’ll tell you stories about him - Schleizier and Wolf.</span> <span id="s945">There were three shifts.</span> <span id="s946">So, a German was responsible for the guards.</span> <span id="s947">Then, we had - we had the Lagerführer, which was responsible for the camp.</span> <span id="s948">He lived outside of camp, but he was there all day.</span> <span id="s949">That was in Strzelnica.</span> <span id="s950">I’ll talk about Strzelnica because I was there the longest.</span> <span id="s951">His name was Vaschek (ph).</span> <span id="s952">He was a sudetendeutche (ph), which means he came from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s953">He spoke Czechoslovakian, Czech, so we could understand.</span> <span id="s954">He could understand Polish, and he had the green uniform, and he was - he had a very foul language.</span> <span id="s955">He talked so badly, but he had - he was the only one that had a heart, the only one, because he never - he would always screamed at the people, screamed at and swore at them, even at me, like he called me all kinds of name, but I didn’t pay attention because I knew that he had a heart.</span> <span id="s956">He never touched a Jew, although he had this rubber stick.</span> <span id="s957">He would pick it up and he would scream, “Get the hell out of here.”</span> <span id="s958">And he was screaming, but he never - to such a degree that once he told the Ukrainians, “No one touches my Jews.</span> <span id="s959">Only I have the right to touch my Jews.”</span> <span id="s960">So, he wasn’t so bad, and as a matter of fact, he was there for a long time.</span> <span id="s961">I don’t know why he was later let go.</span> <span id="s962">He went to Ostrowiec, which was a camp not far from us, and they tell me that he was horrible there.</span> <span id="s963">So, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s964">He was the only German that I could say a good word about because the others were all murderers and, I mean, I’ll tell you stories unbelievable stories.</span> <span id="s965">Then we had - then we had in camp, above Vaschek (ph), Vaschek (ph) was in camp all the time.</span> <span id="s966">Then there was a guy by the name of Meyer (ph) who was overseeing all the camps, but he would only come for an hour.</span> <span id="s967">He would talk with Vaschek (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s968">You know, they would walk and talk.</span> <span id="s969">He wasn’t yet - I mean, he wasn’t good, but he wasn’t yet as bad as the top man was called Altov (ph).</span> <span id="s970">He was the most horrible killer that one, I mean, he was - he was killing Jews and when he arrived into the camp, he wanted everybody to freeze in the place where - if you walked you had to stand up.</span> <span id="s971">He jumped over fences.</span> <span id="s972">He killed from all kinds of situations, like he would sit down, he would jump, he would kill people that appeared on his way, and we will just make a note then at the office that is deceased.</span> <span id="s973">He was the worst of them, and apparently I heard that he was from a family because there was as I said called Altov (ph), apparently in Germany a very famous circus.</span> <span id="s974">So, he must have been an acrobat, because the way he behaved, I mean, only an acrobat could kill people from all positions like him.</span> <span id="s975">Everybody was so scared of him that I didn’t even look in his - I don’t even - I don’t remember his face because when he came to the office and asked for Vaschek (ph), I would pretend that - I was afraid to look up.</span> <span id="s976">So, that was the worst.</span> <span id="s977">Then, in the factories we had - we had people.</span> <span id="s978">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: Can I ask you a question about somebody like Altov (ph)?</span> <span id="s980">How did you - how did you make sense then or how do you make sense now of this kind of brutality?</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: I think that he was not accepted by the Germans because I think - he didn’t have a uniform, he didn’t have an SS, most likely because we found out later, whether it’s true or not, we met his mother in Auschwitz and she was a gypsy.</span> <span id="s982">Whether this was the same Mrs. Altov (ph), but if must have been because I talked personally with her.</span> <span id="s983">When I heard that she was an Altov (ph), I went and I talked to her.</span> <span id="s984">And the way she described him, it must have been her son, and she says she was a gypsy and they were in the circus business.</span> <span id="s985">So, I can’t tell you, but he wasn’t an SS man.</span> <span id="s986">Everybody was afraid of him.</span> <span id="s987">The Judenrat was afraid of him.</span> <span id="s988">They were hardly talking to him, and I’m telling you, I mean I would freeze.</span> <span id="s989">I put my eyes down, I so was afraid, and I kept my shoulders up because I was afraid that he would shoot me in a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: But, the Germans didn’t stop him.</span> <span id="s991">They didn’t care that he was doing this.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: They didn’t care.</span> <span id="s993">He was the worst and he was - his title was Stumführer (ph).</span> <span id="s994">Then we had - and Meyer (ph) died, I think, yes, he died.</span> <span id="s995">So, he was replaced by a guy called Colditz (ph).</span> <span id="s996">He was very fat man.</span> <span id="s997">He was also screaming.</span> <span id="s998">He was almost as bad as Altov (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: On the Judenrat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: No, no, he was almost as bad as Altov (ph) by his behavior like when he was coming they’d he also demanded to freeze, people to freeze, and then they were the people, the Sicherheit Polizei, which was the, like - I don’t know how to say encavudei (ph) in Russian, how do Sicherheit Polizei (ph), they were…</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: Intelligence police?</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: Intelligence police.</span> <span id="s1003">Okay?</span> <span id="s1004">Q: Maybe security police.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: That’s right, Sicherheit (ph).</span> <span id="s1006">And, I’ll tell you stories about him, what he did to people, because I’ll give specific stories about him, horrible man, horrible.</span> <span id="s1007">Then there was Kashmider (ph), and who was in charge of, like - the Germans were - the Germans soldiers, the German officials who were wearing uniforms were in charge of the place where the Jews worked.</span> <span id="s1008">So, they would come and look around and change workers and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s1009">Those were the people that accepted all sorts of bribes, you know, to take somebody to work or to change his job, you know, what it was.</span> <span id="s1010">So, they used to come to the, for conferences, to the Judenrat, but it wasn’t a conference.</span> <span id="s1011">They had to be prepared with bribes.</span> <span id="s1012">There was another one.</span> <span id="s1013">I think I gave you all the names already.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: Can I ask you something?</span> <span id="s1015">I think most people assume that Judenrat was a function inside a ghetto, as opposed to a labor camp.</span> <span id="s1016">Was this camp somehow in between being a labor camp and a ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: No, that was the labor camp, and those people were - maybe the Judenrat was the same people who were in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1018">The same as they took me and my father because we were in Arbeitsamt, maybe that’s why we got into the office.</span> <span id="s1019">Otherwise, I mean, I don’t know how we could get into the office if they didn’t see us writing there and keeping records.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: Was you in somewhat of a privileged position because of the job?</span> <span id="s1021">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: You were not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: So, whatever…</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: I slept in the same barrack, and I wasn’t in any privileged position at - they never spoke to me, nobody except for my boss, that Vaschek (ph).</span> <span id="s1026">He was the only one that talked to me; otherwise, nobody else talked to me ever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: Did you actually have conversations with Vaschek (ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: No, because he had such a foul mouth, I was afraid to, I mean, I wasn’t afraid of him, but I just couldn’t take the way he - I mean, he didn’t mistreat me, but he called me all sorts of names, but it wasn’t only to me.</span> <span id="s1029">He did that to everybody.</span> <span id="s1030">But that was only words.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">That’s why I say he had heart, because sometimes there were a few cases when I was saved because of him, because he sent me to the factory to work, to type letters, and type lists where they had - when they had some kind of action.</span> <span id="s1032">I only think like that because on two occasions, I was sent to the factory during selection, and the first time I thought I was lucky, but the second time, I thought maybe Vaschek (ph) did that.</span> <span id="s1033">Although he talked to me so badly, but I didn’t care.</span> <span id="s1034">It was a good job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: So, how regularly were there selections?</span> <span id="s1036">Was it regular or was it just…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: No, only sometimes, and the selections were only when people were sick.</span> <span id="s1038">So, I’ll tell you those stories separately because it was very important how they were treating it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: So, you’re now in this - are you with Renia or with your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: No, my father and Krysia were in - on Majowka, and Renia and I were there for awhile, and then later - I don’t - this I don’t remember exactly how it happened, because they brought all the people from Majowka to Strzelnica and then from Strzelnica to Majowka.</span> <span id="s1041">You know, it was, I don’t remember exactly what time and when, but Strzelnica was the bigger camp, the bigger camp, but then later we were all moved to Majowka.</span> <span id="s1042">At first, because for a time I was with my father and Krysia, and for a time I was away from them.</span> <span id="s1043">I don’t really remember when it was, what year it was, because I’m sure that Krysia must have been - they must have taken them from Strzelnica to Majowka maybe first and then to - they made one camp at a certain time, maybe for repairs or for other things, I couldn’t tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: But, when you went to Majowka, is Majowka larger than 500 people or was it was still only 500 people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: Five hundred people, but maybe they - maybe they enlarged it meanwhile, because, you know, later on they were taking us, towards the end - towards the end, we were taken to another camp altogether.</span> <span id="s1046">They were building a special camp for us, just to get rid of us, because it was near a train line.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: Can you give us some idea of what these camps looked like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1049">When you walked in, there was a gate and there was a tower.</span> <span id="s1050">The Ukrainian was on the tower with a gun.</span> <span id="s1051">The Ukrainian that was at the gate also had a gun - did he have a gun or one of those sticks?</span> <span id="s1052">And, the office in Strzelnica was almost close to the gate, like, you walked and that was - such a barrack was an office, and then, I remember, there was a kitchen there further away, where they were cooking the soup, and you would have to line up for the soup right away.</span> <span id="s1053">And there was a laundry where Renia later worked.</span> <span id="s1054">She worked in a laundry, and then there were the barracks.</span> <span id="s1055">The barracks were separate from the men and separate for the women, and I don’t remember how many of the barracks were there, but we slept two on one cot, and…</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: And, where these buildings brick?</span> <span id="s1057">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: Wood?</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: Wood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: And, were they made specially?</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: I suppose they had - there was no camps before, so they must have made them specially when we were in ghettos, because there were no camps there before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: And how terrible were the conditions?</span> <span id="s1063">I mean, was there any water running?</span> <span id="s1064">Where was the latrines, if there were latrines?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: There were latrines and there were showers, but you k now what?</span> <span id="s1066">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1067">I really, like, I was thinking the other night, “Where did we eat?”</span> <span id="s1068">Because I remember that we lined up for food.</span> <span id="s1069">We lined up for food - for soup.</span> <span id="s1070">That was the main meal.</span> <span id="s1071">The people that worked in the factories got their meal, but the people that were on shifts, and the people that worked in camp ate - we had to line up for the soup and line-up for the bread.</span> <span id="s1072">But, if you ask me where did we eat?</span> <span id="s1073">Did we eat - it wasn’t a dining room - but in a big room or whether we eat in our barracks?</span> <span id="s1074">You know, I couldn’t remember.</span> <span id="s1075">I was trying to think, “How did we eat?”</span> <span id="s1076">I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: Did you eat outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: I don’t - I don’t remember, like, I don’t think that we would sit outside and eat.</span> <span id="s1079">So, we must have eaten somewhere, but where?</span> <span id="s1080">Maybe there was a room behind the kitchen, but I couldn’t tell you.</span> <span id="s1081">I forgot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: Did you carry bowls or did they hand them out to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: No, we had such metal dishes that they were - because they served the soup and you left your dish there later.</span> <span id="s1084">But it wasn’t - in concentration camp we had metal kind of manashki (ph), we called it, and with the handles so we could put it on a string and carry it all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: I think we probably have to stop the tape now, am I right?</span> <span id="s1086">Two minutes, all right then let’s stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: Then we’ll have lunch?</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: We have lunch?</span> <span id="s1089">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1090">End of Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: Hania, I know that you can’t remember where you ate, but can you describe the process of getting food and the container in which you got food and if you had a utensil, and describe the food if you can.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: Okay, there was - there was a kitchen and some of the people worked in the kitchen, and one of them was Salka Perinsweic (ph).</span> <span id="s1094">She was in charge of the kitchen, if that’s important.</span> <span id="s1095">Every noon - or the main meal - I don’t know if it was at twelve or at two o’clock, or whatever - the main meal we would get soup and we had to all line up for the soup.</span> <span id="s1096">The workers that went to the factories were getting their main mail in the factories.</span> <span id="s1097">So, there weren’t that many people, only the workers inside, the people that weren’t well, and the people that didn’t go to work that day or whatever.</span> <span id="s1098">So, but she would - there were some metal plates painted white.</span> <span id="s1099">We would line up, get the food, and I’m sorry I don’t remember where we ate, whether we took it to the barrack, whether we ate outside.</span> <span id="s1100">I don’t remember any rooms that would be available for us to sit down at the table.</span> <span id="s1101">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1102">Maybe there were.</span> <span id="s1103">I couldn’t really tell you.</span> <span id="s1104">Then we would get bread in the morning, I think.</span> <span id="s1105">Each time, we had to line-up, but food, like, the morning breakfast wasn’t so important because many times the workers that went to the factories were buying somehow or exchanging things with the Polacks and were bringing home some bread and some other stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: What was the soup made of?</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: The soup, potato soup, I remember.</span> <span id="s1108">I don’t really remember exactly, but whatever they had, they put in this pot, and that was the soup for the - that was our dinner for the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: And, do you remember how about how many people were being fed like this?</span> <span id="s1110">I mean, were there a lot of people working in the kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: A few people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: A few.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: A few people.</span> <span id="s1114">I would say that at least half of them, because don’t forget that we had shift work, that some people were going to work at night, in the evening, I don’t know whether we had three shifts, I think.</span> <span id="s1115">So, they were getting food at the factory or on the premises, but this Salka Perinsweic (ph) was, she was one of the inmates as I call it.</span> <span id="s1116">She was in charge of the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1117">That was her job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: And it was a big job.</span> <span id="s1119">A: Yeah, a big job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: Do you remember being very hungry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: Not in labor camp.</span> <span id="s1122">You know that I really don’t remember being so very hungry.</span> <span id="s1123">That means that we must have had - we didn’t have any fancy food.</span> <span id="s1124">We didn’t have - we had bread and soup, but maybe we were allowed to eat as much as we could.</span> <span id="s1125">I couldn’t, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1126">I remember being very, very hungry in the concentration camp, but maybe because in concentration camp it was - it was, I mean, we were almost dying from hunger that - that the camp in Starachowice was already like a restaurant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: So, I guess as you progress for deprivation, you remember the least bad as being not so bad somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: That’s true.</span> <span id="s1129">I just don’t remember those things.</span> <span id="s1130">Q: Did you have an evening meal?</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: You don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1133">Tell me something about what your day would be like.</span> <span id="s1134">How early would you get up in order to go to the office?</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: I would go very early because the first shift, if the shift was going, I had to give them the work list.</span> <span id="s1136">I had to prepare it for them.</span> <span id="s1137">So, if they went to work at seven o’clock, I had to be there, and I worked until the last shift would go to work and Vaschek (ph) - before Vaschek (ph) would go home and put all the records under the lock and key.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: Did you make up the work lists or did Vaschek (ph) tell you who would be on it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: No, I was told either by the policemen or like, I was, if there was any changes.</span> <span id="s1140">If the list was the same, I didn’t have to change it.</span> <span id="s1141">I just - because I got reports that would say, “This was transferred to here.”</span> <span id="s1142">So, I knew that the next day, I’d have to put this name on another list.</span> <span id="s1143">And I had to adjust the cards, as well.</span> <span id="s1144">I had to write on it, let’s say if she worked, if he worked in Department A, as an example, I’m just saying.</span> <span id="s1145">So, if he was changed to C, I had to put it on his card too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: So, everybody in the camp had a kind of identity card.</span> <span id="s1147">A: Yes, in the inside office.</span> <span id="s1148">They didn’t carry any cards.</span> <span id="s1149">Q: And how big were these cards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: How big?</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: They were small cards because all we had was the name, as I told you, the birth date, the barrack number where they lived or slept, and the department where they work, and a place whether he’s still alive or dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: Now, did you type these lists?</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: First, we didn’t have like a typewriter in camp at first.</span> <span id="s1155">So, if he wanted typed lists or something, he would send me to the factory, Vaschek (ph) would.</span> <span id="s1156">But, if - but I had a very good handwriting, very legible, I remember, and that’s why he took me to his place, because he could read so easily my writing, and I was doing it all by hand.</span> <span id="s1157">Later on, I remember, I don’t know when, he brought a typewriter, an old typewriter, to the office.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: Did you…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: I didn’t know how to type, but I pretended.</span> <span id="s1160">I said, “With two fingers, I type so fast.”</span> <span id="s1161">I learned so fast.</span> <span id="s1162">I never learned how to type.</span> <span id="s1163">So, when he asked me if I could type, I had to say yes.</span> <span id="s1164">I mean, otherwise he’ll take somebody else to the office.</span> <span id="s1165">That was a good job.</span> <span id="s1166">So, I typed with my fingers and I learned to type so fast that I was faster than the others - to such a degree that, in my office later, when I worked for ourselves, I took typing classes and I could never learn because I was much faster with two fingers, the way I learned in camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: And did you print when you were not using the typewriter or did you handwrite?</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: No, I didn’t print, I wrote, but my letters were like printing.</span> <span id="s1169">They were like calligraphically.</span> <span id="s1170">Like, I had a very good handwriting.</span> <span id="s1171">You wouldn’t believe when you see how I sign my name now, with my eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: And how many people worked in the same office with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: Three people.</span> <span id="s1174">There was one girl that cleaned the office.</span> <span id="s1175">She’s still alive.</span> <span id="s1176">She lives in Toronto.</span> <span id="s1177">And there was one seamstress.</span> <span id="s1178">She actually - he hired her as a helper to the - when I say he, I mean Vaschek (ph) because he was in charge of this office - he hired her to help the other girl to bring wood and stuff.</span> <span id="s1179">We had a fireplace.</span> <span id="s1180">There was no heating there.</span> <span id="s1181">So, there was such a fireplace and the girls had to bring wood, chop wood, they had to do all this.</span> <span id="s1182">So, he hired her, but since she was a seamstress, Mrs. Vaschek (ph) used to come very often to the office just to visit because this third girl was sewing dresses for her.</span> <span id="s1183">So, she would bring materials and she would sit there, she would try on, and she would - so, actually officially she was a helper to the cleaner, but in reality, she was a seamstress that sewed dresses.</span> <span id="s1184">I don’t remember because there was - I don’t remember a sewing machine there.</span> <span id="s1185">So, unless he provided a sewing machine, I don’t remember, but she made many dresses for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: What was Vaschek’s (ph) wife like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: She was a very quiet woman, German, tall like him or maybe a little bit shorter because he was extremely tall, and she was slim and she was a very pretty woman, and she was very nice to us.</span> <span id="s1188">I mean, she didn’t talk with the other people, but if she would come to the office, she would say hello to me.</span> <span id="s1189">She would say hello to the seamstress.</span> <span id="s1190">She would say hello to the other girl that cleaned the place.</span> <span id="s1191">She was very nice.</span> <span id="s1192">She used to come quite often because she - I don’t know where she got all those materials.</span> <span id="s1193">So, that girl sewed for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: So, was your work day like nine, ten hours?</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: Yes, as long as people were going out and coming in, until the last shift went to work, I had to be at the office, to give them the list and then I went home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: So, your day…</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: And sometimes Vaschek (ph) wouldn’t be there so long.</span> <span id="s1198">I mean, he would be working maybe eight hours or seven or six, but I had to be in the office.</span> <span id="s1199">But when he left, he locked all his - I had no access to the papers anymore, but the list were prepared in advance, so the lists that I was giving out before they went to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: So, all day long you were doing lists and changing the things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: I kept all kinds of records, like, when I say all kinds of records- they brought in, let’s say if there was a delivery of clothes and we were giving the clothes out.</span> <span id="s1202">So, I would say - I wouldn’t, let’s say, tell them what’s going - we got a shipment of clothes and it came on such and such a date, and we gave them out on such and such a date.</span> <span id="s1203">And, if the other supplies would come or whatever, like, somebody had to keep records of those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: So, you really were the record keeper of the whole camp?</span> <span id="s1205">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: Of these two camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: Right, in one camp, but later on when they put us together, my father worked with me.</span> <span id="s1208">Krysia told me that in Majowka she was helping father in the office, but I couldn’t tell you because when my father was transferred to Majowka and I was transferred to Strzelnica, for a long time, I didn’t have any contact with them, until we came together.</span> <span id="s1209">But I remember when I had typhoid, I think Krysia was there with me.</span> <span id="s1210">I think so, but I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q: Was it typhoid or typhus?</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: Typhus, but isn’t it called typhoid in English?</span> <span id="s1213">Q: No, I think they’re two different diseases.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: I see, because we had what they called - it wasn’t connected with the stomach.</span> <span id="s1215">It was… Q: Spotted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: Spotted.</span> <span id="s1217">It’s called typhus, right?</span> <span id="s1218">Okay.</span> <span id="s1219">Q: I’ll have to look it up.</span> <span id="s1220">I’m not…</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: We called it tiphus.</span> <span id="s1222">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: So, I think I told someone typhus and he said, “No, typhoid.”</span> <span id="s1224">So, I say typhoid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: Now, tell me something, were people coming into your office to talk with you or to find out information?</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: I wasn’t such a big wheel.</span> <span id="s1229">The Judenrat was deciding, you know, they were - I was just - I was just writing and typing and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s1230">But I’ll tell you that people liked me a lot, because I remember once when I was distributing clothes and, you know, I was so straightforward, I was transparent.</span> <span id="s1231">So, I started giving clothes and people were grabbing and they started taking like instead of one shirt or whatever T-shirt, they would grab from my hands and run.</span> <span id="s1232">So, you know, I started crying.</span> <span id="s1233">I said, “What do you want from my life?</span> <span id="s1234">I have so many I have to give and get to everybody.”</span> <span id="s1235">I started crying.</span> <span id="s1236">So, some people who stood in line were chasing those other people to take it away, to help me because they were sorry for me because, you know, I would like to give them three or four of them, but, I mean, I only had a limited amount.</span> <span id="s1237">So, I must say that people always helped me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q: It’s very interesting that you would cry at that moment.</span> <span id="s1239">A: Yeah, I was crying because you know why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: I was crying because I felt that, because of those few pigs that want to grab all this, the people at the end won’t get nothing, will get nothing.</span> <span id="s1242">So, I felt sorry for them.</span> <span id="s1243">I started crying and I remember they ran them and chase the down the guys.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: Did you see a lot of that kind of behavior, people…</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: Yeah, people were grabby, people were, you know, but, you know, this was life like - it was hard.</span> <span id="s1246">It wasn’t as hard, in comparison to concentration camps, it was a picnic, but it was still hard because we were still treated like animals.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: Why do you think that you and your sisters remained…?</span> <span id="s1248">You didn’t do that.</span> <span id="s1249">You kept wanting to be fair.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: You know, we were fair and because of that we really - we really always had protectors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">I’ll tell you later stories about Auschwitz, how we remained alive because we kept ourselves together and how people were helping us, people that were in charge of something.</span> <span id="s1252">They would pick us because they felt sorry for us - more sorry for us because we didn’t fight, like we didn’t - we didn’t fight for food or grab it or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1253">We wanted to be fair.</span> <span id="s1254">We were brought up that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">Q: All right, let’s get back to some of the - let me ask you, did you know the people on the Judenrat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">A: All of them, because they were from Wierzbnik.</span> <span id="s1257">One was the father of our very good friend, Krysia knows - Krysia and my friend, Mr. Minzberg (ph).</span> <span id="s1258">He was a very well- known man in Wierzbnik.</span> <span id="s1259">They were once very rich, but at the time when we met them, they had some kind of possessions, lots of land, landowners, bankers, who knows?</span> <span id="s1260">Like, his predecessor.</span> <span id="s1261">At that time when we knew them, they were just like any others.</span> <span id="s1262">There were no rich people in Wierzbnik, but they were very well-known and very respected.</span> <span id="s1263">He was very well known and very respected person, and although he belonged to the Zionist organization, he was also very religious.</span> <span id="s1264">But he was - we didn’t have a synagogue.</span> <span id="s1265">We used the school the Tarbut school we used for prayers, and he was - he was the one that prayed like he was religious.</span> <span id="s1266">Another one was Minzburg (ph).</span> <span id="s1267">Einisemann (ph) was just a shoemaker, but he was a very simple man, but he was a good man.</span> <span id="s1268">So, they have chosen him because he was also - he tried to be fair.</span> <span id="s1269">Then there was Mr. Wolfowicz (ph).</span> <span id="s1270">They had the store, like in Wierzbnik; they had the store materials, sewing materials.</span> <span id="s1271">He wasn’t that pleasant, but he was good at giving orders and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s1272">He wasn’t as pleasant, as matter of fact, he was a little mean, but he was good if people refused to do things, you know, that they sent.</span> <span id="s1273">Then, there was…Minzberg (ph), Wolfowicz (ph)…Wirenswiec (ph), Wirenswiec was - they had a - they had a liquor store, I mean, not a liquor store, a liquor restaurant or whatever you call it, a bar.</span> <span id="s1274">And, you know, in Starachowice because the Polacks, the minute - the minute they finished work, they got their pay they were going to drink vodka.</span> <span id="s1275">So, he was quite well off, and he was okay.</span> <span id="s1276">So, those were the four.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: So, it’s a small group.</span> <span id="s1278">A: A small group.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: And, what did you think of these folks and what they did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A: They - we had to have them, because otherwise the German would run it.</span> <span id="s1281">So, they were running the - they were under Vaschek (ph).</span> <span id="s1282">What I mean under Vaschek (ph), Vaschek (ph) supervised their work, that let’s say if we needed supplies or something, they had to tell Vaschek (ph) and he would do those things or whatever, but they were trying the best they could for the people in the camp.</span> <span id="s1283">So, as I said, supplies and what else would they do?</span> <span id="s1284">Order and complaints, you know, I mean, when they didn’t want to sleep with one another, because there were two people to a cot.</span> <span id="s1285">So, you know, they would solve all the problems, inside problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: Was there something like a court?</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A: There was, but they had nothing to say.</span> <span id="s1288">They weren’t - I mean their orders were what?</span> <span id="s1289">People didn’t listen to them.</span> <span id="s1290">But they didn’t go and squeal to Vaschek (ph), they had to settle it, but they didn’t have very much - they didn’t have very much power.</span> <span id="s1291">The same as Adash’s, my husband’s father.</span> <span id="s1292">He was in charge of the police.</span> <span id="s1293">He didn’t have that much power.</span> <span id="s1294">I mean, I saw how they - how the Germans were almost murdering him, giving him orders.</span> <span id="s1295">So, he screened and he did what he could, but, I mean, his power was limited.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: So, what would happen if someone really was committing a crime?</span> <span id="s1297">I don’t mean a German definition.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: No, no, no, no - we would keep it quiet.</span> <span id="s1299">Nobody would - nobody would squeal to the Germans, unless the Germans would find it out somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1300">Like, we were always protect - when I say we, there was Judenrat and the police - they were always protecting the people.</span> <span id="s1301">On the outside they had to - on the outside they had to pretend that they are - that they are solving all the problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q: So, you really didn’t have anyone in those positions who you thought were betraying the Jews and trying to protect themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: No, it was - how could they protect themselves?</span> <span id="s1304">They were in the same shoes.</span> <span id="s1305">I mean, the policemen were - when we planned the uprising, all those strong people and the people would only keep a secret, because you couldn’t tell everybody - but the policemen were essential because they were all strong young men.</span> <span id="s1306">So, when we were planning the - this - not the…</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: The breakout?</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: …the breakup…out, the policemen were influential.</span> <span id="s1309">They were organizing it.</span> <span id="s1310">They were organizing the break.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: When did you meet Adrian?</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: I knew Adrian all my life, because he comes from the same town, but I had - when I went to Radom, I didn’t see him - I saw him in camp, but at that time, I had another boyfriend.</span> <span id="s1313">So, actually I didn’t identify with him.</span> <span id="s1314">Firstly, because they were the orthodox people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: Adrian was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: Adrian was, like his father, he wasn’t, but his father was orthodox people.</span> <span id="s1317">Secondly, since they were religious, they didn’t mix with the Zionists because they didn’t believe in Zionism.</span> <span id="s1318">So, the groups were divided, you know.</span> <span id="s1319">So, my mother - I always laugh when I say this, what would she call me?</span> <span id="s1320">Genius.</span> <span id="s1321">I had to have a doctor for a husband, otherwise she wouldn’t accept him.</span> <span id="s1322">So…</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: So, that’s why you were dating this medical student?</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: Yeah, she was so happy because he was, you know, that was a real find.</span> <span id="s1325">She could tell all her friends her daughter is going with a medical student.</span> <span id="s1326">But then, I met him after the war, because I remember he helped us a lot, because we came to Lodz.</span> <span id="s1327">We couldn’t go anywhere.</span> <span id="s1328">All the Jews went to Lodz after the war.</span> <span id="s1329">They had a Judenrat there.</span> <span id="s1330">So, we heard that his family lives there because he was in the partisan groups, and for him, the war ended in January.</span> <span id="s1331">For us, we didn’t come until June.</span> <span id="s1332">So, he already had his own apartment, and so when we came, he said he would do anything for us.</span> <span id="s1333">He found us.</span> <span id="s1334">First of all, he asked us what we wanted to do.</span> <span id="s1335">So, I wanted to go back to school.</span> <span id="s1336">So, he found - he regist-… because he was the big shot.</span> <span id="s1337">He was at that time a Polish officer.</span> <span id="s1338">So, he arranged for me this school, like, found this school that was for gifted people that was in a half a year you could do a year.</span> <span id="s1339">So, he found this school and he registered me there.</span> <span id="s1340">He found me a job, and he found us an apartment, and that’s how we started going, and he was sending me flowers every day to the office, to the house.</span> <span id="s1341">That’s how it started.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: So, you weren’t very close in the camp.</span> <span id="s1343">You just knew him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">A: I talked to him because we had a lot to do together, not only with him, with all the policemen, because they were coming to the office every minute for whatever list they needed or whatever order they needed, they had to come to the office.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Q: So, he was one of the policemen whose father was the head of the police.</span> <span id="s1346">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1348">So, you’re 18 in 1942 through this period.</span> <span id="s1349">This is one of the worst years.</span> <span id="s1350">Probably more Jews are killed in 1942 than any other year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">Q: Do you - are you hearing rumors from outside and…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">A: I’ll tell you what I heard also.</span> <span id="s1354">My boyfriend got killed in such a manner.</span> <span id="s1355">He was working as a chauffeur for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1356">I mentioned that to you before.</span> <span id="s1357">And the Germans were so good to him because his boss was also a medical student.</span> <span id="s1358">So, they had a lot in common and they really liked him, and they picked him up at the time from Wierzbnik - my boyfriend with his boss.</span> <span id="s1359">They gave me all - they treated me as if I was - as if I wasn’t Jewish.</span> <span id="s1360">And I remember, one of them, his boss went home, so he asked - my boyfriend asked him at the time to buy me a raincoat.</span> <span id="s1361">He bought me the most beautiful raincoat - of course, my boyfriend paid for it.</span> <span id="s1362">And then Busko was liquidated before Starachowice, and they send them all to Treblinka, the whole family.</span> <span id="s1363">He was the only one who survived Treblinka and broke out of Treblinka.</span> <span id="s1364">How?</span> <span id="s1365">Because when he came, they were looking for truck drivers.</span> <span id="s1366">So, since he was a chauffeur for the Germans, he had very good credentials.</span> <span id="s1367">So, they picked, they took him.</span> <span id="s1368">So, I heard the story from somebody else, because I never saw him again.</span> <span id="s1369">I’ll tell you later, but they said he was a truck driver.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Whatever he was doing, he was going outside with the Germans.</span> <span id="s1371">Apparently - he was driving - apparently, at one time - he was a strong and tall man - apparently, he killed a German that he was driving and he ran away.</span> <span id="s1372">And, when he ran away, he went back to Busko because they were quite wealthy people.</span> <span id="s1373">They had all those hotels at the time.</span> <span id="s1374">So, he figured that when he goes to his friend, his boss that he will help him - he will help him.</span> <span id="s1375">Meanwhile - and I’ll tell you how I found out about that, too - so, he went to Busko and he registered with his boss.</span> <span id="s1376">He told him how he ran away.</span> <span id="s1377">He most likely didn’t tell him that he killed a German, and - and the guy said to him that he should show him where the family wealth is.</span> <span id="s1378">They had money, like gold and rings and jewelry, and hidden somewhere on the property.</span> <span id="s1379">So, he went with him and he showed it to him and he gave it to him, and the German killed him right on the spot.</span> <span id="s1380">I found it out from a girl - like we had…</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: Wait a second, I think we have to stop at this point.</span> <span id="s1382">We don’t?</span> <span id="s1383">All right, then, continue</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: So, I’ll just tell you how I found it out.</span> <span id="s1385">We had an address.</span> <span id="s1386">He gave me an address.</span> <span id="s1387">He had the Paliszewskis’ and he gave me an address from a girl that - to write her if I ever want to get in touch with him, because it was before the - it was 1940 or ’41.</span> <span id="s1388">So, of course, after the war, I wrote the girl and she wrote me and told me the whole story.</span> <span id="s1389">His boss killed him for the money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q: Okay, we’ll take a break and change.</span> <span id="s1391">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: Boy, that’s quite a story.</span> <span id="s1393">End of Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">Tape #6</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">Q: Tell me what your relationship was like with the sisters now.</span> <span id="s1396">Are things changing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">You’re now 18 years old, and Renia is 13, and Chris is 16.</span> <span id="s1398">Do you have roles with each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: No, never.</span> <span id="s1400">We were always - we tried to be always together, because we knew if something happens to one of us - like, we tried to keep together to defend one another.</span> <span id="s1401">So, in camp, actually, we slept together in one barrack.</span> <span id="s1402">We went most - in our free time we spent together, protecting each other.</span> <span id="s1403">Renia was always scared.</span> <span id="s1404">She was always sickly, I mean, a little bit sick, and she was always cold.</span> <span id="s1405">She had to have - she was wearing all kinds of covers not to shiver.</span> <span id="s1406">So, Renia was really - we had to take care of her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: Did you ever have conflicts with each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s1409">I mean, not really conflicts.</span> <span id="s1410">As I said - as my sister tells me now, I’d give her a punch here and there because her closet was better organized than mine or, you know, but it wasn’t important really.</span> <span id="s1411">We always kept together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Q: And, how do you remember your father during this period?</span> <span id="s1413">Do you now, after the…</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A: My father - I will tell you, my father was, when he lost his wife, he was very much to himself.</span> <span id="s1415">He was working in the office and - I don’t remember going to him and complaining to him like I would to my mother or looking for protection of any sort because he was - he wasn’t the way he was at home.</span> <span id="s1416">He was a broken-down man.</span> <span id="s1417">But, of course, we cared for him and we talked to him, but not the same way as to our mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">Q: So, that would have been true even if your mother had been there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">A: Actually, maybe not to such a degree because he didn’t take an active part, you know, in our when we were growing up.</span> <span id="s1420">Like, I couldn’t go to tell him and tell him a story that I found a boyfriend or something, that I had a good time.</span> <span id="s1421">I’ll tell it to my mother.</span> <span id="s1422">But if I had a report card, I would run to show it to him so he could be proud of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: Do you think he knew that your mother was dead?</span> <span id="s1424">A: Most definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: At that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">A: Definitely.</span> <span id="s1427">Definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: And you?</span> <span id="s1429">When did you think you…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">A: I thought to myself at one time at the camp.</span> <span id="s1431">I don’t know whether it was to make us mad or whatever, one Ukrainian came in to the office once and told me that he saw my mother in a camp somewhere, that she’s alive.</span> <span id="s1432">So, we wanted to believe that that’s true.</span> <span id="s1433">But on the other hand, if my mother was alive, she would have - and she knew that such and such Ukrainian, I mean, how would he know that she was my mother, but if she knew, she would have written on a newspaper or something - she would send some kind of a sign, but how could she?</span> <span id="s1434">They took them all, and then later after the war we found out that everyone from Wierzbnik went to Treblinka and they were - they were right away killed there.</span> <span id="s1435">So, it was impossible that my mother survived the war.</span> <span id="s1436">Why did he come to the office just and told me that?</span> <span id="s1437">I couldn’t tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: Did you believe him then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">A: At the time, I didn’t know whether to believe him.</span> <span id="s1440">I told my sisters about it and we wanted - when you want to believe, you believe.</span> <span id="s1441">But, then we knew it’s impossible.</span> <span id="s1442">Maybe he made a mistake.</span> <span id="s1443">How did he know that she was my mother?</span> <span id="s1444">How did he know that, I mean, he didn’t know us.</span> <span id="s1445">It was a strange Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s1446">It wasn’t one of the guards.</span> <span id="s1447">How did he come there to tell us?</span> <span id="s1448">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">Q: And did you see your father deteriorating during this period?</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1451">He was - he wasn’t as energetic as he used to be, because he was very energetic and he was very resourceful and he wasn’t.</span> <span id="s1452">He was kept to himself, going to the office.</span> <span id="s1453">He was working there, and that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">Q: So, that must have been very upsetting to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">A: Yes, very upsetting, yeah.</span> <span id="s1456">But he still lived long enough to go to Auschwitz, where he perished.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">Q: I guess deterioration sometimes takes a long time.</span> <span id="s1458">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">Q: Did you get very sick with typhus?</span> <span id="s1460">A: Very sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: Were you the first of the three?</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: I was one of the first ones.</span> <span id="s1463">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1464">Renia says that one of them recovered before I, but I - I don’t remember whether Renia or Krysia told me that I was really very sick, that I had a very high temperature and I was talking nonsense.</span> <span id="s1465">I was delirious.</span> <span id="s1466">But once, when you were sick, like when you had typhus - first of all, when you had this high fever, this very high fever, you burned like anything, and even if you were delirious and you were contagious, you weren’t as sick as during the crisis - when the crisis came, when your temperature went right down, you couldn’t move, and this was - if you survived the crisis, you lived.</span> <span id="s1467">Otherwise - and then you, after a while, you were yourself, but a lot of people didn’t survive the crisis, and that was the time that I want to tell you about Sulamite (ph).</span> <span id="s1468">Because that was when typhus was so rampant, everybody was sick.</span> <span id="s1469">The Germans decided they’d have to kill off the people that are sick.</span> <span id="s1470">So, what they did, the decided, the army came in.</span> <span id="s1471">It was as they - it wasn’t - it wasn’t because they needed soldiers to put all the sick ones on the truck to take them out.</span> <span id="s1472">So, what they did, they told the policemen that everybody had to come out of the barracks, whether he was sick or healthy, and the Germans were watching them and asked them to run.</span> <span id="s1473">Whoever could run - the sick ones with the fever could run - but the ones that were just going through the crisis, they couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1474">So, those were put on the truck, and they called me from the office to write down the names of the people that were going on the trucks.</span> <span id="s1475">Also, at that time, every policeman was - every policeman was responsible for a group, for a few barracks or one barrack, I forget how it was, but the policemen were responsible that everyone that was in the barrack came out.</span> <span id="s1476">So, at that time, I remember, my sister-in-law, like my husband’s sister’s husband was also a policeman, he hid somebody there and covered because they person couldn’t walk.</span> <span id="s1477">So, later after what happened when they found the sick one there covered, you know, and very sick, they killed the policeman.</span> <span id="s1478">Cogord (ph) was killed right on the spot.</span> <span id="s1479">Then, as I was writing the names - I had two very good friends from Lodz, two very intelligent, beautiful, two tall girls - I forgot whether they were twins, but they were always together.</span> <span id="s1480">One’s name was Sulamite (ph), and the other Mira (ph).</span> <span id="s1481">One went through quickly, like she ran through, and this Sulamite (ph) couldn’t run, she just - because the reason for it was she was in crisis, and she runned, he sent her to, for me to write her name down.</span> <span id="s1482">So, I thought that they will take her to the truck.</span> <span id="s1483">So, I asked - I didn’t know those people because they came especially for that function.</span> <span id="s1484">They were Becker’s people.</span> <span id="s1485">You know, Becker was outside the Lagers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">Sicherheit Polizei or whatever you call it - Sicherheit Deist, I think they were called.</span> <span id="s1487">So, those people were assigned this function.</span> <span id="s1488">So, I said to the guy that was standing near me, “Please leave her.</span> <span id="s1489">She’s my best friend.”</span> <span id="s1490">So, he says, “Oh, she is, eh?”</span> <span id="s1491">He took out the gun and killed her right in my presence.</span> <span id="s1492">So, I remember that - I didn’t remember - I don’t remember what happened to me because I fainted, but the policemen later told me they got me quickly off my job, put me in the police barracks, covered me there, and the policeman was writing down the names after later.</span> <span id="s1493">So, that was very traumatic to me because I saw it with my own eye.</span> <span id="s1494">I mean, it wasn’t her fault.</span> <span id="s1495">She was sick, and all I did, I felt - I felt guilty because I told him she was my friend, but I thought that if I would tell him that she was friend, that he would spare her life, but he just killed her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Q: So, in some sense, you think you’re responsible for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">A: I felt that - I thought that maybe if I would have leaved her or something, but I said, “She’s my best friend, please leave her.</span> <span id="s1498">Let her go.”</span> <span id="s1499">So, he killed her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q: Was that the first time you saw anything quite like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">A: No, things happened before when Altov (ph) was killing.</span> <span id="s1502">I remember, one day he made one Jew dance, like, I don’t know, he - he - and he killed him there, and then I watched from the office window when he killed him, they called the Ukrainian to take him away, so the Ukrainian caught him by the legs, and the camp was full of sand or something.</span> <span id="s1503">So, he was dragging - not dragging, running with him, wherever they told him to take him, and you know all this sand was - how should I say - covering the face of this Jewish man.</span> <span id="s1504">So, I saw a few people that were killed and by Atlov (ph), I mean, you know, nobody looked, but when he came and he always killed a few people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">Q: What sort of affect does this have on you?</span> <span id="s1506">Do you stop feeling things?</span> <span id="s1507">I mean, as you start seeing so much brutality, what…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: Well, it was traumatic.</span> <span id="s1509">It was traumatic, very traumatic, and it made us cry, but we couldn’t help it.</span> <span id="s1510">I mean, we got so used to it that at night, when we were in the barrack, we sang.</span> <span id="s1511">Like, we would always, there were songs - special camp songs.</span> <span id="s1512">They were different from the songs that we sang in the past.</span> <span id="s1513">Today’s your turn and tomorrow’s going to be our turn.</span> <span id="s1514">So, we never knew whose turn it was going to be.</span> <span id="s1515">So, we really didn’t care.</span> <span id="s1516">We wanted to live - life, the will for life was very strong, but not to a point to, you know, to such - because we knew that today’s their turn, and tomorrow’s going to be ours.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: Tell me something.</span> <span id="s1518">I don’t know whether you know this, when you fainted, when your friend Sulamite (ph) was killed, and the police grabbed you and put you in the…</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">A: The Jewish police.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">Q: Right, the Jewish police, I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">A: They took me - the barrack was very close to where we were arriving, the police barrack.</span> <span id="s1522">It wasn’t a barrack - it wasn’t my barrack.</span> <span id="s1523">It was the police - you know, they had their - if you want to call it office there, and their beds there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">Q: And, we - the security police didn’t stop them.</span> <span id="s1525">It didn’t matter that they took you away, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A: That’s what they told me, because I fainted, but they told me that they grabbed me and they said, “Ah, she’s no good,” or whatever they said, they took me to the barrack and one of the policemen took over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">Q: How long were you in the police barrack?</span> <span id="s1528">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">A: After the finished with it all, the truck went away.</span> <span id="s1530">I know - to tell you the truth, I know how they were killed because they were making all these graves outside the barrack.</span> <span id="s1531">I don’t know how many people.</span> <span id="s1532">I don’t remember because right after that, it was very bad when I had to put down ‘deceased’ for those people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">Q: Does it take you a while to get over the death of Sulamite (ph)?</span> <span id="s1534">A: Oh, yeah, until today I can’t forget it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: What was her last name?</span> <span id="s1536">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">Q: Sulamite (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">A: Sulamite (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: From Lodz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: From Lodz?</span> <span id="s1541">They were Mira and Sulamite (ph).</span> <span id="s1542">Mira is still alive, but I don’t remember the name.</span> <span id="s1543">They were from Lodz, and they were also teacher.</span> <span id="s1544">They, you know, every girl that was in Wierzbnik, like going back here, every girl that knew how to read was a teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: When people were shot, some people died of disease, right?</span> <span id="s1546">A: Very few people.</span> <span id="s1547">Typhus, typhus was the biggest killer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">Q: Not starvation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A: Not starvation.</span> <span id="s1550">No, not in Starachowice, no.</span> <span id="s1551">Q: And, every name was given to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q: Even if Altov (ph) came in and shot somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">A: So, we took the card out and I would write down “dead”, “deceased”.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">Q: And, who would tell you the name of the person?</span> <span id="s1556">Because Altov (ph) wouldn’t know who he’s killing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: No, but the police…</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q: Would know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A: They would - you know, they were inside.</span> <span id="s1560">I mean, they would report to me, so that we could take them off the list.</span> <span id="s1561">And Vaschek (ph), I mean, you know, he was there every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">Q: So, this was clearly the worst part of your job.</span> <span id="s1563">A: The worst.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">Q: To write down…</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A: To write down ‘deceased’, but if I didn’t know the people - I mean, I got so used to it because it happened quite often, I would say.</span> <span id="s1566">So, if I didn’t know the face of that person, it was just a name, it was different than when I had to write that Sulamite (ph) was dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">Q: Help me to understand something, because there are people who, when you’re afraid, are you constantly afraid or does the terror go up and down?</span> <span id="s1568">Because you have to watch all the time, that’s clear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">A: All the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">Q: Right?</span> <span id="s1571">So, is there a funny feeling in the pit of your…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: I’m going to tell you something that I’m embarrassed to admit, but it’s true.</span> <span id="s1573">I believed, although I was - I’m really a non-believer.</span> <span id="s1574">In camp, I believed that God is taking care of me, that nothing could happen to me.</span> <span id="s1575">I’m embarrassed to admit because I wasn’t religious and I didn’t earn this special privilege.</span> <span id="s1576">But somehow - I even told my sisters during selections in Auschwitz, “If I’m sent there go after me, because God is watching over me.”</span> <span id="s1577">Because you know like I went through so much and nothing - I cannot say that nothing happened to me because all those incidents that I’m tell you about were very traumatic, but somehow I believed - I somehow believed in God, that he’s watching over me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">Q: Where do you think that came from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">A: I’ll tell you, I just don’t know, because things happened to me many times - like, things happening, like people were helping me.</span> <span id="s1580">So, I thought that God sent them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">Q: So, you might be a believer in angels or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">A: No, no, I didn’t believe in anything.</span> <span id="s1583">But during the camp, I really and truly - and I said I didn’t earn this because I wasn’t religious before, and I wasn’t religious after, so I didn’t earn God’s special attention - but that’s why I believe that he’s taking care of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: Were you…</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: Because I figured, how come that I wasn’t in the marketplace when the things happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">How come the German that took me hitchhiking didn’t kill me on the spot?</span> <span id="s1587">I mean, he didn’t even have to make any excuses.</span> <span id="s1588">How come he didn’t kill me then?</span> <span id="s1589">And I had a lot of happenings that I’ll tell you later.</span> <span id="s1590">How come that nothing…?</span> <span id="s1591">I mean, I was right there and somebody - somebody helped me.</span> <span id="s1592">So, that’s why I believe that God is watching over me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">Q: This is going to leap - just for a second - leap forward and then we’ll go back.</span> <span id="s1594">Were you with the Paliszewski when Chris was told about what your mother said.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: No, what happened - no, with Paliszewski I was there, but I will tell you that this goes already after the liberation.</span> <span id="s1596">Since you asked for Paliszewski, you know the Polacks killed those Einisemann kids and Wolfowicz’s kids, and we were in Stratachowice at the time.</span> <span id="s1597">We came to visit the Paliszewskis.</span> <span id="s1598">And that day when they killed the whole families including the Einisemanns, the Wolfowiczs, together with the kids that survived the war, being small kids like seven or nine or eight, you know.</span> <span id="s1599">They knocked at the door at Paliszewski and they said - Polish partisans or who knows, Polish anti-Semites - they knocked at the door and they said to Paliszewski, “I know that Laksuvnas (ph) are here, and we want them.”</span> <span id="s1600">She wouldn’t let them have it - Krysia remembers that she said, “I won’t let you have them.”</span> <span id="s1601">But I remember that she said, “What do you mean?</span> <span id="s1602">I wouldn’t keep Jewish people here.”</span> <span id="s1603">I remember that way, that she said that, that when they went away, like, they came to kill us.</span> <span id="s1604">I mean, specifically they asked for us.</span> <span id="s1605">The next morning, the husband of one of the Paliszewskis took us in a horse and wagon thing, covered us with straw and took us to another - to Skarzysko, which was a little bit further away, so that we can go to Lodz, that nobody will know that he’s helping us.</span> <span id="s1606">You asked for the Paliszewski story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">Q: I was going to ask you another part of the story because what I heard from Chris was that your mother, the day before the liquidation of the ghetto, came to Paliszewski…</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">A: No, my mother couldn’t have come to Paliszewski.</span> <span id="s1609">No, she couldn’t have because she went to - before maybe she went.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: No, before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: Oh, yeah, before.</span> <span id="s1612">Because she’s was taken to Treblinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">Q: But the day before or two days before or something, she came to give her some things.</span> <span id="s1614">And Chris said, this is what she heard, that your mother told her that if only my three daughters will survive, I will give my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">A: Yeah, she said that.</span> <span id="s1616">She said that to me.</span> <span id="s1617">She said in Jewish, because she never spoke in Jewish to us.</span> <span id="s1618">She always Polish, but she in Jewish to me that if you survive, I would like to be the orben (ph), the sacrifice.</span> <span id="s1619">That’s what - she said it in Polish, but she used this Hebrew word.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">Q: She said this to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">A: To me.</span> <span id="s1622">She says, “I hope that three of - I want to be your orben (ph),” or whatever, like, she said it in Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">Q: What did that make you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">A: That means that I want to be victim, so that you can live.</span> <span id="s1625">She said that to me, and she could’ve said it to Paliszewski because she could have - Paliszewskis’ was our point of meeting after the war.</span> <span id="s1626">They were very good friend of ours.</span> <span id="s1627">So, we always used to tell them everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">Q: That’s quite something for your mother to have said to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">A: Yeah, she said it to me.</span> <span id="s1630">I remember it all the time, and I never believed - that was a couple of days before, before the - I remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">Q: So, who should we talk about?</span> <span id="s1632">Tobah (ph)?</span> <span id="s1633">Adrian’s escape?</span> <span id="s1634">Which do you want to start with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">A: Because everything happened the same time.</span> <span id="s1636">So, maybe I’ll start with Tobah (ph) because maybe it will be shorter.</span> <span id="s1637">I don’t know that much about her, but about my husband’s escape and the way that he bought the gun and stuff like that, it might be a little longer.</span> <span id="s1638">So, Tobah (ph) - one day Becker, who was the Sicherheit Deist, came in a car with another German soldiers and they came and asked for Tobah (ph), and they took her out of the camp.</span> <span id="s1639">We didn’t know why.</span> <span id="s1640">Then, she came back.</span> <span id="s1641">We didn’t know why.</span> <span id="s1642">Then, a few days later, he came for Tobah (ph) again.</span> <span id="s1643">Took her himself already.</span> <span id="s1644">He took her out again.</span> <span id="s1645">He was very polite.</span> <span id="s1646">I remember because I was near the office, like they brought her to the office, and you know, I could look through the window and see.</span> <span id="s1647">He opened the door for her, like if she was - like a girl, and he took her out and he brought her back the same day.</span> <span id="s1648">The third time, he took her out - I don’t know if it was a few days or a week or two later - he took her out and he never brought her back.</span> <span id="s1649">Now, that day, he was ordered - her father was ordered to, to dig a grave, and of course, it was like, they called him to work.</span> <span id="s1650">He didn’t know it was going to be for him.</span> <span id="s1651">So, he started digging but he was an older man.</span> <span id="s1652">It took him a little time.</span> <span id="s1653">So, Schrodt came out of his office, and he took the gun and killed him on the spot.</span> <span id="s1654">The grave wasn’t dug exactly - like, the grave was half-finished and he called other workers to cover him.</span> <span id="s1655">And she never came back.</span> <span id="s1656">Then we found out, because they were from Opatow - it was about, I would say, about 40 kilometers away from Wierzbnik.</span> <span id="s1657">Apparently, they had money - money or some goods or some jewelry.</span> <span id="s1658">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1659">She must have showed it to them, and after they got whatever they wanted, you know, the money, they just killed her.</span> <span id="s1660">I didn’t know what happened to her because they didn’t bring her to camp, but I was talking to the professor about her because he had - he had her - heard the story and his records.</span> <span id="s1661">He told me that he asked, whether he asked himself or whether one of those people that he - that he was talking to told him that she was - the grave was found later in the woods very close to where she lived - where they lived, where they found the treasures.</span> <span id="s1662">So, this was Tobjah Weisblum (ph) that’s how she perished, and her father, for money.</span> <span id="s1663">Not only because they were Jews, but because they had money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">Q: Why did they kill the father, do you think, at the moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">A: Because I suppose they decided they didn’t want to have any witnesses because nobody knew why Tobjah Weisblum (ph) was taken out, nobody knew, and she never told anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">Q: But the father knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">A: The father probably didn’t knew.</span> <span id="s1668">Q: Didn’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">A: Didn’t know what for they are taking her out.</span> <span id="s1670">Because he was - when he was digging the grave, it was an older man as I say, he never suspected that that was for him, but Schrodt killed him even before he finished.</span> <span id="s1671">Like, he just killed him in front, like during the daytime, when everybody looked on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">Q: Did you see that killing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">A: No, I wasn’t near the grave then.</span> <span id="s1674">No, but of course, I was the one that wrote down ‘deceased’.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">Q: Okay, I think we’ll change the tape now.</span> <span id="s1676">End of Tape #6</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">Tape #7</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q: Hania, before we go onto the next story, I’m just wondering if you have a sense if there was different treatment of men and women.</span> <span id="s1679">Was there anything about the women’s part of the camp that was different then the men?</span> <span id="s1680">Were women afraid of being mistreated as women, not just being brutalized, but sexually?</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">A: Actually, it would be - to them, it would be a sacrilege to talk to - not to talk to associate with any Jewish girl, because the Jews were not people.</span> <span id="s1682">They were animals.</span> <span id="s1683">So, you are talking about the people in the camp, the people that lived in camp or the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">Q: There are two sets of possible relationships.</span> <span id="s1685">One is between the prisoners, right?</span> <span id="s1686">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">Q: And, then there is between the guards.</span> <span id="s1688">Now, there were Ukrainian guards, and I’m wondering, they didn’t have Ros Hashanda (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">A: No, they didn’t have Ros Hashanda (ph).</span> <span id="s1690">Q: So, they wouldn’t be necessarily…</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">A: Well, they were - maybe they treated the women a little bit better, but I don’t think.</span> <span id="s1692">When I say “better”, we have nothing to do with them, but maybe they wouldn’t push us or hit us or whatever, but I don’t think the Ukrainians would dare, or whether they would dare or whether the Jewish girls would go with Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s1693">I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">Q: Were women able to be in contact with men in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">A: To a certain point.</span> <span id="s1696">As a matter of fact, certain names maybe I should mention, it must have been Mr. Billenswiec had a - because his wife was there, too - and everybody knew that he had a lover there, a woman from Lodz, but that was - everybody knew about it, and - because see the camp, the camp had separate barracks for women and separate for men.</span> <span id="s1697">So, if they met together it must have been during the day sometime, so the barrack was open for everybody to see.</span> <span id="s1698">It wasn’t that they had separate rooms or anything, because we had - it was like a cot underneath and another one above.</span> <span id="s1699">It was good for two people, but like people were saying, “Oh, this one or that one,” but that was about the inmates.</span> <span id="s1700">But you know people, I think that people behaved a little better in camps.</span> <span id="s1701">What I meant - I mean, there was nowhere to go, you had to do it - if you wanted to do it, everybody could watch.</span> <span id="s1702">I don’t know how many people got into a barrack.</span> <span id="s1703">I was asked the same question by the historian.</span> <span id="s1704">So I said, at night, the women were separated because, you know, there was no movement from one barrack to another, but during the day, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">Q: Tell me, did you menstruate in the camp.</span> <span id="s1706">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">A: Not in Auschwitz, though.</span> <span id="s1709">Q: But in Majowka.</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">A: In Majowka and Strzelnica, yes.</span> <span id="s1711">Q: How did you take care of yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">A: You know, you’re asking me questions, and I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1713">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1714">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1715">I really don’t.</span> <span id="s1716">We must have had some way to do it, but I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">Q: So, you were not starved enough so that you couldn’t get your period.</span> <span id="s1718">Did women get pregnant in this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">Q: No one got pregnant?</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">A: No one.</span> <span id="s1722">I don’t know of anybody.</span> <span id="s1723">They would be afraid to get pregnant, I suppose.</span> <span id="s1724">Even if they had a relationship with their husband, there were husbands and wives there, but they were separated.</span> <span id="s1725">And I, so I - to tell you the truth, I don’t remember having any problems with protecting - not protecting ourselves, but keeping ourselves clean.</span> <span id="s1726">I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">Q: It is possible that some women came into the camp pregnant, however, even…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">A: No, there were some children in the camp that were already the children, not too many.</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">Einisemann (ph) had his kids.</span> <span id="s1730">Wolfowicz (ph) had his kids.</span> <span id="s1731">Vera Veislava (ph) had a son, a young son, and he survived.</span> <span id="s1732">She was from Lodz.</span> <span id="s1733">There were several kids, but I would say not more than ten.</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">Q: Shall we talk about the escape and the plans for the escape?</span> <span id="s1735">This is from 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1737">So, what happened - the conditions were worse and worse and, you know, when things were happening, a group of people decided that we have to make an uprising and to liberate the camp.</span> <span id="s1738">It was an idea that we didn’t know how to achieve it, but we knew one thing: that we have to get arms, some kinds of guns and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s1739">And this was very secretive.</span> <span id="s1740">All the policemen knew about it, because they were young and strong people, and some people, but you know, some people that belonged to the group or was told about it, but not everybody knew about the preparations or the intentions because we were afraid that we could be denounced and killed.</span> <span id="s1741">So, anyway, we decided - everything was secret - and we decided that Adrian was the best one to acquire - he volunteered because he was very good at schmoozing and talking people into it.</span> <span id="s1742">So, we decided he’s going to buy guns.</span> <span id="s1743">We would collect whatever we can from the Ukrainians because when they were going home, they had to give their guns away and they went to get the guns when they came back to work.</span> <span id="s1744">They didn’t keep the guns with them.</span> <span id="s1745">So, when they - that they were supposed to steal - the first gun was purchased, and my husband had it.</span> <span id="s1746">He was the one to purchase this gun.</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">Q: Where did he…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">A: Where did he keep it?</span> <span id="s1749">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1750">Q: No, where did it get it from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">A: From a Ukrainian, a guard, bought it.</span> <span id="s1752">They paid for it through the nose with the collected, whatever we could collect.</span> <span id="s1753">And he talked to one Ukrainian, and this Ukrainian agreed that he would be selling guns for such and such a price.</span> <span id="s1754">I don’t remember what it was, whether it was in gold or whether it was in money or whether it was in other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">When I say other things, some people were, in Wierzbnik, like if we left a lot of things - valuables - not only gold and silver, but other valuables like blankets and furniture and all this.</span> <span id="s1756">So, you know, we could tell the Ukrainian go to such and such, and we have the, let’s say, two watches or something.</span> <span id="s1757">Take the two watches and bring me a gun.</span> <span id="s1758">I don’t remember exactly how he got the first gun because that’s as far as he got, the first gun.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">On the second try, they caught the Ukrainian, when he was stealing.</span> <span id="s1760">Instead of taking one gun with him or whatever, they caught him stealing - they found two guns in his possession when he - whatever.</span> <span id="s1761">So, of course, they investigated and they interrogated him and he said, “He doesn’t know the name, but there is one of the policemen.”</span> <span id="s1762">So, they lined up the policemen, all twelve of them, and the Ukrainian came in and of course he sold it to Adrian, so he went there and he showed, “This is the policeman that bought from me the gun.”</span> <span id="s1763">Right away, Becker came in and he started interrogating my husband, and my husband said, Adrian, he says, “I never bought from him a gun.</span> <span id="s1764">I don’t know him.</span> <span id="s1765">I didn’t - I never saw him.”</span> <span id="s1766">But, of course, they didn’t believe him.</span> <span id="s1767">He was interrogated and we had such a bunker, a small bunker that was made out of concrete.</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">They put him there for a while, and then Judenrat went to Becker, and Becker came in and he said that he is lying, that Adrian is lying, because the Ukrainian didn’t have any problems finding him, and he’s going to be condemned to death.</span> <span id="s1769">So, the Judenrat decided that - Becker you can buy him.</span> <span id="s1770">This is the guy who took out , so, he says, “Okay, if you give me…” No, the Jew said, the Judenrat said to him, “How do you know?</span> <span id="s1771">Maybe he’s lying.</span> <span id="s1772">Why not put him somewhere like lock him up until we find out, until the investigation is through.</span> <span id="s1773">If this is true what happened, then he should be killed, but how you can take an innocent man?</span> <span id="s1774">I mean the Ukrainian, maybe he had another reason why he showed that this is the guy that bought from him the gun.”</span> <span id="s1775">So, they agreed.</span> <span id="s1776">They put him in this bunker, and he had to dig his own grave, and Becker, not Becker, the other, the Baumgarten read, he read, you know, he read to him the order, that because he bought the gun from the Ukrainian and because he is key of an uprising, he’s condemned to death.</span> <span id="s1777">He said it in the name of Adolf Hitler, and whatever it is, and so he read this to him, and this was the first time that a grave was dug up and they had no body, because they kept him there and then when he got his money, they wanted a kilo of gold.</span> <span id="s1778">A kilo of gold, but we didn’t have gold, so everybody, if they hid some ring or whatever, even teeth they were putting in their head, and what happened, they went to Becker and this Baumgarten to say, “Now, you can start the investigation.”</span> <span id="s1779">So, in order for him not to be able to escape, they took him out of the bunker, took two Ukrainians, they covered his head - like, they put him on a bench, took off his clothes, put a sack, you know, like a sack hat you put potatoes in or sugar or whatever with holes in it?</span> <span id="s1780">They put it over the head.</span> <span id="s1781">They took two rubber sticks or whatever and they had such whips - whatever you call it - and they told him that he would get now a hundred whips and he has to count.</span> <span id="s1782">So, you know, one, two, three… Adrian said after the twentieth whip, his body was numb.</span> <span id="s1783">He says he couldn’t even feel anything.</span> <span id="s1784">He didn’t care.</span> <span id="s1785">So, anyway, after they did that, they put him back into the police barrack there, because they figured that after his body was black and blue and red and bloody.</span> <span id="s1786">But he was a very strong boy, and don’t forget that in 1943 he was nineteen.</span> <span id="s1787">So, I mean, he was a young, strong boy.</span> <span id="s1788">They put him in the barrack and they said, “This is only so that he can’t escape or can’t do anything.”</span> <span id="s1789">So, they took him from the bunker because he couldn’t breathe there, and they put him in the barrack, and the next day they called in appel.</span> <span id="s1790">Everybody had to go to the - everybody had to an appel so that they could tell them that what happens if - everybody will be shot who will take part, that if things like this, if people want to escape, if anybody escapes they will kill ten people for each one that escapes, and in addition, they are not going to - because somebody - they didn’t say it anymore that Adrian bought the gun - somebody bought the gun for a certain purpose.</span> <span id="s1791">They didn’t know about the gun that already existed.</span> <span id="s1792">They were talking about the gun that they caught the Ukrainian with, you know?</span> <span id="s1793">There must be a reason why they wanted the gun, and while they were doing it, the guys that were thinking of escaping, of the uprising, they decided that when they visited Adrian later, when he was so sick, that they had to escape at the first opportunity.</span> <span id="s1794">So, when everybody was standing at the appel and they were saying that, the policemen were moving because they were always helping to round up people.</span> <span id="s1795">So, they went to Adrian’s room.</span> <span id="s1796">They took him out.</span> <span id="s1797">They had some shears, and they decided, because the Ukrainians were also watching us inside - not outside, the only Ukrainian that was okay was kept, was on the gate.</span> <span id="s1798">But they decided to cut - there was ten of them, ten young people.</span> <span id="s1799">I don’t know how many policemen, but I think about two or three policemen.</span> <span id="s1800">The rest were young boys that were always in contact to do the uprising.</span> <span id="s1801">So, while they were talking and we were watched by the Ukrainians and the policemen moving around, they cut the barbed wire and my husband, like Adrian was at the time, you can imagine, after he got those lashes the night before or the day before.</span> <span id="s1802">They jumped over the fence and started running.</span> <span id="s1803">They had to run quickly over the road because on the other side of the road there were forests and the Germans usually, like, all they wanted is to get to the forest as fast as they could.</span> <span id="s1804">But meanwhile Schrodt, the guy that was watching, he started shooting.</span> <span id="s1805">So, immediately they took all the Ukrainians and Schrodt was in charge.</span> <span id="s1806">He had a motorcycle and he started running after them.</span> <span id="s1807">But until they found they were a little bit further.</span> <span id="s1808">So, anyway they managed to go to the forest and the Ukrainians and Schrodt came back and Schrodt said to Vaschek (ph), like they said, “I am telling you, the young Wilczek (ph) ,” which in German means the younger Wilczek (ph) I killed personally.</span> <span id="s1809">So, we all thought that he’s dead, like his mother and his sister assumed that he’s completely dead.</span> <span id="s1810">Meanwhile, the ten of them managed to go to the forest, and what are they going to do?</span> <span id="s1811">I mean, they run away the way they were.</span> <span id="s1812">Nothing - they had nothing on them.</span> <span id="s1813">They had no guns, no knives, I mean, I don’t know why Adrian didn’t take his gun.</span> <span id="s1814">I never asked him that question, but when they reached the forest, they were very happy.</span> <span id="s1815">And we had three kinds of partisans in the forest.</span> <span id="s1816">One - I’ll name them by the Polish name, and then I’ll try to translate.</span> <span id="s1817">One was Armia Rudowa (ph), which means the People’s Army.</span> <span id="s1818">This was run by the Russians.</span> <span id="s1819">It was a Communist party under Russian supervision, and they were taking everybody, like not everybody.</span> <span id="s1820">They were accepting people that when they needed them.</span> <span id="s1821">The second group was called Armia Kryowa (ph), which means the home army.</span> <span id="s1822">Those were Polacks, those were Polish people.</span> <span id="s1823">They wouldn’t accept Jews, but they would accept Polish people.</span> <span id="s1824">They didn’t kill the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">They hated them, but they didn’t kill them.</span> <span id="s1826">But then there was an Innoset (ph) which was a partisan group that were like Nazi, National Polish Organization that they were killing the Jews like if they met them - the real anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s1827">So, anyway, they were sitting there.</span> <span id="s1828">I remember four names - three names - four names.</span> <span id="s1829">I remember four names of the escapees.</span> <span id="s1830">I don’t remember the rest.</span> <span id="s1831">So, it was Adrian.</span> <span id="s1832">It was a guy Salik Anulevicz (ph), he was the real first cousin of Daniel Levicz (ph) from Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s1833">And, the third one was Freumik Singer (ph), he was from Opatow - he was related to Tobjah Weisblum (ph), and the fourth one was James Levy (ph), he was also a policeman, and there were six others, but I really don’t remember their names now.</span> <span id="s1834">So, as they were waiting in the forest, the Russian group came by.</span> <span id="s1835">So, they told them that they are from camp escapees and so on.</span> <span id="s1836">So the guys said, “I can’t take ten.</span> <span id="s1837">We can’t take ten.</span> <span id="s1838">We don’t have room for ten.</span> <span id="s1839">We don’t have arms for ten.”</span> <span id="s1840">Because the supplies came directly from Russia by plane.</span> <span id="s1841">So, they couldn’t take so many.</span> <span id="s1842">So, he says, “We can only take two of you.”</span> <span id="s1843">So, he picked up this Freumik (ph) from Opatow and they picked Adrian.</span> <span id="s1844">And, he says, “And you stay here, maybe the next group will take you because we don’t have room.”</span> <span id="s1845">There was apparently 25 of them in this group, this Russian group.</span> <span id="s1846">So, there were 27 of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">Then - so, I will now speak about them, and I’ll come back later to those.</span> <span id="s1848">I’ll say what happened to them later.</span> <span id="s1849">So, anyway they started to - they needed miner.</span> <span id="s1850">What I mean miners - the ones who will put mines under bridges so that the German arms couldn’t put them in trains like - what they had to do, they had to put mines under the bridges, but the mines were not like today’s sophisticated.</span> <span id="s1851">They had their mine.</span> <span id="s1852">They had the string.</span> <span id="s1853">They had to first go by boat, don’t forget the Germans were watching.</span> <span id="s1854">They were over every bridge, there were German soldiers walking back and forth because that’s what they were afraid of, that the bridges would be mined.</span> <span id="s1855">So, they had to swim or go by such a boat that couldn’t hear anything under the bridge, put the mine there, go far enough with the string, wait until the train comes - goes by, and pull it.</span> <span id="s1856">It was a very dangerous job, and very specialized because when the Germans were up there, if they heard anybody in the river, they were shooting them right away.</span> <span id="s1857">So, that was a very - the two Jewish boys that were accepted, Freumik (ph) and Adrian, they were doing those jobs, and now, they had different encounters with the Germans looking for them, but the Germans were always afraid to go straight to the forest.</span> <span id="s1858">They had people that were in the village, Polish villages that were telling them about the movement of the Germans and where they were going, and whether they were coming, what happened here and there.</span> <span id="s1859">So, they had contact with the world.</span> <span id="s1860">They had enough to eat there.</span> <span id="s1861">I mean, not that they were given special - like Adrian says, they would bring them a glop of pork, you know, the fat, and they would just eat half a pound to a pound of it, no bread or anything because it depends on what they had and brought in, and he says, “You wouldn’t believe what I could eat - this pure fat.”</span> <span id="s1862">And, they could really eat the pound of fat without anything.</span> <span id="s1863">So, they weren’t really hungry.</span> <span id="s1864">They slept in the woods, and they were doing the mine work.</span> <span id="s1865">That was their work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">Q: Now, when the Russian…</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">A: I will tell you about the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">Q: But, I wanted to ask you, there was no question about whether these guys were Jewish, or they said they were not Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">A: No, they didn’t say.</span> <span id="s1870">And, they knew that they were Jewish, and to such a point they said that they are happy that Adrian had the name Wilczek (ph) which means “little wolf” because everybody in the partisan group had a nickname and the nickname was an animal.</span> <span id="s1871">Do you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1872">Like, he was called a cat, a dog, whatever.</span> <span id="s1873">So, he had - his name “little wolf” was suitable, but they knew that they were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">Q: Tell me something, Adrian’s physical condition then… Did anybody take care of him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">A: And, you know what?</span> <span id="s1876">That’s what I’m going to say.</span> <span id="s1877">At first, they let him rest because they told them what happened.</span> <span id="s1878">So, those were the Russians, mostly Russians there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">Anyway, one day, he got so sick, he got delirious, so they said they had to move for whatever reason, and they told him that they can’t take him because he couldn’t walk.</span> <span id="s1880">So, he asked them to kill him.</span> <span id="s1881">He said, “Maybe if you kill me because I..</span> <span id="s1882">.”</span> <span id="s1883">But they couldn’t kill him.</span> <span id="s1884">So, they gave him, like, they gave him a gun.</span> <span id="s1885">They covered him up.</span> <span id="s1886">They gave him all the food they had, and they left him there.</span> <span id="s1887">They kissed him and they said, “We are very sorry,” because they left him there to die because he was so sick.</span> <span id="s1888">So some people were going by the woods and they found him and they took him - some Polacks, most of them were collaborating with the partisans.</span> <span id="s1889">They were the people that were saying where the Germans are.</span> <span id="s1890">So, they took him home and they, and it took him ten days and he was better.</span> <span id="s1891">So, he decided to go back to his group.</span> <span id="s1892">When he went to his - before he went out, he contacted one of those people that they were in contact with, and he said, “I’m sorry to tell you that somebody denounced the group, the Russian group.</span> <span id="s1893">The Germans came in while they were asleep in there, and…and one of the - where they kept horses or cows or whatever - one of those buildings, they put it afire and everybody got killed.</span> <span id="s1894">So, he felt so bad, but, I mean, he couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1895">So, he went…he went back to the woods, after he felt better, and he decided he’ll wait for another group.</span> <span id="s1896">I’ll tell you more about the others that were left, the eight that were left, but I have to finish this story first.</span> <span id="s1897">So…</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">Q: Maybe we should stop so you can continue.</span> <span id="s1899">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">Q: I don’t want you to get caught in the middle.</span> <span id="s1901">End of Tape #7</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">Tape #8</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">Q: Hania, before we go back to Adrian in the woods, let’s talk just a little bit about him getting a gun and where you think he may left it, if you have any idea, and did he have any experience with guns?</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">A: He - he was a Jewish boy.</span> <span id="s1905">He never had - he wasn’t violent.</span> <span id="s1906">He never saw a gun in his life.</span> <span id="s1907">I don’t think if he was given a gun whether he knew what to do with it unless someone will tell him or show him.</span> <span id="s1908">I don’t know whether the gun was - the gun that he bought and he - from the Ukrainian guard - whether the gun was at all operational, and whether - I couldn’t tell you, maybe it was, maybe it was one of the best, but even if he had it, he wouldn’t know how to use it unless someone would show it to him.</span> <span id="s1909">So…</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">Q: So, tell me, of these boys who were planning the break-out… A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">Q: And, you were involved, too.</span> <span id="s1912">A: I was involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">Q: Right, were there other women involved as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">A: I was involved.</span> <span id="s1915">Some women were involved because we’re talking about uprising.</span> <span id="s1916">So, the women were also involved.</span> <span id="s1917">Like, we didn’t think it would be so fast.</span> <span id="s1918">We thought that it would take us time first of all to arms and to be prepared and to-to-to-to prepare a strata-strategy.</span> <span id="s1919">It wasn’t - this was just the beginning.</span> <span id="s1920">We had no idea what’s - what’s going to be after, and we had to be very, very careful and secretive because I think like that, if the Germans would have found out, it would’ve been death to all of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">Q: So, how many of you would there have been, fifteen, twenty people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">A: That’s the most - all the policemen were involved in it, because they - they were the strongest and they were the ones that were supposed to know how to do that, and a few other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">Q: And, when would you meet and discuss this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">A: One would tell - we didn’t meet.</span> <span id="s1925">They would - one of the policemen would come to me and tell me what they decided.</span> <span id="s1926">One would tell the other one who’d tell - we didn’t meet.</span> <span id="s1927">There wasn’t no meeting.</span> <span id="s1928">I mean, how could you make a meeting?</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">Q: No, I thought that might be the case, but one doesn’t know how those things happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">A: We knew that the policemen were the - the initiators of that.</span> <span id="s1931">So, I knew it, and maybe - I don’t know if Chris knew it because she was too young to know about it.</span> <span id="s1932">Maybe she did.</span> <span id="s1933">I couldn’t tell you, and there was a few people, so I would say if they would tell me to tell so and so, but not in certain - we didn’t have meetings.</span> <span id="s1934">We couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">Q: So was there one person who was the leader who then made the decision?</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">A: I think that my - that Adrian was the best at it because - because he knew how to talk to people - how to talk to those Ukrainians to get what he wanted.</span> <span id="s1937">He was the type of a person that - that he knew how to - to get things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">Q: And who had experience with arms in this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">A: Nobody, nobody, even the policemen, they didn’t carry anything in their hands.</span> <span id="s1940">I mean, I’m talking the Jewish policemen.</span> <span id="s1941">I mean, they were only assigned a certain job and they were - there was a good job, you know, by comparison, you know, and they didn’t have to go to the factory and - and work at the iron stove where it was so hot that they couldn’t breathe.</span> <span id="s1942">So, they - they were glad that they had this job, but they were - they were all thinking of uprising and getting rid of because we were too long - too long we listened to that - we went like sheep to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">Q: So, when you all were thinking about this separately - because clearly you’re not supposed to have conversations because it’s too dangerous, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">A: No, it’s too dangerous, and I’ll tell you, I couldn’t take a part in the running away, anyway, because they told us that if someone runs away, first the family and then ten other people and there were cases where they killed ten people for one.</span> <span id="s1945">If one escaped, they would round up ten people and kill them - shot them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">Q: So, you were not going to take any chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">A: I wouldn’t because I had my father and my two sisters.</span> <span id="s1948">You couldn’t take Renia with you, but, you know, if I took part in it and knew what was going on, and in case - listen, we didn’t - we didn’t expect that everybody - everybody would carry a gun.</span> <span id="s1949">First we had to get the guns.</span> <span id="s1950">I mean, the idea started - came to us, and we tried, but we weren’t successful because we just started.</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">Q: But, was the idea that all fifteen or twenty, as many as…</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">A: As many as possible.</span> <span id="s1953">That’s why ten of them - ten of them were from this group.</span> <span id="s1954">The ten people were from this group that ran away that night - that day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">Q: And the idea was for that group, whatever the fifteen or whoever many of that group could run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">A: Run away, and then - and then come and do something with, you know, like to maybe to get other guns somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1957">Go to see the partisans and come back and - and - and free all of us, but it was a stupid idea, but nobody - like you - you didn’t believe, but you had to believe that something would be done that we are not going to be killed like, you know, like just go voluntarily to just be killed because the way we saw it, we didn’t know about - about what happened in Treblinka.</span> <span id="s1958">We didn’t know that there was an Auschwitz, but it was enough that any German can - could come and kill anybody and, I mean, how did we know?</span> <span id="s1959">Maybe one day all of them would just, keep shooting until they shoot us all.</span> <span id="s1960">So, those ten that ran away, they were from this group, and they had the best opportunity because the guards weren’t there - only one guard.</span> <span id="s1961">The Germans and everybody, they round us all up to teach us a lesson.</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">Q: So, now Adrian having gotten better, and his…</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">A: He came - he came to - he come - he’s in the woods, but of course, already half his time - like he was there for a long time with them, because I didn’t tell you, that all he did was the mines and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s1964">I didn’t tell you everything that happened because it wasn’t important, but now - now it’s already close to - already ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">Q: So, he’s with them almost a year or six months?</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">A: Yes, he’s been with them for a long time, but that’s when he got sick and they left him.</span> <span id="s1967">Like, he was working every day that he had another assignment.</span> <span id="s1968">Most of them, he was a specialist in mining.</span> <span id="s1969">He was - I mean, working so long every day at it, he was a specialist in it.</span> <span id="s1970">Because they had to observe the - the bridge going up.</span> <span id="s1971">Like, when he had this string, he had to go far enough so that nothing would happen to him.</span> <span id="s1972">He had to - he - he activated the mine, the bridge went up in flames or whatever it was, whatever, and he had to run away back to the forest.</span> <span id="s1973">So, each - each of such escapade was very, very dangerous, but in his group, nobody - nobody died from that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">Q: So, they taught him how to do all this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">A: They taught him, and of course, he used his gun very efficiently later.</span> <span id="s1976">I mean, after - because they carried guns all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">Q: So, now he’s waiting for another group.</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">A: He’s been waiting for another group, then the worst group comes in, and that was already ’44.</span> <span id="s1979">Don’t forget that the war in Poland - in Poland, in the woods there or in this district already finished around January of 1945.</span> <span id="s1980">So, that was shortly before - before the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1981">Because we were - for us, May was the end of the war, but for him, where he was in Poland, the Russians were very close.</span> <span id="s1982">So, January was already the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1983">So, anyway, when he came back to the woods, the worst of the groups, Anazed (ph), got him.</span> <span id="s1984">So, the - the name of - the name of the captain or whatever, whatever he was, I know one of the leaders of this group was - his name was Orlig (ph), which means - how do you call it now?</span> <span id="s1985">The bird that has such a big beak, such a very aristocratic bird.</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">Q: Tern?</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">A: No, aristocratic.</span> <span id="s1988">I forgot now.</span> <span id="s1989">Anyway, it was a bird, like he said - Adrian told him the truth because there was no use to tell him that - that he’s Polish or whatever.</span> <span id="s1990">So, the guy looked at him and he figured like this - it’s almost the end of the war, what they did now, the Germans would go away because they were sometimes even they were more against Russians than the Germans.</span> <span id="s1991">They were against Germans, too, but if they have to choose, they would kill the Russians.</span> <span id="s1992">So, he figured like in his mind was that if he keeps a Jew, he’ll have a token no matter what happens.</span> <span id="s1993">He had a son who befriended Adrian very much - was a friend.</span> <span id="s1994">So, he told him, “Please don’t tell the guys in the group that you are Jewish.”</span> <span id="s1995">And, he went and he taught him to pray the Catholic prayer, and he made - he was the one that started the prayer and then - but, Adrian was quite honest.</span> <span id="s1996">So, he told his son, but the son never told on him.</span> <span id="s1997">Adrian didn’t realize that he wanted to - that he wanted to - the guy, the captain of the group wanted to save his life by holding a Jew, but he didn’t tell anybody else, but he figured when the Russians come, you prove to them that he’s a saint because he has a Jew there.</span> <span id="s1998">So, anyway, soon after the war finished - and he was working with them in the woods there - and soon the war finished, the Russians started appearing.</span> <span id="s1999">And right away, this guy wanted to say that - that he saved a Jew, but Adrian didn’t pay attention to it, but the Russian - the worst part was that the Russian, when he saw him, he said, “Tell me your story.”</span> <span id="s2000">So, Adrian tells him the story, and he says he was in the People’s Army.</span> <span id="s2001">They were all Russians, mostly Russians and there were two of them - he didn’t say Jewish because he says that they escaped the camp, and they were accepted there, and he says, “This is the last group.”</span> <span id="s2002">He didn’t say anything about being Jewish or anything because he didn’t know who the Russian is.</span> <span id="s2003">So, the Russian says to him in Russian, he says, “You know, this is a very interesting story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">There was 27 of you - 27 of you -25 Russians and two Polacks,” and he says, “That’s interesting that one Polack got out and all the Russians, you know, all the Russians perished.”</span> <span id="s2005">So, Adrian said, he says to his guy, “Kill him, like, shoot him - shoot him.”</span> <span id="s2006">So, he says, “What do you want?</span> <span id="s2007">I’m Jewish.”</span> <span id="s2008">So, the guy says in Jewish to him, “Why didn’t you tell me that before?”</span> <span id="s2009">So, anyway, he was saved, but now this guy from the Anazed that killed so many Jews on his ways, tried to - since Adrian was already there, like the Russian and him were already such friends, and so, he tried to say that he was also good to the Jews because he saved him, but he wasn’t.</span> <span id="s2010">So, Adrian says, “I am the first Jew that he saved.”</span> <span id="s2011">Because he told him, when he accepted him, “You are the first Jew that I met in my life that I’ll save you - that I’m going to save your life.”</span> <span id="s2012">So, he repeated it.</span> <span id="s2013">I mean, he just said it.</span> <span id="s2014">I don’t know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s2015">I don’t think that anything happened to them.</span> <span id="s2016">Adrian was right away made, like, he was a lieutenant right away.</span> <span id="s2017">They put all the stars on him, and then when he came home, he worked for the - like, he was - he worked in the army as a lieutenant.</span> <span id="s2018">Now, I’ll go back to Salik Anulevicz (ph) and the others.</span> <span id="s2019">When this - when they took the two of them - the two of them - the two guys Freumik (ph) and Adrian, they were very much concerned what happened to the other guys, but they never found out.</span> <span id="s2020">Only after the war, they found out what happened.</span> <span id="s2021">Salik started his story.</span> <span id="s2022">When they took them and went away, there was eight of them left.</span> <span id="s2023">So, Armia Kryowa, which was the home army, which wasn’t killing the Jews, but they were - they were doing everything possible to make their life miserable, went by and they see eight people, and the people - they all told them what happened.</span> <span id="s2024">They told them, “We run away from this Jewish camp in…” And not all of them spoke because the - Hassidic Jews that spoke Yiddish at home, they had a very big accent.</span> <span id="s2025">You could right away notice that they were not - I mean, you couldn’t tell them you are Polish.</span> <span id="s2026">They all knew that they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s2027">So, they said, they, so, there was eight of them - they - they were anti- Semitic, but they said, “We are not going to kill you, but what we are going to do…” They told them to undress.</span> <span id="s2028">They left them eight people naked, the way they are.</span> <span id="s2029">They took their clothes away.</span> <span id="s2030">He says, “Now, wait for the Russians to come, for the other army - for the People’s Army.</span> <span id="s2031">They’ll take you.”</span> <span id="s2032">But, and they laughed and laughed that they left them alive but completely naked and took away their clothes.</span> <span id="s2033">So, they were there and they started thinking, “What are we going to do now?”</span> <span id="s2034">I mean, they can’t move.</span> <span id="s2035">They have nothing.</span> <span id="s2036">They have no clothes.</span> <span id="s2037">So, they sat and Salik Anulevicz (ph) was the only one that spoke without an accent.</span> <span id="s2038">So, they said, “You know what?”</span> <span id="s2039">There’s a forest - there was a farmhouse and the guy was looking after the forests, you know.</span> <span id="s2040">So, he says, “There is this house.</span> <span id="s2041">If you can go there and bring us clothes or food or something.”</span> <span id="s2042">So, he says, “Why me?</span> <span id="s2043">Why not you?”</span> <span id="s2044">He says, “You can speak Polish.”</span> <span id="s2045">So - so, he went.</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">He decided - I mean, he had no alternative.</span> <span id="s2047">He went there, and on the way, a woman came out of the house, and he told her the story.</span> <span id="s2048">It was a young woman.</span> <span id="s2049">It was the daughter of the - this forestman.</span> <span id="s2050">So, she took him home.</span> <span id="s2051">She gave him something to wear and food and the father came in and the father says, “I can’t take eight people.</span> <span id="s2052">I cannot.”</span> <span id="s2053">“Okay, we can take food and clothes and whatever we can.”</span> <span id="s2054">But he says, “They will kill me, the Germans, if they know that I hide so many Jews.”</span> <span id="s2055">Anyway, apparently the girl fell in love with this Salik Anulevicz (ph) and she decided to save him, and she took him in and she was hiding him there, and he survived the war in her place.</span> <span id="s2056">Now, I’ll go back to the seven and I’ll tell you what happened to Salik Anulevicz (ph).</span> <span id="s2057">So, he and the daughter - this daughter and her name was Hela (ph), because he always talked about her, Salik Analewicz, after the war.</span> <span id="s2058">So, the girl’s name was Hela (ph).</span> <span id="s2059">He and Hela (ph) were going - went to give them food and give them clothes, but they under no circumstances can they keep them there because there was eight of them.</span> <span id="s2060">So, they were helping them with - nobody knows what happened to them.</span> <span id="s2061">Nobody - they didn’t survive the war.</span> <span id="s2062">How did they perish in the woods because when one day they were there, they weren’t there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">Like, you know, they were taking daily food to them and water, but they weren’t there.</span> <span id="s2064">Nobody knows whether they perished and they must have perished because nobody came back.</span> <span id="s2065">Now, I’ll go back to this Salik Anulevicz (ph).</span> <span id="s2066">He lived there with this woman and she promised - he promised that he would marry her.</span> <span id="s2067">He promised he will marry her after the war, but after the war he changed his mind, but he - he wanted to pay them back for what they did for him.</span> <span id="s2068">So, he was a very rich guy - I forgot which city he lived, but he was not far from the Czechoslovakian border there.</span> <span id="s2069">They had some real estate and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s2070">He went to the lawyer and assigned all the real estate to her, and he says whenever, as long as he lives, if he can help her in any way, he will help her.</span> <span id="s2071">I don’t know whether he could do it, whether she cashed in on his promises, whether she could get - although he went to a lawyer and signed over all this properties to her, we don’t know because he never - no, he saw her once.</span> <span id="s2072">Her father was - her father was accused of being, not a Nazi, but that he collaborated with the Germans, and they took him out, put him to jail, and she new where Salik was in Poland at the time yet.</span> <span id="s2073">So, she says, “I want you to be a witness to telling him that we - that we saved you.”</span> <span id="s2074">So, he went there and they let the father go.</span> <span id="s2075">Whether he was a German collaborator or not, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">Anyway, Salik Anulevicz (ph) went to West Europe, and then he went to Brazil.</span> <span id="s2077">He married a Swiss girl, and he was coming to Toronto every year because he had - he died five years ago.</span> <span id="s2078">He died before my husband because the two of them were friends like, you know, and not only that, he had a brother Hirsa (ph).</span> <span id="s2079">He was coming and he always went, like he stayed with us with his wife and whenever we talked to them, he was talking about this Hela.</span> <span id="s2080">He wanted to go to Poland to see Hela, and the wife was willing to go with him, but she says, “You only know her first name, that Hela.</span> <span id="s2081">She must have - since then she must have been married.</span> <span id="s2082">She must have moved out of this farmhouse.</span> <span id="s2083">How are we going to find her?”</span> <span id="s2084">He wanted to see Hela who saved his life.</span> <span id="s2085">All his life, he was talking about her.</span> <span id="s2086">He died, as I said, about five years ago.</span> <span id="s2087">We never heard of the eight - no, the seven other guys, and Freun (ph) was killed together with the - with like, by the Germans together with the whole group.</span> <span id="s2088">So, this is Adrian’s story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">Q: Did he fall in love with Hela?</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">A: Yes, but he was - you know, she was a very simple girl.</span> <span id="s2091">She was a very simple girl.</span> <span id="s2092">At the time, he felt that he wanted a Jewish wife.</span> <span id="s2093">You know, some people are - he was one Jewish, he was religious.</span> <span id="s2094">He was a nice guy.</span> <span id="s2095">He wanted a Jewish wife.</span> <span id="s2096">So, he decided that maybe if he gives her the real estate that they had - houses and apartment houses or something - I don’t whether she ever got it because the Polish government took over all the properties, Jewish properties, so nobody gets anything anyway.</span> <span id="s2097">So, maybe she didn’t get it.</span> <span id="s2098">He wanted to - and his ways, he was okay, but in his ways, he was also simple like he didn’t know how to go about it.</span> <span id="s2099">He didn’t know to go to Poland and to go the farmhouse and start looking for Hela.</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">Q: There’s something so humorous about the meeting.</span> <span id="s2101">He’s coming out of the woods nude.</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">A: And you know, may I say something on the tape?</span> <span id="s2103">He said it in Jewish he said to him - I will say it in Polish because my Jewish is not too good - he says, “You are lucky that you were naked because when she saw you, she fell in love with you.”</span> <span id="s2104">But those were the circumstances, and this is a real true story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">Q: Unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">A: Yeah, unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">Q: So, she got to see everything long before most people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">A: That’s what he said.</span> <span id="s2109">He said it in Jewish, “You were lucky that they undressed you because otherwise nobody would’ve accepted you.”</span> <span id="s2110">But he was a very good looking man, and he was - he lived in Sao Paolo in Brazil.</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">Q: But, you think he didn’t know her last name?</span> <span id="s2112">A: He said he didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">Q: He never…</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">A: Because, in a way, he was quite simple.</span> <span id="s2115">Because I mean he asks his wife she should go and look for Hela, and she says, “You know what?</span> <span id="s2116">I will go with you, but that he tells me where it was, he doesn’t remember where the farmhouse was.”</span> <span id="s2117">You know, like, he was there, but he was hidden.</span> <span id="s2118">So, how did he know?</span> <span id="s2119">You know?</span> <span id="s2120">He don’t know, and he wasn’t smart enough to remember, because some people are fast, but Hela, how can you find Hela in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">Q: So, let’s go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">Q: You are now in the camp, after these boys leave, what is the effect?</span> <span id="s2124">What did the Nazis do?</span> <span id="s2125">Or the Germans do?</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">A: See that was shortly before - that was in 1943, but it must have been towards the end of 1943, close to ’44.</span> <span id="s2127">Well, they didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s2128">They didn’t kill anybody when they ran away.</span> <span id="s2129">They didn’t because - maybe because Schrodt said that he killed them.</span> <span id="s2130">He killed a person - he young Wilczek (ph), as he said.</span> <span id="s2131">Maybe he thought that he killed them all.</span> <span id="s2132">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2133">I don’t remember suffering any consequences because of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">Q: That seems surprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">A: Very surprising, yeah, but nothing happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">Q: And the people who didn’t leave, who were part of the group who were thinking about resisting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">A: Yeah, there was another - then later, it was another try of running after them.</span> <span id="s2138">They were already, how should I say, energized by their running away.</span> <span id="s2139">And one night people went - they started running - people started running to the barbed wires, cutting the barbed wires.</span> <span id="s2140">And when I say a lot, I don’t know how many, but I would say maybe a hundred people got killed by the Germans, because they started shooting, the Ukrainians and the Germans, everybody, because they were much more ready to combat all those people after the escape than before, because before it never happened, and - and those - I’m sure that Chris and Renia must have told you the story, how those people were moaning.</span> <span id="s2141">They were lying there.</span> <span id="s2142">They didn’t kill them, and they - they were crying and shouting and screaming, all those people, because they tried to escape.</span> <span id="s2143">We didn’t try to escape because somehow I didn’t see - I mean, where would we go?</span> <span id="s2144">There was nowhere for us to go.</span> <span id="s2145">If we could run away and be accepted by someone and live with someone or have some kind of a connection, but we didn’t.</span> <span id="s2146">And we were afraid that if one of us would run away, the whole family would suffer, would be killed, and we didn’t - we couldn’t leave the father there, and we couldn’t leave Renia.</span> <span id="s2147">I mean, where can you take Renia?</span> <span id="s2148">I’m telling you, she was a sickly - always sick, always, every Tuesday and Thursday like this - it’s a Jewish expression - she had either a cold or she was sneezing.</span> <span id="s2149">She was always sick.</span> <span id="s2150">So, we didn’t but people did.</span> <span id="s2151">That was after what happened to the ten, like after they run away, there was immediately the rest of them wanted to run away, too.</span> <span id="s2152">Because they figured if they could do it, but they run away under special circumstances, and those people started at night.</span> <span id="s2153">So, they were just shot like - there were so many dead people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2154">Q: Actually, neither Chris nor Renia told me about this.</span> <span id="s2155">A: Is that true?</span></p> <p><span id="s2156">Q: Did they just spontaneously - this was a plan that hundreds of people were just…?</span> <span id="s2157">A: Yeah, when I say hundreds, but about a hundred people, I would say, about that.</span> <span id="s2158">Q: And they had no guns?</span></p> <p><span id="s2159">A: No, nothing.</span> <span id="s2160">They were just running to the barbed wires and tried to escape the way the others because, you know, they saw what happened that the wires were cut and they run away, so they just blindly - they had nowhere to go.</span> <span id="s2161">And all the guards were on alert, the Germans would come.</span> <span id="s2162">I mean, Becker with his troops would come right away.</span> <span id="s2163">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2164">That wasn’t heroic; that was stupid.</span></p> <p><span id="s2165">Q: I think we ought to stop the tape here to change.</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">A: So, we are almost close to the end of Starachowice.</span> <span id="s2167">End of Tape #8</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">Tape #9</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">Q: When we ended the last tape, we were talking about this second break-out that you thought was really madness.</span> <span id="s2170">So, all these people’s bodies were just left there, and they were left to die, moaning all night long.</span> <span id="s2171">Was there, this time, a repercussion inside the camp?</span> <span id="s2172">This was still in Majowka.</span> <span id="s2173">You were not in the third camp yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">A: No, we weren’t in the third camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">Q: Did the Germans do anything to you who were left?</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">A: No, nothing.</span> <span id="s2177">Because they - there were so many bodies there that they had enough bodies already, and it was close to - was close to us going to Auschwitz already, close.</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">Q: Did you know people who tried to escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">A: Yeah, I know, because, I know a lot of people - young girls that ran, yeah.</span> <span id="s2180">Q: And, did you know beforehand that they were going to try this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">Q: Did you try to convince people not to do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">A: No, because I didn’t believe anybody would do it.</span> <span id="s2184">We all thought about running away all the time.</span> <span id="s2185">That was - that was our aim, to run away from this horrible camp, but you know when the time came to run away, we were too - too - too scared to because we were afraid.</span> <span id="s2186">We couldn’t take our father out.</span> <span id="s2187">We couldn’t take Renia out.</span> <span id="s2188">And we are afraid that they would be killed.</span> <span id="s2189">So, we didn’t even try.</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">Q: You talked about roll call when they were going to do selections at times.</span> <span id="s2191">Did you have roll call every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">Q: You didn’t in this camp?</span> <span id="s2194">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">Q: So, how did…</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">A: We didn’t have roll call.</span> <span id="s2197">They would call all the people - they had an announcement, and they - and they, you know, the policemen then the Ukrainians said to come out and the Jewish policemen would round us up - round us up and tell us that there’s going to be a lecture, or whatever you call it, that we have to go and listen to it.</span> <span id="s2198">That was the time when Adrian and his nine friends ran away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">Q: So, how would you know - how would they count how many people there were?</span></p> <p><span id="s2200">A: They were counting, but the policemen would, you know, don’t forget when they started counting, they knew how much we have to have, and the Germans were very gullible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2201">Like, I told them, let’s say that to talk, as an example, was 1,479, as an example.</span> <span id="s2202">So, I would tell the policeman that we have 1,479 people.</span> <span id="s2203">So, they would come and report how many people - people were taken from each barrack when he was rounding them up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">They were writing down - he’s there.</span> <span id="s2205">So, they - they made a count that should agree with 1,479, and I remember Altov (ph) saying “Shtumpt!”</span> <span id="s2206">Because he didn’t know that we fabricated those numbers because all the numbers he started counting together, not saying the amount that I just told you was a fictitious amount.</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">Q: So, you would make up a number?</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">A: I knew the number because they would come - a policeman would come to me and say, “How much do we need?”</span> <span id="s2209">Like this, I’d say, “1,479.”</span> <span id="s2210">I’m just inventing the number.</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">Okay, so everyone knew.</span> <span id="s2212">So, the first one, let’s say came first and then the last one said, “How much do I need?”</span> <span id="s2213">You know, I mean, to give the number, and then they counted it together, and then Altov (ph) would come and start counting, “Barrack 3 has so many.</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">Shtumpt (ph)!”</span> <span id="s2215">but meanwhile there were who knows how many missing?</span> <span id="s2216">But, we had to do it.</span> <span id="s2217">I mean, we had to do it, and if they find out, I mean they didn’t find us out, but if they did.</span> <span id="s2218">So, we would have had to suffer the consequences, but I mean, that was the only thing that we could do.</span> <span id="s2219">and Irinst (ph), that’s Adrian’s sister’s husband, got killed because they found one person in the barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s2220">Q: That’s what I was going to ask.</span> <span id="s2221">This could be very dangerous if you…</span></p> <p><span id="s2222">A: Very dangerous - they killed him on the spot, because we counted and the count was right, but there was somebody was - wasn’t supposed - didn’t come out.</span> <span id="s2223">So, they killed him on the spot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2224">Q: Would that affect food distribution because, if saying there were X number, but there were more…?</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">A: I don’t think so because when they delivered to the kitchen - I wasn’t in charge of it, so I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s2226">I remember that Sal Kabiren’s (ph) wife was in charge of it.</span> <span id="s2227">So, she - she - but, the Judenrat most likely was ordering or whatever.</span> <span id="s2228">I know - I really don’t know how it worked, whether they ordered it, whether they sent at random so much of this and so much of this.</span> <span id="s2229">I couldn’t tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2230">Q: During the break, you described nightmares that you had after the war.</span> <span id="s2231">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">Q: Did you have nightmares or dreams that weren’t nightmares during the war?</span> <span id="s2233">A: No, always - during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">Q: Yes, during your experience in the camps here.</span> <span id="s2235">A: Yes, after the war or before?</span></p> <p><span id="s2236">Q: No, during.</span></p> <p><span id="s2237">A: During the war.</span> <span id="s2238">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2239">I must have had nightmares, but I don’t recall of any incidents of any importance.</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">Q: Did you sleep well, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">A: Nobody slept well, really, because you were always thinking what happens, I mean, things like that happened and we never knew what’s going to happen the next day because there was always something happening in camp.</span> <span id="s2242">I only told you a few stories that affected me personally, but such stories were - were happening all the time that affect other people.</span> <span id="s2243">Everyday something happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2244">Q: So, do you recall when you went to bed in the barrack that you would close your eyes and begin to see the things that happened during the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">A: Always, always.</span></p> <p><span id="s2246">Q: So, it would be difficult to fall asleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s2247">A: One day, I refused to come to work because, you know, Vaschek (ph) was insulting everyone.</span> <span id="s2248">I’m not saying that he was insulting me.</span> <span id="s2249">Calling names - all the dirtiest of names he would call, and I wasn’t used to it.</span> <span id="s2250">He wasn’t bad to me.</span> <span id="s2251">Like, I cannot say that he did any harm to me, but I just didn’t want to suffer all those insults.</span> <span id="s2252">So, one day I decided not to come.</span> <span id="s2253">So, he sent a Jewish policeman with a pail of water to throw on me!</span> <span id="s2254">[Laughs] So, I had to come to work, and that was his way of, but he still called me all kinds of dirty names.</span> <span id="s2255">You know, he called me whatever he wanted to - not only me, everybody, all the girls, the other men, the policemen, everybody.</span> <span id="s2256">That was his way, but later on not only that I was glad that I worked for him not Altov (ph) or any of the other guys, because I would be dead by now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2257">Q: So, that day somebody threw water at you, did you come to work wet?</span></p> <p><span id="s2258">A: Right away, wet.</span> <span id="s2259">I was scared.</span> <span id="s2260">I said to myself, “The next thing would be that he would kill me.”</span> <span id="s2261">But, he was very - he knew that I was a very good worker, very consciencious.</span> <span id="s2262">He can find everything and always, and I kept his records to such a point that he knew right away, like, he was happy with my work.</span> <span id="s2263">So, I knew that he’s not going to kill me and take somebody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s2264">Q: Do you have any idea whether any of these records still exist?</span></p> <p><span id="s2265">A: I have no idea because when they threw us out, we went to another camp.</span> <span id="s2266">Who knows?</span></p> <p><span id="s2267">Q: So, Christopher Browning, when he interviewed you, did he say that he had found anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s2268">A: No, I really - I don’t know whether he would find.</span></p> <p><span id="s2269">Q: Did you, by the way, have to make copies?</span> <span id="s2270">Did you have carbons or only one copy?</span></p> <p><span id="s2271">A: No, only one copy.</span> <span id="s2272">I was doing the lists every day.</span> <span id="s2273">I mean, he didn’t need to have those lists, but every day - and then he put - he put, let’s say - I don’t know how long it kept the records - but he kept, you know, he had - he had them under lock and key so, I don’t know whether he kept them for a month, for two months.</span> <span id="s2274">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2275">Because he didn’t need like from last month’s work, he didn’t need the lists.</span> <span id="s2276">I mean, really, he didn’t - why should - what would he use it for except for records.</span> <span id="s2277">But, I really don’t know what he did with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2278">Q: So, one doesn’t know whether they were sent to Berlin…</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">A: I have no idea, no idea.</span> <span id="s2280">We had no numbers.</span> <span id="s2281">We had real names in this camp.</span> <span id="s2282">Q: So, there were no - you weren’t wearing insignias or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">A: No, nothing yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2284">Q: You didn’t have uniforms.</span> <span id="s2285">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2286">Q: You wore your own clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2287">A: No, the clothes that they were supplying.</span> <span id="s2288">We didn’t - don’t - we didn’t have not a beautiful clothes.</span> <span id="s2289">A shirt and some - a T-shirt or - the beds that we got was better than in Auschwitz where we got the uniforms and I couldn’t find a uniform that would fit me.</span> <span id="s2290">I had to change with other girls that the uniform was still here, because then they just threw it at you.</span> <span id="s2291">Here, at least, like when the things came, I had the first choice.</span> <span id="s2292">I could’ve picked a better one.</span> <span id="s2293">I, you know, than...</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">Q: Did you have underwear and a bra?</span> <span id="s2295">A: I must have, but where did I take it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">Q: I don’t know, that’s what I’m wondering.</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">A: Because we didn’t have an underwear - underwear or bra in Auschwitz, but we must have had underwear and bra in camp, but we didn’t buy it.</span> <span id="s2298">[Laughs.]</span> <span id="s2299">I don’t remember, but I must have.</span> <span id="s2300">We must have had it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2301">Q: Why do you think you must have had it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2302">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s2303">I might not as well had it - have had it.</span> <span id="s2304">Really, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">Q: Do you remember having boots for the winter or what sort of shoes did you have?</span> <span id="s2306">A: We wore our own shoes that we came in with.</span> <span id="s2307">I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2308">Q: Do you remember what you were wearing in the brick factory, right before you went in?</span> <span id="s2309">A: No, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">Q: You didn’t have the knapsack.</span></p> <p><span id="s2311">A: I didn’t take the knapsack.</span> <span id="s2312">We didn’t bring it and apparently, I don’t know, I asked Renia and she doesn’t remember, but some people told me that they saw my mother carrying three knapsacks, and they think that this was the reason why they put her - her to the bad side.</span> <span id="s2313">Although, because my mother had a card, as working in the Arbeitsamt, everybody had a card, a working card.</span> <span id="s2314">We really worked.</span> <span id="s2315">My mother didn’t work, or maybe she did, who knows?</span> <span id="s2316">But, she must have had a card, because, like, we were giving out the cards.</span> <span id="s2317">But I asked Renia.</span> <span id="s2318">She says, “Oh, no.”</span> <span id="s2319">She says, “Mother didn’t carry the three knapsacks.”</span> <span id="s2320">But somebody, I forgot who, some friend told me that they saw my mother carrying all the knapsacks.</span> <span id="s2321">That’s why they pushed her to the bad side.</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">Q: Why did - it was surprising to me that you said Pohl would come into the Arbeitsamt and tell you that the…</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">A: Not tell me, tell the Nemcheck (ph).</span> <span id="s2324">Q: Oh, so you heard that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">A: I heard it.</span> <span id="s2326">He didn’t tell me personally.</span> <span id="s2327">I mean, I didn’t know him that well.</span> <span id="s2328">I saw him a few times in the Arbeitsamt, but he told that on such and such a date - it’s going to be - they are going to close the Arbeitsamt and on such and such a date, we’ll all go to camp.</span> <span id="s2329">We - we were expecting going to camp because things like that were happening all around us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">Q: So, did all the Jews realize, and so everybody was preparing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2331">A: Everybody wanted to have a work card, and everybody was preparing to go to camp, whether they know - knew where the camp was, because as far as I’m concerned, I had no idea where the camp was, whether it was Majowka, Strzelnica, or Tartak (ph).</span> <span id="s2332">I had no idea where those camps were until I came there.</span> <span id="s2333">I didn’t have any idea what they looked like.</span> <span id="s2334">I have never worked in the factory, the munition factory.</span> <span id="s2335">I didn’t know what conditions there were there.</span> <span id="s2336">So… But we had so many things happening all around us, that - that we knew that they would liquidate the ghetto, but we didn’t realize how they would liquidate.</span> <span id="s2337">We didn’t think that they would be so beastialic like that, you know, that they would be pushing, and - I wasn’t there, so I didn’t see it, but from what people tell me, it was horrible in this marketplace.</span> <span id="s2338">So, we thought that they would all take us to work now, and we’ll go to camps.</span> <span id="s2339">We didn’t even imagine what the camps looked like inside.</span> <span id="s2340">We had no idea.</span> <span id="s2341">We were never in a camp before.</span></p> <p><span id="s2342">Q: But you saw the people walking to the marketplace, am I right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2343">A: No.</span> <span id="s2344">I saw the people going already to the trains.</span> <span id="s2345">Because the factory where we were was across the road, a little to the left of - not much, I would say like how to describe it, probably five hundred yards to the side.</span> <span id="s2346">Like, let’s say on this - let’s say where I - where I’m sitting is the factory.</span> <span id="s2347">So, it wasn’t right across the road.</span> <span id="s2348">It was about five, six hundred yards to the side, on your side.</span> <span id="s2349">So, we saw people walking from the marketplace, and the marketplace was also to the left of where we were.</span> <span id="s2350">So, we didn’t see the marketplace.</span> <span id="s2351">We saw only people already boarding the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s2352">Q: Where you standing with Chris?</span> <span id="s2353">A: Yes, with Chris.</span></p> <p><span id="s2354">Q: And did you talk to each other about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2355">A: We talked - yeah, because we said, we didn’t expect it to be that day.</span> <span id="s2356">We didn’t have the knapsacks.</span> <span id="s2357">We didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s2358">We went just the way we went to work.</span> <span id="s2359">We had nothing with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2360">Q: Did a lot of people see what was going on or just the two of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2361">A: Everybody that worked there saw it because we - we only had to go a little bit upstairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s2362">We didn’t have that much supervision there because the ones that supervised us weren’t - it wasn’t a factory where like - it wasn’t where there were people, inmates working there.</span> <span id="s2363">There were regular people working there.</span> <span id="s2364">So, some of them were Jewish and some of them were not Jewish.</span> <span id="s2365">So, it wasn’t such a supervision that the Ukrainians or policemen was watching us, what we are doing every minute.</span> <span id="s2366">We worked and we went to see, and one of us would go and tell everybody else, and a few minutes later, somebody, and then the two of would go and whatever and watch, and then we worked again.</span> <span id="s2367">So, it wasn’t that forced labor.</span> <span id="s2368">And if it was, we didn’t have such - that was a night shift.</span> <span id="s2369">During the night, maybe they didn’t have so much supervision, or maybe they felt sorry for us, whatever, but I don’t remember - the work was very messy, and dirty, and hard because, you know, the bricks were heavy, and we had to carry them when they were finished, to carry them elsewhere to dry them and then put - put them in place and so on.</span> <span id="s2370">So, the work was heavy, but it wasn’t forced labor, like I said.</span> <span id="s2371">Like, we didn’t have any soldiers, Germans, Ukrainians, or we didn’t.</span> <span id="s2372">So, we could move around.</span> <span id="s2373">I mean, not that we - we had to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2374">Q: So, now back in the camp, Majowka.</span> <span id="s2375">You wanted to tell us the story of a Frenchman?</span> <span id="s2376">A: Yeah, the Frenchman was - that was in the last camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">Q: So, describe…</span></p> <p><span id="s2378">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2379">Q: …before you do that, describe the move to the last.</span> <span id="s2380">What’s going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s2381">A: They built a new camp for us and that was for the purpose just to keep us there until the train comes to takes us to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2382">We didn’t know; we were moved there.</span> <span id="s2383">I don’t remember whether people were going to work from there, because it was a short time, maybe two weeks, maybe three weeks.</span> <span id="s2384">I really don’t remember the times so exactly.</span> <span id="s2385">But, once we moved into this camp, there were no Ukrainian guards.</span> <span id="s2386">There were no - the Germans didn’t come, but - like we called them the canaries.</span> <span id="s2387">They were…</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">A: The canaries.</span> <span id="s2390">I’ll tell you why.</span> <span id="s2391">That was a German army.</span> <span id="s2392">It was an army - I knew the name, now I forgot - it was Polizei, just let me think.</span> <span id="s2393">Those were the ones that were guarding the soldiers that they shouldn’t run away.</span> <span id="s2394">Not, Sicherheit Polizei.</span> <span id="s2395">I knew the name.</span> <span id="s2396">I forgot.</span> <span id="s2397">Anyway, it will come back.</span> <span id="s2398">They were wearing light - they were wearing light green uniforms and yellow insignia all over.</span> <span id="s2399">The insignia was yellow.</span> <span id="s2400">We called them canaries because, like, we didn’t know who they were.</span> <span id="s2401">They were all around the camp.</span> <span id="s2402">There was - Altov (ph) didn’t come, any more of our - those people that looked - that were in Lager before.</span> <span id="s2403">They were staying outside the new camp.</span> <span id="s2404">Every, I would say, it would be six feet or so.</span> <span id="s2405">Let’s say every six weeks a canary would stay.</span> <span id="s2406">You know, one of those soliders, but what’s their name?</span> <span id="s2407">I just - I was thinking and I knew it for one minute only - Feld Polizei.</span> <span id="s2408">Those were the - they were guarding the soldiers they shouldn’t run away, but, you know, during the battle.</span> <span id="s2409">I just said it and I forget it.</span> <span id="s2410">I just told you and I forgot again, yeah, Feld Polizei.</span> <span id="s2411">And we knew that something horrible is going to happen because we didn’t see any of the guys that were normally coming to camp, whether they were - no Ukrainians, no Germans, only this Feld Polizei all around the camp.</span> <span id="s2412">They were the ones who put us later on wagons.</span> <span id="s2413">Anyway, when we were there, we still kept the office, but I don’t remember any German being with me because Vaschek (ph) didn’t work there for a while.</span> <span id="s2414">They sent him to Ostrowiec, or maybe they sent - like they just let him go.</span> <span id="s2415">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2416">He wasn’t needed.</span> <span id="s2417">So, there was nobody there but the typewriter was still there and I was still there, Jewish policemen were there.</span> <span id="s2418">I don’t remember any Germans except of those canaries outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s2419">Q: This is in Tarbut (ph), or you are going back and forth, or this is the end?</span></p> <p><span id="s2420">A: This is the end.</span> <span id="s2421">This is the camp that was the end camp.</span> <span id="s2422">Anyway, one of the soldiers came up and he asked me in German whether I could - I could type a date on the envelope, he’s sending a letter.</span> <span id="s2423">But he had such a French accent and I don’t know why I said this, so I said, “Moi, je parle francais un peu.</span> <span id="s2424">Donc, si vous voulez, vous pouvez parler français.”</span> <span id="s2425">So, he looked at me as if I came from another world.</span> <span id="s2426">He said, “How do you know French?”</span> <span id="s2427">I said, “I don’t know French.</span> <span id="s2428">I learned a little bit at school.</span> <span id="s2429">That’s all I know.”</span> <span id="s2430">He says, “How do you know I’m French?”</span> <span id="s2431">I said, “Because you have a French accent.”</span> <span id="s2432">Anyway, I - I put the address on his envelope.</span> <span id="s2433">He took it and he says, “Thank you very much,” and he went, and I didn’t see him anymore.</span> <span id="s2434">Then, came a time for us to go to like - the train came over, and they were putting people, a hundred people - a minimum of a hundred people in each cattle wagon, a minimum of a hundred, because I know that in some places there were 125 people instead of I don’t know how many horses they put in a wagon.</span> <span id="s2435">The train was a small train, and it had two little windows with bars, and they were closing the doors by sliding one door, so I don’t know how many horses, maybe four or five horses.</span> <span id="s2436">But we were in the last, like, there were mostly men’s - men’s trains first and then they were ladies’ friends - or trains, ladies’ trains.</span> <span id="s2437">So, we happened to go, Renia and Chris and I, happened to go in the last train.</span> <span id="s2438">They pushed us in.</span> <span id="s2439">So, and the train moved and we knew and we heard crying because people were fighting with each other.</span> <span id="s2440">They could only stand.</span> <span id="s2441">In our wagon - in our train, we could sit down.</span> <span id="s2442">We couldn’t lie down, but we could sit down and, you know, when the people are like that, and they were hungry and thirsty and they were fighting with each other so we heard moans and stuff like that, and the train was very, very slow.</span> <span id="s2443">So, when the train moved and this Feld Polizei, they were sitting on the roofs, you know, they had - they were sitting on the roofs of the train.</span> <span id="s2444">They all went with us, as if we were the most dangerous criminals.</span> <span id="s2445">They would because they - they were with guns.</span> <span id="s2446">Anyway, as we were going, it was time for us to get some water because at a certain station, they stopped the train to get pails of water and to just put the pails of water for the people to have water, like Renia and Chris - not Renia and Krysia, but people - and I tell, the people says, “We didn’t get any water.”</span> <span id="s2447">But anyway, this one guy, this guy, this French guy came in and says, “The girl that speaks French.”</span> <span id="s2448">I didn’t even get up.</span> <span id="s2449">I forgot that I speak French, because I only spoke with him once.</span> <span id="s2450">So, he says, “The girl that speaks French.”</span> <span id="s2451">So, I came to this little window and he says, “Take a couple of other girls because we are going for water.</span> <span id="s2452">To bring water for them.”</span> <span id="s2453">So, he had some pails.</span> <span id="s2454">So, I called - I thought that I took Krysia and Renia, but Krysia went with me, but Renia says she doesn’t remember.</span> <span id="s2455">So, I maybe I took - like, I asked another girl, but Krysia definitely was with me.</span> <span id="s2456">So, we went for to bring the water.</span> <span id="s2457">Everyone was getting either one pail or two, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s2458">Anyway, when we came to the well where the water was to be, you know, like we pumped the water, he says in French to me, “I am going to let you runaway now.</span> <span id="s2459">You just run when you want.</span> <span id="s2460">Don’t worry, I’m going to shoot later.</span> <span id="s2461">First, I will pretend that I didn’t notice.”</span> <span id="s2462">He said it in French.</span> <span id="s2463">“I pretend that I didn’t notice.</span> <span id="s2464">I don’t want you here, run!”</span> <span id="s2465">So, I looked at him, and I thought to myself, “He’s crazy.</span> <span id="s2466">He’s going to - we will run and he will kill us.”</span> <span id="s2467">So, I said to Chris in Polish, “He wants us to run, but I’m not going to run.</span> <span id="s2468">I don’t trust him.”</span> <span id="s2469">And he said again, “Run, and I’m going to shoot.</span> <span id="s2470">Don’t worry, just run.”</span> <span id="s2471">Where are we going to run?</span> <span id="s2472">We are somewhere all strange.</span> <span id="s2473">We didn’t know where to go.</span> <span id="s2474">So, I said to Krysia, “I’m not going.</span> <span id="s2475">I’m going back.</span> <span id="s2476">My father is there,” and I thought Renia was with us, but I asked her.</span> <span id="s2477">So, maybe Renia was there, so we didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s2478">And so we went back.</span> <span id="s2479">He says, “I warned you.”</span> <span id="s2480">And then he says, “Okay, if you don’t want to run away now,” because I said to him, “I don’t have where to run.”</span> <span id="s2481">So, he says, “If you don’t , but don’t write it down, just remember, what I’m going to tell you know.</span> <span id="s2482">Just remember.</span> <span id="s2483">My name is Leo Bernard.</span></p> <p><span id="s2484">My address is Merignan Mine (ph).</span> <span id="s2485">Don’t write it down anywhere, but if you ever have a chance or any of you have a chance.</span> <span id="s2486">If you remember to tell them to come, I’ll say - you could stay whatever.”</span> <span id="s2487">Like, we would have an address where to run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">Q: Hold the story.</span> <span id="s2489">We have to stop the tape.</span> <span id="s2490">A: This story’s almost finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s2491">Q: Okay, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s2492">A: So, anyway we came back.</span> <span id="s2493">We didn’t trust him.</span> <span id="s2494">We stayed there for a long time until we came to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2495">We didn’t trust him.</span> <span id="s2496">From time to time, he open the door and he’d put a few parcels of some food that he - I don’t know - for anybody, and this is the end of the story.</span> <span id="s2497">When we came to Auschwitz, he says, “I warned you, because from here, there is.</span> <span id="s2498">.”</span> <span id="s2499">He came to me again and says, “I warned you because there’s no escape from anywhere from here.”</span> <span id="s2500">And, this is the end.</span> <span id="s2501">So, when I came to Canada, which was, we came to Canada in ’48 - I was thinking about it.</span> <span id="s2502">I said, “I wonder whether he told us the truth.”</span> <span id="s2503">So, 20 years later or so, I wrote a letter to this address.</span> <span id="s2504">I was just wondering whether such a person - whether he was lying, whether a person like that would exist, that whether he really wanted to save our lives, whether he wanted to shoot us.</span> <span id="s2505">I was never sure, so I thought I would write him a thank you letter for his good intentions.</span> <span id="s2506">I wrote in English, and the letter came back “No One Under this Name” So, did he lie?</span> <span id="s2507">Did he say the truth?</span> <span id="s2508">But, he really and truly told us to run.</span></p> <p><span id="s2509">Q: Okay, we’ll change the tape.</span> <span id="s2510">End of Tape #9</span></p> <p><span id="s2511">Tape #10</span></p> <p><span id="s2512">Q: I want to go back to Majowka for just a moment.</span> <span id="s2513">I want to ask you whether, as far as you remember, were there more men in the camp or women?</span></p> <p><span id="s2514">A: More men.</span></p> <p><span id="s2515">Q: By a considerable amount?</span></p> <p><span id="s2516">A: Considerable amount.</span> <span id="s2517">I would say, let’s take a thousand as a unit - I would say there was 700 men and 300 women.</span> <span id="s2518">I mean, roughly; I’m just estimating.</span> <span id="s2519">Because I go by the amount of barracks.</span> <span id="s2520">There were more men’s barracks than girls’.</span></p> <p><span id="s2521">Q: Do you think that’s significant in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2522">A: Because when they were picking people to work, there was more jobs for men than women.</span> <span id="s2523">There were very - like the munitions factory, I had , they had different departments, but they were doing, like, iron in the hot fire and the women couldn’t do work like that.</span> <span id="s2524">So, they had departments like that where you had - you had to have the strength for this kind of work.</span> <span id="s2525">So, there was always more men than women.</span></p> <p><span id="s2526">Q: How long do you remember the trip being to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2527">A: I would say that at least we traveled two nights because I remember a day and then a night, and I remember another day and another night.</span> <span id="s2528">So, it’s possible that we came on the third day, we came to.</span> <span id="s2529">I was talking to Renia about it.</span> <span id="s2530">She thinks we went there faster, but those trains didn’t go fast.</span> <span id="s2531">The train didn’t go on a regular route.</span> <span id="s2532">They trains were going on side roads and they were very slow, very slow, and they stopped from time to time for crossing, for different things, and I remember two nights when they closed the doors and then when they opened the door slightly for us to get a little bit of breeze, and as you know, on the way to Auschwitz, a lot of people perished.</span> <span id="s2533">Some were trampled by other people.</span> <span id="s2534">As a matter of fact, my husband’s brother and father died in the - because there was so many people, 125 people, and they had to go to the bathroom and they had to do, you know, those things were not provided.</span> <span id="s2535">I don’t remember anymore going for water except for this once, and also a lot of people jumped the trains and they couldn’t have jumped the trains if the train was going fast.</span> <span id="s2536">One of them, some of them, like I remember, but I forgot the name of that man but I knew him well, but a lot of people jumped and they were killed.</span> <span id="s2537">They were killed because the guards - the canaries - were shooting at them, you know, like the train was going slow.</span> <span id="s2538">So, I would say that two nights and two and a half days.</span></p> <p><span id="s2539">Q: Did you have a pail to go to the bathroom?</span> <span id="s2540">A: No, we didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2541">Q: So, did you just go?</span> <span id="s2542">A: Just go.</span></p> <p><span id="s2543">Q: This must have felt horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2544">A: Horrible.</span> <span id="s2545">The stench was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s2546">Q: And were people crying and screaming?</span></p> <p><span id="s2547">A: Crying and screaming and that’s why they jumped, because it didn’t matter to them.</span> <span id="s2548">They jumped the train because it was better to be shot then to go wherever, I mean, in such conditions.</span> <span id="s2549">We didn’t where we were going, because I believed that we were going to another camp to work, like, to another labor camp to work, but that was me.</span> <span id="s2550">I wanted to believe it.</span> <span id="s2551">But other people, I don’t know whether they knew we were going to Auschwitz, but some people preferred to die than to go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2552">Q: And, what did this, as you were - what did this do to you as you saw people trying to escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s2553">A: We heard - we heard shots and we heard moans and we heard screams.</span> <span id="s2554">We heard it all, all the time, and I mean, you know, it was - that was a very traumatic time.</span> <span id="s2555">Different people reacted differently.</span> <span id="s2556">I remember - I remember Krysia.</span> <span id="s2557">My hair was shiny and I used to wear it like this with a - with a…whatever.</span> <span id="s2558">Krysia used to say, “Oh, I’m so sorry for you, because if you die with such nice hair.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2559">Q: So, you, it was macabre jokes that you...</span></p> <p><span id="s2560">A: Macabre jokes.</span> <span id="s2561">But it was, you know, like we didn’t know what to expect, where we are going.</span> <span id="s2562">Like, later on we found out that we are in Auschwitz, but I mean, we didn’t even know how horrible Auschwitz was, because you heard things but you really didn’t believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2563">Q: So, had you heard the word Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2564">A: We heard it, but we never believed that it could be worse than Starachowice camp.</span> <span id="s2565">Like, the camp, consider going - don’t forget they killed us slowly.</span> <span id="s2566">First there was the ghetto, then was a smaller ghetto, then there was the camp.</span> <span id="s2567">So, I mean, we couldn’t believe that anything could be any worse than we already went through.</span> <span id="s2568">Like, you never believed that they’re killing people in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2569">You heard about it, but you didn’t believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2570">Q: Were you frightened for your father as you were riding in the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s2571">A: I was.</span> <span id="s2572">Because I - I knew that he wasn’t the same strong man as he was before, but we were also afraid of us.</span> <span id="s2573">Like, I was afraid that Renia would never survive because - not because I was afraid that they would kill her or anything, but that she was not healthy enough to survive such hard times.</span></p> <p><span id="s2574">Q: But, she had already survived a couple of years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2575">A: She did, but she was still - she was always the most frightened, because I was very daring.</span> <span id="s2576">I wasn’t afraid.</span> <span id="s2577">I was daring, but - and Krysia, too - but, Renia was always afraid.</span> <span id="s2578">She was always shaking, always afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s2579">Q: But neither you, you or Chris were not in the same way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2580">A: Not in the same way.</span> <span id="s2581">I think that Chris was the most realistic person.</span> <span id="s2582">She organized things for us, whether it was food in Auschwitz or whatever, she was able to do those things.</span> <span id="s2583">I, on the other hand, wasn’t afraid of the devil.</span> <span id="s2584">Like, if they told me to go right at something, I wouldn’t have gone.</span> <span id="s2585">I wasn’t afraid because - I don’t know why, but I wasn’t.</span> <span id="s2586">But Renia was - she always was hiding in corners.</span> <span id="s2587">She was always cold.</span> <span id="s2588">She was always sick.</span> <span id="s2589">So, that was our worry, but we were very lucky that we kept together.</span> <span id="s2590">We always watched for one another, and I’ll tell you that, at a certain time when we were going to Auschwitz, not - from Auschwitz to Ravensbrück, when we were walking the death march, if not my sisters - I lost my conscious.</span> <span id="s2591">I didn’t know where I was.</span> <span id="s2592">I couldn’t walk, and I was the tallest.</span> <span id="s2593">Both of my sisters, Renia and Chris almost carried on one side.</span> <span id="s2594">It’s not far anymore, let’s - a few more steps, Hania, a few more steps.</span> <span id="s2595">They saved my life, the same way as, in other moments, I saved their life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2596">Q: So, Renia is the scared one, the baby.</span> <span id="s2597">Chris is the organized, practical one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2598">A: Organized, most practical, she always found us food.</span> <span id="s2599">She was very, very, very good at that way.</span> <span id="s2600">And she always shared not only with us, she shared it with others.</span> <span id="s2601">And I was a devil.</span> <span id="s2602">I wasn’t afraid of anything.</span> <span id="s2603">I was just not afraid, and I’ll tell you, since I was the tallest, there was always a risk that whenever there was a selection or they looked for somebody to work for a job or whatever, they would always - always - even if I was in the back.</span> <span id="s2604">Like, Krysia says, “Don’t stay in the front, stay in the back.</span> <span id="s2605">They’ll take you to take blood.</span> <span id="s2606">They’ll take you to do this.”</span> <span id="s2607">So, but no matter where I stood they - because I was a tall sticking out - so, “This one.”</span> <span id="s2608">But, sometimes it was good and sometimes it wasn’t so good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2609">Q: Does that mean you took risks?</span> <span id="s2610">A: I took risks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2611">Q: Bad ones?</span></p> <p><span id="s2612">A: Well, I don’t know if they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s2613">Q: They obviously didn’t turn out bad.</span> <span id="s2614">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s2615">Q: They didn’t turn out bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s2616">A: They didn’t turn out bad because I wasn’t afraid somehow.</span> <span id="s2617">Q: So…</span></p> <p><span id="s2618">A: You know I helped us to escape from this last, last…but this will be another story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2619">Q: You arrive in Auschwitz, the doors are open.</span> <span id="s2620">As I understand it, your father is in the car either behind your or in front of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2621">A: No, we were in the last car.</span> <span id="s2622">I think that my father was in the car before us, or two before us, because I don’t remember whether all the women were one after the other or they picked a car full of women, then men and then women.</span> <span id="s2623">I don’t know, because we were in the last car, and I know that my father was fairly close by.</span> <span id="s2624">So, Krysia thinks that he was in the car right after us.</span> <span id="s2625">I was under the impression - because we talked about - I was under the impression that they kept women separately so, they must have been in the third car, but he was close.</span></p> <p><span id="s2626">Q: What was it like when the doors were opened?</span> <span id="s2627">Was it…?</span> <span id="s2628">A: When the doors were opened to go out?</span></p> <p><span id="s2629">Q: To go out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2630">A: First of all, we had a very bad experience because the guards that took us before they took us to change our dresses and everything, we went very close by a crematorium, or if that wasn’t a crematorium, we were told it was a crematorium.</span> <span id="s2631">So, I remember having a bottle of whiskey that this Frenchman - I forgot to tell you that the Frenchman left in Auschwitz, he says, “If they take you to the crematorium...” So, we had this bottle of whiskey.</span> <span id="s2632">I never drank in my life, but all the girls - I told the girls, so when they German soldiers stopped us in front of the crematorium, or he called this crematorium, so we took this bottle and every girl had a taste.</span> <span id="s2633">Not a taste of it, but you know, like we were thinking that we’re going to die now so let’s just be merry.</span> <span id="s2634">We never drank in our lifetimes, but the whole bottle went.</span> <span id="s2635">Like, as far as it went from us, and then they took us to the place where they cut our hair, and after that he stayed with us there for a few minutes to scare us or to whatever - to whatever, and then they took us to the place where we had to leave everything we had, to put on the uniform or whatever you call it, a dress with stripes, and they cut our hair.</span> <span id="s2636">This is another story how I suffered the most out of all of three of us.</span> <span id="s2637">And, then we went to the barrack.</span> <span id="s2638">So, I’ll tell you maybe how they first brought us in and told us to take all our clothes off and they put nothing else, we had no brassiere, this I remember - because I was so - it felt so strange to just have the dress on - and they gave us the dress.</span> <span id="s2639">The dress was too short on me, so there was a small girl that I don’t know who, we changed dresses to fit us.</span> <span id="s2640">Because we were all very skinny, but nobody was as tall as I.</span> <span id="s2641">They were mostly smaller people.</span> <span id="s2642">So, there were just a few long dresses.</span> <span id="s2643">I was glad that somebody exchanged with me the dress.</span> <span id="s2644">Then, they cut our hair to here.</span> <span id="s2645">They checked our hair for lice.</span> <span id="s2646">They put this stuff in, disinfectant or whatever you call it, in our hair and on our bodies before they gave us the dresses, and I remember, they took away my shoes.</span> <span id="s2647">So, they gave us such wooden shoes - wooden shoes - and this was a case where the wooden shoes - we were already in dresses and men from another camp were distributing the shoes, and the guy says, “Take it, take it.”</span> <span id="s2648">To me like, in Polish we have - like in English you say “you” it means everything, but do you understand French or German?</span> <span id="s2649">So, they say “vous” or “tu” or in German they said - they say, because here you say “you”, in Polish also you never talk to a lady by calling her “Dou”(ph), you caller her “Vu” like, and the guy says, “Take those, take those.”</span> <span id="s2650">Well I just said, “How dare you calling me ‘dou’?”</span> <span id="s2651">Okay, it was so stupid.</span> <span id="s2652">And, then so anyway I put those dresses - I couldn’t walk in them, and then they put us five people in a row to march to the barracks.</span> <span id="s2653">So, we were five, and so - Krysia, Renia and I were three and there was three others.</span> <span id="s2654">They didn’t want to part and we didn’t want to part.</span> <span id="s2655">So, this woman goes, she says, “What’s the commotion?</span> <span id="s2656">The couple there.”</span> <span id="s2657">You know, I just came to a new camp.</span> <span id="s2658">I didn’t like the way guy says to me “Dou,” and here she screams at me.</span> <span id="s2659">I wasn’t really used to it because you know nobody really mistreated me when I worked before, and she says, “Go to the back.”</span> <span id="s2660">I say, “I’m not going to the back.”</span> <span id="s2661">She says - I say, “Those are my two sisters.”</span> <span id="s2662">She didn’t even want to hear.</span> <span id="s2663">She took me by the hair, grabbed me by the hair, to the German man there that was cutting the hair, and she says, “Make a cross on her head.”</span> <span id="s2664">So, you know, she was mad that I talked back to her.</span> <span id="s2665">So, first he made the cross, and then he felt sorry for me and he shaved my head, but I was the only one with a really shaved head of hair.</span> <span id="s2666">You know, like, I didn’t have anything on my head - just - I don’t know whether I looked like a boy or whatever.</span> <span id="s2667">Anyway, finally we just didn’t want to be parted and I didn’t care what she says.</span> <span id="s2668">She couldn’t kill me, like I was daring.</span> <span id="s2669">I said, “I’m not going, they are my two sisters.</span> <span id="s2670">I’m going with them.”</span> <span id="s2671">So, she got mad.</span> <span id="s2672">She pushed us.</span> <span id="s2673">Anyway, we’re together.</span> <span id="s2674">I didn’t want to part from them, because if I went to the back or whatever, I mean, it wasn’t the next row - we would have never been together.</span> <span id="s2675">When we came to the barrack…</span></p> <p><span id="s2676">Q: Can we go back before you get to the barrack?</span> <span id="s2677">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2678">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2679">Q: Is the sequence that you get your hair cut - you take off your clothes… A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2680">Q: Then you get your hair cut?</span> <span id="s2681">A: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2682">Q: And, then you get a tattoo, and then you get the clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2683">A: Oh, but you know, when did I get it there?</span> <span id="s2684">When did I get the tattoo?</span> <span id="s2685">After we had the shower, after we had the shower, and we got the dress, we went there and we got the tattoo.</span> <span id="s2686">Before we went to the barrack - so, I must have had already my hair - I must have had my hair cut short already.</span> <span id="s2687">I - I was already with shaven head.</span> <span id="s2688">I was the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2689">Everybody had had hair to here because, you know, when we went to - they wouldn’t have touched us.</span> <span id="s2690">This is my logic now - they wouldn’t have touched us before they disinfected us.</span> <span id="s2691">Don’t forget when we were - when we went under the shower, we shed our clothes and we got whatever clothes to put on.</span> <span id="s2692">We were already, like, we were already clean.</span> <span id="s2693">It was after the wash.</span> <span id="s2694">They sprayed such a horrible thing on us.</span> <span id="s2695">It smelled horrible, and it was stinging us because it was against - I don’t know against what - a disinfectant.</span> <span id="s2696">So, I’m positive that they wouldn’t have touched our hair if we didn’t go through disinfection before.</span> <span id="s2697">That’s my logic now; I don’t remember the sequence.</span></p> <p><span id="s2698">Q: Do you remember that it was men who cut your hair?</span> <span id="s2699">A: Yeah, I remember that a German cut my hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s2700">Q: A German what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2701">A: A German man - soldier.</span> <span id="s2702">Q: A soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s2703">A: He must have been a barber.</span> <span id="s2704">He must have - a German soldier shaved my head.</span> <span id="s2705">I don’t remember who cut my hair or - because that was a routine.</span> <span id="s2706">Like, everybody was just getting their hair cut, but this one was a punishment for being disobedient, for talking back to the kapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s2707">Q: After you got your tattoo and the dress, do you remember getting the tattoo?</span> <span id="s2708">A: I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2709">Q: Did it hurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s2710">A: No, it was like - like with a needle, that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s2711">It didn’t hurt, but as if you put a lot of needles all the time, and we have numbers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2712">Q: Sequential.</span></p> <p><span id="s2713">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2714">I have 1736 or something and Krysia has the next number and Reina has the next number.</span></p> <p><span id="s2715">Q: You had 14176, Krysia has 14177… A: Yeah and Renia has…</span></p> <p><span id="s2716">Q: Has 14178.</span></p> <p><span id="s2717">A: Yeah, I remember that we had numbers one after another.</span></p> <p><span id="s2718">Q: When you got - you remember getting striped - all of you got striped?</span> <span id="s2719">A: All of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2720">Q: Did you then get a patch to sew on?</span></p> <p><span id="s2721">A: You know that I don’t remember, but we had a patch there.</span> <span id="s2722">No, we didn’t have - we had yellow patches.</span> <span id="s2723">The Polish people had - a triangle.</span></p> <p><span id="s2724">Q: One triangle?</span></p> <p><span id="s2725">A: One triangle.</span></p> <p><span id="s2726">Q: With a bar above it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2727">A: Was it a bar above it?</span> <span id="s2728">I don’t remember, but that was a triangle.</span> <span id="s2729">So, that was in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s2730">Q: Did you wear it here?</span> <span id="s2731">Did you wear it…</span></p> <p><span id="s2732">A: No, I wore it on my sleeve because in the last camp, we had red ones because we had registered as Poles, but this is - in this camp, we had yellow, yellow triangles.</span> <span id="s2733">I remember having the lower part here and like this.</span> <span id="s2734">It wasn’t a white armband, this was in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s2735">Q: Did you have to sew this on, the triangle?</span> <span id="s2736">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s2737">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s2738">Most likely, but I didn’t have a needle, but maybe it was a glue that they glued it on.</span> <span id="s2739">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2740">I don’t remember, but we wore yellow triangles.</span></p> <p><span id="s2741">Q: Do you remember whether they knew your names?</span> <span id="s2742">Was there a list of all of you who went to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2743">A: I think that, when they gave us the tattoo, they wrote down the name and the number, and from there on we were numbers.</span> <span id="s2744">There were no names.</span></p> <p><span id="s2745">Q: So, there was an identity card in the…</span></p> <p><span id="s2746">A: No, we didn’t get a card, but when they registered us, because the Starachowice group came separately, and the Starachowice groups came separately.</span> <span id="s2747">All Starachowice groups have this number, you know, like one after another, and I forgot what you asked me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2748">Q: Well, I asked you - identity is the wrong word.</span> <span id="s2749">It’s a registration card.</span> <span id="s2750">A: We didn’t have a card.</span></p> <p><span id="s2751">Q: Right, but there was a registration that was…</span></p> <p><span id="s2752">A: They just wrote our names.</span> <span id="s2753">They wrote down our numbers, and from there on, we had no names.</span> <span id="s2754">Like, we called each other by the name, but if they called - if they called you for some reason, they called you by the number.</span></p> <p><span id="s2755">Q: Now, did people recognize you when you got your…</span></p> <p><span id="s2756">A: Now I’ll tell you the story.</span> <span id="s2757">I, myself - okay, we came in.</span> <span id="s2758">They gave us a barrack, three rows of bunks, bigger bunks than we had, but I would say six - five to six people slept.</span> <span id="s2759">We had to sleep like sardines.</span> <span id="s2760">One this way, one this way, one this way, because - and they were boards, just boards, because in camp in Starachowice, we had straw underneath.</span> <span id="s2761">Here, you know, like it was a straw sack with straw inside.</span> <span id="s2762">So, it wasn’t so bad.</span> <span id="s2763">This was on the bare thing and we - there wasn’t enough room to sleep one way.</span> <span id="s2764">We had to have the heads one way… But now I’m going back, because when we arrived, there was a little window similar enough to the windows without bars, but similar to the window in the train that I told you, a small just to let some light in.</span> <span id="s2765">So, I , you know, I’m tall, so I stood there and I see - I see there’s a man there, and I looked at - I looked, it was myself, but I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s2766">So, I say, “Man!”</span> <span id="s2767">I looked out this way.</span> <span id="s2768">I don’t see any man, but then I looked in the mirror, and there’s a man there.</span> <span id="s2769">So, I started moving my head.</span> <span id="s2770">I realized that’s me.</span> <span id="s2771">I didn’t recognize myself.</span> <span id="s2772">I would never believe.</span> <span id="s2773">I was very skinny at the time and very tall, and my head looked like a pin drop, like with the hair, you know, my head was very small by comparison.</span> <span id="s2774">Like, I couldn’t recognize myself, and it was funny because one day I was walking the streets and, you know, the men was coming - were coming to do the toilets in the ladies’ - the ladies didn’t clean - it wasn’t a toilet - how do you call it when there are only holes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2775">Q: The latrine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2776">A: The latrines.</span> <span id="s2777">The men were coming to clean the latrine and one of our guys, a boy from Germany - I remember his name, Lothar - he was picked to clean the toilets.</span> <span id="s2778">So, he came in and he saw me.</span> <span id="s2779">He was so happy.</span> <span id="s2780">He comes, he says, “Tell Hania that your father is alive.”</span> <span id="s2781">I looked at him and I was so vain, I didn’t tell him for a minute that I was Hania, because I didn’t want anybody to know that I looked like that.</span> <span id="s2782">He didn’t - I don’t know - I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2783">I didn’t ask him, but I came home and I said, “I’m so glad he didn’t recognize me.”</span> <span id="s2784">Like, people are stupid.</span> <span id="s2785">I mean, I’m talking about myself.</span> <span id="s2786">So, then we went into the barrack.</span> <span id="s2787">The barrack was run by four people.</span> <span id="s2788">There was the Lager Älteste, which was responsible for the barrack.</span> <span id="s2789">There were two thousand people going in one barrack, you can imagine how many people.</span> <span id="s2790">So, there was the Lager Älteste.</span> <span id="s2791">She was a Czechoslovakian girl.</span> <span id="s2792">Her name was Yolichka (ph).</span> <span id="s2793">Then there was a Shreiberin who had a job like I had.</span> <span id="s2794">She kept records who went to work, and she was doing all the office work.</span> <span id="s2795">Her name was Felicia Berlant (ph).</span> <span id="s2796">She’s still alive.</span> <span id="s2797">She saved our lives.</span> <span id="s2798">She was the Shreiberin.</span> <span id="s2799">Then there were two Steuben Älteste.</span> <span id="s2800">The barrack was divided in four and each Steuben Älteste which was responsible for this part - for like two parts of the barrack on this side, and two parts of the barrack on that side.</span> <span id="s2801">She kept, she kept, she made us clean the places where you slept.</span> <span id="s2802">She made us responsible for, responsible for cleanliness, that’s all, and order in the places.</span> <span id="s2803">When we arrived, this Yolichka (ph) spoke Czech to us, but we understood.</span> <span id="s2804">This Fela Berlant (ph), she got the job because she could scream the most and she had a language similar to Vaschek (ph).</span> <span id="s2805">So, when we arrived and we didn’t stay straight she says, “You…” - I have to translate it because - “Quiet, you whores from Starachowice.”</span> <span id="s2806">She didn’t call us any other - not that she was bad.</span> <span id="s2807">She saved our lives and many other people.</span> <span id="s2808">She was a good woman, but otherwise she wouldn’t have had the job if she didn’t speak like that.</span> <span id="s2809">She called us names of all sorts.</span></p> <p><span id="s2810">And when we arrived, and we got the job, we were working outside the camp, outside the camp, and we were cutting bulrushes in wetland.</span> <span id="s2811">So, we stood always in cold water, wetland, cutting, and those - we had those knives that the Germans gave us at the place of work already, that we had to cut, but it was so woody, like it was so hard.</span> <span id="s2812">It was the hardest job I ever had.</span> <span id="s2813">My hands were bleeding because the bulrushes when they grow for such a long time, they become woody, and to cut it with a knife it’s very hard.</span> <span id="s2814">He had - he had german shepherds, like he took us to work.</span> <span id="s2815">We cut it.</span> <span id="s2816">We were cutting those bushes, two german shepherds - like, I don’t know how many of the guards were there that took us, but two huge german shepherds and as a matter of fact, the first day he taught me a lesson.</span> <span id="s2817">Of course, I was picked because I was tall again.</span> <span id="s2818">So, he wanted to show us that if - because we were outside the camp and the reason why they were cutting those bushes because they wanted to clean up the barbed wire walls in order, if somebody wanted to run away and hide there or if there was a partisan attack or some attack, so they could hide in those bulrushes.</span> <span id="s2819">So, we had to cut them.</span> <span id="s2820">So, he wanted to show us what would happen to everybody - to anybody that intends to run away.</span> <span id="s2821">So, he called his dog and he told him to - he told him to start biting my dress, and he must have told him in German, because he didn’t touch me.</span> <span id="s2822">He just tear my dress to pieces, and of course, I froze because I am afraid of dogs, like especially touch, you know, the mean dogs that bark so, and the teeth were so bad, and he stopped at him at a certain time and started again.</span> <span id="s2823">So, the dog didn’t bite me, but he bit, like, my dress was in shreds.</span> <span id="s2824">I got another dress from Fela when I went back.</span> <span id="s2825">But, that was a time when I was really scared, very scared, because I thought the dog was going to kill me.</span> <span id="s2826">So, I just stood there, and so we worked there for three months.</span> <span id="s2827">After three months…</span></p> <p><span id="s2828">Q: Let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s2829">Did you take your shoes off, the wooden shoes?</span> <span id="s2830">A: Yeah, no, I - I didn’t have any other shoes.</span> <span id="s2831">I had to wear the wooden shoes.</span> <span id="s2832">Q: So, you wore the wooden shoes in the marshes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2833">A: In the marshes - no, in the marshes we took off the shoes.</span> <span id="s2834">Q: So, you were barefoot?</span></p> <p><span id="s2835">A: And, as a matter of fact, we even washed our dresses as much because we didn’t get them so often, maybe every two weeks or so.</span> <span id="s2836">We didn’t go to showers every day, you know, the showers - I’ll tell you a story about, a separate story, but when I came home Fela gave me right away another dress.</span> <span id="s2837">So, that was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2838">Q: One second - how are we doing?</span> <span id="s2839">Okay let’s change the tape.</span> <span id="s2840">You had showers there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2841">A: Not showers, we went every week they took us to such a place where they were - once a week we went… End of Tape #10</span></p> <p><span id="s2842">Tape #11</span></p> <p><span id="s2843">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2844">We were talking about the marshes and the dog, but you were also beginning to talk about the fact that you had, not exactly showers, but you could wash.</span></p> <p><span id="s2845">A: Yeah, we were going to - I don’t - in Birkenau, in another section, where they had a place where most likely they were taking the inmates - I call them inmates - regularly, once a week or once every ten days, whatever time, you know, and we were going to those things to have showers.</span> <span id="s2846">So, I don’t know how often I did that, I don’t remember, but I think once a week or once every ten days.</span> <span id="s2847">When we arrived there, we undressed, they took our clothes, they put it through the same function, like they gave us - okay, what they had to do to put this stuff to disinfect all the dresses.</span> <span id="s2848">So, they gave us - they took another bunch that they already disinfected from another group, and they gave it to us, and we had a new dress, but each time it was a new old dress.</span> <span id="s2849">Each time, I had to fight to get the longest, but I was very lucky.</span> <span id="s2850">The girls always cooperated with me because otherwise they would have to have a dress like this.</span> <span id="s2851">So, that was the procedure.</span> <span id="s2852">So, whenever we went there, German soldiers would come - like, we would be - I mean, this wasn’t in the plan, but I think that was the character that they wanted to do it - they would come to the room where we were, and they would take a hose with cold water, put it on the highest tension, and they would just not only tease the girls, but they would come and they would just try to spray you with this - with all the force in your private parts.</span> <span id="s2853">If you screamed or you danced, they did worse to you.</span> <span id="s2854">So, we knew that we had to stand still.</span></p> <p><span id="s2855">We had to disregard it.</span> <span id="s2856">We had to say nothing, just stand there and pretend that it doesn’t happen to you.</span> <span id="s2857">So, that - so, we weren’t looking forward to the showers so much because we had to suffer, and nobody - I’m sure that it wasn’t like, it wasn’t meant to be like that, but they did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2858">Q: Do you remember which barrack you were in?</span></p> <p><span id="s2859">A: Yeah, 20…20.</span> <span id="s2860">My sister thinks it was 25, but I think it was 20.</span> <span id="s2861">Q: Have you ever looked at a map of Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2862">A: I never went back.</span> <span id="s2863">I couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s2864">Like, my sister… Q: No, a map?</span> <span id="s2865">Not going there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2866">A: I didn’t look.</span> <span id="s2867">No, I didn’t look.</span> <span id="s2868">I’m almost positive it’s 20, because I trust my memory, but my sister thinks it’s 25.</span> <span id="s2869">Krysia thinks it’s 25.</span></p> <p><span id="s2870">Q: Well, I’ll see if I can find out where Fela Berlant (ph) and this other woman were.</span></p> <p><span id="s2871">A: Because we - we differ on that, because I remember - because Miles went to - went to - when he got the barrack, he wanted our barrack, and I was under the impression that they gave him, our barrack.</span> <span id="s2872">I’m not sure, but he said that when they offered to give him a barrack for the museum, and he said when he goes there, he’s going to ask for it, because they don’t care which barrack.</span> <span id="s2873">They had to dismantle it anyway to send it to - so, he says he will try to get our barrack.</span> <span id="s2874">Whether he did or not, I couldn’t tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2875">Q: Weren’t you in quarantine for a month before you went to this barrack?</span> <span id="s2876">A: You know, that I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s2877">I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2878">Q: So, your recollection is going directly to this barrack?</span> <span id="s2879">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2880">Q: So, you don’t recollect sitting around for a couple of weeks doing practically nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2881">A: No.</span> <span id="s2882">I remember that we had to - I don’t know whether it was the next day, but it was soon after we came, we got this job.</span></p> <p><span id="s2883">Q: Do you recall when you discovered the real truth about Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s2884">A: Right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2885">Q: Right away, and you believed it?</span> <span id="s2886">A: I believed it.</span> <span id="s2887">I believed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2888">Q: So, this is the first time the thought you had in your head about what was going on was really destroyed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2889">A: Yeah, because we - the crematorium, we felt it.</span> <span id="s2890">The stench of the, like, it was very easy because we met other girls from different barracks, and the stench from the crematorium, you know, the bones burning and the hair burning and the heat and the fire that was going out from there.</span> <span id="s2891">So, we knew that people - I even knew - I remember, someone told me that 3,000 people can go into one of those crematoriums after they are gassed, apparently, that’s what I was told.</span> <span id="s2892">I was never inside, but I’ll repeat what I was told, that 3,000 people can be put at one time into the gas chamber, and apparently after they’re gassed, the floor opens and they go, and the fire starts burning.</span> <span id="s2893">So, they don’t handle it, they only handle ashes.</span> <span id="s2894">They don’t handle the bodies.</span> <span id="s2895">That’s what I was told, and I asked - I remember, they told me 3,000 people at one time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2896">Q: And this was just another prisoner in the camp that told you this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2897">A: Yeah, another woman prisoner from - maybe Fela told us or maybe Yolichka (ph), or maybe one of those that were a little bit longer, the girls that worked there.</span> <span id="s2898">They could have told us, but I remember asking and that was the answer I got, and I could smell it myself all day, every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2899">Q: Could you see fire?</span></p> <p><span id="s2900">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2901">I mean, from the chimneys.</span> <span id="s2902">I didn’t see fire as fire, but they had such long chimneys and some flames were coming out, and they were making the air impossible, like it was impossible to breath.</span></p> <p><span id="s2903">Q: And were ashes coming down on your clothes?</span> <span id="s2904">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2905">Q: So, how long was it - well, first of all, how was your treatment in this barrack?</span> <span id="s2906">Was the…</span></p> <p><span id="s2907">A: I’ll tell you what.</span> <span id="s2908">This Fela took care of us immediately.</span> <span id="s2909">She liked - I think she liked Krysia the most.</span> <span id="s2910">I don’t care, but she was so good to us, whenever she had an extra piece of bread or something, if she had something, the three girls - she just - she just was, I mean, as bad as she was - maybe she wasn’t bad.</span> <span id="s2911">She had a huge, big mouth.</span> <span id="s2912">She screamed, because otherwise she wouldn’t have had a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s2913">Q: And, where was she from?</span> <span id="s2914">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2915">A: Yeah, she was from Helm (ph).</span> <span id="s2916">I know, because I just saw her.</span> <span id="s2917">I’m - we are friends because she really saved our lives, really saved our lives, and I’ll tell you right away how.</span> <span id="s2918">So, anyway, when we were there for three months working so hard, she tried to always give me a better dress, or you know, if she had something that was special, she would always give it to us and really treat us a little better then she treated everybody else.</span> <span id="s2919">And then, one time, there was a Polish uprising in Warsaw, not Jewish, Polish uprising, and they caught all the people - Polish girls to - that they caught, that they thought that took part in this uprising, maybe men, too, but they came to Auschwitz, and they were Polish people, so they didn’t go to crematorium and they didn’t go to a barrack where they send them to hard labor, and what they did - whatever they brought with them, the suitcases and everything, every piece of clothes had to be recorded, and when they - and they had red triangles - and when they finished their sentence, because they were not convicted for life or taken to camp like that, but when they finished the verdict for two months, half a year, a year, they were getting the clothes washed and ironed, and they went home.</span> <span id="s2920">So, at that time, Jews never worked in this department, only Polish people, but because of the fact that Polish people were coming and they didn’t want any problems, they needed 20 girls to go there, to write down the, you know, to sort out the clothes, to write down the clothes, to hang up the clothes, to wash the laundry and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s2921">So, they decided to take 20 Jewish girls from our - from - and of course the Shreiberin got the order - the first two of us, she picked me and Krysia right away, and she had the 20 girls because we begged her to take - to give Renia.</span> <span id="s2922">She’s like, “I can’t.</span> <span id="s2923">This is office work.</span> <span id="s2924">She looks - she’s too young.</span> <span id="s2925">They want - they will never take her.”</span> <span id="s2926">So, we begged her and begged her.</span> <span id="s2927">So, she went to Yolichka (ph) who was the Lager Älteste - the barrack Älteste, and she asked her.</span> <span id="s2928">She said, “Well, all I can do is to ask the German.”</span> <span id="s2929">You know, the German guy that’s going to pick them up if he agrees, but she says, “I can’t take all of them, because they need 20 people.”</span> <span id="s2930">So, anyway we were so nervous, I remember, the German came in.</span> <span id="s2931">Fela was there standing, and Yolichka (ph) went to the German soldier who was transporting us to the new job, and she said to him, “There’s three sisters, the youngest is the best, but she looks a little bit small, but she isn’t that young.</span> <span id="s2932">She only looks young and she’s the best of them all.</span> <span id="s2933">She can organize…” I don’t know what happened to the German.</span> <span id="s2934">He said yes for Reina.</span> <span id="s2935">She brought her in.</span> <span id="s2936">She was the 21st, that never happened before.</span> <span id="s2937">I don’t know whether it was pure luck or whether it was Fela who did that for us, or whether it was Yolichka (ph) that did it for us, or whether the German just felt sorry for whatever reason.</span> <span id="s2938">We were transported to a new life.</span> <span id="s2939">First of all, when we came there, this department wasn’t for Jews.</span> <span id="s2940">So, everyone - although we slept, I don’t know, ten in one room, but we had - we had cots for separate, like, it was also three “floors” I call it, but they were single.</span> <span id="s2941">They were single, and they had sheets and everything, like no appels, can you imagine?</span> <span id="s2942">No - I didn’t tell you a story about appels before.</span> <span id="s2943">No appels of any kind because there was only 20 of us, and some of the Polish girls, they left a few Polish girls to teach us how to do the work.</span> <span id="s2944">Some of them, we found out after the war, they were Jewish but they were on Polish papers - some of them.</span> <span id="s2945">With one, Krysia is in contact with one Polish girl she’s in contact with lived - that worked there.</span> <span id="s2946">That was the best job we could get.</span> <span id="s2947">The Polish girls were coming.</span> <span id="s2948">They gave us the stuff.</span> <span id="s2949">In their presence, we wrote down everything they had.</span> <span id="s2950">We put it in a sack.</span> <span id="s2951">The sack was hanging there with their number.</span> <span id="s2952">And, when they were going out, we had to wash and iron their stuff, but we - we weren’t there long enough to wash and iron, but we were taught to do that.</span> <span id="s2953">So, it was the best job.</span> <span id="s2954">There was 21 girls that had - I mean, we weren’t there too long because we went there maybe in November and in January we were transported somewhere else, but I didn’t believe it’s Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2955">It was the best job and I said now that we were so lucky, because can you imagine, there was so many of us, and we were lucky, the three of us, that we got this job in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2956">I mean, it was the best possible because it wasn’t meant for Jews.</span> <span id="s2957">It just happened that they needed - they didn’t want Polish girls doing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2958">Q: I gather this was a shock to you that there would be protective kommandos in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2959">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2960">Q: In certain places, there would be no selections.</span> <span id="s2961">A: No…</span></p> <p><span id="s2962">Q: Because there was no selection in…</span></p> <p><span id="s2963">A: Not with us.</span> <span id="s2964">We had to stand appel every morning, four o’clock, five o’clock.</span> <span id="s2965">It was dark when we out for appel in Auschwitz, in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s2966">But in here, we didn’t have to do it because, when they brought - like, we had to work at any time they brought the - when they arrived.</span> <span id="s2967">When they arrived, we had to take their stuff away.</span> <span id="s2968">They went to sauna, because there were the saunas were.</span> <span id="s2969">As a matter of fact, as a matter of fact, I reminded myself now, that from camp, people were coming and you know what we were doing for them, like when they were coming for - to the saunas?</span> <span id="s2970">We took, like for drinking water we had such - it wasn’t a pail, it was such a thing with a spout - so, we would steal from the Polish - from the Polish bags or suitcases or whatever a pair of underwear, a brassiere, because, you know, whatever we could put.</span> <span id="s2971">We went for water, nobody asked us anything.</span> <span id="s2972">We didn’t have any German people supervising us.</span> <span id="s2973">It was an easy job.</span> <span id="s2974">So, we went there for water, and then whatever we had in the pitcher - it was a big pitcher what we were getting drinking water from.</span> <span id="s2975">So, we would go there and distribute it to the Starachowice girls, and whoever wanted anything.</span> <span id="s2976">So, we would - whatever we could steal from the Polish girls we gave it to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2977">Q: Hania, do you recall where the Effektenkammer was in relationship to where the last barrack you were at was?</span> <span id="s2978">North of that?</span> <span id="s2979">It’s in Birkenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s2980">A: In Birkenau.</span> <span id="s2981">It was called - I know in Polish what it was called.</span> <span id="s2982">Q: Say it in Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2983">A: Rozowy effekt.</span> <span id="s2984">Pink effekt because they were where the Jews where when they took all the clothes was it was called Kanada, and it was Red effekt, but they - we didn’t work in this department.</span> <span id="s2985">This was for specifically, not for gentile, but Polish people, you know, this one, from the - maybe it was another department there - but after the uprising in Warsaw by the Polish people, very many were arrested.</span> <span id="s2986">So, that was - it was called Rozowy effekt, which means Pink effekt, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s2987">The other was called Red effekt, and it was called Kanada.</span> <span id="s2988">I don’t know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s2989">Q: And it was near the saunas.</span></p> <p><span id="s2990">A: The sauna was there because, I remember, at first I didn’t remember where we were going, but I remembered that those people were coming.</span> <span id="s2991">I remember ’s sister, she wanted a powder box.</span> <span id="s2992">I said, “Where would I find a powder box?”</span></p> <p><span id="s2993">Q: A powder box?</span></p> <p><span id="s2994">A: Well, she wanted such a box to put powder in, with powder.</span> <span id="s2995">But, you know, it was strange but I mean, when you are in camp and you think that they could get anything, maybe just to look at it.</span> <span id="s2996">But that was the best job we had, because we didn’t have to stand appel.</span> <span id="s2997">We had enough food because there was only 20 of us.</span> <span id="s2998">The Polish girls that were there were getting parcels from home, and I remember they had onions, and the parents were sending them stuff, food that was called like very nutritious, because we didn’t get any apples or pears or anything.</span> <span id="s2999">So, when the parents would send, and the Polish girls were allowed to get parcels from home, and this girl Ioasha (ph) who is still alive and Krysia with her in contact all the time, she found her when they went to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s3000">When she got a parcel, she always shared it with us.</span> <span id="s3001">So, we weren’t - in addition to the bread and the soup that we were getting, in this camp - we weren’t there too long, in this barrack - but we were there all I say from the end of November until January the 18th, a couple of months, because we arrived in Auschwitz in July, and so we were there July, August, September, October, November - five months.</span> <span id="s3002">I said three months - five months in Auschwitz where we did the bulrushes, and then the two and a half months in this place or two months.</span></p> <p><span id="s3003">Q: So, did this bring back strength to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3004">A: Yes, it did, because we didn’t see any Germans, like, there was only the supervisor and the supervisor was the Polish girl who was really Jewish, but there she was nobody.</span> <span id="s3005">She had a Polish name.</span> <span id="s3006">She, as a matter of fact, she wrote a book about Auschwitz and she told - in the book she says her name was Landau, but there was Jevulska (ph).</span> <span id="s3007">She had a Polish name.</span> <span id="s3008">She was from - because there was just a few Polish girls that were supervisors because before that there were other girls, but as I said, after the Warsaw uprising, they wanted Jews there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3009">Q: Does Renia get better, as far as you’re concerned?</span> <span id="s3010">Does she actually work?</span></p> <p><span id="s3011">A: She worked.</span> <span id="s3012">She worked very - she was so efficient, believe me.</span> <span id="s3013">Renia did the same job as we did, because once she got there, she was treated - nobody bothered with her.</span> <span id="s3014">She worked very well.</span> <span id="s3015">As a matter of fact, she was a very good worker.</span> <span id="s3016">She was one of the best.</span></p> <p><span id="s3017">Q: So, did she - did you see her start getting stronger at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s3018">A: She was always a physical weakling.</span> <span id="s3019">She was never very strong.</span> <span id="s3020">Ever since she was a child, she always was susceptible to different sicknesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s3021">Q: So, how did you find out that the camp was going to be evacuated?</span></p> <p><span id="s3022">A: We were told that, on the 18th of January, we are going west, because whatever it was, we knew that the Russians were very close.</span> <span id="s3023">As a matter of fact, we were told that the Russians were 70 kilometers from Auschwitz, and they were sending the people west to Bergen-Belsen and to all sorts of camps, but first we had to go through Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s3024">So, that was the death march because the trains - it was, the weather was very bad.</span> <span id="s3025">The trains didn’t go fast enough.</span> <span id="s3026">It was very cold on the 18th of March.</span> <span id="s3027">On the 18th of March, we left Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s3028">Q: No, the 18th of January.</span></p> <p><span id="s3029">A: Sorry, 18th of January.</span> <span id="s3030">I don’t know why I said March.</span> <span id="s3031">On the 18th of January, I said, it was snowing and blowing, on the 18th of January we went to Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s3032">I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s3033">We went to Ravensbrück, and the train was going slow, and part of it we were walking, and my shoes were all frozen.</span> <span id="s3034">I couldn’t put them on.</span> <span id="s3035">I had to put them in the car in the train.</span> <span id="s3036">I put - to wear my shoes to just be able to slip them on because they, you know, when I took them off to - for the night, I couldn’t open them.</span> <span id="s3037">And, then we…</span></p> <p><span id="s3038">Q: What kind of shoes did you have when you left the Effektenkammer?</span></p> <p><span id="s3039">A: Later, we got other shoes.</span> <span id="s3040">I’ll tell you, when we came to the - to the place where we worked with - the last place, we could pick up any shoes there and put my shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3041">Q: The Effektenkammer, you were able to choose shoes.</span> <span id="s3042">A: Yeah, that’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s3043">Q: But, let me ask you something, you had begun to describe that on the death march, you began to fall asleep, but Renia also describes that she thinks for the whole time, until you got on the train, she was sleeping.</span></p> <p><span id="s3044">A: That’s possible, too, because I remember that if not my sisters - I couldn’t walk.</span> <span id="s3045">I was dragging my feet and I saw pictures that didn’t exist.</span> <span id="s3046">I saw horses and people, maybe I had a bad - a bad vision there, but I couldn’t have had, because I started so long I was working, always was working like this.</span> <span id="s3047">So, I saw things that didn’t exist.</span> <span id="s3048">And, if my sisters wouldn’t have kept me, I don’t think I would have survived.</span> <span id="s3049">Maybe Renia had , or maybe I woke up a little and we carried Renia.</span> <span id="s3050">That was the - then you saw so many dead people because the Germans were pushing us to go west with their dogs, and whoever couldn’t go, they would just shooting, like they couldn’t - and, you saw those people.</span> <span id="s3051">One person was sitting under a tree - was sitting there.</span> <span id="s3052">He was dead, and you know, what the worst part was that the people that were walking were taking the shoes and the - when they saw a dead person, quickly they would get the jacket or whatever they could grab.</span> <span id="s3053">Nobody worried about it - what shoes or whatever they could get quickly so the Germans wouldn’t send the dogs after them, and they walked - we just disregarded all the - the dead people.</span> <span id="s3054">But to me, the man that was sitting under the tree, he looked so real and so alive and he was dead.</span> <span id="s3055">Maybe, he just sat down to die.</span> <span id="s3056">Then, we came to Ravensbrück, I don’t know, three days later, two days later.</span> <span id="s3057">I don’t know exactly what date it was, and there was no room for us in the barracks, and it was freezing and it was snowing, so we had to stay outside - sleep outside.</span> <span id="s3058">So, we slept in the snow together, like we just warmed each other from the bodies, you know, with our bodies, we just warmed each other, and slept in the snow.</span> <span id="s3059">Then, in the morning, we didn’t get anything to eat.</span> <span id="s3060">So, we took this dirty snow - most of the times, we took the snow from trees or something - and we drank it and ate it.</span> <span id="s3061">For three days, we had no meat - because they didn’t have any room.</span> <span id="s3062">From every side the people were sent to Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s3063">They didn’t have - they didn’t even register us.</span> <span id="s3064">They didn’t even write our names.</span> <span id="s3065">So, after three days, they send us to a camp called Retzow, which was…</span></p> <p><span id="s3066">Q: Wait a second - isn’t it the case that somebody asked for your names and you decided you weren’t - one of you decided that you were not going to say a Jewish name.</span></p> <p><span id="s3067">A: No, that was…</span></p> <p><span id="s3068">Q: You said “Gorska.”</span> <span id="s3069">Or is that only in Retzow.</span></p> <p><span id="s3070">A: I think it was in Retzow.</span> <span id="s3071">I’ll tell you in a minute how it was, but I have to remind myself whether it was in Ravens - no, it was - we were there three days, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s3072">I thought that they didn’t register us, only in Retzow.</span> <span id="s3073">But I will tell you this story.</span> <span id="s3074">Now, I get confused.</span> <span id="s3075">I would have to ask them.</span> <span id="s3076">When we stood in line to be registered, I think it was in Retzow, but I could be wrong, maybe they did register us and that was in Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s3077">We decided, like I told my sisters that if the Germans - the Russians were 70 kilometers from Auschwitz, and sound away (ph) fire in Auschwitz, like before we were moved, we were taken on the death march there to Ravensbrück, we saw fire.</span> <span id="s3078">And somebody told us that they are burning all the records.</span> <span id="s3079">You know, and I believed it was true, because the Russians were so close, they didn’t want to have the records.</span> <span id="s3080">So, we said - I said to my sisters, “We can save our lives by pretending we are Polish.”</span> <span id="s3081">So, Chris had a boyfriend; his name was Kleinburg.</span> <span id="s3082">Kleinburg is a small mountain, you know, that’s what it means in German, like, if you translate it.</span> <span id="s3083">So, she translated it into Polish: mala gorska.</span> <span id="s3084">I said, “That’s too long.</span> <span id="s3085">Who is going to...?</span> <span id="s3086">Let’s eliminate the ‘mala’ and we’ll have the ‘gorsky’, ‘gorska’.”</span> <span id="s3087">So, we had to remember, what was the mother’s name.</span> <span id="s3088">So, my mother’s name was Pola Blum - Tannenblum, but they were called Blum.</span> <span id="s3089">So, I said, in Polish, a blum is a flower, it’s like fiatek, so Fiatekosky, because if it was fiatek, you couldn’t say fiatek.</span> <span id="s3090">What was your father’s name?</span> <span id="s3091">So, we said “Gorsky” because our name was Gorsky, and the first name, his name was Isaac, so we said “Anje” because Anje was such a typical peasant Polish name.</span> <span id="s3092">So, we gave this name to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s3093">Then if they asked us any other questions, we have to remember that we are Polish; we are never Jewish.</span> <span id="s3094">And of course, when we registered, we got the red, the red triangles.</span> <span id="s3095">That means political prisoners, so, you know.</span> <span id="s3096">And immediately, when we arrived, I met some people that I knew, and they didn’t want to talk to me because they had the yellow - we call it winkle (ph) - yellow triangle and we had the red one, and they didn’t want to cause any problems for us that are Jewish and we are Polish, so they didn’t talk to us, but later we told them not to worry about it.</span> <span id="s3097">When we arrived in Retzow - this is very, not a very interesting, but that’s again a personal story.</span></p> <p><span id="s3098">Q: Let’s pause for a moment because I think we only have a little bit of time left.</span> <span id="s3099">End of Tape #11</span></p> <p><span id="s3100">Tape #12</span></p> <p><span id="s3101">Q: We’re in Retzow.</span> <span id="s3102">What’s happening in Retzow?</span></p> <p><span id="s3103">A: So, we arrived in Retzow, I think we registered there, and then we lined up for work.</span> <span id="s3104">So, the man in charge - I don’t know his name, but I know his title.</span> <span id="s3105">It’s a mouthful: Haupstunshauführer (ph), and he had - there was a barrack, the German barrack where they worked, and it was this Haupstunshauführer (ph) and then they were kapos, women, and then they were guards in the camp.</span> <span id="s3106">What we did there was when we arrived there, he lined us up for work.</span> <span id="s3107">He needed about, I would say, 12 people I think or so to clean the German barracks.</span> <span id="s3108">Some people were going out to work.</span> <span id="s3109">I don’t know what they did because we were either too short and I wasn’t working outside.</span> <span id="s3110">So, first of all, the cook came in and he picked Krysia.</span> <span id="s3111">That was the biggest, you know, as if she won the lottery because - because if she is going to work in the kitchens, we would have what to eat because we just come from a place where we didn’t eat for three days, and from Auschwitz where the food was so scarce that we were fainting most of the times.</span> <span id="s3112">So, Krysia got the job in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s3113">Then, they started picking people to clean the barracks.</span> <span id="s3114">The Germans - those were the best jobs, don’t misunderstand me, the best jobs.</span> <span id="s3115">So, anyway, he picked me first, and he started picking people and Renia got also in this group.</span> <span id="s3116">So, then he showed where we are going to live and so on, and then he showed - he told us where we are going to work.</span> <span id="s3117">So, he picked me to work in his office.</span> <span id="s3118">So, I figured, what am I going to do here in the office.</span> <span id="s3119">I - I thought I’m going to be a secretary or something.</span> <span id="s3120">So, he comes in and he tells me - he asks me, “Kannst du putzen?”</span> <span id="s3121">“Do you know how to clean?”</span> <span id="s3122">I think myself, “Of course I know - that’s the best job I could get to clean those barracks.”</span> <span id="s3123">So, I said, like, but then I see, there is his desk with all the papers and the radio is playing.</span> <span id="s3124">I think if I’m going to play smart, I won’t get this job, because, you know, I have to be dumb to know how to clean the floors.</span> <span id="s3125">So, I decided that I’m not going to tell him that I know German.</span> <span id="s3126">I don’t know why, but at that moment, my mind started working, and I figured to clean the floors, you don’t need to be intelligent, just be as dumb as you can.</span> <span id="s3127">So, he says, “Can you…” I’ll speak English.</span> <span id="s3128">“Can you speak German?”</span> <span id="s3129">So, I said [so-so gesture with hand].</span> <span id="s3130">And he said to me, “And how about - what do you speak?”</span> <span id="s3131">So, I said, “Polish.”</span> <span id="s3132">Polish he couldn’t speak.</span> <span id="s3133">So, he says to me, “So what can you do?”</span> <span id="s3134">So, I said, “Putzen.”</span> <span id="s3135">I mean, he told me already that I’m going to clean.</span> <span id="s3136">So, that’s what - I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s3137">I never did the - I never cleaned a floor in the house, in my house, never touched it.</span> <span id="s3138">So, then he says to me, “When you clean, I don’t want you to touch anything on my - on my desk because this is all private.</span> <span id="s3139">I don’t want - if you want to - from time to time, I’ll clean it, and you will be able to clean.</span> <span id="s3140">All I want is to clean around, to clean the floor, but don’t touch it, and don’t touch my radio.”</span> <span id="s3141">So…</span></p> <p><span id="s3142">Q: Now, he’s saying this to you in German.</span> <span id="s3143">A: In German.</span></p> <p><span id="s3144">Q: In simple German?</span></p> <p><span id="s3145">A: I pretend that - the way he shows me around, I pretend that I only understand a little bit.</span> <span id="s3146">So, then he sees that I’m - I always - since I walked in, I decided that I’ll play dumb.</span> <span id="s3147">So, then he says, he looks at me, he tells me, he shows me how to do this, how to do this, okay.</span> <span id="s3148">Then, he says not to touch those - I mean, he was showing me because he knew that I could only speak a little - then he says, “Can you read?”</span> <span id="s3149">So, I look at him.</span> <span id="s3150">I pretend that I don’t understand and I says [shakes head].</span> <span id="s3151">“And write?”</span> <span id="s3152">So, I says, again a listened.</span> <span id="s3153">I pretend, so he shows me.</span> <span id="s3154">I said [shakes head].</span> <span id="s3155">So, he said - I remember - Krysia will tell everybody my “So gross ker faxen so dum”.</span> <span id="s3156">Do you understand this?</span> <span id="s3157">She’s “So gross ker faxen” means “She grew so tall and she’s so dumb.”</span> <span id="s3158">You know, like that’s what he said.</span> <span id="s3159">I wanted to laugh, but I really, believe me I was telling myself that I was the most clever girl.</span> <span id="s3160">I got the best job.</span> <span id="s3161">I got the cleaning.</span> <span id="s3162">So, I was reading all his - since I didn’t know German well enough.</span> <span id="s3163">So, he didn’t clean the desk.</span> <span id="s3164">He was leaving the papers.</span> <span id="s3165">I read all the papers because, if I was very careful, I could just pretend that I’m cleaning the table and read the papers.</span> <span id="s3166">I listened to the German broadcast, because the radio was on.</span> <span id="s3167">I couldn’t understand, so he was - he got himself the best cleaner.</span> <span id="s3168">We weren’t there too long, but during that time…</span></p> <p><span id="s3169">Q: What did you hear and what did you read?</span></p> <p><span id="s3170">A: That’s what it is - I read all the orders.</span> <span id="s3171">I knew that the war is being lost.</span> <span id="s3172">I knew - I read all those - the letters that he gathered.</span> <span id="s3173">That’s how we ran away.</span> <span id="s3174">Renia was cleaning another room.</span> <span id="s3175">I would go back to Krysia - how she fed us.</span> <span id="s3176">She was marvelous, but I’ll go back to this portion.</span> <span id="s3177">I’ll just talk now about this situation here.</span> <span id="s3178">So, I read everything and then, the Russians were already so close that he got orders that on such and such a date to let everybody go except the guards, because they weren’t sending the Jews anymore to work, because they had to go out of the camp.</span> <span id="s3179">So, that - we had the - like, we were Poles, but we took off our triangles because then the people that work outside had white crosses across the back with the paint.</span> <span id="s3180">Like, whatever - if you worked outside, you had the white cross painted like this right across the back.</span> <span id="s3181">So, Krysia and I, we came to a conclusion that she works in the kitchen, she gets some flour and water, and she’ll be able to make the crosses, new crosses, on our clothes, because we - we had clothes there.</span> <span id="s3182">We were also distributed some clothes for us because it was a small camp.</span> <span id="s3183">It wasn’t a big camp.</span> <span id="s3184">We were all girls.</span> <span id="s3185">And this, we decided that we are going to run away, but we had to have a strategy.</span> <span id="s3186">We had a Jewish girl from Lublin.</span> <span id="s3187">She was blonde and had blue eyes, and she spoke perfect German.</span> <span id="s3188">She was one of us working in the barracks because there were either ten or twelve of us working the barracks.</span> <span id="s3189">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s3190">Since she could speak so well German, we decided that she’s going to steal the kapo’s - you know, kapos were wearing a black cape, a black cape what covered whatever - they didn’t wear uniforms, just a black cape with a hood.</span> <span id="s3191">So, she stole this hood from her, and then Krysia - we decided that what we can do to take the crosses off, all we had to do is this, is to just crumbled the - like we had to wear the crosses inside, but in order to get outside, to run away from camp - I knew exactly because my boss didn’t come to work that day.</span> <span id="s3192">I don’t know whether he came later or so, because it was ten days before the end of the war - ten or twelve days before the end of the war.</span> <span id="s3193">So, in the morning, we got up this Helena was her name - she put on the cape, we made sure that there was no sign of the cross, and she - we came to the gate.</span> <span id="s3194">She told the post that she registers with him ten people going to work outside, whatever - she knew what to say, where outside, and he says - he showed us to go.</span> <span id="s3195">We went to the road, and all - from there on, we didn’t have to worry because all the Germans were running towards west.</span> <span id="s3196">They were afraid.</span> <span id="s3197">The Russians were very close, so the Germans were leaving their homes and everything marching, running away from the Russians.</span> <span id="s3198">They were afraid.</span> <span id="s3199">So, we were in the group.</span> <span id="s3200">Nobody noticed us.</span></p> <p><span id="s3201">Nobody bothered us, but we didn’t have what to eat and we didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s3202">But, we run away.</span> <span id="s3203">We’re out of the camp.</span> <span id="s3204">As a matter of fact, one girl from Radom that I suggested that she goes with us, she didn’t want to go because she had - somebody gave her spreads - some sardines, a box of sardines.</span> <span id="s3205">She had it with someone.</span> <span id="s3206">She didn’t want to leave it, or she didn’t - she didn’t want to give it to her, and she didn’t want - because she wanted to eat it, she didn’t want to run away.</span> <span id="s3207">So, they went to another camp from there, you know, after - the Russians were - they must have gotten orders to go more west, but we were already free.</span> <span id="s3208">So, we - that was it.</span> <span id="s3209">Those were the camps.</span> <span id="s3210">Now, Krysia - she worked in the kitchen so, she stuck, you know, she cooked and she - she was sending to us - she was working on the second floor and so, we - we used to go under - stand under the kitchen and have our metal thing with the handle.</span> <span id="s3211">She would push down a string.</span> <span id="s3212">We would put the string on the handle.</span> <span id="s3213">She roped it, and she would take - because there was meat, like horse meat, but we didn’t get it; the Germans - the Germans got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3214">We only got the soup.</span> <span id="s3215">So, she would take a tongue or whatever, you know, she had there a big piece - a big piece of meat she would send it back.</span> <span id="s3216">We would take it and divide among all the girls.</span> <span id="s3217">So, everybody had something, not only something to eat, but we were not used to such - so rich food.</span> <span id="s3218">It was tremendous.</span> <span id="s3219">One day she tells me this story.</span> <span id="s3220">She worked there.</span> <span id="s3221">She stole a pound of butter.</span> <span id="s3222">It was, you know, one of those pounds in foil, and she says she didn’t know what to do with it because, I mean, the Germans was - her boss, the German cook, was watching her.</span> <span id="s3223">So, she put it in her pants so that she could take the butter to take to us, and when she started working and cleaning up, the butter started dripping, and she got so scared she almost died.</span> <span id="s3224">She - but anyway, she managed somehow to bring the butter - the butter to feed us.</span> <span id="s3225">So, we really in Retzow we didn’t have a bad day, because she was supplying all the food.</span> <span id="s3226">She was stealing it, but she was supplying all the food and nobody - all the girls that knew, they noticed that I went out to get whatever, they were already waiting.</span> <span id="s3227">I mean everybody was hungry.</span> <span id="s3228">So, that was also lucky.</span> <span id="s3229">We were lucky there.</span> <span id="s3230">But, this is all about Retzow.</span> <span id="s3231">There’s very - we don’t have much to say about it because we weren’t there too long.</span></p> <p><span id="s3232">Q: Did you feel liberated when you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s3233">A: Right away.</span> <span id="s3234">Right away.</span> <span id="s3235">We walked with the Germans.</span> <span id="s3236">We went that way, but we decided to…</span></p> <p><span id="s3237">Q: One second.</span> <span id="s3238">I was asking you did you feel liberated when you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s3239">A: We did.</span> <span id="s3240">We did, but we were far away from home.</span> <span id="s3241">We didn’t know where we were going.</span> <span id="s3242">We decided to - we decided to stop going west because we were going - by going west we’re getting too far away from home, and we - and we - we heard already Russians speaking.</span> <span id="s3243">So, we decided to get off the road, and just managed to go back - to walk back, but we were afraid because this way where we were going west, nobody could - nobody was suspecting us of running away from camp.</span> <span id="s3244">We’re running away to the west where all the Germans, you know, with all their possible treasures that they had.</span> <span id="s3245">They had horse and wagons and stuff like that, and they were all going west running away from the Russians, but then at one point, we decided, all ten of us, we had one Russian girl, not Jewish, with us, too.</span> <span id="s3246">Most of the girls were Jewish.</span> <span id="s3247">Helena was also Jewish, but she didn’t look it.</span> <span id="s3248">She spoke perfect German.</span> <span id="s3249">She could get away with being German just in case if something would happen, and we got off the road and we started going through this forest.</span> <span id="s3250">We started going back home.</span> <span id="s3251">Back home!</span> <span id="s3252">We were far away from home, but back to the east.</span></p> <p><span id="s3253">Q: I’ll tell you what.</span> <span id="s3254">I think that we’ve spent a very, very long day today, and I think that we should just plan at some point that we continue this.</span> <span id="s3255">That is enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s3256">A: That would be great.</span> <span id="s3257">Thank you.</span> <span id="s3258">Q: And I really thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3259">A: I thank you very much.</span> <span id="s3260">I really thank you for your consideration and for being so delicate with me, because I was always afraid of this - not afraid for, I was always - I felt that my body, I mean, I’m not healthy enough to take - to think about Holocaust for so many, you know, hours at times because ’til now I was not successful in not suffering afterwards, but really it was so nice of you.</span> <span id="s3261">I feel good, and I’m glad I give you this interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s3262">Q: I’m very grateful.</span> <span id="s3263">A: And to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3264">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3265">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3266">Q: Okay, you can start Hania.</span> <span id="s3267">Who are these people?</span> <span id="s3268">[picture shown]</span></p> <p><span id="s3269">A: On the right side is my Aunt Drachela (ph) with above is her husband and on the left side is my mother Pola, and I am in the middle.</span></p> <p><span id="s3270">Q: And the husband’s name is what?</span></p> <p><span id="s3271">A: Carmenson.</span> <span id="s3272">I don’t remember his first name.</span></p> <p><span id="s3273">Q: So, we’re now going slowly into the photograph, and you are about how old?</span> <span id="s3274">Does anybody know?</span></p> <p><span id="s3275">A: I have no idea.</span> <span id="s3276">A baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s3277">Q: You look like you’re one or two.</span></p> <p><span id="s3278">A: Maybe, maybe as much.</span> <span id="s3279">I really don’t -
