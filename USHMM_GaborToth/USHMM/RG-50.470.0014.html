mean, even though we were out in the field, we did everything we could for them, and we were kind to them.</span> <span id="s23">But here we go in this place where these people have been abused.</span> <span id="s24">And they didn't have medical care, they didn't have anything.</span> <span id="s25">And it was a real sharp contrast.</span> <span id="s26">While we didn't have the best of equipment, we had the best that we could have out in the field hospital.</span> <span id="s27">But they were fed and we took good care of them, then we go someplace where people had no care at all, nobody cared for them, no one was interested in them, and they were just lying on concrete, some of them, with temperatures of 108.</span> <span id="s28">And they hadn't been fed.</span> <span id="s29">They had some wooden rolls about so big around with some soup in, and I noticed that particularly and the patients were too weak to reach over and get it.</span> <span id="s30">That was the only pretense that they made of feeding them.</span> <span id="s31">And uh, they were so thin.</span> <span id="s32">I couldn't pick any of them up, I tried to, but if I really picked them up I would tear the skin.</span> <span id="s33">So we had to be very very careful moving them out.</span> <span id="s34">The skin was just so terrible.</span> <span id="s35">So it would take, about, at least three people, one person take the head, one person take the legs, and very carefully lift them up and get them outside, go ahead and get them outside of that place.</span> <span id="s36">We put up tents outside, we had cots and clean bedding.</span> <span id="s37">So we'd take them out there.</span> <span id="s38">Or if there was a hospital nearby, we'd go and take over that hospital and move them in there.</span> <span id="s39">But, uh, we couldn't, for typhus, that was the main thing, there was no medication, just supportive treatment, and get fluids down them, well they couldn't drink anything, so we had to feed them with medicine droppers, and we couldn't give them hypos because there was no place to stick them.</span> <span id="s40">There was no skin at all, Working transcript:

was no place to give them a hypo.</span> <span id="s43">So, it was, I was just weak, I couldn't believe it happened.</span> <span id="s44">And then I was so afraid, I thought, what else are we gonna run into.</span> <span id="s45">Is this gonna go on?</span> <span id="s46">And then, later on, I think we were all just infuriated, and outraged at what had happened.</span> <span id="s47">But right in the beginning we were so afraid, first we didn't believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">SWB: How many-- What were the numbers like, that you were confronted with.</span> <span id="s49">How many of you were there and how many people were you trying to help?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">PAT LYNCH: Oh, see, those that were able to be moved, now they went to DP camps from the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s51">And if they were able to be moved, they hurried up and moved them over there, and I don't know what the DP camps were, whether they were buildings, or to me it sounded like they were camps, outdoors someplace.</span> <span id="s52">But nevertheless, they were much better than what they had.</span> <span id="s53">And so they moved those, and those that were really too sick to move, we had to find a building, or put a tent up outside.</span> <span id="s54">We had to get them out of the camps, it was too dirty in there.</span> <span id="s55">And so we put tents up, and we knew how to run a hospital under tents because that's what we'd been doing.</span> <span id="s56">The evacuation hospital that I was with was all tents.</span> <span id="s57">Even surgery.</span> <span id="s58">So we knew how to run a hospital under tents.</span> <span id="s59">So we put the up, put tents outside and got clean bedding for them, and they were bathed, and took care of them there, until we could move them someplace else.</span> <span id="s60">But mainly to get them out of those buildings, they were just terrible.</span> <span id="s61">They were infested with mites, and oh, just awful.</span> <span id="s62">If they didn't have typhus, well they'd get it if they didn't get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Working transcript: not spell checked or verified

id="s66">PAT LYNCH: Oh we had, I'd had training in communicable diseases, that's what I did, and that's one reason they sent me there.</span> <span id="s67">Because I'd had some training in communicable diseases.</span> <span id="s68">We had DDT powder that we used, and it was in a thing that looks like an old flint gun, you know, they used to spray flies, we had a canister with a pump on it, so we put the powder and then we would stick it down our slacks and socks and under our arms, and get inside of our fatigues.</span> <span id="s69">I don't know what we did about our hair.</span> <span id="s70">That's one thing I've been trying to figure out how did we, we must have dusted some kind of a cap, and then put that on, or maybe we had a, we may have tied it up with a cloth, dusted the cloth and then tied our hair up, because if the mite would get on us, we'd get it too.</span> <span id="s71">So, that's about the only thing that we did, that I remember, and try to get as much rest as we could, of course that wasn't very easy because we'd been working sixteen hours a day, but keep well rested.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Our food wasn't very good.</span> <span id="s73">It was K rations and C rations, no fresh fruit, no milk.</span> <span id="s74">No fresh potatoes, no vegetables.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Everything was powdered.</span> <span id="s76">I never had any fruit all the time I was there, no milk.</span> <span id="s77">But anyway we managed to stay healthy.</span> <span id="s78">Where these people hadn't had anything to eat except bread crusts and coffee grounds.</span> <span id="s79">Our general health was good, our resistance was good, so that's probably what kept us from getting it.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">SWB: Were things well organized, or was it pretty chaotic, and how did you see light at the end of the tunnel, or did</span></p> <p><span id="s81">you ever?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">PAT LYNCH: I thought that when

Page 5 pretty well organized, because all the leaders came forth, among the people in the camps, the survivors, the leaders all came forth and helped out.</span> <span id="s85">See, we didn't get there first, the American soldiers got there first, so the soldiers and the people in the camps started running the camps, and I thought they did pretty well.</span> <span id="s86">And then they recruited German people to do the laundry, to do the cooking, to clean, and do all sorts of things.</span> <span id="s87">So, pretty soon it was, things were going pretty well.</span> <span id="s88">It was a matter of just taking care of these desperately ill patients.</span> <span id="s89">And then we started getting better supplies.</span> <span id="s90">Also, after we took over a town, after the infantry or tank corps got in there, they'd go to the burgermeister of the town and tell him what we needed.</span> <span id="s91">So they just, said we need so many beds and need so much clean linen, we brought what we had, what we could spare from our hospital, but we did tell him what we want, and they'd hurry up and find it.</span> <span id="s92">So, in that way, it wasn't too bad.</span> <span id="s93">It was primitive, but we got by, I'll</span></p> <p><span id="s94">say.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">SWB: What was the attitude of the Germans that helped?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">PAT LYNCH: They hung on to us and hugged us like they thought we were gonna go away.</span> <span id="s97">Oh, the German people, oh not this, excuse me, oh, they were very submissive for the most part.</span> <span id="s98">They were very cooperative.</span> <span id="s99">And then the burgermeister would send whatever we wanted, if he possibly could find it, of course [???????]</span> <span id="s100">with the German efficiency, go find it, get what we need.</span> <span id="s101">But as far as the survivors were concerned, they just hung to us, those that could, many of them were too weak, they couldn't lift their arms up.</span> <span id="s102">They hung on to us and grabbed our clothes for fear we're gonna leave.</span> <span id="s103">But, no, the people

over, and we had taken the survivors in there.</span> <span id="s107">And she was a little abrupt.</span> <span id="s108">She's a good nurse, German nurse, but she was abrupt, and she would, I'd hear her talking to the patients, she'd say 'Swallow that,' 'Drink that,' kind of barking at them so I took her aside and told her she'd have to be more caring.</span> <span id="s109">I said, you can't talk to these peo-, those people that way.</span> <span id="s110">Well, she didn't like me very well, so every time she went by me she'd give me a dirty look.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Otherwise, I got along fine.</span> <span id="s112">There was another nurse there, her name was Margaret, and I got along fine with her.</span> <span id="s113">She was a little bit older.</span> <span id="s114">The people we had the trouble with were the Hitler youth, the young ones.</span> <span id="s115">They were starting up again.</span> <span id="s116">And some of our officers and our men found them out in a cemetery, starting up all over again, marching around, Heil Hitler, so, I don't know what they did, and I guess they call the MP's and told them to take them on home.</span></p>

they were afraid and they had to go along with him or they'd have been killed.</span> <span id="s120">But the Hitler youth, they were very bold, and I think they, I was really afraid of

armed, we had to find somebody if we wanted to go to another little town if we wanted to visit a friend or something, we had to find an armed escort to go with us, but I was always afraid of that Hitler youth group, because I don't think they'd stop at anything.</span> <span id="s125">And they were having a demonstrations at night, they'd find them in cemeteries and places.</span> <span

They just didn't say too much of anything.</span> <span id="s137">They just went about their work.</span> <span id="s138">But I'm sure they knew what was going on, they were probably in there

they were going to the, some that were going to the DP camps, I remember one group going, and uh, we did all sorts of things for them that day, I helped one man, or maybe several, their feet were just cut up something terrible.</span> <span id="s154">They wore wooden shoes, so I bandaged them all up and put socks on them, and all other things.</span> <span id="s155">They had sore throatsand

the Americans were coming pretty soon.</span> <span id="s211">They were figured that out.</span> <span id="s212">So they just took off to the villages.</span> <span id="s213">Well then the survivors

there's any way that they had any flesh at all under the skin, we'd inject water, they call it hyperdemoclasis, sometimes in the shoulder there'd be a little fatty tissue there, muscle, then we'd inject some water into them because they were all dehydrated.</span> <span id="s258">And uh, trying to feed them, and uh, did I tell you about the men, those people whose feet were so terribly bad, they were all but up, they wore wooden shoes and no stockings, well there were a lot of people whose feet were just terrible, so we took care of those.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">And uh, oh, and

candy bars and they got very sick.</span> <span id="s277">They just couldn't handle the sugar.</span> <span id="s278">I had just heard about after I went over two years ago, how they gave them candy

our hospital, and uh, I thought that they looked much better, they looked like they'd been eating and put on a little bit of weight.</span> <span id="s307">Well I remember going back to Rhine, the first camp I was in, and we put patients, I think there must have been a staff room where the soldiers lived, or, I don't know, a dining room or, we put a lot of them down there and set up a hospital.</span> <span id="s308">And went I went back two or there months later they looked so much different, you wouldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s309">They had changed a lot.</span> <span id="s310">By that time, they were eating and their color was good, and they were laughing, and, they were too sick to be out of bed, they'd had, had typhus and they were much too sick, but, they</span></p> <p><span id="s311">looked much different.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">SWB: So you saw a huge change in those months between March</span></p> <p><span id="s313">and say

<span id="s329">We had a pretty strict rule on that.</span> <span id="s330">Because if, our chief nurse said if we got sick, well then we'd be no value to her, we'd just, be, more or less of a burden on her, so she expect, she wanted us to sleep eight hours in 24, not to just stay on duty 24 hours a day but sometimes we stayed longer than that.</span> <span id="s331">That's the only thing I was ever reprimanded for.</span> <span id="s332">She came around one morning and said how, she goes to me and says, how come.</span> <span id="s333">And I said I just can't leave, it was too much work to do.</span> <span id="s334">And she says well you'll have to leave, she says I'll stay here, and I said, well I haven't charted things, I've got to get these things charted, the patients have a little envelope with a card on them, and we put, it wasn't a chart like in the hospital, we just jotted down when they'd had penicillin and morphine and whatever.</span> <span id="s335">And she says, well I'll take care of that.</span> <span id="s336">But you have got to go.</span> <span id="s337">So that's the only time I was ever reprimanded for anything.</span> <span id="s338">Staying on duty too long.</span> <span id="s339">Nobody wanted to go, actually, that was hard.</span> <span id="s340">They didn't, if there was work to do they didn't want to leave, under stress people always work much harder.</span> <span id="s341">And uh, they didn't want to go off duty, they could see too many things to be done.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for
