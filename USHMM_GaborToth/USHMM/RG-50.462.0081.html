And so we have very little contact with the secular world.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">SS: Well, in what way did, was it through the bakery that you had contact?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">JF: No, through school.</span> <span id="s49">I went to public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">SS: Oh, you went to public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">JF: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">SS: Were the schools Catholic?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">JF: No, just a public school.</span> <span id="s54">There were people of many faiths.</span> <span id="s55">And neighbors, and my parents friends.</span> <span id="s56">Some were Jewish, some were not.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">SS: I see.</span> <span id="s58">And did you ha--how were your relations with them?</span> <span id="s59">Did you feel...</span></p> <p><span id="s60">JF: Fine, never felt anything different.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">SS: [unclear] as a child...</span></p> <p><span id="s62">JF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">SS: [unclear] to get [unclear]?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">JF: No.</span> <span id="s65">They did not treat me any differently than anybody else.</span> <span id="s66">Until, 1944...</span></p> <p><span id="s67">SS: Oh I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">JF: When the Nazis occupied my hometown.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">SS: Oh.</span> <span id="s70">[unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s71">JF: Germany occupied Czechoslovakia and Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">SS: All right, now, how did they come in?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">JF: In March of 1944, German troops occupied my city, as they occupied all of Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">SS: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">JF: They just simply took over.</span> <span id="s76">Until then, the Germans and Hungarians were allies.</span> <span id="s77">And for some reason that I cannot understand, they did not take away the Hungarian Jews from their homes, until 1944, which was extremely late in the scheme of things, of the Final Solution.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">SS: Yes, now how, yes.</span> <span id="s79">The, how, did they, how did they act when the Nazis came in?</span> <span id="s80">What did they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">JF: When the German armies came in, immediately they declared various laws and requirements, such as...</span></p> <p><span id="s82">SS: Do you remember what some of the laws were?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">JF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">SS: Could you tell me?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">JF: Wearing the yellow star, immediately, on our outer clothing.</span> <span id="s86">Every man, woman and child was to wear a yellow star.</span> <span id="s87">They enforced a curfew.</span> <span id="s88">They came out with a ruling that all Jewish families must submit all their valuables to Nazi or military headquarters.</span> <span id="s89">And I remember my mother packing the silverware and some jewelry, and valuables, paintings, or pictures, or whatever, and submitting it.</span> <span id="s90">And, we got a receipt for it, but of course we never got our possessions back.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">SS: Was there a Jewish Council in that town?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">JF: Yes.</span> <span id="s93">Yes.</span> <span id="s94">And they implemented these laws.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">SS: Oh.</span> <span id="s96">In other words, you turned it over to the Jewish Council?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">JF: No, we turned it in to the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">SS: You turned it...</span></p> <p><span id="s99">JF: And members of the Jewish Council were responsible for seeing that these laws are carried out.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">SS: And how did your lives change?</span> <span id="s101">Did they make you move from where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">JF: Our lives changed entirely.</span> <span id="s103">My entire life prior to March, 1944, was my former life, and after that it just all completely tumbled around me very quickly after these laws of the yellow star and as I was describing, they came out with a new law that told all Jewish families in our hometown that we must leave our homes.</span> <span id="s104">And we must, we will be taken, literally taken, by car, by truck, to a ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">SS: Oh.</span> <span id="s106">By truck.</span> <span id="s107">In your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">JF: This was on the edge of town.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">SS: On the edge of town.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">JF: They established two makeshift ghettos, one in a lumberyard, and one in a brick factory.</span> <span id="s111">And they assembled all the Jewish families at these assembly places, so that they would have everybody very easily together when the deportations began.</span> <span id="s112">But we didn't know about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">SS: No, of course not.</span> <span id="s114">Did you, how did you live in this ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">JF: In the ghetto we were...</span></p> <p><span id="s116">SS: Did they feed you, or, out of...</span></p> <p><span id="s117">JF: We were very, very crowded.</span> <span id="s118">We were allowed to take some personal items, such as clothing, and bedding, with us.</span> <span id="s119">We were housed in a kind of open shed, that had a roof but no sides.</span> <span id="s120">And I remember the rain pouring in one night when it was raining.</span> <span id="s121">We were very, very crowded.</span> <span id="s122">The beds were made on that, on the ground, and there was a communal kitchen set up.</span> <span id="s123">My father, being the baker, volunteered to work in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s124">He figured if he is near food, then he is liable to, he'd be in a position where he can help his family have some extra food.</span> <span id="s125">Nobody ever told us what will happen to us.</span> <span id="s126">Nobody ever told us where we are going to be taken to.</span> <span id="s127">We sort of sensed that this is only temporary.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">SS: You did sense?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">JF: Yes.</span> <span id="s130">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">SS: You had no contact with the outside world [unclear]?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">JF: No.</span> <span id="s133">We were totally closed off.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">SS: You didn't hear of any resistance [unclear]?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">JF: No.</span> <span id="s136">Not at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">SS: When you were living in your town, did you hear what was going on else where?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">JF: We heard that Jews are being persecuted very violently in Poland and in Slovakia and in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s139">But Hungary, like Germany, had a special kind of Jews that felt more patriotic to their country...</span></p> <p><span id="s140">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">JF: Towards the country than towards their own people and their own religion.</span> <span id="s142">We all felt that we're Hungarians.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">JF: And we were extremely patriotic.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">SS: This was a shock...</span></p> <p><span id="s146">JF: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">SS: When it came.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">JF: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">SS: O.K. The, well, the regular, while you were there, what was your daily routine in this ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">JF: Well, in the ghetto, being, by virtue of the fact that we were so very crowded, there was very little moving-about space, and we looked for people we knew.</span> <span id="s151">We tried to stay close to communicate with people we knew better than some others.</span> <span id="s152">The days just sort of passed one after the other.</span> <span id="s153">We were very frightened, because we realized that something different is to come, but we didn't know what.</span> <span id="s154">And nobody said anything about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">SS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">JF: There were rumors that circulated that said that people would, that we would be resettled in the east.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">SS: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">JF: That was the password, the resettlement.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">SS: Resettle, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">JF: Then...</span></p> <p><span id="s161">SS: You can understand that now.</span> <span id="s162">But you didn't understand it then.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">JF: Sure.</span> <span id="s164">Transports were being, they started deportations, and groups of people were being taken to the railroad station.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">SS: Did they start transporting immediately?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">JF: As soon as they finished the ghetto, ghettoizing people.</span> <span id="s167">As soon as they finished relocating everyone into the ghetto, they started taking people away in large numbers.</span> <span id="s168">Now, we're talking about thousands.</span> <span id="s169">It's hard to imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">SS: Now how long did you stay in that ghetto then...</span></p> <p><span id="s171">JF: We were...</span></p> <p><span id="s172">SS: With your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">JF: We were among the last of the people who were deported, because my father worked in the kitchen, and because they had to keep this facility going.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">SS: I see.</span> <span id="s175">Where did the food come from?</span> <span id="s176">Did the Nazis give you food?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">JF: They provided it.</span> <span id="s178">Yeah...</span></p> <p><span id="s179">SS: I see.</span> <span id="s180">And so about how long do you think it was that you were in that ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">JF: To the best of my recollection, a couple of weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">SS: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">JF: I was just 15 years old at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">SS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">JF: My birthday is March 2nd.</span> <span id="s186">All this happened the middle of March that the Germans occupied us and then immediately after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s188">All right.</span> <span id="s189">And then what happened to you?</span> <span id="s190">How they, what did they do to you to get you out?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">JF: When the last, among the last of the people in the ghetto was my family, plus whoever still remained.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">SS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">JF: We were marched to the railroad station.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">SS: What did they do, come in and wake you up and said, "March!"</span> <span id="s195">?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">JF: Well, they simply said, "Tomorrow morning at such and such a time, everyone be ready.</span> <span id="s197">Carry with you your one suitcase and whatever clothing you can wear.</span> <span id="s198">Linens and beddings are not necessary.</span> <span id="s199">You will get new rations and new linens."</span> <span id="s200">And we, I remember putting on several layers of clothing--even though it was pretty warm, it was spring--because we figured in that way we'll have quite a bit more.</span> <span id="s201">And we were marched to the railroad station and shoved into cattle cars, 70, 80, 100 persons into a cattle car.</span> <span id="s202">It was a long, long train.</span> <span id="s203">And we were told by armed guards to board these trains.</span> <span id="s204">And it was very difficult to get settled in the cattle car, because it was very crowded.</span> <span id="s205">There were tiny windows that were sort of closed up with slats, metal slats.</span> <span id="s206">And it was very, very crowded and unpleasant where you're sitting on one on top of the other.</span> <span id="s207">And they placed a bucket, or possibly two buckets into the cattle car to be used as bathroom, which was an absolute horrible torture.</span> <span id="s208">It was very public, and it was very difficult to deal with that.</span> <span id="s209">And very quickly it became full.</span> <span id="s210">And that presented a big problem with the odor, and no facility to use.</span> <span id="s211">And I remember children crying and people moaning, and people shoving a bit.</span> <span id="s212">And somebody was saying, "Let me to the window.</span> <span id="s213">I'm suffocating."</span> <span id="s214">And this is how our journey was.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">SS: Do you have any idea how long it was, Judy?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">JF: A couple of days.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">SS: Days.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">JF: I seem to recall night and day, alternating a bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">SS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">JF: So it was a couple of days.</span> <span id="s221">I do remember that, the feeling I had when the train car was closed from the outside, with a latch.</span> <span id="s222">It clicked, as a, as if a, it's the final click.</span> <span id="s223">And I realized that we were locked in, and we cannot get out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">SS: And you, did you, then when the train stopped and you were...</span></p> <p><span id="s225">JF: When the train stopped, we arrived at our destination.</span> <span id="s226">Our destination was Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s227">It was a name I never heard of, a place I never knew about, until that moment of arrival.</span> <span id="s228">We were, the doors opened and we were ordered to come out of the trains.</span> <span id="s229">Many people died on the journey.</span> <span id="s230">There were two people dead in my particular cattle car, but I saw them dragging dead bodies out from others, and they just lay them down on the ground.</span> <span id="s231">There was a large crowd, and as I came off the train, I came face to face with the notorious Dr. Mengele, who was always greeting the incoming transports.</span> <span id="s232">And I looked around.</span> <span id="s233">I did not see a railroad station, just railroad tracks.</span> <span id="s234">And the German guards with weapons on their shoulders, and weapons in their holsters, and dogs on leashes at their side, milled about the people and were yelling for men and women to line up in separate groups.</span> <span id="s235">And then we had to file by where Dr. Mengele was standing.</span> <span id="s236">I remember him as very dashing looking, immaculately dressed, and shiny boots, and an immaculate uniform.</span> <span id="s237">I was terrified.</span> <span id="s238">I was, I saw my father being sent to one side.</span> <span id="s239">I didn't know what was going to happen to me.</span> <span id="s240">I filed by Dr. Mengele's table and he pointed with his finger to the left or to the right.</span> <span id="s241">To the left meant death, immediately upon arrival, to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s242">To the right meant we're staying alive for a little bit longer.</span> <span id="s243">He asked me how old I was.</span> <span id="s244">I told him I was 15.</span> <span id="s245">He pointed me to the right, my mother and my little 12-year-old sister to the left.</span> <span id="s246">I took a few steps to follow them.</span> <span id="s247">I wanted to be where my mother is.</span> <span id="s248">And a man in a striped uniform, who himself was a prisoner but he was working at the railroad tracks, grabbed my arm and very firmly, he literally shoved me back to the right side.</span> <span id="s249">And I couldn't understand why he was so angry and so nasty to me.</span> <span id="s250">I realize now that had I, he, been allowed to follow my mother, I would have marched into the gas chamber with my mother.</span> <span id="s251">Anyone who was a little bit elderly or looked not very strong, looked weak, anyone with a child under age 15, or children under age 15, anyone with any kind of mental or physical disability, pregnant women, were all pointed to the left.</span> <span id="s252">And they were marched, immediately upon arrival, into the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s253">Little did I know at that moment of arrival, that I will never see my mother, my sister, my cousins, my aunts, my uncles, my uncles, my grandparents, my father.</span> <span id="s254">I am the only survivor from my entire family.</span> <span id="s255">I lost approximately 37 members of my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">SS: In Auschwitz, what was your daily routine?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">JF: Before we were taken to the barrack, or the building, where, that was going to be my home for the next seven months, we were marched to an ar--to another section where we were told to undress, and stark naked, file by a table where women in a white uniform were holding clippers.</span> <span id="s258">They shaved our hair, and all our bodily, our head, and all our bodily hair.</span> <span id="s259">And while all this procedure was going on, German soldiers and men in striped uniforms were milling about.</span> <span id="s260">And you can imagine the horror...</span></p> <p><span id="s261">SS: When you say men in striped uniforms...</span></p> <p><span id="s262">JF: They were prisoners who worked there.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">SS: Oh, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">JF: They were Jewish or political prisoners who worked there.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">SS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">JF: Imagine the feeling of a 15-year-old girl, or plus all the other women who were with me, stark naked, having to walk around and to walk by these soldiers and these men.</span> <span id="s267">That was our first experience with that.</span> <span id="s268">And there were many more later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">SS: Now, did they put you to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">JF: They, after the shaving of the hair, head, we went to a shower, and then dripping wet, we got a garment, one dress, from a huge pile of clothing.</span> <span id="s271">This was clothing that they brought out of the wagons of previous transports.</span> <span id="s272">We have never seen, I've never seen my former clothing, my own, ever again.</span> <span id="s273">It was left in the train.</span> <span id="s274">So people who worked there would then sort it and then, the good things went to Germany and some of the not-so-good things were given to the prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">SS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">JF: I was taken to a section called Birkenau, in a compound called Lager C, where there were 32 wooden buildings, each housing 1,000 human beings.</span> <span id="s277">I was with a group of young girls, who were only 15 or 16 years old.</span> <span id="s278">They were...</span></p> <p><span id="s279">SS: That was the whole?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">JF: The building.</span> <span id="s281">This particular building...</span></p> <p><span id="s282">SS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">JF: Was all a group of young girls.</span> <span id="s284">And we were about 1,000.</span> <span id="s285">And we lived on shelves, three deckers high, ten to a shelf.</span> <span id="s286">Our daily routine consisted of getting up or being woken up at dawn, going outside for roll call, standing in line for hours and hours at a time in rows of five.</span> <span id="s287">When roll call was over we were allowed to go to the lat--latrine, which was a building in itself with just hole, a huge hole and benches to sit over.</span> <span id="s288">It was not plumb--any kind of sanitary facility as we know now.</span> <span id="s289">Then to a washroom, where some cold water was trickling out of faucets.</span> <span id="s290">And then back into the bunk, and we received our breakfast which was a miserable tasting sweetish liquid given to ten of us in one communal bowl, passed from person to person.</span> <span id="s291">The rest of the day was spent with doing absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s292">We were not made to work.</span> <span id="s293">In the afternoon, roll call repeated itself.</span> <span id="s294">We had to go outside again, we had, line up in rows of five, stand outside for hours at a time.</span> <span id="s295">After counting us again they allowed us to the bathroom again, or to the latrine.</span> <span id="s296">And back into the bunks, where they served a horrendous tasting soup as our main meal, in a communal bowl, to be passed from person to person until it was empty.</span> <span id="s297">We would take a, we would make a pre-arranged, we'd take a pre-arranged number of sips each of us.</span> <span id="s298">They also gave us a little piece of bread in the afternoon, with the afternoon soup.</span> <span id="s299">And the days passed in this kind of horrendous monotony.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">SS: And it was, and you did no labor of any kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">JF: They did not make this particular group work.</span> <span id="s302">There were groups who did work in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">SS: Yeah O.K., but your group didn't have to.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">JF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">SS: O.K.</span> <span id="s306">Did you have any contact, or knowledge of what was going on in the outside world there?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">JF: You mean in Auschwitz itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">JF: Yes, we very quickly found out that that horrible odor that we smell is people being burned in the crematorium.</span> <span id="s310">There were five gas chambers.</span> <span id="s311">There were five crematoria ovens.</span> <span id="s312">The odor was permeating the camp day and night.</span> <span id="s313">Ashes were flying in the air day and night.</span> <span id="s314">Every sub-camp was surrounded by barbed wires that had live electricity to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">SS: So you couldn't have...</span></p> <p><span id="s316">JF: Guarded by guard towers.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">SS: Contact...</span></p> <p><span id="s318">JF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">SS: With anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">JF: No.</span> <span id="s321">Only with the people right near us.</span> <span id="s322">The crowding was so enormous that even if the 1,000 people would have come out of their shelves, they would not have had enough space to stand.</span> <span id="s323">There wasn't any simple necessity that we consider a necessity.</span> <span id="s324">There wasn't a towel, a toothbrush, a piece of paper, a watch, a calendar.</span> <span id="s325">We didn't know what day it was, what time it was, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">SS: You had nothing to read?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">JF: Nothing.</span> <span id="s328">Nothing whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">SS: Just, and so what did you do, talk?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">JF: We talked, yes.</span> <span id="s331">We, I tried to be friends with the people who were closest to me on the shelf with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">SS: They were all Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">JF: Yes.</span> <span id="s334">Everybody was Jewish there.</span> <span id="s335">They were all young girls.</span> <span id="s336">Some of them came from villages.</span> <span id="s337">After a few weeks of this horrendous monotonous starving routine, during which time we were always terrified, and always hungry, and when it rained we had an additional problem because we got soaking wet and we had no way to get dry so we would huddle into our shelves soaking wet.</span> <span id="s338">I noticed that after a few weeks of this, some of my bunkmates and some of the people around me, had a vacant stare.</span> <span id="s339">They were just sort of closing out life.</span> <span id="s340">They were giving up.</span> <span id="s341">And that terrified me.</span> <span id="s342">That terrified me even more than the hunger.</span> <span id="s343">So I devised a survival skill, and that was to remember and recall all the books I had read, and all the movies I had seen.</span> <span id="s344">And I told and retold the stories to my bunkmates and people around me, they would surround me and ask me to tell about this movie or that movie.</span> <span id="s345">Now some of the girls had never seen a movie, because they came from little villages.</span> <span id="s346">And I was trying to explain to them how a machine, a magical machine, makes these people move and talk on a screen.</span> <span id="s347">And they couldn't quite imagine it.</span> <span id="s348">And I made it very interesting and colorful and so this was my life's, my life-saving skill, and also a way to preserve my mind, and to preserve my memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">SS: The, and I see here that you said you left the, 1930, 4--nin--November of '44, Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">JF: Well, we were living in Auschwitz for seven months.</span> <span id="s351">It was quite an achievement, because the average life span in this particular section was about six to eight weeks.</span> <span id="s352">People were dying of disease, of starvation, of exposure, or just...</span></p> <p><span id="s353">SS: Did you have any doctors...</span></p> <p><span id="s354">JF: Going berserk.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">SS: From the outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">JF: No, no, nobody paid any attention.</span> <span id="s357">Every day when it was roll call, there were many dead that had to be taken out and lined up in rows of five, to be counted.</span> <span id="s358">They were very meticulous about their counting.</span> <span id="s359">In addition to this horrendous, monotonous routine, there were selections all the time.</span> <span id="s360">Which were, other times for assembly time, other than morning and the afternoon.</span> <span id="s361">The gongs would sound.</span> <span id="s362">The whistles would blow, and we'd have to go outside for a selection, at which time we had to remove our one garment and file by the SS delegation.</span> <span id="s363">And they would select people.</span> <span id="s364">Sometimes they would select people whose ribs showed, and who were pale and who were sickly looking.</span> <span id="s365">They would take them to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s366">So we knew, by then we knew.</span> <span id="s367">Other times they would select people who looked very, fairly in good shape yet and they would take them to labor camps.</span> <span id="s368">But when selections were taking place, we never knew where, what our fate is going to be.</span> <span id="s369">So I remember pinching my cheeks, another survival skill, to try to have a little color.</span> <span id="s370">And whenever there was a selection they would count off the number of people to be going through the selection.</span> <span id="s371">I would try to stay in the middle of the group, or towards the end of the group, so that I wouldn't get beatings.</span> <span id="s372">Because people on the edges were always liable to get beatings more often.</span> <span id="s373">And these all, these were some of the maneuvers and survival skills that I sort of tried to figure out.</span> <span id="s374">Eventually, in November, oh, another thing, I made myself a promise that if I survive the horrendous night and nightmare that was Auschwitz, that I would tell about it and talk about it.</span> <span id="s375">And I have lived up to that promise.</span> <span id="s376">Because I have talked, to hundreds and hundreds and possibly thousands of people about my experiences.</span> <span id="s377">I teach about the Holocaust, where I live.</span> <span id="s378">In Nov--some time in November of 1944, I was caught in a selection.</span> <span id="s379">And at that time, we were marched out of the immediate compound to an area where I could smell the odor of burning flesh much more pronounced than it was in Lager C.</span> <span id="s380">We were taken to the gas chambers, I, with a group of other people.</span> <span id="s381">Put through the entry room, we were told to undress.</span> <span id="s382">They ushered us into a room with brick, bleachers, and benches.</span> <span id="s383">We were sitting there, many, many of us, two thousand at a time.</span> <span id="s384">They emptied half the room.</span> <span id="s385">Half the people went through the doors, into the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s386">We never heard from them again.</span> <span id="s387">The other half, where I was at, we were waiting for our turn, and an air raid siren sounded.</span> <span id="s388">And they stopped the proceedings and took us out of there, and back to our bunk.</span> <span id="s389">That was very close.</span> <span id="s390">It was a very close call.</span> <span id="s391">After that, I found myself in a selection again, and that time they took us to the railroad tracks and I was put into cattle cars and taken all the way from Poland, where Auschwitz was located, west to, into Germany, near Berlin, to a labor camp called Guben, G-U-B-E-N.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">SS: [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s393">JF: It was a small labor camp.</span> <span id="s394">It had some Jewish slave laborers, such as us.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">SS: And other kinds?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">JF: And it had political prisoners in another compound that was wired off from us.</span> <span id="s397">We could talk to them through the wire.</span> <span id="s398">They were men, political prisoners, other nationalities.</span> <span id="s399">But we could not mingle with them.</span> <span id="s400">Every morning we were marched to the factory where we worked.</span> <span id="s401">It was a, an electronics component factory.</span> <span id="s402">They sort of, but there was, nobody told us exactly what it was, but we surmised that it was components for airplanes, for communication systems.</span> <span id="s403">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s404">SS: Were you treated better here?</span> <span id="s405">Did you get more food?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">JF: We were treated better.</span> <span id="s407">The living conditions were a lot better than in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">SS: Did you have clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">JF: I was, no, they didn't give us clothes, but I was very lucky that on the very first day of arrival, I met two women from my hometown who had been there for a number of months in that camp.</span> <span id="s410">One of them worked in the kitchen, and one of them worked in the warehouse, sorting clothing.</span> <span id="s411">And I got a coat from her.</span> <span id="s412">It was November.</span> <span id="s413">It was cold.</span> <span id="s414">And it was very, very precious to me.</span> <span id="s415">And it was a very big help.</span> <span id="s416">We were marched to the factory every day before sun up, and worked 14, 16 hours a day in this factory.</span> <span id="s417">I was soldering wires to components.</span> <span id="s418">A supervisor, a civilian supervisor showed me how.</span> <span id="s419">I had to use tweezers and a soldering iron.</span> <span id="s420">It was not difficult work.</span> <span id="s421">It's pretty fortunate that it was easy work, and it was indoors.</span> <span id="s422">And then we were marched back to the camp in the evening.</span> <span id="s423">And my friend who worked in the kitchen would always give me an extra potato or a piece of bread, which I most often shared with people around me.</span> <span id="s424">We were housed in rooms about forty, fifty people in a room, and we were not as crowded, not really as crowded as in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s425">And I was beginning to be hopeful that if conditions are such as this, it is manageable.</span> <span id="s426">Not great, but manageable.</span> <span id="s427">And that we would survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">SS: When the air raid came, did the people realize what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">JF: Oh sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">SS: They knew that the...</span></p> <p><span id="s431">JF: Oh sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">SS: Enemy was [chuckling]...</span></p> <p><span id="s433">JF: Yes.</span> <span id="s434">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s435">We heard air raids and explosions.</span> <span id="s436">We knew the Russians were bombing.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">JF: We kept praying that they would bomb Auschwitz, even if it meant killing us all.</span> <span id="s439">But at least it would also have meant that it, they are putting a stop to the killings, new arrivals.</span> <span id="s440">We knew exactly by then what the score was, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">SS: Did, and when you went to this Guben camp, were you able to have, hear about outside contacts?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">JF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">SS: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">JF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">SS: No, you were so isolated.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">JF: Totally isolated, and the civilian German supervisors never talked to us.</span> <span id="s447">They never showed a scrap of kindness.</span> <span id="s448">They knew we were prisoners.</span> <span id="s449">I mean, age 15.</span> <span id="s450">I was a prisoner.</span> <span id="s451">And other women were somewhat older, but still, we were prisoners.</span> <span id="s452">We looked emaciated.</span> <span id="s453">We were hungry all the time.</span> <span id="s454">We were cold on this walk back and forth to the factory.</span> <span id="s455">They never gave us any kind of help whatsoever.</span> <span id="s456">Not a kind word, not a scrap of food, not a pair of stockings, nothing whatsoever.</span> <span id="s457">They just ignored us as people.</span> <span id="s458">They made us, made sure we do what we have to do.</span> <span id="s459">There were air raids quite often at that time.</span> <span id="s460">This was near Berlin, and the Russians were advancing.</span> <span id="s461">This was, by then it was the end of 1944, November, December, 1944.</span> <span id="s462">And we could hear explosions occasionally and we were made to go into the air raid shelter.</span> <span id="s463">And at that time we were always thrilled to be in the air raid shelter, because it meant getting away from our work and just sort of sitting and waiting.</span> <span id="s464">And we were warm.</span> <span id="s465">We were inside.</span> <span id="s466">There was also quite a bit of sabotage going on among the laborers.</span> <span id="s467">We would do our soldering very neatly, and then on the next spot or the next station where people had to do something else, turn wires around, a spool or something, they would snip a wire and continue putting the wire on even though a connection may have been broken.</span> <span id="s468">Because I know we used to talk about it among ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">SS: Amongst yourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">JF: Yes.</span> <span id="s471">Of course that was punishable by death if it had been found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">SS: Did your, was anybody ever caught?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">JF: Not that I know of.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">SS: All right, and then was the, it says here in Jan--in January, you went to Bergen--to, you marched for two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">JF: Yes, marched.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">SS: Then in, from this ca--Berlin camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">JF: Well, from Gub--in Guben, conditions were tolerable.</span> <span id="s478">But sometime in January of 1945...</span></p> <p><span id="s479">SS: Eh, do you know who the head of that camp was?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">JF: I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">SS: You have no idea, all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">JF: Some time in January of 1945, new arrivals were brought to this camp, and they were fill--totally infected with lice.</span> <span id="s483">They were frostbitten.</span> <span id="s484">They were hungry.</span> <span id="s485">They were sick.</span> <span id="s486">They were ragged.</span> <span id="s487">They were exhausted.</span> <span id="s488">And they were telling us that they had been on a death march.</span> <span id="s489">They had been on a march, for weeks on end, through the roads of Germany, through forests and highways and roads.</span> <span id="s490">And very soon after that, I mean, we tried to keep away from them, but they were near us and with us and they were, we had to take them in, and we felt terrified of them and felt sorry for them at the same time.</span> <span id="s491">Little did I know that very shortly this would be our fate too.</span> <span id="s492">As, very soon after this new group's arrival--there were a large number of them--orders came to evacuate the camp.</span> <span id="s493">And we were taken on a death march, everybody in Guben camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">SS: Did you know where you went?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">JF: No idea.</span> <span id="s496">Through Germany.</span> <span id="s497">Through the roads of Germany.</span> <span id="s498">And we were not the only ones.</span> <span id="s499">In rows of five, always rows of five, with huge, these huge columns of humanity were marching up and down the roads in Germany, led by, of course, and guarded by armed guards, through forests, through highways, through roads.</span> <span id="s500">We were joined by other groups.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">SS: Did they feed you [unclear]?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">JF: Hardly ever.</span> <span id="s503">We took a little bit of food with us...</span></p> <p><span id="s504">SS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">JF: That was left in the camp.</span> <span id="s506">Everybody got a little bit of ration.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">SS: And [unclear] two weeks about...</span></p> <p><span id="s508">JF: Ten days to two weeks.</span> <span id="s509">I don't know for sure.</span> <span id="s510">Sometimes we had to march day and night.</span> <span id="s511">Sometimes they would house us at, on a farm, in a barn.</span> <span id="s512">And we would spend the night there.</span> <span id="s513">They would always lock us into the barn.</span> <span id="s514">And during those times when we were housed in a farm, they would cook some potatoes, or cook some kind of vegetables, so we would get some food.</span> <span id="s515">Other times there was no food, and I remember seeing the guards, sitting down at the rest stop, every time, and take out their rucksack, take out their bundles of salami sandwiches and cheese sandwiches, and sit there and eat them, and drink coffee with it.</span> <span id="s516">And I'd stand there and just stare at them.</span> <span id="s517">Through the fields sometimes I managed to pull up some roots, if we marched through fields, and we'd chew on them.</span> <span id="s518">It snowed at times.</span> <span id="s519">I would scoop off snow from the person's shoulder in front of me and suck on the snow.</span> <span id="s520">It was...</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s522">SS: O.K. Go ahead.</span> <span id="s523">You, in these...</span></p> <p><span id="s524">JF: Everytime we were housed in these barns, in the haystack, they would always lock us in.</span> <span id="s525">And I used to have terrible fears that they will douse the barns with gasoline and light us, put the, torch us.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">SS: How did you think those things up?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">JF: I had a weird imagination [chuckling].</span></p> <p><span id="s528">SS: You hadn't heard of it being done before?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">JF: I didn't, but instinct told me that this is quite feasible.</span> <span id="s530">And you know, it did happen, time and again, not to my particular group.</span> <span id="s531">But as I was reading, now I read everything that's written about the Holocaust, there are instances where it really, indeed did happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">SS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">JF: And these people tried to hide when the S.S. personnel would come in with pitchforks, and pierce into the...</span></p> <p><span id="s534">SS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">JF: Hay.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">SS: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">JF: Once...</span></p> <p><span id="s538">SS: But it didn't happen to you.</span> <span id="s539">Let's go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">JF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">SS: What happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">JF: [chuckling] One time we went through a village.</span> <span id="s543">And by then we were marching about six, seven days.</span> <span id="s544">Oh, the death march also is called that because it was wintertime and the roads were littered with corpses, everywhere.</span> <span id="s545">Anybody who was too tired to take another step, or sat down when other times, in designated rest stops, were shot right there, unceremoniously.</span> <span id="s546">And we'd hear the shots ring out all the time, beginning of the column, the end of the column, anywhere and everywhere.</span> <span id="s547">There were people dropping in their tracks, and we'd have to sort of kick the dead bodies out of the way, or step over them, or walk on them, which was incredible, horrible.</span> <span id="s548">One time when we were housed at one of these villages, in a, on a farm, somebody started shouting, "Good news!</span> <span id="s549">Good news!</span> <span id="s550">We're gonna get cooked food today!"</span> <span id="s551">And so they asked for helpers to cook some meat.</span> <span id="s552">And, imagine the joy of hearing that we're going to have a hot soup with meat in it, potatoes in it.</span> <span id="s553">And my friend who worked in the kitchen in Guben volunteered to help.</span> <span id="s554">And she helped prepare this food.</span> <span id="s555">And sure enough we got hot food in cans, containers, bowls, whatever.</span> <span id="s556">And we gulped it down joyously.</span> <span id="s557">We were so starved.</span> <span id="s558">And I remember just gulping it as much as, as quickly as possible.</span> <span id="s559">It turned out that the next day, and even during that night, people were getting terrible diarrhea.</span> <span id="s560">We were vomiting and getting terrible sickness from it.</span> <span id="s561">It was a dead horse that they gave to us, which our people cooked, and we ate.</span> <span id="s562">I got sick too, but I survived that too.</span> <span id="s563">After about ten to twelve days of the death march, and I can't be sure just of the exact time span, because day melted into night.</span> <span id="s564">It just was impossible.</span> <span id="s565">I was put into cattle cars again, and taken to my last destination of the camps, which was the second most horrendous, horrible camp in the entire system, called Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s566">Upon arrival to Bergen-Belsen, my two friends--who were always next to me, and who dragged me during the death march at one point when I couldn't walk anymore and I begged them to leave me behind but they wouldn't so I just, they just dragged me till I could take steps on my own--my two friends informed me that they have a little hoard of jewelry, that my friend has taken out of clothing that she sorted.</span> <span id="s567">And we had to think quickly how to save it, because we were, we had to strip and they took away my treasured coat.</span> <span id="s568">That was the end of that.</span> <span id="s569">And we knew that in the other end we'll just get a garment, with no pockets, no way to put anything away.</span> <span id="s570">So we divided the jewelry and stuffed it into our mouths.</span> <span id="s571">And went through the shower, the shower room with showers.</span> <span id="s572">And on the other end they gave us another schmata, a rag.</span> <span id="s573">And my friend looked to see who had the longest.</span> <span id="s574">And with her teeth she bit into the hem and tore off a piece and rolled up her little hoard of jewelry and put it into her neck.</span> <span id="s575">The jewelry was not used to make us look beautiful.</span> <span id="s576">It was used later to save our life.</span> <span id="s577">And it was a very prominent role in that respect.</span> <span id="s578">In Bergen-Belsen we were assigned to live in rooms, just rooms, little rooms, sitting on the floor.</span> <span id="s579">There was no furniture, no bed, not even shelves.</span> <span id="s580">Absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s581">So we were literally sitting on top of one another, sleeping on top of one another, crouching together on top of one another.</span> <span id="s582">And, under these conditions, with no sanitation available, people getting ill, they were infested by lice, those who were already there.</span> <span id="s583">And it was impossible to keep the lice off of us.</span> <span id="s584">So the lice traveled from per son to person to person.</span> <span id="s585">And the lice carried the dread disease of typhus.</span> <span id="s586">There was a horrible epidemic of typhus, raging the entire time I was there, in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s587">And it was during this time that when the three of us got sick, each in rotation, my friend traded a piece of jewelry, a diamond, a bracelet, for some aspirin or some little sugar cubes or pieces of meat.</span> <span id="s588">I don't know how she made the contact, but she shared bite for bite with me and with the other friends, the three of us together.</span> <span id="s589">And so this precious little hoard of jewelry was giving us life.</span> <span id="s590">It was sustaining us another day and another day.</span> <span id="s591">Here, too, we were fed from communal bowls, a horrible tasting soup.</span> <span id="s592">I remember holding my nose and swallowing, because I said, "One sip, I live.</span> <span id="s593">One more sip, I live."</span> <span id="s594">And I kept saying that to myself.</span> <span id="s595">I did absolutely no work.</span> <span id="s596">Nobody did any work.</span> <span id="s597">The job of people there was dying.</span> <span id="s598">Every morning, in each room, many, many died.</span> <span id="s599">Many did not wake up.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">SS: Did you hear from the outside...</span></p> <p><span id="s601">JF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">SS: World then?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">JF: Totally isolated.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">SS: Isolated.</span> <span id="s605">No bombings?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">JF: Tot--not then.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">SS: No airplanes?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">JF: Not there, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">SS: Nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">JF: Not there.</span> <span id="s611">See...</span></p> <p><span id="s612">SS: Were there Jew, only Jews in this...</span></p> <p><span id="s613">JF: Only Jews, yes.</span> <span id="s614">In this section.</span> <span id="s615">Now there may have been other nationalities in other sections, but where we were, only Jews.</span> <span id="s616">As crowded together like herring stuffed in a can.</span> <span id="s617">Here too there was roll call, but not quite as orderly, and not quite as regularly as in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s618">But here, our main job was to remove the dead bodies, and throw them out side, just outside, in front of the building.</span> <span id="s619">And I remember getting violent beating from the woman in charge, whose name was Blockälteste, or Kapo.</span> <span id="s620">That was her job.</span> <span id="s621">Herself was a prisoner, but she had, her job was supervising us and keeping us in order.</span> <span id="s622">Some body near me died, someone I got very friendly with in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s623">And the Kapo just came over and pointed to four of us, "You, you, and you, take her out."</span> <span id="s624">On the way they dragged the bodies out.</span> <span id="s625">We couldn't lift the body.</span> <span id="s626">We were weak ourselves.</span> <span id="s627">Two people dragged the arms, and two people dragged the legs.</span> <span id="s628">And we had to walk through a long corridor, and then down about three or four steps.</span> <span id="s629">And as we dragged these bodies, the head bopped down the steps.</span> <span id="s630">It just went down, down, down.</span> <span id="s631">And I couldn't do this to somebody that I loved.</span> <span id="s632">And I said to this Kapo, "I can't.</span> <span id="s633">I can't take her."</span> <span id="s634">And she started beating me about, around, on my head and my ears and my face and my shoulder.</span> <span id="s635">I couldn't hear for weeks after that.</span> <span id="s636">That was the most violent beating I got.</span> <span id="s637">But I did not drag my friend out.</span> <span id="s638">I just couldn't.</span> <span id="s639">But those bodies of dead grew from day to day to day.</span> <span id="s640">They were just left out there.</span> <span id="s641">They did not bury them.</span> <span id="s642">They did not cremate them.</span> <span id="s643">They just left them out there.</span> <span id="s644">When you see mountains of bodies on documentary pictures, that's Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s645">They were decomposing in the rain, and in the heat.</span> <span id="s646">It was getting warm by then.</span> <span id="s647">It was Spring.</span> <span id="s648">Beautiful Spring.</span> <span id="s649">And there we were, dying.</span> <span id="s650">And as strong-willed as I was, and as much as I wanted to live, when I saw my one friend get typhus and be come totally helpless, then my other friend get typhus and get, become totally helpless, I knew my turn's gonna come.</span> <span id="s651">There was no way not to have, get it, not to get this disease.</span> <span id="s652">I was giving up hope at that point.</span> <span id="s653">I just absolutely felt that there was no way.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">SS: The first time in all those years...</span></p> <p><span id="s655">JF: The first time, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">SS: That you...</span></p> <p><span id="s657">JF: In the entire year.</span> <span id="s658">But I felt there is no way out.</span> <span id="s659">God didn't listen.</span> <span id="s660">People didn't listen.</span> <span id="s661">The world was gonna let us die.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">SS: All through your experience, was there any Jewish beliefs?</span> <span id="s663">In other words, rituals or ceremonies in any of these camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">JF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">SS: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">JF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">SS: Nothing.</span> <span id="s668">No religious...</span></p> <p><span id="s669">JF: Well, not where I was.</span> <span id="s670">As I said, I was with the...</span></p> <p><span id="s671">SS: O.K. [unclear] what we're interested in.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">JF: With the, with young kids.</span> <span id="s673">And so you know we were helpless...</span></p> <p><span id="s674">SS: [unclear] prayer.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">JF: In doing anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">SS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">JF: And particularly, we didn't particularly feel the need for it either.</span> <span id="s678">We did know that it was Yom Kippur in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s679">And some of the people fasted.</span> <span id="s680">I said, "One more bite, one more day of life."</span> <span id="s681">And I did not fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">SS: You [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s683">JF: I mean, I wanted so much to live, even under those conditions.</span> <span id="s684">It's really amazing when you think about it.</span> <span id="s685">But we were so dehumanized, and so scared all the time, and so hungry, and dirty.</span> <span id="s686">Imagine not taking a shower, a bath, for weeks and months on end.</span> <span id="s687">I mean, how does one smell?</span> <span id="s688">And yet, even under those conditions I wanted to live.</span> <span id="s689">I did not want to die.</span> <span id="s690">Even knowing that my family is probably all dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">SS: Did you believe you're gonna be rescued?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">JF: Yes.</span> <span id="s693">I kn--that never left me.</span> <span id="s694">I kept saying, "I'm gonna live, and I'm gonna tell, and I'm gonna live, and I'm gonna tell."</span> <span id="s695">But in Bergen-Belsen, for a little while there, I was beginning to feel hopeless.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">SS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s697">Then how did you change?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">JF: Well, before I became very hopeless, and totally hopeless, I got typhus too.</span> <span id="s699">And by then my two friends were feeling better, and they were able to make me stand up.</span> <span id="s700">And they would hold me up so I wouldn't just be lying there, in my own excrement.</span> <span id="s701">They dragged me to the washroom and they washed my face.</span> <span id="s702">And they tried to make me take a bite of that extra bread that they managed to get, with the jewelry, or a sugar cube, or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s703">And I was really declining.</span> <span id="s704">And I, before I reached the end, I was so skinny.</span> <span id="s705">I must have been about 60 pounds, if that.</span> <span id="s706">I mean I was so skinny.</span> <span id="s707">My arms were like toothpicks, and my legs were so skinny.</span> <span id="s708">I just didn't know it held me even.</span> <span id="s709">I couldn't sit.</span> <span id="s710">It hurt.</span> <span id="s711">I had no flesh on my bones.</span> <span id="s712">Just before the end came for me, on April 15th, of 1945, the British Army came into Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">SS: How did you know they were coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">JF: Somebody burst into the room, and even though I was lying there--I was sick--but I heard them, and they said, "All the German guards are gone.</span> <span id="s715">There are British soldiers, the English soldiers, all over the camp!</span> <span id="s716">We are free!</span> <span id="s717">We are free!"</span></p> <p><span id="s718">SS: You didn't know until they were actually there?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">JF: Actually there.</span> <span id="s720">Actually there, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">SS: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">JF: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s723">SS: Did your friends live?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">JF: My, both of my friends survived, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">SS: Do you want to put their names on your record?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">JF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">SS: All right.</span> <span id="s728">Tell who they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">JF: My two friends were Imu Eisler Berkowitz, from Pushhored Ungvr, and her sister-in-law, Rosie Berkowitz.</span> <span id="s730">The two of them were sister-in-laws.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">SS: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">JF: And, I owe them my life.</span> <span id="s733">Even under those horrendous conditions, the most beautiful traits in human beings were still evident, as were the most horrible, where some body would steal a scrap of bread from somebody who saved it from the night before.</span> <span id="s734">And it had happened to me, where I would save it from the night before, and the next morning it was gone, even though I used to put it under my head.</span> <span id="s735">But it was still gone.</span> <span id="s736">We were liberated by the British Armed Forces.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">SS: Then, when you were liberated, how did they handle you?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">JF: The Brigadier General Grimm Hughes was the Commander in Chief there.</span> <span id="s739">And they were totally unprepared for what they found.</span> <span id="s740">The very first thing that, I remember what they did.</span> <span id="s741">They captured as many of the S.S. personnel as they could get their hands on.</span> <span id="s742">They made them dig enormous mass graves.</span> <span id="s743">By then I was feeling better.</span> <span id="s744">I was free.</span> <span id="s745">And that in itself made me stronger.</span> <span id="s746">I remember my friends supported me, and I walked out on the ground.</span> <span id="s747">I saw the German S.S., the former guards, collecting the dead bodies onto trucks.</span> <span id="s748">They transported them to these mass graves, laid them up on the side of the graves.</span> <span id="s749">Then they insisted that they, the city council, the mayor of Bergen-Belsen, be brought there too.</span> <span id="s750">And then a Jewish chaplain of the British Army said kaddish, and they bulldozed those, these enormous mountains of bodies into the graves.</span> <span id="s751">I was still pretty weak, and I needed treatment.</span> <span id="s752">And I was taken to a makeshift field hospital that the British Army set up.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">SS: In that area?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">JF: Off the campgrounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">SS: [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s756">JF: Off the campgrounds, yes.</span> <span id="s757">And after some time in the hospital...</span></p> <p><span id="s758">SS: Do you have any idea how long you may have been...</span></p> <p><span id="s759">JF: And, I remember two to three weeks approximately...</span></p> <p><span id="s760">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">JF: But I may be hazy about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">SS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">JF: I do remember totally feeling the miracle of lying on a bed with a sheet and a pillow and a blanket.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">SS: And clean.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">JF: And clean.</span> <span id="s766">And I remember asking one of the nurses to show me a mirror.</span> <span id="s767">I was by then 16.</span> <span id="s768">I celebrated my 16th birthday in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s769">And I looked into this mirror and a very strange face stared back at me.</span> <span id="s770">It didn't look like me.</span> <span id="s771">It didn't look like what I remembered myself looking.</span> <span id="s772">I was totally emaciated, and my eyes were sunk.</span> <span id="s773">And my face was very small.</span> <span id="s774">But I remember smiling into the mirror and just feeling that I'm alive.</span> <span id="s775">I cheated them.</span> <span id="s776">I cheated them.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">SS: And were you able to take the new food?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">JF: I was able to take normal food, but they cautioned me all the time to take little bits at a time.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">SS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">JF: Not a lot, just a tiny bit.</span> <span id="s781">Unfortunately a lot of people were not able to heed this warning, and they died of overeating, after liberation.</span> <span id="s782">Can you imagine the horror of that?</span> <span id="s783">To have survived this entire terrible event, and then die because of overeating.</span> <span id="s784">But I was pretty well disciplined, and I did what they told me.</span> <span id="s785">I wanted to live.</span> <span id="s786">And so eventually I recovered from typhus.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">SS: O.K., now after your stay in the hospital, did you, you recuperated to a certain extent...</span></p> <p><span id="s788">JF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">SS: And you gained weight I take it.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">JF: I gained weight.</span> <span id="s791">I was beginning to look like a human person.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">SS: How about clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">JF: They gave us something that, I remember it looked like army uniforms-type things.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">SS: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">JF: [chuckles] Whatever it was, it was clean.</span> <span id="s796">And that was, that's what was important.</span> <span id="s797">My hair was beginning to grow in, and I was very distressed when after typhus it was falling out again.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">SS: Did they give you a physical examination?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">JF: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s800">They...</span></p> <p><span id="s801">SS: And, all right, what did they say outside of malnutrition, what, and the typhus?</span> <span id="s802">Would...</span></p> <p><span id="s803">JF: Well, it was malnutrition and typhus and it needed time to heal and for people to get their strength back.</span> <span id="s804">For me to get my strength back.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">SS: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">JF: I developed sores all over my body from the malnutrition, and that was a great source of problem to me as I made my way back to my hometown eventually that summer of 1945.</span> <span id="s807">They were festering, large sores.</span> <span id="s808">I have the scars on my buttocks, on my abdominal area, and there were lots of it.</span> <span id="s809">Behind the knees, and that interfered with walking.</span> <span id="s810">I would stop at every city, every large city where I traveled through, and go to the first aid station for them to treat it.</span> <span id="s811">And they used to put medication and something, use something, band-aids or bandages or...</span></p> <p><span id="s812">SS: So you went back into your hometown area.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">JF: I, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">SS: You walked back?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">JF: Well, I walked...</span></p> <p><span id="s816">SS: Hitchhiked.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">JF: Didn't hitchhike.</span> <span id="s818">Didn't walk.</span> <span id="s819">[chuckles] Trains were taking survivors from city to city and...</span></p> <p><span id="s820">SS: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">JF: We had no money.</span> <span id="s822">I was also in a German town called Celle for a little while, in some army barracks, until I was able to get onto a truck and go to a railroad station.</span> <span id="s823">By then I was feeling better.</span> <span id="s824">My two friends had left before me.</span> <span id="s825">I was left behind in the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">SS: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">JF: They were able-bodied.</span> <span id="s828">They were able to walk by then.</span> <span id="s829">So I stayed.</span> <span id="s830">I was on my own entirely at that point.</span> <span id="s831">And I had no money.</span> <span id="s832">I had no way to buy tickets.</span> <span id="s833">And the trains were set up in such a way that they simply took people from here to there, and from there to here.</span> <span id="s834">So I traveled through Germany with, Bergen-Belsen was located on the north, northwestern part of Germany, near the harbor cities of Hanover and Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">JF: And from there, I had to go through Germany, through Austria, through Hungary, make my way to eastern Europe where I came from.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">SS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s838">Yeah.</span> <span id="s839">How long did that take?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">JF: It took a long time.</span> <span id="s841">It took many weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">SS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">JF: And in each of the big cities, the Joint, the Jewish Agency, would set up soup kitchens...</span></p> <p><span id="s844">SS: Oh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">JF: And places to house us and they would give us a voucher and we would go to the place to be housed and fed.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">SS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">JF: And I would go to the first aid stations to be treated for these festering sores that I had.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">SS: Oh.</span> <span id="s849">And I see you [unclear].</span> <span id="s850">How long did you stay in your village?</span> <span id="s851">Your...</span></p> <p><span id="s852">JF: City.</span> <span id="s853">City.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">SS: Your city.</span> <span id="s855">Thank you for...</span></p> <p><span id="s856">JF: City.</span> <span id="s857">It was quite urban, yes.</span> <span id="s858">I made my way back to my hometown sometime in the summer of 1945, July or August.</span> <span id="s859">And I felt in my guts that my father is gonna come back looking for me.</span> <span id="s860">He was a young man.</span> <span id="s861">He was only in his 40’s.</span> <span id="s862">I knew my mother and sister did not survive, because of her being 12 years old.</span> <span id="s863">And they had no chance.</span> <span id="s864">But I somehow felt that my father would.</span> <span id="s865">And I would go to the railroad station twice a day, morning and afternoon, and when people were coming in, survivors were coming in.</span> <span id="s866">And I would look for my father, and ask people if they knew of him.</span> <span id="s867">And I found no trace.</span> <span id="s868">He just vanished.</span> <span id="s869">No trace after Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s870">I don't know whether...</span></p> <p><span id="s871">SS: Didn't the Joint, wasn't the Joint able to help you...</span></p> <p><span id="s872">JF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">SS: Face, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">JF: No.</span> <span id="s875">Nobody was able to help me, because people simply died and they got burned or cremated or, or whatever, buried in mass graves.</span> <span id="s876">And there was no trace of them.</span> <span id="s877">I found no one who was even with him.</span> <span id="s878">So he, I doubt that he was sent to the gas chambers upon arrival to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s879">I really doubt it.</span> <span id="s880">Because he was young and strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">JF: So he must have been taken somewhere to a labor camp and perished there.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">SS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s884">You still don't know...</span></p> <p><span id="s885">JF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">SS: You have no hope then?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">JF: No, it's been 40 years.</span> <span id="s888">And if he hasn't...</span></p> <p><span id="s889">SS: I never...</span></p> <p><span id="s890">JF: Come back since, I'm sure he wouldn't.</span> <span id="s891">I stayed with some non-Jewish neighbors for a while in my hometown.</span> <span id="s892">And after a few days one of the, my hostess with whom I stayed sent me to the market, to the farmers' market to buy vegetables for her.</span> <span id="s893">And I met my childhood friend, who also survived.</span> <span id="s894">And of course after the initial joy of seeing each other alive, she asked me where I am living and I told her with a Gentile neighbor.</span> <span id="s895">So she said, "Come home with me.</span> <span id="s896">Don't stay with the Goyim."</span> <span id="s897">So, I looked at her and I said, "Home?</span> <span id="s898">To home where?</span> <span id="s899">Where is home?"</span> <span id="s900">I didn't even go into my own home, because it was occupied by Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s901">So she told me a miraculous tale.</span> <span id="s902">Her mother survived, and her father survived.</span> <span id="s903">All different camps and all different places.</span> <span id="s904">Her mother had a two-year-old child at the time, but she also had her own mother with her.</span> <span id="s905">So upon arrival to Auschwitz, one of these men in the striped uniform said to her, "Give your baby to the grandma to hold."</span> <span id="s906">And that way, a young, the younger woman was survived, was given a possibility to survive.</span> <span id="s907">Had she held her own baby...</span></p> <p><span id="s908">SS: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">JF: She would never have left Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">SS: Let's stick to your story.</span> <span id="s911">All right, so then you stayed with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">JF: So they took me in to live with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">SS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">JF: And I stayed with them.</span> <span id="s915">They had me stay with them for several, oh let's see, from about August of 1945 till January of 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">SS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s917">Did you find your, the town changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">JF: It was occupied by Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">SS: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">JF: It was part of Russia.</span> <span id="s921">Survivors came back.</span> <span id="s922">Few of my age group, very, very few of my age group.</span> <span id="s923">My father never returned.</span> <span id="s924">In this same household I met my husband.</span> <span id="s925">He, too, was the son of friends and they took him in.</span> <span id="s926">He, too, is a survivor.</span> <span id="s927">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s928">SS: Did the Russians bother you, or...</span></p> <p><span id="s929">JF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">SS: No.</span> <span id="s931">And they let you go and...</span></p> <p><span id="s932">JF: No, we were free at that point.</span> <span id="s933">So they did not bother us.</span> <span id="s934">My husband and I got friendly with each other in this same household.</span> <span id="s935">And then eventually we left together to go to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s936">We wanted to leave our hometown.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">SS: All right, now, why do you, why Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">JF: Because that's where a lot of people from our area went to after the war, in the hope of being able to go to Palestine, to Canada, to America...</span></p> <p><span id="s939">SS: Oh, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">JF: To different places.</span> <span id="s941">From Russia we could not have gone out, and by then the borders were closed.</span> <span id="s942">And we had to leave with a group, illegally.</span> <span id="s943">And because my friends' parents were there--they lost five children, but two survived--because they were a family unit, they stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">JF: And we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">SS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s947">All right.</span> <span id="s948">Now, were you married in Hungary or...</span></p> <p><span

my life, Imu, and, who saved my life in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s952">And we moved in, lived in that city in Czechoslovakia called Podmokly, in the Sudetenland.</span> <span id="s953">And, I just showed up on her doorstep, and she took me in.</span> <span id="s954">By then she was remarried.</span> <span id="s955">Her first husband did not come back.</span> <span id="s956">And I slept in the bathtub...</span></p> <p><span id="s957">SS: [laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s958">JF: Because she didn't have another bed...</span></p> <p><span id="s959">SS: [laughing]</span></p> <p><span id="s960">JF: Until my husband and I were married.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">JF: And we got an apartment of our own in Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">SS: And how long did you stay in Slovak-...</span></p> <p><span id="s964">JF: Very short time.</span> <span id="s965">Rumor had it that they're gonna take us back to Russia.</span> <span id="s966">So we had just risked our lives...</span></p> <p><span id="s967">SS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">JF: Coming across the border to come to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s969">We didn't want to go back...</span></p> <p><span id="s970">SS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">JF: To Russia.</span> <span id="s972">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s973">SS: And I see you wound up in Munich?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">JF: Yes.</span> <span id="s975">We had to flee the Czech border again.</span> <span id="s976">This was sort of prearranged and sanctioned by the Czechs and by the Germans.</span> <span id="s977">And people were smuggled through the borders in groups.</span> <span id="s978">And then we wound up in Munich with a large group in a place called Funkkaserne, where there was a, it was kind of a huge assembly station.</span> <span id="s979">And from there they sent us to Gabersee [phonetic], where Displaced Persons went, in Gabersee.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">SS: Cause there was a camp right outside of Munich...</span></p> <p><span id="s981">JF: Well, Dachau.</span> <span id="s982">But that...</span></p> <p><span id="s983">SS: Not Dachau.</span> <span id="s984">Not Dachau.</span> <span id="s985">No, a refugee camp after...</span></p> <p><span id="s986">JF: After the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">SS: After the war.</span></p> <p><span

Funkkaserne.</span> <span id="s992">Funk-...</span></p> <p><span id="s993">SS: No, it began with an "S", Stachenberg, or...</span></p> <p><span id="s994">JF: I don't know.</span> <span id="s995">There were quite a few.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">SS: Oh, uh huh, O.K. And, so you stayed in Munich for...</span></p> <p><span id="s997">JF: And stayed...</span></p> <p><span id="s998">SS: Two weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s999">JF: For a couple of weeks until we were processed, and then we were sent to the smaller Displaced Persons camp called Gabersee, in Wasserburg.</span> <span id="s1000">The town was called Wasserburg.</span> <span id="s1001">The camp itself, the camp complex, was called Gabersee.</span> <span id="s1002">We lived there for almost two years, a little more than a year-and-a-half.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">SS: What did you do there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">JF: There we worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">SS: Oh.</span> <span id="s1006">What did you do there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">JF: My husband spoke fourteen languages.</span> <span id="s1008">He organized a school for whatever remnants of children there were in the camp.</span> <span id="s1009">There were about 1,000 people.</span> <span id="s1010">And some family units were there, because some of them survived in hiding, in Poland or Hungary.</span> <span id="s1011">So my husband organized a school and he was teaching, in every language.</span> <span id="s1012">Whatever language these children spoke, he taught.</span> <span id="s1013">I worked in the office.</span> <span id="s1014">I could type.</span> <span id="s1015">And I worked...</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">SS: Where did you learn to type?</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">JF: I typed, I learned to type when I was a teenager.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">SS: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">JF: While I was still in high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">SS: Yeah, what did you learn to type, in Hungarian?</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">JF: Yes.</span> <span id="s1022">But the typewriter is the same.</span> <span id="s1023">It's standard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">SS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">JF: When I came to America I could type in English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">SS: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">JF: The keyboard is the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">SS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">JF: And I worked with a pre-school-aged children, with little children.</span> <span id="s1030">And we made our own toys of, out of any scraps that we had.</span> <span id="s1031">And that's where we lived for a long, long time.</span> <span id="s1032">And we got rations of food and cigarettes, and money, for working.</span> <span id="s1033">And life was a lot better there.</span> <span id="s1034">But we were still in this waiting period.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">SS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">JF: And I was very distressed about having to be in Germany, finding myself in Germany after this happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">SS: Could you, did you go outside the camp...</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">JF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">SS: And mingled with the population?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">JF: A little bit, yes, a little bit.</span> <span id="s1041">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">SS: Were there more, Jews only, in this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">JF: In this camp, yes.</span> <span id="s1044">Jews only, of many nationalities.</span> <span id="s1045">Slovak, Hungarian, Czech, Polish, all kinds.</span> <span id="s1046">The German population knew who we were.</span> <span id="s1047">As we talked to them, you know, they realized who we were, and that we had the Holocaust experience.</span> <span id="s1048">And they all moaned and groaned and said, "Oh, how, what a pity.</span> <span id="s1049">And wasn't that Hitler a bad person?"</span> <span id="s1050">But let's face it, Hitler didn't do it single-handedly.</span> <span id="s1051">They had an awful lot of help.</span> <span id="s1052">He had an awful lot of willing helpers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">SS: And now, what made you come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">JF: My husband's sister came to the United States very soon after liberation.</span> <span id="s1055">She too is a survivor, but she was the first civilian who entered the United States...</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">SS: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">JF: After the war.</span> <span id="s1058">Her husband was in the United States.</span> <span id="s1059">He came with the last ship.</span> <span id="s1060">And they were legally married in Europe.</span> <span id="s1061">So he was able to bring her out here to America in August of 1945.</span> <span id="s1062">She was the first civilian to enter here.</span> <span id="s1063">And so she was in the United States.</span> <span id="s1064">I had no family whatsoever of my own.</span> <span id="s1065">And my husband...</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">SS: And you had to wait all that time for...</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">JF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">SS: For paper clearance...</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">JF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">SS: And you were, all that business.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">JF: Yes, right.</span> <span id="s1072">And my hus--I felt that if I don't have any family at least I want to be where my husband's family is, or at least a sister.</span> <span id="s1073">He wanted to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1074">He was always a Zionist.</span> <span id="s1075">And he spoke Hebrew fluently.</span> <span id="s1076">But, he managed to make a, his professional life's work teaching Hebrew, and Jewish education.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">SS: Oh, well that's nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">JF: He was director of education in a Conservative temple.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">SS: When he came to America, did you get a job right away or did, what did you do?</span> <span id="s1080">How did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">JF: When we came to America, we both were determined not to ever take a handout in our life.</span> <span id="s1082">So we did not go to the HIAS or to the Joint for any handouts.</span> <span id="s1083">I mean this is age 18, and my husband was 28.</span> <span id="s1084">We met up with some people who told us that we can get jobs in a factory.</span> <span id="s1085">We went and got jobs.</span> <span id="s1086">I lived in New York for a little while.</span> <span id="s1087">Life was terrible.</span> <span id="s1088">It was very difficult.</span> <span id="s1089">I wanted to have a baby.</span> <span id="s1090">And those were no conditions to have a baby, because if I were going to stop working and earning my twenty or twenty-two dollars a week, we would have starved.</span> <span id="s1091">And our relatives were not very generous.</span> <span id="s1092">They didn't really help us any.</span> <span id="s1093">His sister was helpful.</span> <span id="s1094">She was here for a little bit of time already in America.</span> <span id="s1095">Well, I wasn't happy with working in a factory.</span> <span id="s1096">I could type, so I occasionally was allowed to help in the office, typing envelopes and making payroll.</span> <span id="s1097">But that's not what I wanted to do.</span> <span id="s1098">So my husband and I talked about it and we decided that going to HIAS and seek help to get a job is not the same as getting a handout.</span> <span id="s1099">So he went to the HIAS and he was interviewed by a social worker.</span> <span id="s1100">And when she found out that he speaks 14 languages, including Hebrew and English, she decided that she could help him.</span> <span id="s1101">And if he is interested in leaving New York, to go elsewhere for a job, she can help him.</span> <span id="s1102">So she asked him whether he would go to Omaha.</span> <span id="s1103">She happened to have a brother who was a rabbi in Omaha, Nebraska.</span> <span id="s1104">We never heard of Omaha, Nebraska.</span> <span id="s1105">He said, "Certainly.</span> <span id="s1106">Anywhere at all."</span> <span id="s1107">And so, through the HIAS, he got this job in Omaha, Nebraska, teaching Hebrew school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">SS: Oh [unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">JF: And off we went.</span> <span id="s1110">And nine months later I had a baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">SS: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">JF: And that was the greatest moment of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">SS: Then how did you get to Allentown?</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">JF: Well, in the meantime, my husband's sister settled in Allentown.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">SS: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">JF: So we used to come from Omaha to visit her.</span> <span id="s1117">And then we lived in Flint, Michigan for three years, which was a lot closer to Allentown.</span> <span id="s1118">And one Pesach, in 1953, we came to Allentown for Pesach.</span> <span id="s1119">And the people at the temple, at the conservative temple, who by then knew my husband, offered him a job there.</span> <span id="s1120">And we were thrilled to come to live in the same city where his sister lived.</span> <span id="s1121">And we were able to raise our families, at least provide cousins if not grandparents, to have family right in the same city.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">SS: [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">JF: So that's my story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">SS: Thank you very much for sharing that story with us, and allowing this to go on the record of witnesses that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">JF: I feel it's terribly important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">SS: Yes, it is.</span> <span id="s1127">It's a very...</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">JF: I always, to the promise I made myself...</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">SS: Important [unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">JF: In Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">SS: It's not only a contribution to today, it's a contribution to...</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">JF: To the future.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">SS: The future.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">JF: Oh sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">SS: Because here it is, and it's going to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">JF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">SS: And it was just...</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">JF: Mmm hmm.</span> <span id="s1139">I continue...</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">SS: I think it's beautiful that you have gotten yourself so that you can tell it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">JF: Well I've been telling it for quite a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">SS: And here it will be on the record.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">JF: I have continued my education in the United States, as has my husband, and I became educated as a pre-school educator, pre-school teacher.</span> <span id="s1144">And I'm director of the Jewish Community Center Nursery School in Allentown for the past 32 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">SS: I can't tell you how important all this is to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">JF: So, it's been very gratifying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">SS: And to the people [noise] [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">JF: It's really quite miraculous how people are able to build lives out of the ashes, out of nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">SS: Yes.</span></p></body></html>
