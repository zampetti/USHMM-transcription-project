DIGILIO INTERVIEWER: KAETHE SOLOMON DATE: SEPTEMBER 18, 1978</span></p> <p><span id="s2">CAMP: WOEBBELIN</span></p> <p><span id="s3">Q: Before we start the interview, Mr. diGilio, do you know a Donald Walker?</span> <span id="s4">A: No I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">Q: Because we got a reply from this gentleman.</span> <span id="s6">He’s a veteran who was also in the 82nd Airborne.</span> <span id="s7">O.K. Just by way of making a statement, the name of the project is "Witness to the Holocaust."</span> <span id="s8">It's an oral history project and we're very interested in the memories of your experiences as a liberator.</span> <span id="s9">Just take yourself back to that time and share with us what you remember from that time in your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: At that particular time, I spoke German so I was used as an interpreter.</span> <span id="s11">Q: Ah, quite an advantage at the time.</span> <span id="s12">You have a book with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: Yes, this is our division history of the 82nd Airborne.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s15">Would we be able to keep that here for awhile or is it too precious to...?</span> <span id="s16">A: They're out of print and I wouldn't....</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: I can understand that.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: In fact, my wife just had the thing rebound.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: So we have a whole series of photographs and narratives in this book.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Woebbelin is the name of the concentration camp and this is you.</span> <span id="s21">All right, so you have a picture here that can take you back really to what you experienced at the time.</span> <span id="s22">Did you know that you were going to enter this camp before you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Did we know?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: Did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: No.</span> <span id="s26">I personally didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: You had no orders before you left to go to the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: No.</span> <span id="s29">At the time, this was a very fluid situation and we were on the move.</span> <span id="s30">We had covered, I guess, almost a hundred kilometers in a day and we had taken the whole 21st German Army group intact.</span> <span id="s31">It was either May 2 or May 3, 1945 that we came upon this particular camp.</span> <span id="s32">Most of these people in this particular camp were political prisoners.</span> <span id="s33">My job was just to sort out, to try to make an identification of the dead, which there were several of.</span> <span id="s34">We had a public burial in the town square in the city of Ludwigslust and every citizen -- every woman, man, and child -- had to attend that service.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Were you instrumental in rounding up the citizens?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s37">That was someone else's job.</span> <span id="s38">My job was just interrogating or questioning these people because we didn't know whether they were political prisoners or not.</span> <span id="s39">The Germans had a funny way of categorizing people.</span> <span id="s40">A habitual criminal could be categorized as a political prisoner.</span> <span id="s41">In other words, a four-time loser here would automatically be put away, incarcerated for life as a political prisoner, an enemy of the state, for the fact that he is an habitual criminal.</span> <span id="s42">So first of all, we would try to sort out to identify people who were actually criminals and those who were strictly political prisoners in the true sense of the word.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: What were you going to be doing as a result of your identification?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: If they were really people who had like been arrested for murder, rape, or something like that, they would have been taken and kept in captivity, segregated from the other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: When you entered the camp, were you aware of the fact that you were entering</span></p> <p><span id="s46">a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: We knew it was a prison of some sort.</span> <span id="s48">And, of course, there were troops there.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">I guess the night before, someone had entered it.</span> <span id="s50">There was someone there at least 24 hours -- maybe a whole day -- before I ever got to the place.</span> <span id="s51">So the main concern at that time was sorting the living from the dead.</span> <span id="s52">It was the first thing they did because there were many people who were dead and alive all intermingled together.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: When you say intermingled, what do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: As you can see by these pictures, these were piles of dead bodies in the same room with living people.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Actually sorting the piles of bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: To determine if they were dead or not dead.</span> <span id="s57">And I would say it didn’t get really too bad for these people until several weeks before the end of the war.</span> <span id="s58">That was when the German soldiers actually took off and left it to the camp overseers, who were prisoners themselves.</span> <span id="s59">Another thing we tried to do was to identify those people [camp overseers] because many of the prisoners really had a fear of talking to us and we didn't know why.</span> <span id="s60">And then we found out why.</span> <span id="s61">Some of the prisoners themselves who were fit and able to tell us things about it were really the overseers, who were actually prisoners, and there were at least a dozen of those people that we had to identify.</span> <span id="s62">Many of the people were just emaciated and in really terrible condition.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: What was their reaction to you?</span> <span id="s64">Not the ones who were well-fed but some of the emaciated that were still conscious.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: They couldn't comprehend what was going on.</span> <span id="s66">A uniform to them was a uniform, whether it had been a German or whatever.</span> <span id="s67">And they didn't really know what their lot was going to be.</span> <span id="s68">Many of these people were French or Poles and they really couldn't understand us either because of the language difficulty.</span> <span id="s69">But they all had a fair knowledge of German so rudimentary things like "how long have you been here?"</span> <span id="s70">or "why were you sent here?"</span> <span id="s71">they could answer.</span> <span id="s72">But my job was one of gathering intelligence, too.</span> <span id="s73">They couldn't tell us anything about which German units were involved, so my purpose in being there was to find out the German units involved and all of that.</span> <span id="s74">To them, the enemies were these overseers.</span> <span id="s75">At this particular camp, they had no first-hand experience with the Germans.</span> <span id="s76">The Germans had their barracks and their women outside the camp and the camp was left to people who were in the camp, who were made trustees or whatever term you want to call them.</span> <span id="s77">And they had more fear of them, I think, than the German soldiers because most of these people were mistreated by these overseers.</span> <span id="s78">You don’t really ever hear about that, but a lot of these people -- and I would venture to say probably a good many of them -- are walking the street and yet they did just as much as the [unintelligible] because people didn't identify them and they were part of the system.</span> <span id="s79">In fact, they pointed out to me one fellow who hadn't eaten in three days so he would look like he was one of the others.</span> <span id="s80">.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Purposely not eating?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Yes, so he would look like o ne of the others.</span> <span id="s83">He was laying in a bed and said he couldn't move.</span> <span id="s84">One of them pointed him out to me.</span> <span id="s85">But I was only there for two days.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: What was the physical nature of this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: [Looking at the pictures] These were barracks.</span> <span id="s88">This was where we took some of them.</span> <span id="s89">This was in a barn at a farm that was a couple of miles away.</span> <span id="s90">This was an aid station which was set up.</span> <span id="s91">But here were the [unintelligible] that some of the people who were too invalid moved to.</span> <span id="s92">They were still there and the hard thing was to determine just how sick they were and what their ailments were.</span> <span id="s93">We were afraid of contagious diseases.</span> <span id="s94">We didn't want them to infect our own troops either.</span> <span id="s95">So it was really a rough situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Were you one of these men standing around?</span> <span id="s97">[Referring to a picture]</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: The whole division was present at the mass.</span> <span id="s99">In fact, the whole division paraded and I guess it was a religious service for all denominations.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Were you near any German civilians at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s102">I interrogated a lot of the German civilians to gather information.</span> <span id="s103">Q: Were there comments on the camps on the part of the German civilians?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: I really never did determine how long it had been there, whether it had been there months or years or what, but the general populace had a “knowledge.”</span> <span id="s105">Like we know that there are prisoners in Reidsville 1.</span> <span id="s106">I couldn't tell you today what the conditions in Reidsville are because I have no first-hand knowledge; nor could a lot of the German civilians.</span> <span id="s107">Now, I’m talking about when I interrogated some of the soldiers who had been guarding the camp.</span> <span id="s108">There was a different understanding there again.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: How was that different?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: The difference was that these were political prisoners and they were sent there.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A lot of the soldiers that we interrogated thought that most of these people were habitual criminals and were wanted for murder, rape, or larceny.</span> <span id="s112">The quality of the soldiers at this particular camp wasn't high.</span> <span id="s113">They weren't the staunch SS type troopers at all.</span> <span id="s114">They were, I guess you'd call, the Volksmehr which were the old men and young boys and most of them had just been put there a few weeks or a few days before they knew we were moving.</span> <span id="s115">They were all trying to get away from the Russians.</span> <span id="s116">This was actually turned over to the 1Reidsville is a penitentiary in the state of Georgia Russians.</span> <span id="s117">This was between Hamburg, Germany and Berlin in a town called Ludwigslust.</span> <span id="s118">It's just almost half way and it's a good way into what is now the Soviet sector, so we disengaged almost immediately and went back over the Elbe River.</span> <span id="s119">We turned these people all over to the Russians so I really don't know what their fate was after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: When you showed a picture of yourself there looking at the inmates, some of them look....</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Most of these were all dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Can you think back to that time to remember how you felt when you were there looking at these inmates?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: We saw death every day, so seeing someone dead wasn't...I think if I had come upon it today, it would have a real traumatic effect on me, but there every day you were losing your friends.</span> <span id="s124">They were being killed.</span> <span id="s125">You felt sorry and all that for these people but there was no personal attachment.</span> <span id="s126">You didn't know them.</span> <span id="s127">It was the same as coming upon where a mortar shell had landed and there were 8 or 10 German soldiers who had been killed.</span> <span id="s128">There was no sense of identification.</span> <span id="s129">I think afterwards, when you had time to reflect about it, you really got a feeling of what a terrible thing it was; particularly, after the war when we learned about places like Mauning where our own troops had been massacred.</span> <span id="s130">It seemed to register more.</span> <span id="s131">But I'm saying that the division that I was with had seen an awful lot of combat, and death in itself was an every day occurrence.</span> <span id="s132">It was a very real thing and you worried about surviving.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: At that time the things in this picture were not a traumatic as....</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: No, I’m saying it was probably more traumatic to the German civilians who had to march around than it was to the soldiers who were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: The German civilians were aware that this was a political prison camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: No, I wouldn't say that they were even aware of that.</span> <span id="s137">It was a prison.</span> <span id="s138">Whether a camp -- it was a prison.</span> <span id="s139">That’s what I’m saying.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: So that gave it all a political-sociological perspective.</span> <span id="s141">That's what is done in a country.</span> <span id="s142">The prison is put in a country if you act against the country.</span> <span id="s143">Would you say they identified with that in that manner?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: I would say that they thought these were habitual criminals who were taken away from society.</span> <span id="s145">That was more of the attitude you got.</span> <span id="s146">I spent six years in Germany after the war was over with the criminal investigation division of the Army and you hear people say that every German knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s147">It's just like right now, every American doesn't know what's going on.</span> <span id="s148">Last night everything is in agreement concerning the peace talks.</span> <span id="s149">Then I just heard on the radio today Menachem Begin said that’s not the way he understood something.</span> <span id="s150">Sadat said that's not the way he understood it.</span> <span id="s151">Yet, last night, they were all clapping.</span> <span id="s152">So I mean to the American citizens, they're confused about political issues just like the Germans were.</span> <span id="s153">And I think the Germans tried to avoid knowing them because they had seen people taken away and "out of sight, out of mind."</span> <span id="s154">I think they put blinders on.</span> <span id="s155">Not that they didn't have any concern, but it was something "the same thing could happen to you."</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: How do you feel about that?</span> <span id="s157">Do you think something like that could happen in the United States in terms of putting the blinders on and not wishing to see it?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: I think it could happen anywhere.</span> <span id="s159">I’m saying particularly to the older people since we have the same problem today -- an identity with youth and the people who are maturing.</span> <span id="s160">Our mores and standards are totally different.</span> <span id="s161">For example, I can't understand people burning their draft cards.</span> <span id="s162">To somebody else, that's a meaningless thing.</span> <span id="s163">But I'm saying right or wrong, this is the country they live in and, if they don't want to fight for this country, then they should go somewhere else and not be allowed to come back as soon as it's over.</span> <span id="s164">To a lot of the Germans who had gone through 1923 when it took a billion marks to buy a loaf of bread and they now had a job and the first time they had any real stability in anything they're going to identify with good things.</span> <span id="s165">They are not going to identify with the bad things.</span> <span id="s166">It's just like the war.</span> <span id="s167">The bad things about it you rarely think about or even want to remember.</span> <span id="s168">It's the good times you had.</span> <span id="s169">We have a convention every year.</span> <span id="s170">They’re the things we always talk about.</span> <span id="s171">No one talks about the fellow who died.</span> <span id="s172">You never think anybody died because nobody talks about them because you don't want to remember.</span> <span id="s173">It was too horrible to remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: You were in Germany six years afterward.</span> <span id="s175">I imagine you spoke to many of the German civilians at that time.</span> <span id="s176">You liberated a political camp.</span> <span id="s177">Of course, there were other camps.</span> <span id="s178">Were you able to talk or get any information from the civilians about other camps, such as Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: I was stationed in Munich for a while.</span> <span id="s180">You see, the thing that most Americans did not understand about it is if you lived in this town and you wanted to go to the next town, you had to go to the police to get a permit to leave here to go there.</span> <span id="s181">You just didn't wander about the countryside in freedom.</span> <span id="s182">And this was still going on until we signed a peace treaty in 1955.</span> <span id="s183">The first thing I would check, if we arrested somebody, is whether a person had a Offenhausgenahmenung, which was a document that stated they could legally be in this town.</span> <span id="s184">That was the first thing you checked.</span> <span id="s185">Even when we were there they had to have an identity card.</span> <span id="s186">You could stop anyone on the street and ask them to show you theirs.</span> <span id="s187">So it was no different to them in the sense that a German policeman could have done it the day before the war and five years after the war an American MP could do the same thing.</span> <span id="s188">So they really didn't see any big change, other than maybe everything was more controlled.</span> <span id="s189">Even when we got there, things were more controlled.</span> <span id="s190">They couldn't go anywhere then.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Your experience then in terms of our project, "Witness to the Holocaust," really was not an experience of seeing people emaciated to such a degree because of their religious affiliation, because of their ethnic affiliation, such as the Poles or the....</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: I'm just saying these people were all Poles, French, Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians.</span> <span id="s193">I'm saying that they had a general term for people: political prisoner.</span> <span id="s194">And a political prisoner could be anything from a rapist to someone who spit in somebody's eye.</span> <span id="s195">So I'm saying that was a general category.</span> <span id="s196">The thing we always had to determine was were some of these people really habitual criminals, and some of them were.</span> <span id="s197">Like in any society, some of them were legally in prison.</span> <span id="s198">Now, they weren't entitled to the treatment they got, but they were legally entitled to be in prison.</span> <span id="s199">So I'm saying that separating that from what happened to them, regardless of what they had done, they shouldn't have had the treatment that was served them, naturally.</span> <span id="s200">And what we found out in the camps is that it wasn't the habitual prisoners that these overseers hurt or did things to.</span> <span id="s201">It was the innocent people because they were the easiest to manipulate.</span> <span id="s202">If a guy knew someone was a three-time murderer, he didn't get picked on; but if some guy was an old man and they wanted his ration, he got kicked in the head.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Did you see this as any particular religious type of persecution in general?</span> <span id="s204">This would be reflective thinking on your part, I'm sure.</span> <span id="s205">In terms of Jewish persecution, specifically since we know that six million of the eleven million were Jewish.</span> <span id="s206">When I ask did you see it as such when you got in there, did you have any of that type of orientation?</span> <span id="s207">Now that you’ve read the material, perhaps....</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: I’m trying to look at this thing in the perspective of the time rather than now.</span> <span id="s209">Q: If you can take yourself back to that time, did any of the boys talk about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Was there any feeling....[slight interruption in tape.</span> <span id="s211">Conversation resumes as follows.]</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: ...Africa to the end of the war, in many of the countries there was a marked anti-Semitic attitude.</span> <span id="s213">Even in France, because we always see things in the light we want to see them in.</span> <span id="s214">For instance, we lost more American soldiers landing in Africa that were killed by the French than were killed by the Germans and, yet, you hardly ever hear about that.</span> <span id="s215">You hardly ever hear about the other people who were persecuted either.</span> <span id="s216">I'm saying it's simply because the Jewish people do stick together and they do have a sense of unity in their own community and their religion.</span> <span id="s217">You hear more of that than the other people who were just rounded up on a random basis for reasons such as maybe they didn't pass a test in school or maybe they didn't do something else.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Created reasons.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Right.</span> <span id="s220">And I'm saying they suffered just the same thing.</span> <span id="s221">But today, if you ask most children...for instance, I was talking to my daughter, who is nine years old, about this.</span> <span id="s222">I just asked her and she told me she has a teacher who is Jewish and she said that only the Jewish people were in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s223">And I said, "No, Honey, a lot of people were in concentration camps because they would have had the cross of David over all of these people."</span> <span id="s224">And there were a few and they were buried separately because the Jewish chaplain wanted them buried separately for religious reasons.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: At this Woebbelin camp, the Jewish chaplain had them buried separately.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s227">For some reason.</span> <span id="s228">I don't know why, but they were buried separately from the Gentiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: That’s an interesting thing we haven’t come across.</span> <span id="s230">But you have discussed this with your children, which is another thing we would like to ascertain -- how much of this experience you've shared with your family.</span> <span id="s231">Did you see the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: I saw it.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: How did you feel about the portrayal in the movie in light of your experience, what it had to say, the way it had to say it?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: There’s one thing I guess I didn’t buy in the whole picture and I don't know whether that was based on fact or not.</span> <span id="s235">I would doubt very seriously that the young lady who had been married to a Jewish person would have been allowed the freedom she had.</span> <span id="s236">Knowing after the fact what we saw from records and things, she would have immediately been put on some list.</span> <span id="s237">So then she would have been considered Jewish, period.</span> <span id="s238">I think it would have even portrayed what could happen to people just by association .</span> <span id="s239">Like her going to that camp.</span> <span id="s240">I don't care on whose orders, she wouldn't have gone anywhere near any of those camps.</span> <span id="s241">That part was pure fiction.</span> <span id="s242">That kind of thing just didn't happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: In terms of your family, did it develop any discussion about your experience when they had seen it?</span> <span id="s244">Did you talk about your experiences as a result of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Do you share your experiences very often with any of your friends, with people.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: And you have no difficulty in terms of sharing what you had seen?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: What is difficult for these people to understand is that in the time this was, if I had gone to Canada like some of the kids did2, I would have wound up in Fort Leavenworth for life.</span> <span id="s250">And I'm saying that they could not understand why a German soldier didn’t just desert.</span> <span id="s251">Why didn't he just leave?</span> <span id="s252">Because the same thing would have happened to him.</span> <span id="s253">I mean that they just try to make it sould like, well, all one had to do was to say something.</span> <span id="s254">Well, all someone had to do is say something and he could get in a lot of trouble.</span> <span id="s255">I'm saying people didn't say things, not because they didn't feel something towards other people, but they had no physical means of doing anything about it.</span> <span id="s256">You kept your mouth shut and you went your merry way.</span> <span id="s257">I mean you got drafted, you went into the Army, and you did what you were told.</span> <span id="s258">And it was no different in the Italian Army, the French Army, the German Army, or the American Army.</span> <span id="s259">I'm saying people want to make things today like it would have been so simple for the German people to have done something.</span> <span id="s260">It would not have been simple at all unless they had a rebellion and they didn't have that.</span> <span id="s261">They didn't have that type of person.</span> <span id="s262">And I don't think in this country you would have a rebellion because people think equally as much of their country and I don't see where you could have a rebellion.</span> <span id="s263">If some isolated thing happened somewhere, you might have protesters.</span> <span id="s264">But I don't think you would have a rebellion simply because of our own education towards our country and all of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Do you think that the people here would follow the orders as people in Germany followed orders, which is essentially what happened?</span> <span id="s266">They did not deviate from the orders.</span> <span id="s267">Did you think that same structure could conceivably happen today?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: You have to look at people that are in the Ku Klux Klan, the Black Panthers, the Simbionese Liberation Army.</span> <span id="s269">You put those people in uniform and 2Referring to Viet Nam war draft dodgers legitimize what they are doing and they'll do it.</span> <span id="s270">So in that respect, people are people; and people will always do things for their own gratification, for greed, for self-esteem -- whatever you want to call it.</span> <span id="s271">There are certain elements in any society that will do these things.</span> <span id="s272">Just like these overseers in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: You see it as sort of a disease within society?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Right.</span> <span id="s275">And I'm saying that you put the right people in the right jobs and you'll get the jobs done and you'll get the results you want.</span> <span id="s276">I don't think that it would be any different in any country.</span> <span id="s277">You can take people who for some reason have a grudge against someone for an invalid reason.</span> <span id="s278">Someone could say tomorrow all Presbyterians are terrible and this guy's a Roman Catholic and he's been brought up that there's only one Church, and if he’s of the right frame of mind he would do the same thing.</span> <span id="s279">By indoctrination, training, all of these things could....</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Which brings me to a question in terms of religion.</span> <span id="s281">You are a..</span> <span id="s282">.</span> <span id="s283">?</span> <span id="s284">A: Presbyterian.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Taking yourself back to that experience once again, did your Presbyterian background have anything to do with...?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: I was brought up as a Catholic.</span> <span id="s287">Q: And your reason for change?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: My reason for change was that I could just never buy -- and I don't think I could ever be Jewish either -- that in the Catholic faith only Catholics are going to Heaven and everyone else...I don't know where they're going.</span> <span id="s289">I know very little about the Jewish faith, but as an outsider looking in, it's that close knit, same type of element and I think that we've got to have... When I say I'm a Presbyterian, I believe in God and that's what I'm saying.</span> <span id="s290">I believe in God and how you get to these different denominations is the same way you get to political parties.</span> <span id="s291">You have people out there beating a drum.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Did that have any particular influence on your feelings at the time that you experienced the liberation of this particular camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: The immediate thought that came to all of our minds when we saw all these people just left to die, just left to rot, was what was going on with our prisoners?</span> <span id="s294">The American soldiers who had been captured, our friends who had been captured in Africa or in Normandy.</span> <span id="s295">You started then to wonder what was happening to them.</span> <span id="s296">I think that was more of an immediate concern to all of us.</span> <span id="s297">What happened to the fellows who were taken prisoner?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Did you talk about that with your fellow....</span> <span id="s299">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: So you had plenty of time to rap that back and forth.</span> <span id="s301">What you had seen.</span> <span id="s302">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Before we go any further, I do need some questions answered for the record.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">The first one is your full name?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Edward John Digilio ... and it's di Gilio.</span> <span id="s306">Q: Your address?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: 3028 Gant Quarters Circle, Marietta, Georgia.</span> <span id="s308">Q: Is there a zip code?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Yes ... 30067.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: Your date of birth?</span> <span id="s311">A: August 30, 1926.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: And you were born where?</span> <span id="s313">A: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Your age at the time of liberation?</span> <span id="s315">A: I was eighteen years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: And your prospective profession at the beginning of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: I had joined the Army when I was sixteen so I was a professional soldier [laughs].</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: So you didn't think about too much before that time.</span> <span id="s319">And your present occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: I'm in the security business.</span> <span id="s321">I'm the assistant vice-president for Guards Mart, Inc.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: You mentioned that you knew the German language.</span> <span id="s323">How did you learn it?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: I know the German language, but I don't know it grammatically.</span> <span id="s325">In the test they give you when you go into the Army, they said I had an ability or an affinity towards languages and they sent me through school in England just before Normandy and I learned....</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Because you were so young when you went in.</span> <span id="s327">That's why I questioned you about how you knew the language.</span> <span id="s328">Your military unit?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: I was with Headquarters Company, Division Headquarters, in the 82nd Airborne Division.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: And your rank at the time of liberation?</span> <span id="s331">A: I was a sergeant.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: And the name of the camp that you liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Woebbelin.</span> <span id="s334">If you have a machine that can copy a book, you could make a copy of this portion of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: We do have a machine that can do it.</span> <span id="s336">I don't know if we can do it immediately and I know about your...I can certainly respect your feeling about not wanting to leave it here.</span> <span id="s337">If I can show it to somebody here and let them see whether or not we should add this in to our text, which I really think we should, then you can take it back home with you.</span> <span id="s338">I just want to be sure that if you have any other thoughts about this project in general, you would like to share with us to be sure to get it in terms of using this as a source of study education for the future.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: To me, I don't think we teach enough history in our schools today.</span> <span id="s340">If people really knew what other people had to go through, they would have a better appreciation of their own lives.</span> <span id="s341">If people knew the suffering in the world, not from an ice-cream soda view, but from a participant view...I don't think today, in this country, there are enough people who have had any hardships to realize what hardships really mean to people.</span> <span id="s342">When I was growing up, we had the Depression, so we had a sense of what's right and wrong...</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: A sense of deprivation, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: Right.</span> <span id="s345">And today, if a kid flunks out of one school, his father sends him to another.</span> <span id="s346">And with no effort, they get ahead in the world.</span> <span id="s347">I just pity them that something like 1929 would happen because they would be so ill-prepared, it would be terrible.</span> <span id="s348">I think we'd have anarchy; I really do because they wouldn't know how to adjust.</span> <span id="s349">They wouldn't know how to adjust to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: So you see an exposure of this phase in our history helpful in teaching future generations to cope in times of adversity.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: Right.</span> <span id="s352">Because it is still happening in plenty of places today.</span> <span id="s353">The same thing is going on.</span> <span id="s354">We're not standing up where we should be and opposing, so we're accommodating [laughs].</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: Do you see any similarities or differences between the Holocaust aspects of World War II and Cambodia, Vietnam, Bangladesh?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: No, because I don't see any parallels, if that's what you're looking.</span> <span id="s357">For one thing, in the Orient, in particular, life and death is a mute term almost.</span> <span id="s358">I'm saying they're not highly structured societies and human life...they are just pawns of people.</span> <span id="s359">In the Western world, I don't care in what country, you have some say in what's going on; but these people relate to what they're going to eat for dinner tonight.</span> <span id="s360">And it doesn't take much to influence their minds if their body is being taken care of.</span> <span id="s361">But with regard to the Poles, the Germans, the Belgians, the French, the Dutch, these people had a feeling of something to live for.</span> <span id="s362">When you realize that every year a million babies die in India, death is not one of the first things people worry about.</span> <span id="s363">It’s in a different context.</span> <span id="s364">Life and death is an entirely different context than what we feel or understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Would you say then that because of their whole sociologic outlook or lack of outlook, as opposed to our outlook, that it would be their problem because of their outlook?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: I think we've just about covered it all and I do not want to omit thanking you for sharing this time in your life with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: It's really too bad that you never got to know any of these people to find out who they were, what they were, and find out really why they were there other than they just were put there.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: You were not able to talk to any of these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: Yes, we talked to them; but can you imagine not having eaten for four or five days, how many questions you'd want to have answered?</span> <span id="s371">Or having been in a sick bed, which is rat infested and someone asking you about your home, was it a nice home.</span> <span id="s372">Can you imagine the type of answer you would get?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: How did you feel about having to ask...?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: That was the whole problem -- trying to get information out of people.</span> <span id="s375">You thought, "My God, haven't they suffered enough?</span> <span id="s376">Now we're going to ask them questions."</span> <span id="s377">And as I say, I always had the feeling that to them we were just another uniform and then tomorrow [someone else would come along.]</span> <span id="s378">And it did happen.</span> <span id="s379">Two days later the Russians came and I'm sure they started the whole thing all over again with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: So you really had to deal with your own conscience in terms of carrying out orders that you were given.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: Of course, my orders were just to try to find out who did this to these people so we could find them and hopefully do something about it.</span> <span id="s382">But, to them, they didn't know what our true intent was.</span> <span id="s383">And who knows whether even half of the people told us the truth because they thought maybe we were going to set up another camp right then.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: They were directly fearful of you.</span> <span id="s385">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s386">.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: And, certainly, sharing confidences with you....</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: I'm saying that once we started feeding them and delousing them and segregating them out and putting them in places where they had a bed to sleep and all of that this is just the time we left.</span> <span id="s389">And this is just about the time they were starting to really come around.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: [Unintelligible] realized your good intentions?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: Tes.</span> <span id="s392">We confiscated a lot of the German homes and put people in them.</span> <span id="s393">They had some food in them, they had a place to sleep, they had clean clothing.</span> <span id="s394">The Army brought in these shower units and they had them bathed and all of that.</span> <span id="s395">So they knew we were not there to hurt them then; but I'm saying with the first encounters, though, they didn't know that we were going to be any different then.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: So you weren't able to sit with someone and say, "Yes, I see what you mean."</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Right.</span> <span id="s398">Now after the war, there were these Polish Displaced Persons camps and, being in the Criminal Investigation Division, I did have occasion many times to go into the camps and talk to the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Do you remember some of these stories that were shared with you at the time you went into these Displaced Persons camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: A lot of them were caught at the time when Germany and Russia split up Poland and some other countries.</span> <span id="s401">There was more of a hatred of the Russians because the Russians didn't want them and turned them over to the Germans.</span> <span id="s402">There was real hostility to the Russians.</span> <span id="s403">They had UNRAA there.</span> <span id="s404">I don't know if you're familiar with that, which were relief agencies trying to repatriate people....</span></p> <p><span id="s405">[End of Side One.</span> <span id="s406">Conversation continues on Side Two as follows]</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: We did wrong and what I mean by that is there were collaborators in all of these countries we went into, like France and Holland and all of these places.</span> <span id="s408">And I don't think we really did a real good job of finding out who these people were.</span> <span id="s409">I think a lot of them are still around....</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Roaming around when they really haven't paid....</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Right.</span> <span id="s412">So I'm saying I don't think we did as good a job of finding all our perpetrators that we could have done.</span> <span id="s413">I guess that a lot of it is political, too, as to why we didn't or couldn't or wouldn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: You say your group gets together.</span> <span id="s415">I assume from your Division?</span> <span id="s416">A: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: You don't talk about these things or very rarely?</span> <span id="s418">A: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Never?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Have you gotten together since the time of the Holocaust movie on TV?</span> <span id="s422">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s423">We met in Phoenix, Arizona this year.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Was there any discussion as result of that movie in terms of the experiences of these men?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: I thank you very, very much for your time.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">[At this point, the interview terminates.</span> <span id="s428">The interviewer continues with comments of her own as follows.]</span> <span id="s429">There are a couple of comments I'd like to make about this respondent.</span> <span id="s430">Initially, when he walked into the interview, he brought this book with him, which is a book which describes some of the Army goings on.</span> <span id="s431">I understand it's a collector’s item now.</span> <span id="s432">He was very proud to show me the picture of himself as it is included in the material, along with a tape, looking at the inmates, who are in piles.</span> <span id="s433">He's standing next to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">He referred to this initially in his introductions as to what he was involved in.</span> <span id="s435">He also related a couple of post-war stories by way of showing me the effect that the war had on him -- when he heard a fire cracker on the Fourth of July when he was out with his family.</span> <span id="s436">It reminded him of the bomb sounds in Europe and it really shook him up.</span> <span id="s437">He said this is a way of showing you what a war experience can do to a veteran.</span> <span id="s438">He apologized because he was only a sergeant and really didn't have that much in the way of experience.</span> <span id="s439">He was sure if I talked to people who were higher up in the ranks, I would have more experience.</span> <span id="s440">I assured him that a sergeant’s point of view is equally as important because it's a personal point of view, and no matter what the rank was, the personal point of view was important.</span> <span id="s441">He was glad to be able to share this and almost left with sort of a sense of relief.</span> <span id="s442">Having just read the contents of the material that we photographed from the book that Mr. diGilio had with him, I think it's important to read page one of this context in the light of his answer to the question as to whether or not he saw the Holocaust as any particular form of religious persecution.</span> <span id="s443">I also don't recall, since I haven't relistened to the tape, whether or not the conversation about the burial was on the tape at the time of the interview because there was some talk going on when the tape was shut off.</span> <span id="s444">He indicated he had no idea as to why the Jewish Chaplain insisted that the Jewish soldiers be buried with a Star of David on their graves as opposed to a cross.</span> <span id="s445">He said, "...for some strange reason.”</span> <span id="s446">I'm not too sure if he used the word strange.</span> <span id="s447">He was very insistent upon that, so they were buried separately from the others.</span> <span id="s448">I don’t know whether or not the commentary is on the tape, but in light of some of his orientation in that field of questioning, I think perhaps it's important to know that he mentioned that in addition to looking at page one of the attached material.</span> <span id="s449">I wonder, really, if he read this material before he came to the interview.</span></p></body></html>
