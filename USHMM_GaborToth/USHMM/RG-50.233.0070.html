was December 7 that I was in Budapest with my mother and my sister Chicha and we had gone to Budapest from the small town where I lived in Kisvarda, Hungary because we had received instructions from my father in America to go to see the American consul in Budapest on Monday morning.</span> <span id="s3">It was December 8.</span> <span id="s4">But we are now December 7 and my mother and my sister and I are enjoying a very happy and special breakfast at a friend's house in a beautiful part of Budapest, Buda,as a matter of fact, and we are looking forward to the appointment tomorrow morning because that appointment is going to bring us to the promised land of America.</span> <span id="s5">And we were full of expectations and joy because we are the chosen family, the lucky ones who will escape Hitler's hatred and it was Sunday morning and we were having this wonderful breakfast and the radio was turned on by our host and we heard the announcement that Hungary has declared war against the United States and that was of course Pearl Harbor, December 7, and since Hungary declared war against the United States needless to say there was no appointment at the American consul the following morning so the very happy Sunday morning turned into a very tragic day, a very tragic breakfast and that announcement on the radio resulted in our eventual deportation to Auschwitz [Japanese naval forces attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 at 7:55 a.m Hawaii time; Hungary did not declare war on the United States on December 8, but Germany and Italy did so on December 11; Britain declared war on Hungary on December 6, 1941; the United States declared war on Hungary on June 5, 1942].</span></p> <p><span id="s6">So Hungary was not the promised land in 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Hungary was the cursed land from the day I remember.</span> <span id="s8">I was always called the dirty Jew, smelly Jew, the translation is smelly Jew.</span> <span id="s9">And I was called that by my classmates and as I was walking down the main streets of my home town Kisvarda the riffraff hanging about referred to me as the smelly Jew.</span> <span id="s10">I was not smelly, a very dear child of a wonderful Jewish family.</span> <span id="s11">I had to live with this insult always and we thought that that's the way it is everywhere.</span> <span id="s12">It's certainly that way where I am living.</span> <span id="s13">The anti-semitism was fierce always.</span> <span id="s14">If it was not on the surface it was so deeply imbedded in the character of the people we shared the town with, the non-Jews that it was a living presence always.</span> <span id="s15">I do not remember anything but an anti-semitic atmosphere.</span> <span id="s16">That's what I grew up in, that's what I lived in, that's what I hoped to escape.</span> <span id="s17">When Hitler came of course all that was intensified a thousand fold and there was no escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Could we back up a little bit and talk about the family and growing up in Kisvarda.</span> <span id="s19">When were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">In May 28 1921.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">In Kisvarda?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">In Kisvarda.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">They were, my mother I believe born in the town she grew up in she came from a town called Hajdunanas.</span> <span id="s25">I have never been there it was some kilometers away, probably not very far, but those days it seemed far.</span> <span id="s26">And she was the daughter of a very distinguished rabbi.</span> <span id="s27">It was a whole line of rabbinical background.</span> <span id="s28">From what I understand it was a very distinguished rabbinical background her mother was a Schreiber [scribe].</span> <span id="s29">The word Schreiber is a writer [a scribe] and I think in Hebrew it was called Sofair and there is great distinction to that name and I think that all of the Schreibers are the same family all over the world.</span> <span id="s30">My grandmother I think was actually the one who inherited the rabbinical seed.</span> <span id="s31">It comes from her father I believe.</span> <span id="s32">And that she must have married my grandfather whose name was Halpert and he became the rabbi of the town Hajdunanas and then he died before I was born and my mother had enormous respect and high, tremendously high regard for her father.</span> <span id="s33">I always heard her talk about her father, not so much about her mother whom we knew and I don't know, we weren't crazy about her, but my grandfather my mother spoke of with tremendously high regard that he was an extraordinarily intelligent man and a great Talmudic scholar who has written Talmudic works as many members of the family have written many large Talmudic contributions to the Talmudic literature and I remember big books that were written by them, various members of my mothers family.</span> <span id="s34">And my mother claimed always that her father as she spoke of him she would say that he was a very sensitive man and that he was very intelligent and he was so sensitive that he could not live with the idea that man kills his fellow man and evidently he died of a heart attack.</span> <span id="s35">But my mother always associated his death with the first world war that it was such a blow to his philosophy of humanity that he couldn't live with the brutality of the war even though I am sure that he knew the history of the world was full of wars but probably because he was right in the midst of this world wide conflict which was evidently not much of a war in comparison to the one that followed it.</span> <span id="s36">And I always heard these very sensitive talks about my grandfather.</span> <span id="s37">She evidently loved him very much.</span> <span id="s38">I never met him.</span> <span id="s39">He died during the first world war, several years before I was born.</span> <span id="s40">My mother was one of seven children.</span> <span id="s41">There were five girls and two boys.</span> <span id="s42">Both of the boys became rabbis.</span> <span id="s43">My uncle, one of my uncles, was the rabbi in [ph 124 Shumkutch?]</span> <span id="s44">which eventually became Romania and Transylvania you know after the first World War and I remember him well because he came to our house once and I remember him on a Sunday morning listening to the radio and because in his own home as a rabbi he did not have one in those days and he was an enormously tall beautiful looking man with a long beard and the long kaftan and a remarkably sophisticated for the position he was in.</span> <span id="s45">And my mothers younger brother became the rabbi after his father died in this town, Hajdunanas, but also very tall and very distinguished looking gentleman.</span> <span id="s46">Whenever I heard about my mother's family from strangers, visitors, people who we met as we travelled somewhere, that they were a very special family because the members of the family were very intelligent and very cultivated people.</span> <span id="s47">My mother was in particular spoken of as the most intelligent of all.</span> <span id="s48">The kids who had worldly ambitions that she could not fulfill because she was the daughter of a rabbi.</span> <span id="s49">She had to toe the line so to speak and could not do really what she wanted to do, but her mind was so active that she absorbed all of the worldly influences not only that came her way but that she sought out and she was a reader.</span> <span id="s50">She's read such an enormous amount.</span> <span id="s51">She was so cultivated and her ambition was to become a physician which she, of course, could not fulfill because of the status of her family.</span> <span id="s52">You know the very religious rabbinical daughter would not go to a medical school, of course, but she would have to get married at the age of eighteen or nineteen to a chosen groom who was of high reputation.</span> <span id="s53">My father was the son of a landowner, a very religious Jewish family from a small town.</span> <span id="s54">But an arranged marriage came about because he was an outstanding Talmudic Yeshiva Bucher.</span> <span id="s55">How do you translate Yeshiva Bucher?</span> <span id="s56">[Yeshiva student]</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Rabbinical school Rabbinical school and he had an extraordinary mind.</span> <span id="s58">As people were talking about my mother being so very intelligent he was being talked about as being the most learned Talmudic student and indeed he was really famous.</span> <span id="s59">Even to the point if today I go to one of these weddings, the descendants of these people who come from my mother's hometown or my hometown or any other part of Hungary, they would remember this very intelligent Toby, my mother's Yiddish name.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Toby Tereza, Terry Maria Tereza was her Hungarian name</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Maria Tereza?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Maria Tereza, evidently she was named after the Hapsburg queen and my mother named me after Queen Isabella.</span> <span id="s63">I don't know what the association is the royal hangup.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Could you please spell your mother's name?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">I think it was T E R E Z A .</span></p> <p><span id="s66">And her last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">H A L P E R T</span></p> <p><span id="s68">And your father's?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">My father's name was Menhir.</span> <span id="s70">I heard it spelled as Menyhert the e has an umlaut [accent], Katz K A T Z. And he was a very handsome looking man, a really beautiful face.</span> <span id="s71">He was totally different from my mother.</span> <span id="s72">My mother was steeped in this quiet worldly knowledge and cultivation of music and literature and my father shut all of that out entirely and was only interested and focused in on Hasidic and Talmudic matters and Talmudic world.</span> <span id="s73">That was his world.</span> <span id="s74">So they were really two opposites, yet giants in their own rights equally matched in level of intellect Yes the level of intellect was on par evidently but one was in total opposition to the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">What kind of schooling did your mother have?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Probably public school and probably not much schooling because that was forbidden also in that circle but tremendous self education.</span> <span id="s77">That was probably on par with any college eduction that we know.</span> <span id="s78">The six children who came to this insane world of Auschwitz and some of us survived, then to America - whatever we are is what my mother poured into us; not my father at all because we were not interested in his world but my mother poured so much into us that I feel we have had an education on top of whatever little education was available to people in our station.</span> <span id="s79">It was so hugely enriched by my mother who endowed us with it, never stopped.</span> <span id="s80">I remember we would ask her questions and she would say "How would I know.</span> <span id="s81">I was six years old a long time ago."</span> <span id="s82">Two minutes later she gave the answer, of course.</span> <span id="s83">She had the answer to almost everything.</span> <span id="s84">We all talk about her with such rich memories and admiration and I am sure it is justified.</span> <span id="s85">So many people cannot be wrong.</span> <span id="s86">So many people who still mention her with such reverence.</span> <span id="s87">I personally was unquestioningly like my father.</span> <span id="s88">There was something about her and he was nowhere near as good and gentle as my mother.</span> <span id="s89">He was much rougher in many ways but somehow I liked him.</span> <span id="s90">I always had criticism from my mother but I didn't like many of the things, many of her ways, but I am my mothers daughter and I am trying to fulfill her expectations of me, almost totally ignoring what my father might have expected from us.</span> <span id="s91">As a matter of fact I think all of us are fulfilling the expectations my mother had of us and trusted that we would come through with those values that she poured into us that were so important to her.</span> <span id="s92">And I think we did come through intact almost with her values and her ideas about life both in humanitarian method which was the number one issue in her life - to be an absolute humanitarian.</span> <span id="s93">Although she was fully aware of the cruelties that man is capable of.</span> <span id="s94">I think that probably she didn't know the details of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s95">She never even heard of Auschwitz because maybe in this country there were headlines in the New York Times but we never heard the word Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s96">We lived in a totally repressive country where fascism was the order of the day.</span> <span id="s97">We didn't know anything.</span> <span id="s98">We only knew what Hitler fed us in the controlled press and the controlled radio.</span> <span id="s99">So we had absolutely no way of knowing anything and we certainly didn't know they were burning people and because we were the last country occupied, all those years passed us by with deprivations.</span> <span id="s100">We did not get enough potatoes or enough bread because Hitler stole everything from my country.</span> <span id="s101">But we lived in our homes and we had no idea.</span> <span id="s102">We never heard the word Warsaw ghetto, only some of these people who were in leadership positions all over.</span> <span id="s103">The world knew a great deal more than we knew.</span> <span id="s104">We are even accused today.</span> <span id="s105">Why didn't we do something?</span> <span id="s106">Why didn't we go.</span> <span id="s107">Who knew anything and certainly who would expect that the war is not going to end and we will be alive.</span> <span id="s108">We have suffered deprivations, separation from my father and everything sounded terribly ominous and frightening from what we heard of Hitler's speeches which were on incessantly and that he hates the Jews but none of that added up to a crematorium and we knew that certain people were caught and interrogated and beaten.</span> <span id="s109">We heard these stories from people who passed by trying to escape from neighboring countries which were occupied by Hitler, like Czechoslovakia and Romania.</span> <span id="s110">They passed through and told us some horror tales.</span> <span id="s111">Those people were interrogated but no one said anything about people being transported in cattle cars to another planet named Auschwitz and burned.</span> <span id="s112">When we heard these gruesome stories we were as incredulous as people are today when we tell them about the holocaust.</span> <span id="s113">Who would believe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">What kind of stories did you hear from refugees?</span> <span id="s115">Were they coming from Poland or Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">No not from Poland or Germany.</span> <span id="s117">They usually came from Slovakia and Czechoslovakia and Romania.</span> <span id="s118">Those around us who passed by managed to escape and they found a nice lodging in my home because my mother was always in the forefront of aiding the disadvantaged.</span> <span id="s119">So as children we listened to some of these tales but there were not that many people who escaped and found their way to our home and how much do children believe; today there is television to show them what happens in Ethiopia and children starving and all these horrible things that are.</span> <span id="s120">But at least it's shown on TV.</span> <span id="s121">It is more believable.</span> <span id="s122">But then the kids go back to school and go and listen to their rock and roll music and figure it is far away, it's not where we are; it's not going to happen to us, we are human beings.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Speaking of school what kind of schools did you attend?</span> <span id="s124">Can you tell us something about going to school in Kisvarda?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Yes, there was a Jewish elementary school that my family was not allowed to attend because my father was an anti-zionist.</span> <span id="s126">And they taught about zionism in the Jewish school.</span> <span id="s127">It's kind of crazy.</span> <span id="s128">My father sent me to a non-Jewish school, the town elementary school,then we would go to junior high there.</span> <span id="s129">And it starts somewhere early.</span> <span id="s130">We didn't go to gymnasium, but very few Jews attended the gymnasium and it wouldn't have been people like my father's children because he wouldn't allow us to go for that worldly education.</span> <span id="s131">Wo you know it starts somewhere after Junior High and maybe it starts early enough, before eighteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Fourteen or so?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Probably there were some kind of courses that we were attending.</span> <span id="s134">I remember that one time Hungary was friends with Italy when Mussolini was still the good guy and there was something called Istituto Italiana di Cultura and we attended courses like that and there was a tremendous amount of self education and reading and a tremendous amount at home and my mother's prompting and the kids all were very interested in all of the worldly matters and that kind of education went on in the home forever.</span> <span id="s135">When my father went to America we were able to send Rachel to a more....</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Rachel being your younger sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">My younger sister.</span> <span id="s138">My father was no longer there so my mother was able to send her to further schooling.</span> <span id="s139">I don't know how far she got but then when it came to my youngest sister, Potyo, it was the antisemitism.</span> <span id="s140">When Hitler came was at our doorstep I know that she was brutalized.</span> <span id="s141">Her school life was cut short with real brutality.</span> <span id="s142">I think she was thirteen and a half when she was killed.</span> <span id="s143">I think she was thirteen in January and she was killed in May in 1944.</span> <span id="s144">But as she was going to school she was - I don't know a year or two, sometime before they deported us I don't have the time frame - she developed the - what is this thing you get?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Appendicitis?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Appendicitis, and she had to be operated on.</span> <span id="s147">In those days an operation like that was a major event and you had to stay home at least six weeks after the operation.</span> <span id="s148">I don't know how long she was in the hospital but she had to be removed from school and had to have surgery.</span> <span id="s149">When she was at home recovering and was getting very lonely and anxious to go back to school and my mother went to her school.</span> <span id="s150">They refused her.</span> <span id="s151">She was not permitted to reenter school because she was out.</span> <span id="s152">Once she was out for that long time they got rid of her and that was another Jewish kid they got rid of and they don't have to take her back.</span> <span id="s153">She was no longer in the school system.</span> <span id="s154">They refused to take her back and I remember the child suffering enormously, pleading with my mother that she should go back to school and beg the principal to take her back.</span> <span id="s155">She was lonely and she was not learning anything and all her friends were in school and it was a tragic time.</span> <span id="s156">In the end she wound up in Auschwitz and she never went back to school.</span> <span id="s157">But I remember it with great pain, how she suffered from not being allowed to reenter school.</span> <span id="s158">Now some of the other Jewish kids probably continued but this was a good way to get rid of another Jewish child.</span> <span id="s159">There is lots to say about my sister Potyo who was truly a child of war, as we all were children of war, but none more than she was because she was really born into the war.</span> <span id="s160">She was 13 years old.</span> <span id="s161">I'm talking now about 1944 so she must have been born in 1931.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Her name was?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Her name was Helen but we called her Potyo that's some kind of endearing term for I don't know "the little one" The baby in the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Yes, the baby in the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">And that's spelled?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">POTYO O with an umlaut [accent].</span> <span id="s167">And she was a very beautiful child and different from the other children in my family.</span> <span id="s168">Hitler was riding high already when she was growing up and she didn't even know anything else than a life that is colored by Hitler and his speeches and everything else.</span> <span id="s169">She was a different kind of child from the rest of us, tremendously self- centered and obviously a very intelligent child.</span> <span id="s170">You know I have great pain talking about her even now and by now she would be well over 50.</span> <span id="s171">She would be an old woman and it would....</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Over 50, that's not old.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">But to me she is that child, that beautiful 13 year old lean child who evidently knew nothing but fear and love in her - this enormous love for the family and this fear of what Hitler's era did to her and the war came.</span> <span id="s174">She was 9 years old when the war broke out and I can only think of her as fear and love and by fear i mean the fact that she was so terrified of being torn away from the family.</span> <span id="s175">She was already a tall little girl a normal not a little bit of a child, but a growing little child and she insisted on sleeping with my mother.</span> <span id="s176">When my father left she always slept with my mother, but even when my father was home she wanted to sleep with my mother because she was afraid.</span> <span id="s177">I remember I do not know if other members of my family remember her crying out in the middle of the night having terrible dreams and it was Hitler, something about Hitler.</span> <span id="s178">So this was a child of fear and love.</span> <span id="s179">The love of her family was enormous and I think her death might be somewhat the result of her wanting to be with her mother because I am sure that she hung onto my mother, wanted to go with her wherever she was going and sure enough Mengele did ask her.</span> <span id="s180">From the accounts I heard from my sisters, my two sisters who were on their way to the crematorium because Mengela picked us out separately.</span> <span id="s181">He picked out Chicha and myself first and my older sister, Cipi, and Rachel kept going to the crematorium and then Mengele turned around the group and made another selection.</span> <span id="s182">I think Rachel still to this day does not remember if it was Potyo or she who answered Mengele's question of "Du kleine, wie alt bist du?"</span> <span id="s183">and you little one, how old are you?</span> <span id="s184">And the indication was that he asked her for her age to contemplate to pick her out.</span> <span id="s185">Had she said 15 he probably would have put her out to the life side but my sister Rachel does not remember if it was the child who answered, Potyo, that she was only 13, not saying that I am 13 and a half but lying a half a year, or she, Rachel, said it; and that sentence haunted, has been haunting Rachel all her life and she still doesn't know if she said it or the child said it and she's never free of guilt and its been a terrible life for her because she has been suffering tremendously.</span> <span id="s186">And Potyo wanted to go with my mother.</span> <span id="s187">Whether Potyo was killed with my mother in the crematorium or whether she was put in the open fire that they built in those days when the Hungarian Jews were brought in.</span> <span id="s188">The crematoriums were working day and night in Auschwitz and they burned according to the Kapo who told us, who was there many years before.</span> <span id="s189">She survived a number of years.</span> <span id="s190">Eventually she was killed also, but she told us that never had she seen in Auschwitz this kind [ph 510 homage] as when the Hungarian Jews were brought in.</span> <span id="s191">And whereas they used to burn 10,000 people a day they were burning 10 to 24,000 people a day and the crematoriums.</span> <span id="s192">I think there were 5 of them.</span> <span id="s193">Four or five of them were not proved sufficient enough for the daily carnage so they built open fires and evidently Elie Wiesel saw some of these live children being thrown into the fires because there was no room in the crematoriums.</span> <span id="s194">And I am still haunted because I don't now if Potyo because she was a child was thrown alive into the open fire or if she was put into the crematorium but I do know this much that I saw the flames and I heard the shrieks and it was obvious that in addition to the fire that was burning in the crematoriums there was another fire to accommodate the extra world of the extra burden of Jews that they felt had to be burned up so there was a lot of live burning.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Do you recall the date?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Oh yes it was May 31, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Just a day after your birthday?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">No, we left Kisvarda on the May 29 and my birthday is on May 28 and that's the day we were packing for what they called the deportation and we didn't know what the hell it meant, deportation.</span> <span id="s199">But we were packing getting ready for this.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Who ordered you to pack?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Who ordered us to pack?</span> <span id="s202">The sixteen year old SS who came into the ghetto of Kisvarda with a silver pistol and a dog.</span> <span id="s203">I guess a German Shepherd and this is the first time we saw the Germans because after that point Hitler marched into Hungary on March 19, 1944 Sunday afternoon then in quick succession because they have learned their own method of madness by then so well of how to kill Jews.</span> <span id="s204">First they started manually killing one by one then they developed these incredibly sophisticated ways of burning them and gassing them and burning them and all that, and by the time it came to Hungary what they started in 1939 what they started in Poland, let's say, ended up in Hungary as a push button system and that's how they were able to desecrate the Hungarian Jewish population in a matter of three weeks I believe.</span> <span id="s205">600,000 Hungarian Jews I believe, it was a highly developed system.</span> <span id="s206">But Hitler marched in on March 19 1944 and probably about four weeks later, which was the day after Passover they allowed us to stay in our homes on Passover, for Passover, and the day after Passover we were herded into the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">By the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">By the Hungarians.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">By the Hungarians?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">By the Hungarian Gendarmes the most cruel creatures on the face of the earth with their high hats and feathers and rifles and shoulders.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">No Germans in Kisvarda yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">No.</span> <span id="s213">It was the Gendarmes - the I don't remember much activity by the policemen but I do remember the Gendarmes.</span> <span id="s214">I remember clearly two Gendarmes took each family into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s215">They came to each home - two Gendarmes - and delivered them into the ghetto with their fifty kilos on their backs.</span> <span id="s216">And we did not see the Germans.</span> <span id="s217">Evidently the machinery worked in such a way that the Germans had no authority on the fate of the Hungarian Jews until just before the deportation and then they seemed to co-mingle with the Gendarmes - the Gendarmes and the Nazis, the SS.</span> <span id="s218">The first time we saw the SS was on Sunday afternoon May 28, 1944, on my birthday.</span> <span id="s219">And he came in with the Gendarmes and they lined up all of the ...I remember this beautiful sunny afternoon in May and we were ordered out of our cramped quarters and I think in each courtyard they lined them up - I think the gendarmes did that and the ghetto police and people who worked in the ghetto in some kind of leadership positions - and we were to appear in the courtyard and then the Nazi came and he announced each name.</span> <span id="s220">As he called out the names, the names that were called out had to move over to the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">How did they know the names?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">The names were collected well in advance by the Jewish management -people evidently the Nazis had dealt with from Budapest throughout the country with this.</span> <span id="s223">They had various.....</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Did you have a council?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Yea, they had a council I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">How far back was this council set up?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Oh this was after Hitler marched in but before we were taken to the ghetto because this was when we were in our home yet.</span> <span id="s228">And they had an actual census taker - one or two people assigned for these jobs.</span> <span id="s229">Whether they were paid jobs, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s230">But I know that they came to our home.</span> <span id="s231">They went to each home with a form and they listed each person living in that home.</span> <span id="s232">So there was no escape from that.</span> <span id="s233">You couldn't lie and say Mrs. Katz lives here but her children are not living here - everybody was listed.</span> <span id="s234">And they compiled this - it was a regular census taking of Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Only of Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Only of Jews, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">And no one suspected anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Noone suspected anything.</span> <span id="s239">We knew that Hitler is doing his things but what this would result in, we didn't know.</span> <span id="s240">This was another craziness that we had to comply with.</span> <span id="s241">And a lot of the orders prior to taking us to the ghetto were handed down to us by a town crier in the center of town, in the circle; the town crier with his drum and his little funny hat and his uniform with a very important air about him.</span> <span id="s242">He was an absolute idiot but he knew how to tap this out and how to read enough to read the orders that came to him from Budapest or from the council, certainly from the Nazi machinery.</span> <span id="s243">And he would read out these orders.</span> <span id="s244">Whether you were in the town square or not you had to know the orders.</span> <span id="s245">Not knowing the law was no excuse of course like it isn't here either.</span> <span id="s246">The kids would run home and tell their parents that these were the new orders and all that and then an hour later he would appear again and give out new orders - Jews cannot have bicycles.</span> <span id="s247">You have to take them into the town hall.</span> <span id="s248">Jews can have no radios.</span> <span id="s249">This happened all the time and larger news came from the Fascist newspapers that we were still able to purchase in which they what the Jewish star has to be made of - how many inches of the yellow star, which side of the coat you have to wear it on.</span> <span id="s250">All of these things came from the newspapers and then they were repeated by the town crier and the restrictions - every minute something else - every hour something else.</span> <span id="s251">All of this was heralded through the radio while we still had the radio, before we had to turn it in - and the newspapers and the town crier.</span> <span id="s252">We were bombarded with it day and night.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">You had to move out of your home, didn't you?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">We did not have to move out of our home until they took us, until the two gendarmes came and took each family from the home and took us to the ghetto and then we ...</span></p> <p><span id="s255">So you lived outside of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">We lived on the main street in a perfectly beautiful home.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">And you weren't forced to move into the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Not for - it happened so fast.</span> <span id="s259">He marched in March 19.</span> <span id="s260">I don't know when Passover was then.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">April Well, we had our Passover at home and the day after Passover the two gendarmes came to each home with the list.</span> <span id="s262">In this home in this address these are the number of Jews who live.</span> <span id="s263">And we were given orders to take 50 kilos of our best clothing and best food.</span> <span id="s264">Of course which they confiscated immediately.</span> <span id="s265">They made us bring our finest clothes for the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">So you brought your best clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Oh absolutely.</span> <span id="s268">I remember what I was wearing when we boarded the cattle car.</span> <span id="s269">I was wearing a beautiful big flowing cashmere coat with brown suede platform shoes made to order.</span> <span id="s270">They were beautiful and I had a beautiful big handbag, beige, matching my coat.</span> <span id="s271">It was summer.</span> <span id="s272">It was May, it was hot but we didn't know where we were going.</span> <span id="s273">We dared not take our best coat.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">They didn't tell you where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Deportation, to the east.</span> <span id="s276">Whatever that meant, we had no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Do you recall what your mother was wearing?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">I"m afraid I don't but it seems to me that she was wearing a wig usually, but this time she was wearing a kerchief on her head instead of wearing a wig and I remember her frantically shopping for last minute food.</span> <span id="s279">They had kept the Jewish food stores open until a minute before they took us away, ten o'clock in the morning or whenever they had to close the Jewish shops and I remember my mother sending me out to the store.</span> <span id="s280">That was very fancy, like a delicatessen kind of store right outside of our courtyard on the main street.</span> <span id="s281">And she sent me out for a quarter pound of butter or something and I remember how the lady (by the way lived in our courtyard also, the people who owned the store, and they were very successful and it was a very elegant store.)</span> <span id="s282">She was counting the pennies how I paid for the butter.</span> <span id="s283">In that respect it seems like insanity that I had to give every last penny that the butter was priced at because I guess she thought she was coming back.</span> <span id="s284">Of course, she was killed immediately.</span> <span id="s285">She was a young woman.</span> <span id="s286">Her husband and her two children, they were all murdered immediately.</span> <span id="s287">And then the gendarmes came and rolled down the iron roller the way they used on the stores there.</span> <span id="s288">Shut the stores down.</span> <span id="s289">But I remember my mother went out to the market.</span> <span id="s290">There was a marketplace where you would buy live chickens, fruits and all kinds of things while they were available.</span> <span id="s291">I clearly remember that my mother, a woman who came from such a religious background, went out to the market and bought ham because she wanted her children to be well fed in the train on that trip going east because there was no use trying to be kosher anymore.</span> <span id="s292">At least to her it was more important that her children should have some nourishing food than that it should be kosher.</span> <span id="s293">I'm not even sure that she ate it but I remember that she bought ham for us - so that we would have a ham sandwich on the train.</span> <span id="s294">We didn't know then that it was a cattle car.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">You expected to travel in a passenger coach?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">We had no idea because we didn't see these cattle cars before they pulled up.</span> <span id="s297">As a matter of fact we never saw them until they pulled up because we sat out at the railroad station on the sand.</span> <span id="s298">We were kind of lying down and devastated by heat and thirst and then we were guarded by Germans and the gendarmes and everyone with rifles and we just couldn't stand on our feet so we lay down on our backpacks.</span> <span id="s299">The insanity began but we didn't know what we were waiting for and we waited all the way till the afternoon.</span> <span id="s300">I think they took us away in the morning from the ghetto to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s301">We didn't know what we were waiting for.</span> <span id="s302">So we were at the railroad station but there were no cars yet.</span> <span id="s303">There were no trains.</span> <span id="s304">And then these cattle cars pulled up.</span> <span id="s305">That's what we were waiting for all day, evidently.</span> <span id="s306">And the cattle cars pulled up and they shoved us in and the little window in the cattle car was barred with iron bars and then we found ourselves 75 or maybe more standing in this cattle car like sardines.</span> <span id="s307">And then the fun began.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">This was when you were separated from your baggage at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">No we were separated from the baggage - I am talking now about Kisvarda - we were not separated from our baggage until we arrived in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">So the baggage went into the cattle cars with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Yes and we were trying to sit on those baggages.</span> <span id="s312">I remember my mother was sitting against the wall, the far wall of the cattle car on these baggages that we had arranged for her and she was sitting there with my sister, Potyo, and my brother kind of laid down in front of her, he placed some other backpacks - it was 50 kilos each of us carried and he laid them down.</span> <span id="s313">But there was not enough room so he lay on top of that and we sat on top of him, sort of.</span> <span id="s314">And of course there were no sanitary - there was some kind of a....</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A barrel?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">It wasn't a barrel.</span> <span id="s317">It was something smaller than that.</span> <span id="s318">That's what we used for a toilet and it was splashing all over</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A bedpan?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">It wasn't a bedpan.</span> <span id="s321">It was one of those big [kubel] 803 we used to call it, [kubel].</span> <span id="s322">Then it was splashing all over.</span> <span id="s323">By this time the whole thing was out of this world.</span> <span id="s324">People screaming, and I had my period and I couldn't change my napkin, and people were dying already and going mad.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Did anyone argue or resist in any way before getting on the train?</span> <span id="s326">I imagine the moment you saw these cattle cars, must have been a shock of some sort.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">We were surrounded by men with rifles.</span> <span id="s328">They all wore rifles, the SS had the ----------[814] those pistols.</span> <span id="s329">And all these aides, Hungarians and Germans, they were all wearing rifles and we knew they shoot immediately.</span> <span id="s330">You know if your spine was crooked they'll shoot you.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">So you were too afraid to complain?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Oh there was no way to oppose, to do anything because these were not fighters.</span> <span id="s333">These were children and old people.</span> <span id="s334">The young men were all taken away long before into the labor battalions.</span> <span id="s335">And these were all young people and women and children and old and sick.</span> <span id="s336">What were you going to fight with?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Your entire family?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">The six of us.</span> <span id="s339">The six children and my mother.</span> <span id="s340">My father was already in America.</span> <span id="s341">But my brother did try, fought the best he could.</span> <span id="s342">He went over to the Nazi at one of the stops, when we were already choking because there was no air through that barred window, and he tried to make a deal with him to take off the bars so that more air would come in.</span> <span id="s343">I think that there was one at this end and one at the other end, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s344">And he tried to pry it I think with his hands apart to get some air.</span> <span id="s345">And as the train stopped he dared to go over to the Nazi and offer him some kind of bribe and for some reason I seem to remember, but he could tell you this better, there was some kind of a scissors they needed, or something or other, I wish you would check with him.</span> <span id="s346">He gave them a scissors or something and then he didn't keep his promise.</span> <span id="s347">He was going to pry the window open but he didn't keep his promise.</span> <span id="s348">He took the scissors.</span> <span id="s349">I don't know if I'm telling you the story right.</span> <span id="s350">It's something that you might want to check with him.</span> <span id="s351">But he fought to get us air, I know that.</span> <span id="s352">He fought as best as he could.</span> <span id="s353">And the rest of us I guess want to stay alive until we finally arrive at this "east" place that we are deported to and where the families will be together we heard.</span> <span id="s354">And they will have good treatment.</span> <span id="s355">We will work for the war effort but we will be treated well.</span> <span id="s356">We heard these talks somewhere along that we will be treated well and work for the war effort and families will be together.</span> <span id="s357">So all we wanted to do is arrive at this precious place, you see, this east where we are deported to and the families will be together.</span> <span id="s358">So lets get this insane trip over with because after this everything will be all right.</span> <span id="s359">And after that, two days later, we arrived at someplace that said Auschwitz M[861].</span> <span id="s360">And we had no idea what that meant.</span> <span id="s361">And then it all began, you know.</span> <span id="s362">Mengele and the crematoriums and the whole thing but you probably don't want to hear about that.</span> <span id="s363">You have enough of that.</span> <span id="s364">All over.</span> <span id="s365">My mother, I remember, sitting through those two days from Monday afternoon through Wednesday afternoon.</span> <span id="s366">That's how long the trip took.</span> <span id="s367">She sat against that wall cuddling my little sister and her eyes were filled with perception of this thing that we are in and that we are going to and there was no question that she knew in her soul what is happening.</span> <span id="s368">She knew that this is the final road, the final trip, that this will result in death.</span> <span id="s369">I don't know how she could have known there was a crematorium or a gas chamber but in her soul it was obvious that she knew everything and there was only one prayer in her eyes as she kept looking at her children that they should survive this, that they should outlive this madness because there is a world out there that has humanity still locked in somewhere and this is a passing madness of a madman but there is goodness and there is dignity and there is life and there is purpose and man has a mind with which he can create wondrous things and we should live up to those images in her head, those ideas that she had rather than what the moment is which is evidently the ugliest part of humanity and that we have to go beyond that and look for that in man which is noble and creative and good and has intellect of mind.</span> <span id="s370">All of these things were written in her eye.</span> <span id="s371">She spoke to us silently.</span> <span id="s372">She knew everything.</span> <span id="s373">I remember her having kind of a resigned look.</span> <span id="s374">I will not live but remember that there is so much to live for and you all should live for what can be not what is now here in front of us.</span> <span id="s375">To me it was unmistakable that she never stopped transmitting these messages while she was rocking in that hideous cattle car.</span> <span id="s376">That car was jerking like this.</span> <span id="s377">I just have no doubt about it that she spoke to us all the time without saying anything.</span> <span id="s378">And I think her legacy was heard by us and understood and in some mysterious way it added to the effort that we made to stay alive.</span> <span id="s379">Had we not come from such a noble heart as she had I don't know if we would have been able to make that kind of effort to survive.</span> <span id="s380">But there's no question that she handed down that legacy.</span> <span id="s381">Now you can say this about all mothers, that their love carried through those who survived and they remembered their mother's legacy.</span> <span id="s382">This is the way I have to talk about my mother because she had such largness in her heart.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">I can't put it any other way except that for two days she fed us her vision of a humanity that's greater than what Hitler has created.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">It seems like she had two visions, the vision of death and the vision of the triumph of humanity.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">She had the vision of her own life and the triumph of humanity.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Was she the only person in your car to imagine that this was the end?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">No, I shouldn't think so.</span> <span id="s388">I don't know if we saw it as the end.</span> <span id="s389">Remember we were young and healthy and not willing to bow our head to Hitler.</span> <span id="s390">There is the fighting spirit for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Determination?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Yeah, we were not willing to accept Hitler as the last word.</span> <span id="s393">There is something else out there and we're going to destroy this Hitlerism, this Hitler world when we're free and we can add our voice to those who create a better world.</span> <span id="s394">And I guess we always tried.</span> <span id="s395">We heard.</span> <span id="s396">After all it's that spirit that moved me to wheel the stroller through the Washington marches in the Vietnam days.</span> <span id="s397">I took both my kids, my husband and my two kids and we protested the Vietnam war.</span> <span id="s398">It was that same spirit that we have to fight for a better world, and I fought.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Were there discussions in the train?</span> <span id="s400">Do you recall any discussions among the various families?</span> <span id="s401">You probably knew some of the other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">There was no way to get to anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">No, within your cattle car.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Yes but within the cattle car there was no way to move to the other end of the cattle car so we were in this spot, in this tiny little spot, the seven of us and you couldn't even go to the left or to the right.</span> <span id="s405">There was no room.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">But you recognized some of the other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">I don't remember anybody or anything.</span> <span id="s408">I only remember this little group huddled together trying to make it through the night.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Very little talking?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Remember the clattering of the cattle car is very noisy.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Prayers?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">I don't remember praying.</span> <span id="s413">I'm sure people were praying but I remember hearing screams and nightmarish screams of all kinds.</span> <span id="s414">People were going mad and people were dying, and the moans of the sick.</span> <span id="s415">Who can ever describe that kind of ride.</span> <span id="s416">You know it is very hard to tell after so many years but I think we were focused in on my mother's soul and that soul must have been incessantly feeding us messages of life, not death.</span> <span id="s417">That's how I see it.</span> <span id="s418">You will talk to my brother and I don't know what he will say but this is my inner interpretation of that trip.</span> <span id="s419">No, we didn't see anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">It was dark, wasn't it?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Of course it was dark.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">You had no windows.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">No light.</span> <span id="s424">Who could hear from the screams and the tremendous noise of the rattling of the cars.</span> <span id="s425">You couldn't hear your own voice.</span> <span id="s426">You could only hear your inner voice which gave you a mandate to live or end it right here - let me die or go on.</span> <span id="s427">Philip was an extraordinary force of strength.</span> <span id="s428">He was all of 19 or 20, 21 and he knew that he was the man in the family that he's responsible as like he was the father of these six women.</span> <span id="s429">He was just great.</span> <span id="s430">He always has been.</span> <span id="s431">He is still the father of us all.</span> <span id="s432">He is treating us as if we are his children and that my mother ordered him to shield her children.</span> <span id="s433">And he was shielding us all the time and he tried.</span> <span id="s434">How he managed to talk to the Nazis, I don't know, but he tried to do some kind of negotiation.</span> <span id="s435">His story might be entirely different than mine but these are my inner interpretations of what my mother was and my baby sister who couldn't breathe.</span> <span id="s436">Probably wouldn't let her finger go.</span> <span id="s437">She must have held on to my mother with her entire body and everything within her.</span> <span id="s438">My older sister, Cipi she was one of these suffering more grown children because there were only the two little ones and my brother who was shielding everybody and then there were the three grown girls and she had the bewildered protective look about her if I can remember.</span> <span id="s439">But she was very protective also, always.</span> <span id="s440">She was a very good-hearted woman who had a tendency to speak first and think about it later.</span> <span id="s441">But the first instinct was always good - to be good.</span> <span id="s442">I remember when somebody came into our house as they often did, the gypsy lady who had nine [ph] 1048 million kids and she would come to my mother and say my children are hungry and my mother would pack things in her potato sack that she came with.</span> <span id="s443">My older sister had a tremendous amount of goodness in her.</span> <span id="s444">I really remember one Friday the lady came from a very poverty ridden area of town - a Jewish woman and said that it's already Friday afternoon and she doesn't have fish or chicken or largeness (shabbat bread).</span> <span id="s445">She doesn't have it because she doesn't have a penny and it's getting too late in the afternoon and she still doesn't have anything for the shabbat.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">They were so religious that even if they had something on shabbat they wouldn't cook it so it had to be Friday afternoon.</span> <span id="s447">And I clearly remember that my older sister had a gold ring with her name in it.</span> <span id="s448">I don't remember what they called it but it was very fashionable in those days that you would have a ring with a kind of circle here and your name was imprinted in it and she had this gold ring that she's gotten for a birthday or something or other and when she heard this lady come and cry that her children are hungry, she doesn't have anything for the shabbat, she just took off her ring and gave it to the woman.</span> <span id="s449">She was extremely good-hearted and she acted upon the first impulse.</span> <span id="s450">She thought about it later but she would always act immediately and some of her acts were acts of native goodness.</span> <span id="s451">I was so focused in on my little sister that outside of the strength of my sister Chicha who after all is responsible for our survival, there is no question about that.</span> <span id="s452">I remember her for her strength and I remember my brother for his bigness not even all of this world but also of another world of great ideals, goodnesses.</span> <span id="s453">I was duly focused in on the little one most but I remember my older sister.</span> <span id="s454">There was always some kind of envy because she had the best clothes and she was the one to be married off and she was very elegant and very well kept and you had to pay homage to this older sister always.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">How old was she?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">She must have been 26, 27, 28, something like that.</span> <span id="s457">She was a grown woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">But not married?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Not married because there were no men around.</span> <span id="s460">They were all in the Munkaszolgalat, the labor battalion.</span> <span id="s461">But I remember her most for her determination to live.</span> <span id="s462">She was the one, of course, who didn't survive but I clearly remember in the second camp, not in Auschwitz but in Birnbaumel when she was wearing this blanket, some kind of blanket that we had and we tore to pieces and each one wore another part of the blanket or sometimes we had a whole blanket and she was bundled up in this blanket, frozen to death in the January snow and frost of Eastern Germany which is like the North Pole.</span> <span id="s463">I just remember her standing with that blanket on, weighing probably 50 pounds, a frozen skeleton that's still alive.</span> <span id="s464">She said to me armless, legless, but I want to survive.</span> <span id="s465">Even if my arms freeze off and my legs freeze off, no matter how much of me is left, I want to live, I want to survive.</span> <span id="s466">It made a tremendous impression on me because I didn't think of her as death.</span> <span id="s467">I thought that she would be more depressed because I remember at one time that she had a failed love story where one of these men who came to my town with this labor battalion and she was in love with one of them and then they took him away.</span> <span id="s468">The whole thing busted and she was terribly depressed.</span> <span id="s469">This was when we were still at home.</span> <span id="s470">She felt like life was not worth living without him.</span> <span id="s471">I don't remember his name.</span> <span id="s472">But she looked like she just doesn't think life is worth living without him.</span> <span id="s473">I remember I was surprised she was so tremendously pro-life, how she wanted to live, even if only part of her is whole.</span> <span id="s474">And she's the one who didn't make it.</span> <span id="s475">That much can be said for determination and human spirit.</span> <span id="s476">It's just another indication that there is absolutely no way to tell - you cannot tell what made one survive.</span> <span id="s477">There are no rules to this game that can be detected by any normal human being and while psychiatrists make these idiotic utterances that survivors guilt I am supposed to be feeling.</span> <span id="s478">On top of everything I carry in my battered heart I am supposed to be feeling guilty for surviving.</span> <span id="s479">Survivors' guilt.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">I have never yet been able to consciously put my finger on that pronouncement because I feel guilty about everything I do today; if I say a cross word to my husband, if I mistreat my children, if I insult anybody, if I'm not kind, if I'm not sensitive and G-d knows I am sure I do those things.</span> <span id="s481">I feel very guilty about those things but I have never consciously felt guilty about surviving.</span> <span id="s482">When I hear these learned pronouncements and these psychiatrists seem to know so well why we survived and how we survived and what we feel and all that.</span> <span id="s483">What comes to mind is always what Golda Meir said once, I heard her on television, who said that she feels guilty not because I didn't do everything within my power but because I wasn't there.</span> <span id="s484">So I was there.</span> <span id="s485">I have no reason to feel guilty.</span> <span id="s486">If there is a survivors' guilt, it's mysterious to me.</span> <span id="s487">Maybe they know something that I don't know but I didn't kill six million people.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">You didn't kill anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">I didn't kill anybody.</span> <span id="s490">I didn't kill my mother.</span> <span id="s491">I didn't send my family to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s492">Hitler did.</span> <span id="s493">I can't see why I feel guilty.</span> <span id="s494">I feel guilty about all kinds of other things.</span> <span id="s495">I think I feel very guilty about the fact that what this whole experience left me with is that I may have treated my children in the way not other people treat their children but with more worrying, more caution, and infinitely more anxiety than normal parents who have not had my experience.</span> <span id="s496">I think that in that sense I have victimized my children.</span> <span id="s497">I think there is no question in my mind that children of survivors are deeply wounded by the experiences of their parents and they refuse to admit it but this tremendous drive to excel, nothing less than Harvard would do for some of them is always making up for the pain and deprivation that the parents have experienced.</span> <span id="s498">I think our children are in some ways more sensitive because of the tales that the parents have told them but it's a very complicated issue of guilt between the parent and the child.</span> <span id="s499">They feel guilty for what happened not out of their volition.</span> <span id="s500">It's not their fault, but what happened to their parent was something far more gruesome than happened to any other parent unless in individual cases they have hideous experiences.</span> <span id="s501">But on the whole their parents have experienced horrendous gruesomeness in life.</span> <span id="s502">Two really great victims of this outside of those of us who survived - because those who perished are no longer even victims, they're just nothing anymore, but we are the living victims.</span> <span id="s503">I thought the two really innocent victims are our children and their children - the perpetrators - the Nazis whose children and grandchildren have to live with this knowledge though they don't know anything usually because their parents won't tell them.</span> <span id="s504">But they suspect it.</span> <span id="s505">Maybe my father is a murderer.</span> <span id="s506">And which child wants to be fathered by a murderer.</span> <span id="s507">Afraid to ask, they don't get any answers.</span> <span id="s508">Generally, I suppose that's what happens.</span> <span id="s509">And I used to say that they're the true victims, those children and ours.</span> <span id="s510">And then I've had quite a number of terrible experiences with German children and I stopped saying that and I say it's only our children who are the real victims.</span> <span id="s511">It's not quite true probably because there are probably a lot of sensitive German kids who are suffering tremendously.</span> <span id="s512">But I had two or three lousy experiences, so I stopped saying it.</span> <span id="s513">I just focus in on the fact that our children are terribly punished emotionally by being truly the extension of Auschwitz because when we are gone, long after we are gone, when none of us will be left, perhaps decades later, these children will be the nearest thing that you can touch that is connected to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s514">It is them they will ask how was it to grow up with a mother who was a survivor of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s515">You know I'm talking 50 years from now.</span> <span id="s516">I expect that our children should live longer than we live in our age.</span> <span id="s517">But you know, 20, 30, 40 years from now there will be nothing as comnmonly visible as it is today that you can find a survivor here and there.</span> <span id="s518">So they will be the nearest link to the reality of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s519">I don't envy them.</span> <span id="s520">As a matter of fact I have noticed in some of these gathering that we have had in Israel, in Washington, in Philadelphia, the survivors, that the media was kind of wise to that reality because I have noticed how they go after our children rather than us.</span> <span id="s521">It's as if we were already gone and let's better ask those who will be here with us for a long time, their children.</span> <span id="s522">Who knows what it is to be the child of such a person.</span> <span id="s523">I want to hop back to some of the antisemitism that I grew up with that was really mother's milk to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Being a Jewish girl in a Hungarian school in l933?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Yes.</span> <span id="s526">First of all I had to be sort of the best student because I was this terrible minority of one or two there.</span> <span id="s527">I think there were two of us in the class who were Jewish.</span> <span id="s528">So I had to be the best student.</span> <span id="s529">So was my friend.</span> <span id="s530">We were both extraordinary students.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Jewish friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">This Jewish friend of mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Did you have any non-Jewish friends in this class?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">None that I could trust.</span> <span id="s535">I might have had some superficial friends.</span> <span id="s536">I might have had, but I remember this one.</span> <span id="s537">Leah, I don't remember - something like that - was her name but her second name was Halpert I think and her father was equally...</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Not related to you Halpert?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">No, not at all.</span> <span id="s540">But her father was so terribly religious, as mine, and did not want her to go to a Jewish school which would teach her something about Zionism so she was very bright and she was a good friend of mine and she was decent and darling and intelligent and the two of us just simply had to be the best students.</span> <span id="s541">But you couldn't win because you had to be the best student because you were such a minority and if you were the best student they hated your guts because you were just a damn Jew who was smarter than the next guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Was this all girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">No, it was a mixed class.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Boys and girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Yeah.</span> <span id="s546">These very same kids that I was in school in the afternoon if I walked out later in the street, I just heard them say, "Dirty Jews, dirty Jews, dirty Jews."</span> <span id="s547">You can't be a winner which is what I apply as well to the fact that we cannot win this ugly reality of our life that we are survivors of this madness because vis-a-vis our children.</span> <span id="s548">We cannot win because so many of us have shielded them from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s549">We did not want to tell them anything about it.</span> <span id="s550">So there were those parents.</span> <span id="s551">And they were losers because the kids came back at them.</span> <span id="s552">Why didn't you tell me?</span> <span id="s553">I know my niece did and so did others.</span> <span id="s554">I had told them and my husband was very helpful and tried to impart some of the information because they were seeking it out.</span> <span id="s555">But I must tell you they wanted to know it and they didn't.</span> <span id="s556">Early in their lives they were already torn by conflicts because they wanted to know so much but they did not want to know so much.</span> <span id="s557">I clearly remember when my children were going to school, this Fieldstone we just mentioned, and we were walking distance from the school.</span> <span id="s558">We lived in over there.</span> <span id="s559">I remember my older one Peter who said one morning, "Mommy, how did my aunt die?"</span> <span id="s560">, referring to Potyo.</span> <span id="s561">They heard that maybe she died in an open fire alive they threw her in.</span> <span id="s562">Mommy how did my aunt die, Potyo?</span> <span id="s563">And I realized that as he asked me the question he had his hand on the knob.</span> <span id="s564">He was opening the door to leave for school.</span> <span id="s565">So he wants to know but he didn't really want to know and he left without finding out.</span> <span id="s566">But this terrible conflict was already imbedded in there at such an early age so the end result is that there are no winners in imparting the knowledge or not.</span> <span id="s567">Those of us who did lost in a sense and those of us who didn't lost.</span> <span id="s568">There's no way to win something as big as this, you cannot.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">I would imagine too that you found it difficult to think of Potyo as an aunt, thirteen years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Clearly, sure.</span> <span id="s571">That's a very good point.</span> <span id="s572">As a matter of fact when I was saying aunt I was wondering who I was talking about because she was just a child.</span> <span id="s573">But indeed she was my children's aunt.</span> <span id="s574">And would have been a lovely wonderful aunt of some fifty odd years.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Not to mention a beautiful wife and a great mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">And a mother herself, yeah.</span> <span id="s577">There's not even any point to talk about that.</span> <span id="s578">But in that same vein as I mentioned some further antisemitic winds that I got -</span></p> <p><span id="s579">In Hungary?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Yeah, I must tell you the story that pained us, or pained me, I don't know if the others know it the same way.</span> <span id="s581">But the way I know the story of my two brothers, twins, their names were Shmuel and Barry.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Barry?</span> <span id="s583">Could you spell it, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">I don't know how you would spell it but it was Beryl and Shmuel.</span> <span id="s585">That would be the Yiddish name.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Would that be Samuel?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Sam would sound right and maybe Bernard.</span> <span id="s588">But I don't remember their non-Jewish names though they had them because they had to be registered by their non-Jewish names.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">So you had three brothers, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">I originally had three brothers.</span> <span id="s591">I don't remember - it seems to me yes, they were born before Potyo.</span> <span id="s592">They would come between Rachel and Portyo.</span> <span id="s593">They were not identical twins.</span> <span id="s594">They were two delicate little boys that I remember in their swaddling clothes.</span> <span id="s595">I didn't know about this because something evidently happened and they shipped us away from home and they sent us to my grandmother in Nyiregyhaza.</span> <span id="s596">When we came back we found that we only had one brother out of the twins left.</span> <span id="s597">My mother was kind of totally destroyed.</span> <span id="s598">And they were telling us that we came home because something terrible had happened but we're going back to my grandmother and then we're going to come back home again.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">They sent us back and we didn't come back again because something terrible happened again and what happened was that the twins had a wet nurse and the wet nurse's child got ill with some kind of lung inflammation of some sort - I don't know what it was, maybe TB for all I know - but her milk was infected with whatever this was and her child recovered.</span> <span id="s600">She was breast-feeding the three children.</span> <span id="s601">Her child got ill and recovered and our two children got very ill.</span> <span id="s602">My parents had a philosophy in life when something is wrong, when somebody is ill, you seek out the best possible care at any cost or any religion or any anti-semitism, no matter what it is you will get the very best care.</span> <span id="s603">So you go to the most famous man in the field.</span> <span id="s604">The most famous man in the field, evidently, was in this children's hospital which was very famous in the country, in Debrecen which was near the town where my mother was born.</span> <span id="s605">My mother and father immediately took the children to this hospital.</span> <span id="s606">One died and my mother came home, I think, to sit shiva.</span> <span id="s607">You know what that is, I think.</span> <span id="s608">After the dead, you have to sit for a week on the floor, and that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s609">It was the time before the child died that they shipped us off to my grandparents.</span> <span id="s610">She evidently left the other child there ill in Debrecen.</span> <span id="s611">And I guess left the other child there and a week later or so the other child died as well.</span> <span id="s612">And somebody, I don't remember who, told us that when the other child died my mother left the hospital and charged out to the street absolutely crazed.</span> <span id="s613">She was screaming.</span> <span id="s614">She was totally crazed by it.</span> <span id="s615">And then she came home and finally we heard the story of what happened and she was absolutely convinced or she had facts, I don't know, because conceivably she had friends.</span> <span id="s616">My mother was a very social person to whom people talked.</span> <span id="s617">She had real friends.</span> <span id="s618">In any field, people she touched trusted her and confided in her and everything.</span> <span id="s619">So I suppose she must have heard this from other doctors, young doctors, perhaps Jewish doctors, colleagues of - there were a lot of people involved evidently in the two cases of death of these children.</span> <span id="s620">And my mother was absolutely certain that the children were victims of antisemitism; that they had experimented on them and treated them as Jewish children, not necessarily to be saved, but to learn from.</span> <span id="s621">And that they were sacrificial lambs.</span> <span id="s622">She never recanted on that.</span> <span id="s623">She maintained forever that the children were victims of anti-semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Back in those years, which goes way back, I don't remember when those children were born, but this was before Hitler.</span> <span id="s625">But curiously the place, the hospital, was known for a sense of anti-semitism.</span> <span id="s626">So it wasn't her imagination.</span> <span id="s627">She either had proof of it because they were twins that they were a subject for experimentation.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">How old were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">They were eight months old when they died, within two, three weeks of each other.</span> <span id="s630">Of course my parents could never be consoled and that's how Philip remained the only son after that.</span> <span id="s631">My mother's instincts were to be trusted on the whole in all of the big issues.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">One for instance which stands out in my mind always - I sort of cannot live it down.</span> <span id="s633">In a sense it does add to my pessimism which my family will testify that despite the fact that I show strength and have survived and all that - I am a afflicted with a sense of pessimism.</span> <span id="s634">And G-d knows at this stage, I have enough to be pessimistic about, all of us, because the world is taking from bad turn - always seems to be making worse turns than last time and G-d knows what will become of the world now.</span> <span id="s635">Antisemitism rising everywhere in the world.</span> <span id="s636">So there is enough cause not only to be skeptical but to feel deeply sad about the state of the world and particularly in regard to anti-semitism and I always thought I should be involved in the activity of leaving something behind for future generations about this whole event of the holocaust because I was there, I'm a first hand person, I have a certain responsibility to leave the truth behind.</span> <span id="s637">I have done it very much at my own expense and undoubtedly at the expense of my children and my husband.</span> <span id="s638">I paid very dearly.</span> <span id="s639">They pay very dearly for what I have done in order to leave enough of the truth behind so that when the revisionists make even bigger noises than they have made all throughout these years after my survival, our testimonies will be there so that we can counteract their evil pronouncements regarding the holocaust.</span> <span id="s640">The holocaust never happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Do you believe in G-d, Isabella?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">No.</span> <span id="s643">I have had tremendous trouble with the question of G-d because I never saw him when I needed him and I really have questions only.</span> <span id="s644">I have absolutely no answers to any of them.</span> <span id="s645">How can I have any answer to them when I remember standing in Auschwitz on a summer day when evidently planes were flying overhead - probably those were the planes that were going to takes pictures of the Krupp [Buna] installments.</span> <span id="s646">Those are the pictures they have of Auschwitz itself.</span> <span id="s647">The allies have had those pictures and they didn't bomb Auschwitz, as we know now.</span> <span id="s648">They didn't bomb the rails.</span> <span id="s649">It must have been those planes that flew overhead that we saw way up there.</span> <span id="s650">Whichever planes they were, I remember standing in Auschwitz in Lager C on a very hot summer afternoon in 1944 and as the planes flew overhead raising my hands in prayer saying G-d, please let them kill us with their bombs.</span> <span id="s651">I'd rather die by the bombs of the west or the fighting forces or whatever I might have said - I don't remember - but I'd rather die by the bombs than let Hitler have the joy of killing me in the crematorium.</span> <span id="s652">I don't want him to have the last word.</span> <span id="s653">I really wanted to die.</span> <span id="s654">There was no way out.</span> <span id="s655">Certainly there was no way to imagine that I'm ever going to survive that.</span> <span id="s656">Since I have no other fate except dying, why shouldn't I die by the bombs.</span> <span id="s657">And the planes flew over us and never bombed us.</span> <span id="s658">It was only this much that I asked of that almighty G-d in those circumstances and I wasn't granted this much.</span> <span id="s659">I cannot give you an answer on the question of G-d because I will as long as I live ask where he was hiding when they burned 24,000 people a day in Auschwitz and we, the few survivors, had to live with the stench of 24,000 people burning a day.</span> <span id="s660">Even G-d has to forgive me for asking this question.</span> <span id="s661">Where is an answer?</span> <span id="s662">Give me an answer to that question.</span> <span id="s663">Where was G-d when the smoke was so thick, so gray, so dark.</span> <span id="s664">There was no sky.</span> <span id="s665">There was nothing blue to be seen on some days.</span> <span id="s666">Nothing but smoke around the clock.</span> <span id="s667">My children throughout the years have been very conscious of thick smoke.</span> <span id="s668">I remember riding along in the car with my question via New Jersey and there would be a big fire in these - I don't know where they keep these gasoline tanks or something...</span></p> <p><span id="s669">The oil refineries.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Yeah, all kinds of fires and as soon as the thick smoke appeared, my children looked frightened, and looking at me and looking at the smoke and trying to find out what's going on inside me because I see the smoke that I used to speak of and my children were frightened for their mother to see smoke because it reminded her of the burning mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">If it could remind them, it certainly reminded you.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">You can imagine.</span> <span id="s673">So is that a way for children to grow up?</span> <span id="s674">And then I can ask, "Where is G-d?</span> <span id="s675">Why doesn't he protect my children from having these terrible feelings?"</span> <span id="s676">And you were brought up as a religious girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">And I was brought up in a very religious home and I cannot answer your questions nor anybody's.</span> <span id="s678">I don't know what to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A religious girl who was forced to attend the public school because of her father's religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">And coming from a long line of rabbinical background.</span> <span id="s681">I am sure that in my mother's side, I have nothing but rabbis as great great great great great grandfathers.</span> <span id="s682">I"m sure that that's the whole lineage - is rabbinical.</span> <span id="s683">But I welcome any of my ancestors to send me a supernatural message if you will about the question of G-d and Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s684">Under normal circumstances I perhaps would not have had to question.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Who helped you survive, if anyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">My sister.</span> <span id="s687">My good sister.</span> <span id="s688">I go back to Chicha but I must tell you about my pessimism I started out with.</span> <span id="s689">My mother was so accurate in her pessimistic outlook vis-a-vis Jewish survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">She was also optimistic, remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Yes, because she hoped that her children would live and she expected them to live.</span> <span id="s692">But my mother, throughout the war years while Hitler was making his big noises and big moves and was dancing all over our graves all over Europe, even before the war broke out in the 30s when I was old enough to remember, my mother used to say (all the time I heard this) Hitler will lose the war (there was no war yet) - Hitler will lose the war but he will win it against the Jews.</span> <span id="s693">Nobody put it more accurately, more astutely than she and she fed our young minds with this absolute truth.</span> <span id="s694">She proved to be absolutely right.</span> <span id="s695">And she had this submission that could not be placated by any kind of foolish talk about what Hitler will turn out to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Is this when you decided to seek visas to leave Hungary?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">No, my father had come to America on a business trip in 1936 in connection with the World's Fair.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">1936?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">I think it was '36.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">'39 I know there was a World's Fair in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Yeah, but he must have come earlier to make arrangements for a Hungarian wine pavilion.</span> <span id="s702">He was a wine and liquor wholesale merchant.</span> <span id="s703">He came to America to make arrangements for a pavilion and one of the Hungarian ministers (I understand from my brother and he can give you the accurate name) made a comment after they issued the necessary papers to him.</span> <span id="s704">He was quoted as saying, "It's a dirty shame that a G-d-damn Jew should represent us on the World's Fair."</span> <span id="s705">Antisemitism was in the highest places and lowest places and everywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Your father heard this?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Well the quote was handed down to us enough so that my brother remembers it very accurately.</span> <span id="s708">He remembers the name of the Hungarian official, some very high official.</span> <span id="s709">In any event, my father came early before the World's Fair to make arrangements for a Hungarian pavilion and he returned within ten days to Hungary.</span> <span id="s710">He came on a visitor's visa and he returned.</span> <span id="s711">In those days, anyone who came to America would never dream of returning.</span> <span id="s712">They came as visitors, whichever way they came, they stayed here.</span> <span id="s713">That's all they wanted was to escape those poverty-ridden lands of Poland, and Hungary and all of them.</span> <span id="s714">My father was the only one who returned.</span> <span id="s715">And because he returned within ten days and he came back because it was Passover and he had to be home for the seder.</span> <span id="s716">The American consul trusted him so much because he was a weird person to return from America that when he came to ask for another visa they just issued it to him with no questions asked.</span> <span id="s717">He was very trustworthy.</span> <span id="s718">So he finally went back to get a visa because my mother urged him to save his family and go to America.</span> <span id="s719">My mother saw this very early.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Was this after the outbreak of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">No, before the outbreak of the war.</span> <span id="s722">Hitler was already too powerful and my mother was too frightened.</span> <span id="s723">He got the visa and he had the visa in his breast pocket.</span> <span id="s724">People were offering him all kind of monies to buy the visa off him and somehow convert it to their own names or picture or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s725">My father of course wouldn't give up the visa but at the same time he refused to come back to America because he kept saying that America is not the kind of place - you don't want to bring up Jewish children there - they have people from all over the world - there is not enough Yiddishkeit, Jewishness and religiosity.</span> <span id="s726">I think now there seems to be a lot more of surges of Jewishness and religiosity.</span> <span id="s727">These kids going around with their skull caps and everything.</span> <span id="s728">There's a lot going on that's very Jewish consciousness.</span> <span id="s729">I welcome that.</span> <span id="s730">But he was afraid that if he brings his family here his children would not be Jewish enough.</span> <span id="s731">They will absorb too much of Americanism rather than Judaism.</span> <span id="s732">He was reluctant to come back.</span> <span id="s733">My mother constantly urged him - you must save our children.</span> <span id="s734">You must go back.</span> <span id="s735">Finally he agreed to come to save his family.</span> <span id="s736">He came back and arrived with probably the last boat that brought him here.</span> <span id="s737">The war had already broken out.</span> <span id="s738">Courtesy of the great Franklin Delano Roosevelt who was such a great president.</span> <span id="s739">He didn't have a Jewish soul.</span> <span id="s740">He didn't want to save the Jews.</span> <span id="s741">He wanted to win the war.</span> <span id="s742">The Jews were not uppermost in his mind and we know now he refused to bomb the Auschwitz rails and he did too much that was terribly, terribly wrong.</span> <span id="s743">One of those things was that when a Jew such as my father from Hungary who was already in this country and applying for his papers to remain here to eventually become a citizen, and asked for papers to bring over his family of seven so at least they could save those seven people from Hitler's murder.</span> <span id="s744">He, I understand, spent all his waking hours knocking on the doors in Washington at the various authorities - give me the papers - give me the papers - save my children.</span> <span id="s745">And they managed to postpone it long enough so that by the time they would give him the papers, Hungary had declared war against the United States.</span> <span id="s746">Witness the beginning of the statement I said that on December 7...</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Yes, I recall.</span> <span id="s748">So two years to get papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">They dilly-dallied.</span> <span id="s750">They would have had to give him the papers immediately.</span> <span id="s751">Let's save one Jewish family.</span> <span id="s752">There is some legitimacy here because the father came here for that purpose and some of us were underage and could have come under his auspices.</span> <span id="s753">They managed to sabotage this Jewish family and they managed to sabotage all of the efforts to save Jews.</span> <span id="s754">This is not my story but it is well documented in G-d knows how many books.</span> <span id="s755">So Hungary declared war against the United States and there was no American consulate because we were allies of Hitler.</span> <span id="s756">So were the Japanese.</span> <span id="s757">The whole thing was aborted.</span> <span id="s758">So then my father evidently spent another year and a half or two years - 41 until 44, I guess - to try to get papers to come to Israel since the American plan didn't work.</span> <span id="s759">So he was knocking on the doors - get me papers to go to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">British-controlled Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Yeah.</span> <span id="s762">And he was desperate.</span> <span id="s763">Day and night he worked to get them papers to go to Palestine because America was out of the question.</span> <span id="s764">And he finally succeeded again with so much postponement from these gentle souls who were not interested in saving at least one Jewish family.</span> <span id="s765">By the time we got the papers, Hitler had occupied Hungary and I remember the papers had arrived and there they were - seven documents to get this family to Israel and Naziism was already in full force in Hungary.</span> <span id="s766">I always say I don't know what we used it for, toilet paper or what, but it was worthless.</span> <span id="s767">And instead of going to America or to Palestine ......</span></p> <p><span id="s768">How did you finally escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">I never mentioned to you that Philip, my brother, was torn away from us immediately in Auschwitz but his last plea to us - actually it was a very dramatic and very unusual act of defiance on his part - that when men and women were separated and we made it to the life side and we were led into this huge wet monstrous place where they shaved us and threw a rag at us in Lager C - no it probably wasn't Lager C - and we saw two other monsters - this was Chicha and I - and we saw two other shaved monsters in rags who we barely recognized, but they looked familiar and these are our two sisters whom Mengele was originally leading to the crematorium and then he changed his mind and took them out to the life side.</span> <span id="s770">As we were shaved and looking absolutely hideous some kind of a magic force appeared--my brother Philip who by now was wearing a striped uniform.</span> <span id="s771">He was shaved and evidently his group was ready to be led to the camp where they were going to lead them - whether it was A or B or wherever they led the men.</span> <span id="s772">Evidently he kept looking for his sisters and he knew already that his mother was no longer alive.</span> <span id="s773">There was somebody who shaved him and he was evidently a prisoner in Auschwitz who was one of the people who shaved him and it was somebody he knew.</span> <span id="s774">He could tell you more about this.</span> <span id="s775">And he said to him that your mother is already dead, or something about the smoke that there is your mother.</span> <span id="s776">My brother evidently passed down the word to the others, to the next guy and the next guy.</span> <span id="s777">Tell them to say kaddish.</span> <span id="s778">We no longer have parents.</span> <span id="s779">He was evidently looking for whatever was left of his family hoping that the girls, because they are young and healthy, that they are on the life side and he kept peering through this window and this incredibly brave human being, despite the Nazis all around, managed to climb through that window because he saw us and he flew into the window.</span> <span id="s780">How he did that I don't think he knows.</span> <span id="s781">And he put his arm around these four naked-headed monsters, his sisters.</span> <span id="s782">And he shook us and he said, "Listen to me!</span> <span id="s783">Eat!</span> <span id="s784">Eat everything they give you.</span> <span id="s785">If they give you shit, eat shit, but you must survive.</span> <span id="s786">We must live.</span> <span id="s787">We must pay them back and create a better world."</span> <span id="s788">And he flew out.</span> <span id="s789">He was back through the window and he was gone.</span> <span id="s790">We never saw him again until we were in America.</span> <span id="s791">But he managed to - talking about resistance, what this man did, we never ever forgot - I don't know if he remembers the words he said to us.</span> <span id="s792">I clearly remember them as these words.</span> <span id="s793">How the others remember them, I don't know.</span> <span id="s794">These are the words I remember and whenever it looked like we were finished, there is no more life left in us, somehow this vision came up of Philip saying you must eat no matter what they give you because we must survive.</span> <span id="s795">And then for three weeks he was evidently in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s796">He was the most ingenious public relations man or communication man probably in the world because he found pieces of wood in his camp because they were still building the camp and there were pieces of wood.</span> <span id="s797">He somehow managed to barter his bread probably to a prisoner who had been there longer and probably had a little chunk of a pencil.</span> <span id="s798">He carved every day on a piece of wood - you must live, you must live, you must survive.</span> <span id="s799">And he would say on that, my sisters are in Lager C.</span> <span id="s800">Their name is Katz.</span> <span id="s801">Whoever finds this piece of wood please toss it over the next camp, Lager they called it, until it reaches Lager C. And these band of resisters, these prisoners, managed to throw it over the wire, Lager to Lager, until it reached Lager C. And we got the message every single day for about three weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Who would catch it?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Somebody would find it in the same spot the same way and we would go there looking for it because by now we were trained.</span> <span id="s804">It was a secret language of the most powerful underground communication in the world and we found the piece of wood or somebody brought it to us because by this time they knew us so there were some people who knew us.</span> <span id="s805">They brought us this life message and then one day it stopped and then we were certain that he is up in smoke or Mengele took him to another camp.</span> <span id="s806">We never heard from him again until we arrived in America.</span> <span id="s807">An American soldier found him in a hospital and wrote to my father because the only thing - we didn't have any belongings - the only thing we were all schooled in at home, by my mother, I guess, or by each other, that if we ever lived through this war, we should remember one thing - my father's address, l66 Ross Street, Brooklyn, where my aunt lived, and my father lived with his sister.</span> <span id="s808">And that's what we remembered, this address.</span> <span id="s809">That was the only document we had, that was the only paper, which was not a paper.</span> <span id="s810">It was in our head, engraved, 166 Ross Street.</span> <span id="s811">He gave this address to the American soldier who liberated him.</span> <span id="s812">He found him in a hospital with a bullet in his leg.</span> <span id="s813">He was in six concentration camps while we were in two.</span> <span id="s814">He tried to escape, after he tried to make a deal with the Nazi who he caught changing his clothes, I believe, because he wanted to escape when the Americans were so near that they were overhead and they were in the cattle cars shipping them further into Nazidom.</span> <span id="s815">But this is something he would have to tell you.</span> <span id="s816">But in any event he shot him in the leg .</span> <span id="s817">He didn't want to kill him, it looks like, but he shot him in the leg and this American soldier found him in the hospital.</span> <span id="s818">We didn't know anything about him, this whole saga of six concentration camps and the bullet until he arrived in January 1945.</span> <span id="s819">I will return to how we survived.</span> <span id="s820">When Auschwitz was beginning to be liquidated in the fall of 1944, we spent all our energies - whatever was left in our 40 to 50 pound human being that we each weighed, 40, 50, 60 pounds, and I had typhus throughout the nine months that I was in the camps, whatever energy we had we spent it on only one thing - to run away from Mengele's selections, because if Mengele will select the four of us, one would go to another camp, one would go to the crematorium, one would go yet to another camp, one would stay here.</span> <span id="s821">We cannot afford a selection if we still want to be four sisters.</span> <span id="s822">We were a rather large family.</span> <span id="s823">There was another family who had six sisters.</span> <span id="s824">We were probably the next largest because they were decimated.</span> <span id="s825">Families were totally decimated.</span> <span id="s826">Because we were close in age, young and healthy, he picked us out.</span> <span id="s827">So the four of us made it all the way through six months of Auschwitz in the worst times of Auschwitz and escaped Mengele's selection even if we had to run, as we did one night, and he shot after us, but he didn't get us in the dark.</span> <span id="s828">So we remained alive.</span> <span id="s829">We tried anything and everything to remain together.</span> <span id="s830">We made it sort of to the entrance to the crematorium where they were going to take us out of Lager C in November on a bitter cold night and put us in the crematorium and then as it happened so many times we were unable to figure out what they were going to do and they changed the orders once more.</span> <span id="s831">Instead of putting us in the crematorium, they put us on trains, on ice-cold trains, with heated cars for the Nazis and ours were ice-cold.</span> <span id="s832">They took us to another concentration camp called Birnbaumel, or that's the way I remember the name, in Eastern Germany.</span> <span id="s833">We traveled, I don't know how long, frozen to death and starved.</span> <span id="s834">We arrived in a place called Birnbaumel where they had a thousand prisoners in a forest in umbrella-like paper-thin wood structures with no floor.</span> <span id="s835">It was only ice.</span> <span id="s836">The walls were ice and the floor was ice.</span> <span id="s837">It was eastern Germany in a forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">What were you wearing?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Rags.</span> <span id="s840">Chicha was wearing a wooden shoe and one regular shoe.</span> <span id="s841">The only thing they let us keep were eyeglasses and shoes and the shoes wore out and somehow all kinds of wooden clogs appeared.</span> <span id="s842">My sister had one wooden shoe and one regular shoe.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Coats, blankets?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Rags and whatever we could somehow manage to - maybe they gave us something or we bartered something.</span> <span id="s845">We had a little more clothing than we had in Auschwitz but certainly not enough to keep you warm in the forest.</span> <span id="s846">Every morning we had to go to the other end of the forest through the town where all the Germans saw us.</span> <span id="s847">They said they never saw us.</span> <span id="s848">They were going to work and to school.</span> <span id="s849">Twice a day they saw us coming and going.</span> <span id="s850">They had to stop traffic for a thousand of wretched skeletons to walk through the town to reach the other end of the forest to do Schatzarbeit [Schutzarbeit] digging ditches for the tank traps.</span> <span id="s851">In the frozen earth, if we wanted to start digging, we had to heat up the earth first because the earth was frozen.</span> <span id="s852">The Germans stood there with their incredible coats and uniforms and rifles and they would warm their fat rumps at the fire and they would chase us away with the butt of their rifles because heat the earth, not the Jews, you know.</span> <span id="s853">This went on all winter from November to January and we got thinner and frailer and sicker and my typhus was raging.</span> <span id="s854">How I didn't die, I never know.</span> <span id="s855">I had typhus for nine months.</span> <span id="s856">The doctor said under the best of care at home I would have died in days.</span> <span id="s857">Finally after digging the bloody German earth and watching how the Nazis were so gentle with their murderous dogs and what they did to us.</span> <span id="s858">Finally the end came.</span> <span id="s859">We were in Birnbaumel in these icy huts and on a Sunday afternoon on January 21, they gathered us in a tremendous hurry.</span> <span id="s860">The word was always los, los, schnell, schnell, fast, fast, whatever the hell it meant.</span> <span id="s861">We had to line up in funferreih always five in a row.</span> <span id="s862">They counted us and within minutes they marched us out of the camp.</span> <span id="s863">Had we hidden then, which we didn't know, had we hidden anywhere, they had no time to come looking for us and the people who were in the so called hospital which was called the Revier with their legs frozen off and they had gangrene and they couldn't take them out and they didn't want to shoot them because they didn't want to leave the evidence behind - dead bodies.</span> <span id="s864">Those people were the ones who survived because if we had hidden anywhere we would have been liberated that very afternoon because the Russians were that close but we didn't know anything about that.</span> <span id="s865">We only knew that we had to go very fast - run, line up, and march out of the camp.</span> <span id="s866">We were out on the road on Sunday afternoon, bitter, bitter cold, snow and ice all over and we had to march fast and fast and faster.</span> <span id="s867">We were led out of the camp and we were marching towards the west where Hitler was ostensibly ruling.</span> <span id="s868">We didn't know where we were going.</span> <span id="s869">We marched until the evening.</span> <span id="s870">In the evening they had put us up in another evacuated camp where a thousand girls had been taken out of.</span> <span id="s871">We spent the night there and that was Sunday night and Monday we marched another day in these hideous conditions.</span> <span id="s872">Rachel was coughing.</span> <span id="s873">It sounded like she had TB.</span> <span id="s874">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s875">But the four of us were still together.</span> <span id="s876">Tuesday morning we tried to fight back again.</span> <span id="s877">One night we were housed in an evacuated concentration camp and the second night they put us up in several barns.</span> <span id="s878">The cows were in one barn and the straw and their bedding, I guess, was in another barn and we gathered enough strength, inner and physical strength, to try to make it once more and we hid ourselves in the straw, on the top level.</span> <span id="s879">We thought if they come with their pitchforks to drive us out of our hiding place well then that's the way we'll die but let's try it anyhow.</span> <span id="s880">We successfully hid ourselves.</span> <span id="s881">Several other people had done the same thing.</span> <span id="s882">They had no time to pitchfork us out of the hiding places.</span> <span id="s883">They knew that some of us must have been hiding in these straw refuges.</span> <span id="s884">Cunningly, as always, they began to boil potatoes.</span> <span id="s885">It's not that they wanted to feed us but the smell would lure us out from the hiding place and that's exactly what it did.</span> <span id="s886">The four of us who struggled so hard to remain four together gave up our hiding place because the smell of potato was irresistible.</span> <span id="s887">To eat once more was more important than perhaps freedom and we voluntarily gave up our hiding place and lined up for the potatoes, the four of us together with the others.</span> <span id="s888">By the time we reached the kettle in which they were boiling the potatoes, there were none.</span> <span id="s889">They were all gone.</span> <span id="s890">But by now we were prisoners again.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">How did you get away now?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">This was Tuesday morning.</span> <span id="s893">Sunday we slept in the camp and Monday we slept in the barn and Tuesday morning on the 23rd, we were prisoners again, and we lined up and we marched again.</span> <span id="s894">By this time a great many girls had died and anyone who couldn't march was shot right there.</span> <span id="s895">It was Tuesday morning, I don't know what hour it was, late morning probably, they were marching us.</span> <span id="s896">We were in this town called Jagadschutz and there were three sisters in the back of us who escaped so the guards who were in the back guarding us in this marching line and the guards on the two sides went all back to shoot two girls, as we later found out, and the third one had to dig a grave for the two sisters.</span> <span id="s897">Only the guard in the front remained.</span> <span id="s898">My sister Chicha, who was the heroine always, was at the end of the line as we entered this little village called Jagadschutz.</span> <span id="s899">There was a little house of a blacksmith and she had enough presence to figure out that if no smoke is coming out of the chimney - they didn't have any sophisticated fire, heating arrangements - if no smoke is coming out then they must be gone.</span> <span id="s900">They must have escaped from the oncoming liberators, whoever they were - Americans or Russians or who knows what; we didn't know anything about the status of the war.</span> <span id="s901">But they have escaped evidently and she bolted and ran out.</span> <span id="s902">She had made another attempt to escape but by this time we agreed that ostensibly we're not going to be aiding each other in the same way as we always did.</span> <span id="s903">There was no question that we were always going to do the same thing.</span> <span id="s904">This time we said somebody has to survive.</span> <span id="s905">Whoever can, let's make it.</span> <span id="s906">So she bolted and she ran into the little house and she ran up to the stairs.</span> <span id="s907">Nobody was in there.</span> <span id="s908">It was ice cold.</span> <span id="s909">She went up to the attic.</span> <span id="s910">Rachel was marching right next to her and she ran.</span> <span id="s911">Nobody looked back.</span> <span id="s912">Nobody said anything.</span> <span id="s913">I saw Rachel and I ran and I was certain that Cipi standing next to me would do exactly the same thing.</span> <span id="s914">Rachel and I ran into a little doghouse.</span> <span id="s915">The dog was gone.</span> <span id="s916">They took the dog away.</span> <span id="s917">We hid in the doghouse crouched.</span> <span id="s918">Suddenly in this deadly silence and snow and it was a snowstorm but it was beautiful, white, it was Christmas time like Christmas time, peace on earth, good will towards men.</span> <span id="s919">We were crouching in the doghouse and then we heard these steps in the silence, this absolute silence and snow.</span> <span id="s920">It was the oberschutzfuhrer, the Nazi with his dog.</span> <span id="s921">He was walking on the road cursing the Jews mumbling things at who escaped behind holding him back from marching ahead away from the liberators and taking his precious cargo along.</span> <span id="s922">Whether the wind blew our scent away, I don't know, but the dog evidently did not smell us and he passed us by.</span> <span id="s923">Evidently Chicha was watching this from the window in the attic and she yelled out all our names and said Cipi, Rachel, Isabella are you all here.</span> <span id="s924">And we said yes, well we're here, Rachel and Isabella but Cipi is probably in the next house because she had to do exactly what we did.</span> <span id="s925">Once the obershutzfuhrer was gone my sister yelled down, "Come on up here to the attic.</span> <span id="s926">Here I am and I found a frozen cabbage and it's delicious.</span> <span id="s927">We ran up and a few minutes later the door was slightly opened and there were three other wretched creatures who escaped and they made their way into the same house.</span> <span id="s928">But it wasn't Cipi.</span> <span id="s929">This was the 23rd of January.</span> <span id="s930">We stayed in this house and had another anti-semitic experience when a forced labor worker from Poland, they were working around in Germany, they were forced laborers.</span> <span id="s931">He came and he wanted to chase us out because he wanted to take the contents of the house.</span> <span id="s932">He threatened us that the Germans are all around and they are going to kill us and we'd better leave.</span> <span id="s933">I think Chicha told him if this is what you want in the house you can take everything but let us stay here and eat some before we die.</span> <span id="s934">Leave us alone.</span> <span id="s935">He finally left.</span> <span id="s936">We stayed there Tuesday and Wednesday.</span> <span id="s937">Wednesday night the lights were cut.</span> <span id="s938">Chicha was smart enough to say the Germans must have left.</span> <span id="s939">They cut the electricity.</span> <span id="s940">Sure enough it was true.</span> <span id="s941">It was Thursday morning.</span> <span id="s942">We were in our warm bedding, barefooted and suddenly we saw a tremendous army entering the village, blood splattered soldiers, fighting soldiers, spent completely, and all kinds of war machinery, and we didn't know who they were.</span> <span id="s943">They didn't look like the Hungarian soldiers we knew and they didn't look like the German soldiers.</span> <span id="s944">Who were they?</span> <span id="s945">Suddenly we saw the sickle and the hammer and the red flag.</span> <span id="s946">We knew that was Russian.</span> <span id="s947">We ran out barefooted in the snow and we started to scream.</span> <span id="s948">We are liberated, liberated.</span> <span id="s949">It was an insane sound.</span> <span id="s950">You probably heard it on 42nd street.</span> <span id="s951">Then we started to cry like nobody ever cried.</span> <span id="s952">We are liberated, we are liberated.</span> <span id="s953">But where are they all?</span> <span id="s954">They are all dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">And Cipi?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">And there was no Cipi.</span> <span id="s957">Now that we were liberated we went looking for Cipi.</span> <span id="s958">We spent six weeks there on the road waiting for all the survivors who survived pass through our town going towards the train and all we looked for was finding Cipi.</span> <span id="s959">We never found her.</span> <span id="s960">All those bastards who say today forget it, it happened long ago, I have only this to tell them.</span> <span id="s961">To me it happened yesterday because it took me thirty some years before somebody related the story to me of what happened to Cipi.</span> <span id="s962">I looked for her for all those years.</span> <span id="s963">If I saw a familiar walk I followed that for blocks.</span> <span id="s964">I went to buy some bread in a bakery and I thought maybe this old lady is my sister who disappeared thirty some years ago.</span> <span id="s965">And even today when I know that absolutely certain that she's dead, if I see a head that looks familiar, I run.</span> <span id="s966">I never had any peace from that but I know from this eye-witness, one of the girls who was with us, her name was Eva [Philip] [ph][385] who told me that 30 some years later when I told her now you can tell me.</span> <span id="s967">I met her a couple of years before and she started to tell me what happened and I broke down crying so terribly that she stopped the story right there.</span> <span id="s968">But I told her now I am sitting in my kitchen and I'm very comfortable.</span> <span id="s969">You won't see me cry.</span> <span id="s970">You're talking on the telephone.</span> <span id="s971">Please tell me what happened.</span> <span id="s972">And then she told me that Cipi followed me some minutes later and they caught her and they beat her so brutally that she thinks she went crazy.</span> <span id="s973">She wanted to die.</span> <span id="s974">Three more weeks they marched in the most wretched conditions and they refused to kill her.</span> <span id="s975">She begged them kill me, kill me.</span> <span id="s976">They knew that her sisters were gone.</span> <span id="s977">She said she doesn't want to live, please kill me.</span> <span id="s978">They refused to kill her because they knew that she suffers more alive because her sisters are gone.</span> <span id="s979">She lost them to freedom.</span> <span id="s980">Over and over she begged them to kill her and they refused to kill her.</span> <span id="s981">There were no more barbed wires so she had no way to kill herself.</span> <span id="s982">Another indication that you could not die when you wanted to.</span> <span id="s983">You could only die when they wanted you to die and only die their way, not your way.</span> <span id="s984">They dragged her to Bergen-Belsen for three weeks in that condition.</span> <span id="s985">Somebody saw her there.</span> <span id="s986">All she could say was my sisters, thank G-d they're in America probably.</span> <span id="s987">They're free.</span> <span id="s988">At least they live, at least they're free.</span> <span id="s989">She was lovingly talking about us to this person who later on was liberated, came to America, and she couldn't cope with memories of Auschwitz and hanged herself.</span> <span id="s990">But she left us with Cipi's words.</span> <span id="s991">Then she was liberated.</span> <span id="s992">My sister Cipi was liberated.</span> <span id="s993">And then she died.</span> <span id="s994">And in those heaps of Bergen-Belsen, those mounds, those miles of bodies that they were churning up with machinery, one of them was my sister.</span> <span id="s995">And it was that same Bergen-Belsen that that damn Reagan went to Bitburg and I don't wish him a good day because he did that.</span> <span id="s996">He went to Bitburg to honor the SS forty-some graves and it was my sister Chicha who went, not along with him, to Bergen-Belsen on the same trip to protest him because it was that Bergen-Belsen that he was at that they wouldn't let my sister in, I think.</span> <span id="s997">He went to Bergen-Belsen also.</span> <span id="s998">He went to Bitburg and ed-Belsen.</span> <span id="s999">My poor sister went to protest Reagan's attention to Bitburg.</span> <span id="s1000">Coming to the same ed-Belsen where my sister perished and I will always be angry about it, always, always hate him for doing that, for going to Bitburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">You wrote a poem about your youngest sister, did you not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Yes I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Would you please read it for us?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">By the way I want you to know that we were the very first survivors of Auschwitz to reach this land.</span> <span id="s1005">We were put aboard a merchant marine ship called the Brand Whitlock in Odessa.</span> <span id="s1006">Finally we made our way to Odessa by April, from January to April.</span> <span id="s1007">We were put aboard this ship and we were through half the world for nearly five weeks and arrived by some mysterious coincidence on the very day the war ended.</span> <span id="s1008">We arrived on May 8, 1945.</span> <span id="s1009">That made us the first survivors of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1010">You want to hear the poem that I wrote about my sister: Ring around a rosy, six million is only a number, but each somebody's mother, somebody's child, somebody's lover, somebody's bride.</span> <span id="s1011">Potyo was just thirteen; she was my sister.</span> <span id="s1012">She had the wisdom of a child of war.</span> <span id="s1013">She was full of fear yet tiptoed with tenderness, laughter and love in a world of madmen.</span> <span id="s1014">She was a weeping willow, a song of sorrow, a poem of infinite beauty.</span> <span id="s1015">Why does Hitler hate me?</span> <span id="s1016">Why does he love hate?</span> <span id="s1017">Mama, I am only thirteen.</span> <span id="s1018">I have songs yet to learn, games yet to play.</span> <span id="s1019">Give me time to live.</span> <span id="s1020">Give me time to die.</span> <span id="s1021">Mama, how can I do all the living in just an inch of time?</span> <span id="s1022">On a wretched piece of earth, alien land of terror and chaos, on another planet called Auschwitz, Mengele points at Potyo - Ring around a rosies, pocket full of posies, ashes, ashes.</span> <span id="s1023">-- That it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Thank you, Isabella Leitner.</span></p></body></html>
