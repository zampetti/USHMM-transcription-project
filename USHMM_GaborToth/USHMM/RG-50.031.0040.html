I was born in 1915 in Duluth, Minnesota.</span> <span id="s14">I entered the army and enlisted as a private in 1942 at Fort Snelling, Minnesota which is between Minneapolis and St. Paul.</span> <span id="s15">I was commissioned in 1943, after going to officer candidate school, in the artillery.</span> <span id="s16">I went overseas to England and followed normal tract of combat forces though France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.</span> <span id="s17">I was part of the third, the ninth and later the seventh army in Germany in which I moved east along the Southern tier-through Stuttgart, Dachau Munich . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q. Before you entered Dachau, had you heard of the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A.</span> <span id="s20">Many of us were aware of the existence of the concentration camps and we had been given information that the conditions in the camps were less than desirable and the treatment of the prisoners was almost inhuman.</span> <span id="s21">However, there was no possible way of any of us visualizing with any degree of accuracy the impact of having actually come upon and entering a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s22">The condition of the physical facility, the condition of the prisoners was such a shock that it was indescribable, just not to be believed.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q.</span> <span id="s24">You entered on April the 29th?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A. Yes, when Dachau was entered for the first time by the American forces on April 29, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q. Do you recall your first impression upon entering the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A.</span> <span id="s28">At first, before we entered it was a very innocent kind of thing, you don't see anything except there was a railroad track moving in the direction of the camp with the boxcars stationed on the tracks.</span> <span id="s29">This train had just arrived and there were still bodies of the people transported along side of the track that had been deserted by the guards on the approach of the military forces and there were some bodies in the cars.</span> <span id="s30">It's rather a horrible sight because normally a combat person would be acclimated to combat destruction, death, maiming, but not the kind of death that you see under these conditions.</span> <span id="s31">The emaciated bodies, the behavior when the possibility of food is available, and there were people that were expiring from the exhaustion of the excitement.</span> <span id="s32">It is a very difficult thing to recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q.</span> <span id="s34">You entered the camp, as far as physical nature of the camp, what did you see in terms of buildings?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A.</span> <span id="s36">The buildings were regular barracks, very austere, not very clean.</span> <span id="s37">The method of keeping the area clean was very crude.</span> <span id="s38">The discipline the last week prior to our arrival almost ceased to exist.</span> <span id="s39">Some of the prisoners that were well enough moved into the woods to try to locate some of the guards who had run off with the idea of trying to beat them to death and they were unhappy that we prevented them from doing that.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q.</span> <span id="s41">Did you see any guards, were there any left in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A. Yes, we found some and they were turned over to our PW people.</span> <span id="s43">The primary area of our interest was to determine what had actually transpired in the camp by interrogating the prisoners and also the citizens of the town of Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q.</span> <span id="s45">So as an intelligence officer at that time, this was 06:06 your duty to interrogate?</span> <span id="s46">How long after the liberation did that interrogation begin?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A.</span> <span id="s48">It began almost immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q.</span> <span id="s50">It started with the prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A. Absolutely, the prisoners had to be sorted by those who needed medical attention, most of them did.</span> <span id="s52">By almost immediately, I mean within several days the interrogation began.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q.</span> <span id="s54">The physical condition of most of the prisoners you saw was, would you say, malnourished, near death?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A. Malnutrition was the primary cause of the condition, it was just horrible.</span> <span id="s56">There was disease, typhus, there was a great number of cases and the survival rate was very low.</span> <span id="s57">When people ate the food we gave them many got sick, they couldn't handle the volume.</span> <span id="s58">It was too good for them in a sense, they weren't acclimated to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">06:79 Q.</span> <span id="s60">Did you speak to any of the prisoners right after you came into the camp, any contact immediately?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A. Yes but it wasn't on a person to person basis.</span> <span id="s62">It was a question of asking what they needed, how they felt, could they walk so we could separate them and isolate them in terms of their needs so we could handle them more efficiently.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q.</span> <span id="s64">What were some of the general responses to the questions of what they needed and wanted?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A. Food was their primary area of interest.</span> <span id="s66">Many were too sick to be definitive to what they needed and we gave these people immediate medical attention.</span> <span id="s67">We tried to feed them very carefully so they wouldn't be overcome physically by the food they couldn't handle.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q.</span> <span id="s69">As you mentioned before, some of those died soon after the liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A. Yes, some might have passed away whether we were there or not.</span> <span id="s71">Some couldn't handle the excitement.</span> <span id="s72">The level of excitement was not to be believed.</span> <span id="s73">Although there had been rumors that we were approaching, the guards were aware that we were approaching, but the realization of our being there was greater than the anticipation of our arrival.</span> <span id="s74">Some of them felt that they would never be liberated, I suppose, and that perhaps another indication of their despair.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q.</span> <span id="s76">In looking around the camp in terms of buildings what else did you see, what did you notice?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A.</span> <span id="s78">It is very difficult to speak of this.</span> <span id="s79">We even went to an area where people were taken just outside the camp in a wooded area late in the evening, in the winter.</span> <span id="s80">They were asked to remove their clothes and they were sprayed with water and left there all night.</span> <span id="s81">There were times when they did not have to remove their clothes but were still sprayed with water.</span> <span id="s82">So that hopefully when the guard came back in the morning, there would not be too many people to bring back into the camp to put them on work details.</span> <span id="s83">This was one of the methods of reducing the population of the installation.</span> <span id="s84">It's just not to be believed that people can do this to other people regardless of what side of any kind of fence they might be on.</span> <span id="s85">I don't think it's conceivable for so many people to understand that this actually happened.</span> <span id="s86">I found it very difficult to accept, in fact it was much easier for me to forget what I saw than to remember it.</span> <span id="s87">It was more comfortable for me because it was just a horrible thing to think that people could do this to others.</span> <span id="s88">Somehow, being in combat we're trained to seize ground and in the process if necessary to shoot another person.</span> <span id="s89">Somehow I can handle that, but this is not combat that we're talking about, this is absolutely different, inconceivable, that a civilian can do this to another.</span> <span id="s90">You have to be some kind of animal to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q.</span> <span id="s92">So once you started interrogating, one of the things on your mind was how could this have happened?</span> <span id="s93">Why was this done?</span> <span id="s94">Did you ever receive any kind of response to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A. It's difficult to define, Dachau was activated in 1933 by Hitler and initially designed to hold political prisoners and a few criminals.</span> <span id="s96">Little by little it became more than a place to incarcerate prisoners.</span> <span id="s97">It developed slowly.</span> <span id="s98">The SS were called upon to administer and to operate the facility.</span> <span id="s99">They were already trained to do many things we would find reprehensible and difficult to accept.</span> <span id="s100">The camp was designed to hold 8,000 people but at times there were as many as 60,000.</span> <span id="s101">30,000 were there at the time of liberation, still a far greater number than you would expect to find in a camp designed for so fewer people.</span> <span id="s102">The mere fact that they were overcrowded causes a kind of discomfort among the guards and the prisoners, not enough room coupled with inadequate space, add to the inadequate food, add to that the problem, the fear that they may not survive it here by sickness, by malnutrition, or by lack of food, by overcrowding, by lack of sleep and rest.</span> <span id="s103">In the meantime they were called upon to do physical labor.</span> <span id="s104">Add the disappearance and never returning, when you have witnessed people being called away and not returning.</span> <span id="s105">There is a fear that begins to be built up.</span> <span id="s106">You begin to do things that you normally would never do, they would be reprehensible to you but you'll do them to others.</span> <span id="s107">Fear and hunger were the two main reasons people began to lose their humanity, the prisoners did.</span> <span id="s108">The administrators never had any upon arrival that's why they were given this job.</span> <span id="s109">Only the replacement SS, in early 1945 were not the hard core SS.</span> <span id="s110">They were not quite as firm and hard but they had to follow rules.</span> <span id="s111">I'm not sure whether I'm able to get across that transition from normal human beings to animal behavior of one to the other in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s112">The fear of death, fear of dying, fear of not being able to survive will do many horrible things to people.</span> <span id="s113">In the group psychology you're not alone, you're almost reinforced in what you are doing by the numbers that do it with you.</span> <span id="s114">Whether it is hiding behind someone, blending in as not to be noticed, whatever, it is part of the psychology that occurs in concentration camps 1195 of this type.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q.</span> <span id="s116">In addition to malnourishment and overwork, there was also a gas chamber-did you see the chamber there?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A. Yes, but I'd rather not talk about that, I can't handle that.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q.</span> <span id="s119">Once you started interrogating the prisoners, were there many different of nationalities?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A.</span> <span id="s121">At the time we arrived, the camps in the north were overrun and prior to that there was an attempt to reduce the population and ship the prisoners elsewhere.</span> <span id="s122">One of the destinations was Dachau.</span> <span id="s123">30,000 seems to be a low estimate of the number of people there.</span> <span id="s124">Many were from France, Poland, and the other camps.</span> <span id="s125">There was a great number of Jews there that came from the other camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q.</span> <span id="s127">Did you have a series of questions that you asked them?</span> <span id="s128">What were you trying to find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A.</span> <span id="s130">We were trying to find out how they were handled and what tasks they were called upon to do, how they were treated medically if they were ill.</span> <span id="s131">The methods of extermination were learned.</span> <span id="s132">It was an effort to determine what had happened.</span> <span id="s133">Many people couldn't help but know what was going on.</span> <span id="s134">The trains with the people passed right by their homes.</span> <span id="s135">One man, a traveling man lived on Nebelstrasse (ph) the street on which the track that ran right into the camp was.</span> <span id="s136">He knew what was going on and yet he did nothing.</span> <span id="s137">When asked why he indicated that his business was based on the existence of the camp.</span> <span id="s138">For his livelihood he was afraid to do or say anything.</span> <span id="s139">Some of the SS lived in town, Abdachau (ph), the neighbors were afraid to say or do anything for fear that they would end up in the camp.</span> <span id="s140">One particular man, a union man, when asked to support the camp he refused, said "I will not."</span> <span id="s141">He was obstinate in his refusal and felt that the camp was absolutely wrong.</span> <span id="s142">The attitude of the population is very difficult to accept, that they're free because they don't know what's happening but they do know, but they had their own fears to deal with.</span> <span id="s143">That is why they disclaimed any information on what was going on in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q.</span> <span id="s145">Did you see any German civilians brought into the camp to view the camp, to do any labor?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A. I do know that some were bought in the camp.</span> <span id="s147">They were horrified according to their accounts.</span> <span id="s148">I'm not sure how much they knew, they may never had been inside the camps but they saw the cars going in and out, they saw the transports of the work forces in the factories and fields in and around Dachau.</span> <span id="s149">They were not ignorant of the condition of the people, the train loads of people, the stench of the cars, it cannot be escaped.</span> <span id="s150">The cars were sealed and opened for the first time in Dachau.</span> <span id="s151">The people knew more than they were willing 1501 to admit.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q.</span> <span id="s153">In terms of interrogating the prisoners, what were some of the conclusions drawn from the interrogation?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A.</span> <span id="s155">It is difficult to understand how people could do these things to each other, horrible, under the stress of fear, fear of death and survival is a difficult thing to handle.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q.</span> <span id="s157">One of the questions asked of the prisoners pertained to a hospital facility in the camp, was there one?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A.</span> <span id="s159">There was a place where the prisoners were taken care of in a crude fashion.</span> <span id="s160">Experiments took place.</span> <span id="s161">The callousness of the guards and the prisoners picked to be leaders of the barracks, the Kapos, is difficult to understand.</span> <span id="s162">People that were educated were reduced to animal behavior, you knew that they knew better.</span> <span id="s163">They aspired to advance their position and had no concern for the welfare of the prisoners.</span> <span id="s164">Their survival only.</span> <span id="s165">It made me ill that these wonderful people were reduced to such behavior.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q. Were there any German medical personnel that you talked to?</span> <span id="s167">Any SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A. No, there weren't many left.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q.</span> <span id="s170">How long were you in the Dachau area?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A. For several weeks, only until late 1945.</span> <span id="s172">After that I moved to a zone of occupation by Stuttgart to take over a supply function.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q.</span> <span id="s174">At that time did you have contact with former concentration camp survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A. No, nor did I seek it.</span> <span id="s176">I found it hard, I was selfish, trying to forget what I had gone through, I made no attempt to reach out.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q.</span> <span id="s178">The other interrogators in your unit, did they have the same reaction as you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A. I'm not sure if they wanted to forget as completely as I did.</span> <span id="s180">There were many Jews in the unit and they felt a horror that was reassuring to me.</span> <span id="s181">They must 1713 have felt the same way I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q.</span> <span id="s183">So you talked among yourselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A. Yes, while we were there, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q.</span> <span id="s186">The stories of the camps came out in later months in the army newspapers?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A. No, this was for the historical records.</span> <span id="s188">You'll find the accounts, I don't know if they're classified but they're there, I saw them written.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q.</span> <span id="s190">When did you return back to the states?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A.</span> <span id="s192">In 1946, in July.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q.</span> <span id="s194">When you returned, you did not talk about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A. No, I never even discussed it with my wife, not until a year ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q.</span> <span id="s197">Why just now do you feel you need to talk?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A.</span> <span id="s199">This past year I was asked by Dr. Albert Poll (ph) to talk to high school students about my World War II experiences in Europe.</span> <span id="s200">I accepted and about a couple of weeks prior to the date I asked him specifically what he wanted me to dwell on.</span> <span id="s201">He mentioned the Holocaust and the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s202">I was rather shocked.</span> <span id="s203">I hadn't anticipated touching on that subject.</span> <span id="s204">I felt I had to keep my commitment.</span> <span id="s205">I told him that I wasn't sure if I could handle it as well as I would like not having thought about it for 38 years.</span> <span id="s206">The day came I delivered my talk and it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s207">The next day I was asked to make a reference on the same subject to a smaller group who would ask questions.</span> <span id="s208">I found I couldn't handle that.</span> <span id="s209">I broke off half way through.</span> <span id="s210">I began to realize that young people needed to know about something and could only learn it from an eyewitness of the event or else it would be just a story they heard from someone third hand.</span> <span id="s211">It's not an adequate job.</span> <span id="s212">To understand what happened and to do all they could to see that it didn't happen again.</span> <span id="s213">To give indications to the road back to the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s214">This forced me to cease continuing to forget such an important matter.</span> <span id="s215">We all must do everything we can to tell the world what happened so that it is accepted as a fact.</span> <span id="s216">So they can recognize the road back to such a horrible thing and to block it ever happening again.</span> <span id="s217">My comfort is not as important as that matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q.</span> <span id="s219">Did you have occasion later on to encounter any Of the prisoners you came in contact in Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A. I attended a world assembly in Israel this past October.</span> <span id="s221">The event was suggested by Menachem Begin to commemorate and remember the fortieth anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising.</span> <span id="s222">On the first day, I was asked to say a few words on behalf of the uniformed Allied forces, the liberators of the camps.</span> <span id="s223">The world assembly honored the liberators, the survivors the partisans and the resistors of to the Nazis.</span> <span id="s224">After the talks a man rushed up to me and put his arms around me and said "General, don't you remember me?"</span> <span id="s225">I said I didn't and he said, "You saved my life.</span> <span id="s226">You carried me in your arms at Dachau."</span> <span id="s227">I do remember carrying people, no one specifically.</span> <span id="s228">They all looked the same, like a death mask, deep hollow eyes, all alike, all gray.</span> <span id="s229">He was beside himself, he sent me a picture of us together, I will never forget him, Maurice Pioro.</span> <span id="s230">He gave me a book with a list of the Jews taken from Belgium and sent to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s231">The assembly was very moving.</span> <span id="s232">To see so many survivors together, it was reassuring, important to them to be able to talk to one another.</span> <span id="s233">It is essential for their survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q.</span> <span id="s235">Did you speak to the other liberators there?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A. Yes, all had moving experiences.</span> <span id="s237">Talking to people from all the camps from all over the world, it was reinforcing.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">USHMM Archives RG-50.031*0040 PAGE 6</span></p></body></html>
