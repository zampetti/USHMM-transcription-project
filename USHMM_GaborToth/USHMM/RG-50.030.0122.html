<p><span id="s13">Q: Magda, we're going to begin our interview, so I'll start by asking you your name.</span> <span id="s14">A: My name is Magda Lapidus.</span> <span id="s15">My maiden...maiden name is Mezei,</span></p> <p><span id="s16">M-E-Z-E-I.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Fine.</span> <span id="s18">Magna, where were your born?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: I was born in Budapest.</span> <span id="s20">Shall I say the date?</span> <span id="s21">l8th of July 1923.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Good.</span> <span id="s23">Could you tell us a little about your family at that time in the early years of your life.</span> <span id="s24">A: Of my childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Well...uh...I can tell you very nice things.</span> <span id="s27">My childhood in my early, early years...uh...probably the best years in my life because there was no problem.</span> <span id="s28">My father was...uh... a director in...at...at a very nice textile company which...textile company which everybody knew in Budapest, Goldberg was the name.</span> <span id="s29">He was working there from younger age, and gradually working himself up so he had a very comfortable, nice, pleasant life.</span> <span id="s30">My mother never worked.</span> <span id="s31">She was a homemaker.</span> <span id="s32">And my father who was working everyday and I had...I had a little sister who I never knew.</span> <span id="s33">Her name was Clara.</span> <span id="s34">She...That was the firstborn to my mother.</span> <span id="s35">She died when she was a child...a baby, an infant, 8, 7...7 weeks old.</span> <span id="s36">And then after came my little brother, John, who is Hungarian and they called him and he was 16 months older than I am.</span> <span id="s37">He was born in 1922, March 14th.</span> <span id="s38">And then I came.</span> <span id="s39">Magda.</span> <span id="s40">And very many years after came my little brother, George, who was born in 1936, April 15.</span> <span id="s41">So we were the children.</span> <span id="s42">Of course, George doesn't remember my early childhood because I was a young girl.</span> <span id="s43">I was 12 years old when he was born.</span> <span id="s44">We had a..</span> <span id="s45">.</span> <span id="s46">a very.</span> <span id="s47">.</span> <span id="s48">How shall I say it?</span> <span id="s49">A very comfortable, not luxurious life...I can't say that...but we had a very lovely home.</span> <span id="s50">As a matter of fact, I visited in 1977 first time Hungary after I left...from Hungary with my mother and brother.</span> <span id="s51">We left in 46, so we went back in 1971.</span> <span id="s52">That was how many years, 30 some years after...31 years after.</span> <span id="s53">And we went back to the same place where I was born because I was born in that house.</span> <span id="s54">And so was my little brother.</span> <span id="s55">My little brother, John...my younger, brother George was born already in a hospital.</span> <span id="s56">But I was terribly upset.</span> <span id="s57">So upset that I didn't even take my mother in...with her we had a little rental car that time.</span> <span id="s58">We went specifically on my mother's request to go back to Hungary.</span> <span id="s59">She wanted to see the old country once more, so we went in 77.</span> <span id="s60">And we went to that house, and it was unfriendly, dark and not clean so we didn't go inside at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">When...when I went inside is when I went with my husband, Norman.</span> <span id="s62">In 1986 I think or 85 we went to Budapest.</span> <span id="s63">I wanted to show him.</span> <span id="s64">We came from Israel at that time.</span> <span id="s65">He has a brother in Israel.</span> <span id="s66">So we went and I said to my husband, "I'd really like to go back to the house there.</span> <span id="s67">To the building.</span> <span id="s68">It was an apartment.</span> <span id="s69">It was not a private home.</span> <span id="s70">And it's lovely street.</span> <span id="s71">It's a very well known street in Budapest.</span> <span id="s72">It's called .</span> <span id="s73">And nowadays when we went there with my husband, there are some embassy or delegations in that area, in that street.</span> <span id="s74">So we lived in that street and was another street, corner.</span> <span id="s75">And so when I went there it seemed the same in a way again, but I opened the main door and inside it was filthy, and the main entrance to our apartment was either walled in or changed so I couldn't go into the apartment.</span> <span id="s76">It was so disappointing for me and I was so sad that I told my husband, "Let's go.</span> <span id="s77">It's no use to look for something.”</span> <span id="s78">But in my time, it was a very beautiful apartment.</span> <span id="s79">It had four bedrooms and I think had two bathrooms and had a little maid...for the maid.</span> <span id="s80">We had a permanent woman who lived with us for many, many years and then later on changed to other one who also lived with us for many, many years.</span> <span id="s81">And...uh...we had...and I described this...not in this paper what I left but I made a tape on this actually at home in Los Angeles and I lived there really remember.</span> <span id="s82">I remember the curtains were all with strawberry velvet and in the summertime my mother took it off and changed it for a summer curtains that the sun shouldn't eat it up.</span> <span id="s83">And we had a little music room.</span> <span id="s84">One of the rooms was kind of a music room because my mother played the piano beautifully and my father played the harp, which is very unusual that the man plays the harp, but he played the harp.</span> <span id="s85">Everybody else in the family, including me, not anymore, including me, we ...we sang.</span> <span id="s86">We loved to sing.</span> <span id="s87">My mother had a very pretty voice.</span> <span id="s88">My father had a lovely baritone, so we used to play in that music room and friends of my father came and they sang so we had very lovely memories on the holidays.</span> <span id="s89">Hanukkah or Yom Kippur or Pasah, and even Christmas I have to say.</span> <span id="s90">We had a wonderful event even on Christmas time.</span> <span id="s91">You know, Hungary was a very Catholic country.</span> <span id="s92">Everybody had Christmas trees and all this, so everybody was even holiday feeling in that time, winter.</span> <span id="s93">And we had...I remember my...the bedroom... my mother's and father's bedroom was...was in that time, probably was personal when they got married, was light pink and had all lace and so, the children...my brother and myself, we were in one room, never separated.</span> <span id="s94">I don't remember when we were separated.</span> <span id="s95">And then later my...my brother, my little brother was born and...uh...he...I don't know whether he was in a separate room.</span> <span id="s96">I don't remember that.</span> <span id="s97">But it was a lovely home.</span> <span id="s98">We had...in the house was...all the heating were with fire ovens.</span> <span id="s99">I don't know what they stoves or ovens.</span> <span id="s100">I don't know how they call it.</span> <span id="s101">Beautiful.</span> <span id="s102">Each room had a different color.</span> <span id="s103">One was brown.</span> <span id="s104">The other one was pink.</span> <span id="s105">So we liked to sit around there.</span> <span id="s106">And so the regular life was very peaceful.</span> <span id="s107">My father worked, and we went to...later on school.</span> <span id="s108">I remember only the years from my own life when I went to primary school.</span> <span id="s109">And interesting enough I remember that my late brother when to the same primary school a year before I did, and my brother, George, much later...it was already almost war time, he went to that same primary school which was called Princess Julienne.</span> <span id="s110">It was a Dutch Reform private school.</span> <span id="s111">The Dutch Reform Church private school in Hungary, and it still it exists because I took my husband and showed him and said, "Look, how small it looks and...” It was beautiful in my time because it was well kept.</span> <span id="s112">Now it wasn't anymore...the ground well kept.</span> <span id="s113">So I went there to see so after I attended that school and my brother, my late brother, after 4 years...we had 4 years primary school, he went to a so-called gymnasium in Hungary.</span> <span id="s114">They were not called high schools.</span> <span id="s115">or gymnasium.</span> <span id="s116">He went to a gymnasium which was very near where we lived.</span> <span id="s117">, it's called.</span> <span id="s118">This is an old famous Hungarian patriot's name, and he went there and he got his Bachelors Degree there after 8 years.</span> <span id="s119">And I went from that...from the primary school, I went to the Jewish leitsiam, which is...the street still exists.</span> <span id="s120">I don't think that the school existed in Albiana Street.</span> <span id="s121">Maybe it is.</span> <span id="s122">I didn't look for that one.</span> <span id="s123">What I was looking for and surprisingly I didn't find when I went back to Hungary...I went for...after 4 years in that school, I went for a year or so...a year to a Catholic school.</span> <span id="s124">And then from...from the Jewish school...the Catholic school, and on the end I ended in the Commercial Academy of Budapest, which is a very beautiful and very important school.</span> <span id="s125">And I went there for 2 years.</span> <span id="s126">Actually, I have at home...in back in Arizona, my primary school report cards of 4 years and I found some of the report cards from the Jewish leitsiam, high school, so-called high school.</span> <span id="s127">I didn't find anything from the commercial academy.</span> <span id="s128">But as a..</span> <span id="s129">.</span> <span id="s130">as a history, I learned that the Commercial Academy but as a..</span> <span id="s131">.</span> <span id="s132">as a history I learned at the Commercial Academy to write typewriter and geography and mathematics and subjects, accounting and things which was connected to the.</span> <span id="s133">.</span> <span id="s134">uh...Commercial Academy.</span> <span id="s135">And I didn't find the Academy at all, and I told my husband that I really have to go back and look for that.</span> <span id="s136">Why don't I?</span> <span id="s137">So I attended that.</span> <span id="s138">So the school years, if I can say that to you...the primary school and the high school were beautiful.</span> <span id="s139">The primary years, of course, were the best.</span> <span id="s140">I remember all the little gifts we have gotten.</span> <span id="s141">I was a very good student in primary school and my late brother, we were always being Jewish students in a..</span> <span id="s142">.</span> <span id="s143">in a Protestant, because Dutch Reform was...mostly, they were Protestant.</span> <span id="s144">It's a reform school, and even we...the Jewish children, we had special religion class everyday in the morning, the Jewish students...the few of them.</span> <span id="s145">And we were allowed to go to their church where they sing all the beautiful psalms, you know, the Protestant Psalms.</span> <span id="s146">And we learned that.</span> <span id="s147">And that gave us a very good relationship with the other students.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Unfortunately, I have never ever met anybody when I went back to Budapest in 77, anybody at all from my school years.</span> <span id="s149">Probably was a Gentile Christian children went other ways.</span> <span id="s150">The Jewish probably were all most killed, because I didn't see anybody.</span> <span id="s151">So in our life, I speak about, you know, 23, and I got to school when I was 5 and a half, 20 years, 29, 30, 32, and all the way up to...I would say...I remember the date on 1938, that my father was at the table sitting at lunch time.</span> <span id="s152">He came home every day for lunch, and he came every evening home and...and the good years he had even a car.</span> <span id="s153">And I know it was a Fiat.</span> <span id="s154">And we...we didn't travel on that much I know, but when we went to Lake Balaton for the summer season for the 4 weeks, we traveled on this car.</span> <span id="s155">So...but that doesn't mean that we were wealthy, just because he was in this position in this textile company which was the largest in Budapest, he could afford it I suppose or they gave it to him.</span> <span id="s156">I don't know whether it was his or the company, but we had the car.</span> <span id="s157">And...uh...I just don't know...that day I remember very clearly...I remember that for years, that my father opened the newspaper at lunchtime.</span> <span id="s158">We were very quiet at lunch.</span> <span id="s159">We were not supposed to...not because he was strict.</span> <span id="s160">He was not as strict...my mother was stricter to us than my father.</span> <span id="s161">I never even been spanked or anything my father ever in my life.</span> <span id="s162">Never!</span> <span id="s163">I didn't put this in the paper, but I come to my mind, the only time I remember that my father was...became angry with me.</span> <span id="s164">One day when I was a child and he said, "You have to go with me today and with , to Grandma," his mother who passed away before the war .</span> <span id="s165">And I don't know...I didn't want to go.</span> <span id="s166">I said, "No, Father or No, Daddy.</span> <span id="s167">I don't go.</span> <span id="s168">I don't want to go to the...” And he came to me and shook my shoulder and said, "Yes, you go.”</span> <span id="s169">And that was the only violent thing from my father toward me.</span> <span id="s170">My mother, who I adored and all our lives, my younger brother...I think he was a fantastic son and unusual son too because he cared for my mother in last years of her life.</span> <span id="s171">And my mother, if I said something fresh which we were not supposed to...I remember once that I fought with my older brother.</span> <span id="s172">My...my younger brother wasn't alive.</span> <span id="s173">We fought or something.</span> <span id="s174">And I beat my brother, Yanshi with from anger.</span> <span id="s175">And my mother...my brother went to complain to my mother and my mother said, "What did you do?"</span> <span id="s176">And I said, "Well, he said something or he didn't want to do something.</span> <span id="s177">I beat him.</span> <span id="s178">And I said you shouldn't do that.</span> <span id="s179">You will be punished.</span> <span id="s180">And you will be punished now if you continue this.”</span> <span id="s181">And I was so upset about the punishment, I told my mother, "If you punish me Mother, I commit suicide.”</span> <span id="s182">A word from a young child.</span> <span id="s183">And my mother gave me, "Why did you say that?"</span> <span id="s184">And I got it on my mouth.</span> <span id="s185">And I cried terribly.</span> <span id="s186">And my mother said, "You have to go into the corner, with your back turn around.</span> <span id="s187">And I just hysterically cried.</span> <span id="s188">Pardon me.</span> <span id="s189">And I remember that because I cried, cried and then she came to me and embraced me and said, "Okay.</span> <span id="s190">No, more.”</span> <span id="s191">And that was the end of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: You were saying that your father came home one day and.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: And my father came home one day and I remember that he opened the newspaper and he says, "My God, the Germans occupied Vienna.”</span> <span id="s194">And that was in 1938.</span> <span id="s195">So, 1938...I was born in 23, so I remember that...at the paper he said that.</span> <span id="s196">And that...that from that day on, really times in a way changed.</span> <span id="s197">Not much, but in a way, because first of all we lived still in that...in that building where I was born, but I don't know if in 1940 or 41, his salary decreased and something happened in the company.</span> <span id="s198">He didn't have the car needless to say...anything like that.</span> <span id="s199">And in 1941, in Hungary...I remember that very clearly because I was not such a young little girl.</span> <span id="s200">I remember in 1941, they began to take away...the Hungarians, the Jewish men.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Certain young men, certain age.</span> <span id="s202">They had to go to labor camp.</span> <span id="s203">1941 or 1942 they began to concentrate these people in labor camps.</span> <span id="s204">Young men and so I remember that...that time already, we had to move out from the apartment.</span> <span id="s205">We moved in another place called which is forget me street.</span> <span id="s206">And I been back on that street.</span> <span id="s207">We seen the apartment with my younger brother and with my mother, and that part is very nice, still very pretty.</span> <span id="s208">Not too far from our original home, but not that near, maybe a mile and a half or so, walking distance.</span> <span id="s209">And we went there because I suppose my father couldn't afford the big house.</span> <span id="s210">We didn't have a maid then there anymore.</span> <span id="s211">Our maid who we loved very much went back to her village on that time.</span> <span id="s212">I remember that well.</span> <span id="s213">And so we moved to this apartment which is much smaller.</span> <span id="s214">Was very pretty too because I remember that my mother could put her famous curtains and the lace covers.</span> <span id="s215">No piano in that apartment.</span> <span id="s216">I don't know whether they just sold it probably.</span> <span id="s217">No piano, but her own furniture.</span> <span id="s218">She had very beautiful...the living room furniture was wood.</span> <span id="s219">I remember that.</span> <span id="s220">That was with us.</span> <span id="s221">So we had a nice home there too.</span> <span id="s222">And from that home, we were then later on taken to the David Star house.</span> <span id="s223">I remember that we had to leave that.</span> <span id="s224">But the...the town changed because they were frightening times.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Hungary I think entered already in the war as part of the (clearing throat) Nazi Germany.</span> <span id="s226">1942 I suppose.</span> <span id="s227">I am confused with the dates, which you said is not so important for me.</span> <span id="s228">But I know that in 1942 men were taken away to labor camps.</span> <span id="s229">In 1943, that I know positively...1943 my brother was taken also.</span> <span id="s230">It was taken...in that particular time the Hungarian government issued some decrees that certain age, young Jewish men has to go in that...in that district and whichever district we lived, and so my brother had to go and left in 1943.</span> <span id="s231">I seen him once more because in the...in the labor camps...so-called labor camps, because and that's the exact translation, is labor and tava is a camp, so it was a labor camp, where they did...I don't know what work.</span> <span id="s232">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s233">Probably... I don't know what they did.</span> <span id="s234">Anyhow, we weren't supposed to visit him, but we had cards for him, post cards which I have along with me.</span> <span id="s235">And...uh...my brother...uh... we were...we could visit my brother once.</span> <span id="s236">They advised us we come down to Mohacs is the city where we went.</span> <span id="s237">It's south from Budapest.</span> <span id="s238">And we went on a boat with my mother.</span> <span id="s239">My father didn't come along.</span> <span id="s240">I don't know what reason.</span> <span id="s241">That was in 1943.</span> <span id="s242">And we visited my brother on...we went on...by boat, on the Danube River boat, with my mother.</span> <span id="s243">And other families were on this boat visiting this part...particular camp.</span> <span id="s244">Probably, it was advertised or was called up on the people on this labor camp people relatives can come.</span> <span id="s245">I don't know why they done this because when we got there late evening, they were terrible to us.</span> <span id="s246">The Hungarian guards, they were the so called national guards which in Hungary called Chander, and these were in special uniform and a hard like a hat with a feather on them...I don't know what can...it's...it's a bird it was.</span> <span id="s247">It was a very special uniform.</span> <span id="s248">They were very frightening people to me even in...in peace time, but they were very rude and they were very bad and they pushed us and so we were very frightened and they hustled some people in a little room there and I..</span> <span id="s249">.</span> <span id="s250">we didn't go to the camp.</span> <span id="s251">And just where we had to wait for my brother, and my brother came and we seen my brother.</span> <span id="s252">He was not in a bad shape as I remember his face.</span> <span id="s253">He was thinner that time, but he could get packages from my mother and my father for helping through, and that was the last time I seen my brother.</span> <span id="s254">My father and my brother has another story, of course which is later on...my father, in 43, was still with us all the time.</span> <span id="s255">And then came...when the Germans came in 1944, I think 19th of March, was when the Germans entered through the Austrian-Hungarian border to Hungary, and immediately was a horrible evening because we know this was the end of us.</span> <span id="s256">Why we didn't go away from Hungary, I have no idea because I had a cousin, my late father's late brother who died also before the war, who immigrated to Argentina.</span> <span id="s257">So I don't know why it didn't come ever to my father's mind to leave and as a matter of fact, it didn't because we were brought up...my...my brother, my late brother, and myself on a very patriotic way.</span> <span id="s258">We were Hungarian.</span> <span id="s259">We were Jewish, but we were at same...same time Hungarian, so we didn't follow...we didn't have this hatred against Hungarians, because we were Hungarian.</span> <span id="s260">We sang the Hungarian national anthem with the children and we were...my...my late brother was in the boy scouts and went out on the camp just like here in the U.S., so we weren't...we weren't educated to.</span> <span id="s261">.</span> <span id="s262">to hate Gentiles.</span> <span id="s263">That's not true.</span> <span id="s264">We were educated to love everybody.</span> <span id="s265">Just keep our religion as much as we can and respect our books and our past, but we were never in hatred, so when the Germans came and since I remember that was terrible times to other parts of Europe.</span> <span id="s266">1944, it was...the Germans were occupying half Europe, and the Hungarians were fighting with the Germans...not even fighting, it was already a withdrawal.</span> <span id="s267">I think it was...the offensive, the Russian offensive was already a long time on.</span> <span id="s268">My father said, "This is the end.</span> <span id="s269">This will be the end if the...if the Germans come in.”</span> <span id="s270">Because we knew that a lot of Hungarians were very anti-Semitic and we were all...couldn't lead the life as we really wanted to...the peaceful, kind, sweet life.</span> <span id="s271">We were always frightened about something.</span> <span id="s272">When the Germans came in, not very long time after that, they occupied, of course, Budapest, Hungary.</span> <span id="s273">They were these decrees given out to us...to the Jewish people that everybody should leave the house, and they had to be in an assigned building, and that's how we went from that particular place from to this street which was called King Street.</span> <span id="s274">It was not on the...near, but it was again the same district.</span> <span id="s275">I don't know whether you know that Budapest had 12, I think, different districts.</span> <span id="s276">So Budapest was much smaller in a way that time than now....Greater Budapest .</span> <span id="s277">So it was a little bit smaller city and these districts were all, I think, in the Seven districts, if I remember correctly.</span> <span id="s278">And so we were ordered from the house where we were living to go to this David Star house, and we couldn't take anything.</span> <span id="s279">We really didn't take anything.</span> <span id="s280">Really.</span> <span id="s281">It was order given just to...necessary belongings.</span> <span id="s282">All the furniture, everything stayed back which we have never found, needless to say, even after the Russian came in.</span> <span id="s283">Everything was stolen.</span> <span id="s284">Everything was taken.</span> <span id="s285">I only remember things like...like my mother gave out some Persian rugs to some Christian friends because we had...my father was 4 years...in the first World War, he was decorated.</span> <span id="s286">He had a shot in his leg and his back.</span> <span id="s287">Never suffered of it, but I know that he showed that.</span> <span id="s288">This was...he was in Shamisho, I remember...this was a big event in first war, first of all.</span> <span id="s289">And he had friends from first World War.</span> <span id="s290">His pals or his buddies as we call it, and he kept up with them and he went to military meetings like the people do, so he had Christian friends.</span> <span id="s291">We had very many Christian friends through my father and...uh...what happened when we went...when we were ordered to go out from this street building to the other one... Well, we couldn't take anything along.</span> <span id="s292">I remember that.</span> <span id="s293">Only clothing.</span> <span id="s294">And I remember that my mother put things in a big basket.</span> <span id="s295">You know, the old fashioned baskets which you carry.</span> <span id="s296">And that was all what we have taken to the other house.</span> <span id="s297">But I remember that my mother gave out some jewelry which she had, necklace and something from her aunt.</span> <span id="s298">I don't remember exactly which...which it was because I was .</span> <span id="s299">I think her diamond earrings were sold already.</span> <span id="s300">Because I know that it was sold because the little container where her earrings were...she had, I still have.</span> <span id="s301">And how I got it back that's a long story.</span> <span id="s302">That comes later, but I know that...that the basket was filled up with winter clothing and some pots and plans which she needed maybe to cook.</span> <span id="s303">Anyhow on that particular time, this was in 44, frightening things happened.</span> <span id="s304">As you know, in 1944 March to mid July I suppose or maybe before, all the Hungarian Jews were deported from the provincial area.</span> <span id="s305">There were no Hungarian Jews alive unless some could escape or could hide or had fake documents or what not, but all the rest of the Hungarian-Jewish population was deported to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s306">All of them.</span> <span id="s307">And...uh...I have to make a comment here, which I put in my paper, which is always in my mind that I have very good friend in San Diego who was in Auschwitz and is a Czech girl from Prague.</span> <span id="s308">And she mentioned to me when I..</span> <span id="s309">.</span> <span id="s310">I..</span> <span id="s311">.</span> <span id="s312">I met her and she became friend of mine in Venezuela.</span> <span id="s313">I lived in Venezuela 12 years.</span> <span id="s314">And she always told of me of her times from Auschwitz and we interchanged ideas.</span> <span id="s315">She was liberated in Bergen-Belsen by the way.</span> <span id="s316">She said, "You know, the Hungarian Jews were amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Because the Hungarian Jews were brought in by the train to Auschwitz on X days in June or July, and these people had their own clothing where they came...those that survived the transportation because, as you know, many of them died unfortunately in the transport.</span> <span id="s318">And as they arrived, they were separated, men and women, all the survivors and they were taken on the same day to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s319">So many Hungarian Jews, according to her, and I know this from history, in a way, they were spared to Auschwitz and all the others.</span> <span id="s320">They were gassed on the same day.</span> <span id="s321">So this was very important for me to hear, because the Budapest Jews were the last fortress in a way as we call it.</span> <span id="s322">And the rest we hear...we heard rumors.</span> <span id="s323">We heard the news, but we really didn't know exactly, because you really never knew exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s324">I didn't have a radio or my father had no radio at that time to hear any foreign news.</span> <span id="s325">Anyhow, my father...</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Magda, before you go into that, could you come back.</span> <span id="s327">A: Yes, I can.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: To the house that you were moved into, the Star of David House.</span> <span id="s329">A: Yal.</span> <span id="s330">The Star of David house.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: And...and tell us a little bit about what you did at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: Well,.</span> <span id="s333">.</span> <span id="s334">uh...the Star of David House was the house that my father separated from us because when we went to the Star of David House and again, as you say, I don't remember exactly the date, but it must have been June or July when the Budapest Jews were already...you know, in Budapest, they had the Jewish Council who were discussing with Eichmann what to do with the Budapest Jews.</span> <span id="s335">That I remember historically that it happened.</span> <span id="s336">But my father went into hiding.</span> <span id="s337">And that particular time, his friends who were my friends and my late mother's friends...they offered him to stay with them and give him false documentation.</span> <span id="s338">So my father didn't live with us in that house because as far as I remember, I was the oldest, and my mother and my brother and my father said, "You would be taking care of my mother, your Mum and your brother.</span> <span id="s339">Whatever happens.</span> <span id="s340">I will be outside.</span> <span id="s341">Whatever I can help, I will help.</span> <span id="s342">If I can bring food, I will help food.</span> <span id="s343">If I can take you out, I will take you out, but at least I will be outside.”</span> <span id="s344">This was a decision between my mother and father, and I know that he left and he went to live with these people whose name I know, of course.</span> <span id="s345">Steven , the family.</span> <span id="s346">Uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: And yourself.</span> <span id="s348">How did you...</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Me.</span> <span id="s350">I was the one who was the man of the house.</span> <span id="s351">Let's put it this way.</span> <span id="s352">And I was a very strong, young girl I think because I said we will have to survive this because my brother, my older brother who I loved terribly, wasn't with us and I said to my mother, "I want to be with my brother.”</span> <span id="s353">Because I grew up with him.</span> <span id="s354">My little brother, of course, was a baby brother we loved.</span> <span id="s355">But I went with my brother in the same school.</span> <span id="s356">I was a little bit Tom boyish in my life because I was always surrounded with these boys of his schools.</span> <span id="s357">My.</span> <span id="s358">.</span> <span id="s359">His friends were my pals, so I was pretty strong little girl I'd say.</span> <span id="s360">I went to all...in my childhood, all the child illnesses basically, with my brother together, so I thought that, "Yes, we will do it.”</span> <span id="s361">So I was the mover.</span> <span id="s362">I was doing...when we went to the David Star...this was a house which was not emptied by the tenants.</span> <span id="s363">The tenants...they lived in the...in the building stayed there, but some Jewish people from other building like we were...other streets, were put into this building.</span> <span id="s364">So I took my husband also to that building which is now beautifully re...redone actually.</span> <span id="s365">In that time, it was a three-floor building and we were just coming in and we were assigned...uh...because the Consier in that building stayed on, was a woman, Christian woman.</span> <span id="s366">Very nice person, who was apparently appointed by either the Hungarian government or whoever that she...she should order where these people that coming to the building should live.</span> <span id="s367">So she assigned us, my mother and my brother to that floor, to the second floor in that apartment, which was a very large apartment, but I think we were at least 30-35 people in that apartment.</span> <span id="s368">So we were cramped together also in...in a place where nobody could bring their own furniture.</span> <span id="s369">But people they lived in there were their furniture, and we had only this basket with our winter clothing, what not, and some pillows.</span> <span id="s370">I remember that some pillows were stuffed in the basket.</span> <span id="s371">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: What was life like for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Life was like that.</span> <span id="s374">You know the government allowed that one or two people in certain hours of the day went still with these David Star houses, which was not the ghetto, could go out into the street with the David Star.</span> <span id="s375">We were all marked of course with the yellow star.</span> <span id="s376">We all had.</span> <span id="s377">My father, not.</span> <span id="s378">My father was...sometimes we didn't even see my father 3, 4 days.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">When he appeared suddenly during the hour when people...when we could move, he came into the building and he told...told us, "Don't go out on Tuesday or Wednesday because I will be coming when you are supposed to go out.</span> <span id="s380">So the building...the door was open.</span> <span id="s381">And also the Consiers...this woman whose name was Anna actually, she was quite nice to the people in the building.</span> <span id="s382">She was not a bad person.</span> <span id="s383">So my mother could come time to time to the building and bring us bread or bacon which was a no, no, but still whatever he could bring.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Some food.</span> <span id="s385">Hot food, I don't remember that he brought.</span> <span id="s386">But in that time, in the building is gas...was gas, and all the was a siege city because already bomb...bombing.</span> <span id="s387">The American bombing was there already at that time, but still gas was coming.</span> <span id="s388">So people they had any kind of material which you could obtain down in the streets and the shops.</span> <span id="s389">street is a street which I went to, walking with my husband, which is a street connecting major avenues, kind of.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Magda, before you get into that, could you come back to the time that you were in that house, in the Star of David House.</span> <span id="s391">How long were you there before you moved out into...</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Well, this was sometimes in June.</span> <span id="s393">Basically, I think it was June.</span> <span id="s394">And from there they took us to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s395">I didn't go directly to the Spanish house.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Tell us about getting to the ghetto?</span> <span id="s397">Who took you there and how did they take you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Well, they were not taking us.</span> <span id="s399">They were ordering us.</span> <span id="s400">There was no taking.</span> <span id="s401">That was a time in...by that time I had the Spanish...I had the...I had the Spanish Shutzpass, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: How did you get that?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: Oh, the Shutzpass is another story.</span> <span id="s404">But let me tell you about my father because that...that is conflict...conflicting with the Shutzpass.</span> <span id="s405">My father came back.</span> <span id="s406">This was June and July, and we still could go out from the David House to shop if we had some money.</span> <span id="s407">We still could cook something on the stove, if we had one.</span> <span id="s408">We were in a horrible, frightening condition needless to say, because we heard that the Hungarian Nazis are coming to the buildings and getting off people from the buildings for a different marches to take them away wherever they wanted to take to deport them.</span> <span id="s409">Needless to say, Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s410">We didn't know that exactly where is Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s411">And my father was coming back time to time but not too frequent.</span> <span id="s412">And what happened, on one day I went out on the street because I was again the eldest...to the street where I can find some friends or contact because we needed food.</span> <span id="s413">We were very little food.</span> <span id="s414">We had no meat or no milk or nothing like that.</span> <span id="s415">You know, we had flour Nothing really or sometimes, some little bread.</span> <span id="s416">So we changed with people, or we had friends we could go to some friends and say, "Could you give me something because I'm in this house.</span> <span id="s417">I have to go back.”</span> <span id="s418">So some friends helped sometime.</span> <span id="s419">One day I went out from the building and on the street I met a professor of mine from the Commercial Academy who was also a Jewish man and was much elderly than I am, probably I'm .</span> <span id="s420">He must have been that time 55.</span> <span id="s421">And we...as he recognized me, I recognized him and I said...he seen that I have a David Star and he had a David Star and I said, "Where do you live?"</span> <span id="s422">And a little conversation occurred, and he said, "You know there is a way out from this David Houses, David Star Houses, because he warned me and he said, "I am warning you that this house is endangered because they are setting up the ghetto in Budapest and on the .</span> <span id="s423">In that area .</span> <span id="s424">I remembered even the certain names of those streets.</span> <span id="s425">And he said, "You are endangered and we are endangered.”</span> <span id="s426">I don't know where he was.</span> <span id="s427">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s428">He was not in the building.</span> <span id="s429">He says, "But there are some countries they're helping the Jewish people to get into protected houses.</span> <span id="s430">The Swedish and Swiss I knew about more or less, but I had no contact with these people and I didn't know where to go any how, so I just skipped that idea totally that I should go to these homes, the ligation.</span> <span id="s431">I just didn't...maybe I didn't even know where they were.</span> <span id="s432">But he said to me that you know the Spanish Ligation is also giving out passes and I..</span> <span id="s433">.</span> <span id="s434">as of today, I don't remember where the Spanish Ligation was by the way.</span> <span id="s435">I have to ask Perlasca, Mr. Perlasca, where was it because I don't remember.</span> <span id="s436">But he said, "I'm going there.</span> <span id="s437">Would you come along?"</span> <span id="s438">And this was in an hour or two period when we were allowed to leave so we went together.</span> <span id="s439">And I said, "Yes, I want to have that because I might rescue my family.”</span> <span id="s440">And he took me in and I remember the Ligation, there were a lot of people already there.</span> <span id="s441">I don't know how and I don't know when we got into...with him ...into the Ligation.</span> <span id="s442">It was in...not in what is it called?</span> <span id="s443">Uh...I don't remember the name in English.</span> <span id="s444">It was a foreroom kind of.</span> <span id="s445">And as soon as we got there, Havier was attached to me or attached to us or attached .</span> <span id="s446">Anyway, I met Havier.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Havier was whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Havier was this young Spanish man who on that point I didn't know who he was.</span> <span id="s449">Havier talked to me.</span> <span id="s450">I didn't speak a word Spanish that time, needless to say.</span> <span id="s451">I spoke German perfectly.</span> <span id="s452">I grew up with German, simultaneously with Hungarian, and I tried to talk to him in German and he spoke to me and he asked who I am and I told my name is Magda Mezei, Magda and I have still my brother, little brother and I told my little story in two words and...uh...by that time, my father was taken by the way.</span> <span id="s453">My father...and I..</span> <span id="s454">.</span> <span id="s455">this was a period of end of October or beginning of November.</span> <span id="s456">I don't remember exactly the time, but it was in October because my father wasn't with us anymore.</span> <span id="s457">My father was taken from our building because he came back one night.</span> <span id="s458">One terrible night he came back to stay with us, brought food and the next morning...in the morning, the Hungarians came and round up the men and young women and we were round up...my father and myself together.</span> <span id="s459">We left together and my mother and brother in that building.</span> <span id="s460">And they took us in a long march and suddenly, the Hungarians separated the men from the women and I never seen my father on that day on.</span> <span id="s461">I only know that I marched with the Hungarian...with the women, Jewish women from the whole King street all the way in the alley was called Fosua and I went back by at my old school...my Julienne was there, and looked at it, and I went...passed by and they took us out, far away this march, picked up hundreds and hundreds of women.</span> <span id="s462">And they picked us up and took us in a big, I call it a lodge, but it wasn't a lodge.</span> <span id="s463">A big empty area outside of...kind of outskirts of Budapest.</span> <span id="s464">And there where I was.</span> <span id="s465">My father I never seen again.</span> <span id="s466">I know what happened more or less is my father, later I found this out, after the war, but my story...a long story what happened to me, but we go back.</span> <span id="s467">How we come...come to the Spanish...uh...Legation.</span> <span id="s468">So this professor of...I came back from his horrible march.</span> <span id="s469">I rescued myself.</span> <span id="s470">How...I..</span> <span id="s471">.</span> <span id="s472">it's a different story.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Why don't you tell us?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: Okay, I'll tell you how.</span> <span id="s475">We went...this was very early morning.</span> <span id="s476">And this march began, sometimes at 4 o'clock, 5 o'clock in darkness and when...when these Hungarian Nazis came to the building and the...the...the way as they do it was a very regular way.</span> <span id="s477">They stand...the Hungarian...they had the autocrats.</span> <span id="s478">They didn't have swastika.</span> <span id="s479">They had black uniforms with this autocrats.</span> <span id="s480">They went...they were armed.</span> <span id="s481">They went in the middle of the house.</span> <span id="s482">The house...the European houses, as you know, had outside you could see downstairs to the...to the courtyard.</span> <span id="s483">This house was like that, so anybody who came out from the apartment was a..</span> <span id="s484">.</span> <span id="s485">some could look downstairs, every apartment.</span> <span id="s486">So they...they stood in the middle of the court yard and were there...what is it called?</span> <span id="s487">with their microphone, not microphone.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q:</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Yal.</span> <span id="s490">What they do like it and the police and they call it.</span> <span id="s491">They called out all men from a certain age, and all women for and that age should come down to the court yard.</span> <span id="s492">So everybody was frightened.</span> <span id="s493">Nobody could hide away.</span> <span id="s494">There was no way where to hide.</span> <span id="s495">So the age limit, what they directed, they came down.</span> <span id="s496">And there was my father.</span> <span id="s497">On that night he came, and my father had to go.</span> <span id="s498">And there was I in that age limit, so we went together.</span> <span id="s499">We said goodbye to my Mom and to my brother because we really didn't think that we would be never coming back or we never see each other.</span> <span id="s500">You know, people were naive.</span> <span id="s501">They didn't know this.</span> <span id="s502">So I..</span> <span id="s503">.</span> <span id="s504">I get a little bag from my mother with some clothing, something in it.</span> <span id="s505">And my father, I don't recall that he had anything.</span> <span id="s506">My father had only a warm coat because I'm sure it was sometimes in October, because he had already a kind of a winter coat with a velvet collar on it, and a hat.</span> <span id="s507">And so we went together hand in hand, but on this march, out of the building...everybody out of it, hustled, hustled, hustled fast, were already a column on the street.</span> <span id="s508">We were not the only one.</span> <span id="s509">They picked up on all the... street had a fairly large Jewish population.</span> <span id="s510">That's true.</span> <span id="s511">So they took everybody from these homes which was set up to the street.</span> <span id="s512">And we marched and marched and we went by at the school and we didn't see and we didn't talk much because we didn't know what happened.</span> <span id="s513">And suddenly, they stopped the column and they separated the men and the women.</span> <span id="s514">So I said goodbye to my father, not even goodbye, it was kind of going away from me and I was in the middle of the other column and we were marching, marching, marching to this big area in Hungary.</span> <span id="s515">I think, if I remember well, it was in Zuglo, Z-U-G-L-O, which is kind of on outskirts...outside of the main city.</span> <span id="s516">And they marched, marched, marched.</span> <span id="s517">They hustled, you know, these...these aristocratic people.</span> <span id="s518">They shouted, "Well, Move," you know, very harshly.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Nobody...everybody...mostly young people I see...young person like I am, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, I didn't see hardly in that column at all.</span> <span id="s520">And they took us to this (clearing throat) to this empty...empty grass lot, but it wasn't a lot really because there were hundreds.</span> <span id="s521">(clearing throat) There must be thousands.</span> <span id="s522">I don't know to me it looked incredible amount of people.</span> <span id="s523">And all day, and it was from morning until late afternoon, we couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s524">We couldn't...we didn't have food.</span> <span id="s525">We didn't have water.</span> <span id="s526">We didn't have toilets.</span> <span id="s527">If somebody had to go, we had to make it to secretly that they should finish up they had to finish because these guards were not that many, but they were around.</span> <span id="s528">They were walking.</span> <span id="s529">And I was...the lot was kind of...to me looked square, square, I seen the people.</span> <span id="s530">And I was somehow on the edge of the square corner, kind of, and on this column.</span> <span id="s531">And I always pushed myself also to the side, because I had a feeling that I have to get away from here because if I don't get away from here I will not see my mother and brother.</span> <span id="s532">And interestingly enough, this edge where I was standing with others, hundreds, had a big ditch, a big ditch.</span> <span id="s533">It was the end of this lot, kind of.</span> <span id="s534">A regular ditch, which was like bush, bushes and green stuff, but dry stuff, and I didn't do anything on that whole day except freezing and thinking how will I get away and when.</span> <span id="s535">And I did that exactly on one moment when the guard was looking up.</span> <span id="s536">I just jumped.</span> <span id="s537">Nobody wanted to do this, but I couldn't do anything else.</span> <span id="s538">I jumped and rolled into this ditch.</span> <span id="s539">I just rolled into it and crawled on the ditch toward the other end where...the ditch was long.</span> <span id="s540">It wasn't a ditch...after the ditch were far away homes, but not a lot.</span> <span id="s541">They were already building.</span> <span id="s542">Like this would be the ditch.</span> <span id="s543">I was standing here and this ditch was a long ditch, and here were already houses of this area.</span> <span id="s544">Here...and part of empty with hundreds and hundreds of Jewish people.</span> <span id="s545">I ripped my star off.</span> <span id="s546">I left right there and crawled, crawled, crawled, crawled, until I seen a street crossing of the ditch because then the ditch goes under the water goes, so I had to get up.</span> <span id="s547">There was not a soul.</span> <span id="s548">I just got up.</span> <span id="s549">It was dark because in the late afternoon, it was probably, I suppose, it was dark.</span> <span id="s550">All...all dark.</span> <span id="s551">It was getting dark, but you know, Budapest has a tough curfew because Budapest was a bomb city at that time.</span> <span id="s552">It was bombing and dark.</span> <span id="s553">So it was really dark and I don't know how.</span> <span id="s554">Today, as you told me, and as I went back to Budapest and I didn't find that area and I was looking.</span> <span id="s555">As a matter of fact, I was accommodated...in 1977 when I went back with my mother and brother, we went by the we rented an apartment, you know, to stay in Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">And they...they gave us an apartment in Zuglo and I said to my mother all the time, "This is the area where I was somehow here.”</span> <span id="s557">But I never recognized it.</span> <span id="s558">It was all built in.</span> <span id="s559">And the next day from Zuglo, we left because I told my mother I can't...we can't stay here.</span> <span id="s560">I was very upset.</span> <span id="s561">I found it very dirty.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: You got back?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: In 77 yes.</span> <span id="s564">So I got back to this...uh...to the street and I ran.</span> <span id="s565">And there was not a soul on the streets of Budapest.</span> <span id="s566">And I don't even know how today exactly how I found King street.</span> <span id="s567">I know more or less, you know, I remembered naturally where my high school was, the Jewish gymnasium which is in that direction from...when I attended my high school I went from the old apartment where I was born to a certain area where I get...took the tram...tram and go to my high school.</span> <span id="s568">So I remembered very well that area and where I was.</span> <span id="s569">Now in this ditch area, I thought I knew exactly which is north and south which area I have to go.</span> <span id="s570">So I followed my instinct and I got...and this was far away.</span> <span id="s571">I have to tell you, this is really far from Zuglo where we were...the David Star must have been.</span> <span id="s572">I am sure.</span> <span id="s573">50 miles.</span> <span id="s574">I don't know.</span> <span id="s575">I am judging because I really don't know.</span> <span id="s576">And I was on the street, on King Street because I remember that I went by my little school again in the dark.</span> <span id="s577">It's an alley where my was a beautiful old chestnut trees really.</span> <span id="s578">And it was already...leaves were already not on in October.</span> <span id="s579">They were already fall.</span> <span id="s580">Cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: You walked back to this street?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: I walked back to the street and suddenly it was dark.</span> <span id="s583">Suddenly, I heard that somebody is also walking, coming toward me and somebody shouted, "Halt," in German.</span> <span id="s584">And I froze, because if "Halt," says it must be a German...some...a full German soldier.</span> <span id="s585">And good enough, he put the flashlight...I wrote this in my paper because I had it so clearly in my mind.</span> <span id="s586">He put the flashlight on my face.</span> <span id="s587">There were three of them, three German officers.</span> <span id="s588">I don't think they were SS because I'd remember that.</span> <span id="s589">And they said, " .”</span> <span id="s590">What are you doing here?</span> <span id="s591">"Do you speak German?"</span> <span id="s592">"Yes" And I said to him, "I'm going to visit my grandmother, .</span> <span id="s593">She is crank I told him and she's sick, and I just...I'm sorry that I go that late, but I have to look for her.</span> <span id="s594">And they said, "No.</span> <span id="s595">Go.</span> <span id="s596">Go.</span> <span id="s597">Get.</span> <span id="s598">Get.”</span> <span id="s599">And they let me go.</span> <span id="s600">And you can imagine that I'm a Jewish girl, a young girl.</span> <span id="s601">I had very long hair that time, and these Germans, they could kill me right there.</span> <span id="s602">Or they can take me to the Hungarians.</span> <span id="s603">And they let me go.</span> <span id="s604">And I go to that building and the building was...this David Star building was always closed.</span> <span id="s605">Was curfew time, always had to go...and I rang the bell and Anna came, the Consier.</span> <span id="s606">"How come they let you back?"</span> <span id="s607">I said, "Just let me in.”</span> <span id="s608">And that's how I survived that.</span> <span id="s609">And I survived an other time.</span> <span id="s610">My father was, of course, gone, but I survived another time because not very long after that, they again came to look for the young...not young, for the women.</span> <span id="s611">And Anna, Anna, this woman, Anna, came said, "I have to hide you," and took me down to her little room.</span> <span id="s612">The Consiergeree had...her apartment, a little room, you know, as in Europe they sit there to watch who comes and goes.</span> <span id="s613">Not that she was sitting there.</span> <span id="s614">But she said, "I take you.”</span> <span id="s615">And she pushed me into that room, into the cabinet where she had a red fox coat.</span> <span id="s616">I remember that clearly because who had a red fox coat that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Only maybe she was stolen that from somebody or somebody gave it to her because she was not wealthy.</span> <span id="s618">And put me behind that stole and I was there for hours in that little cabinet until she came.</span> <span id="s619">"Now you can get out.”</span> <span id="s620">I was amongst the very few young people, if I remember, young women in that building they ever survived.</span> <span id="s621">At least to my eyes.</span> <span id="s622">There were women like my mother.</span> <span id="s623">My mother was born in 1898 and this she was not a young girl.</span> <span id="s624">Those women were around.</span> <span id="s625">Even elderly women were in the building.</span> <span id="s626">I remember one, a very old woman who came with us to the ghetto, was at that time 80.</span> <span id="s627">She died.</span> <span id="s628">She never survived because in the ghetto very many people died.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Magda, before you get there, you have to get to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s630">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s631">That's very nearby anymore.</span> <span id="s632">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">q: You are still in the Star of David House.</span> <span id="s634">Uh...You had managed to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: But I had...I had in my hand and by that particular time I should stress.</span> <span id="s636">I remember that very clearly because Havier...going back, then I went to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s637">Havier...to Havier, I got the Shutzpass, because Havier said to me in the first meeting that I have to go back and next day when I can get out from the house, I have to bring the photograph.</span> <span id="s638">And I have that Shutzpass.</span> <span id="s639">My brother will bring it on the 6th.</span> <span id="s640">We will give it the memorial.</span> <span id="s641">On that...on that time, we had the pass in our hand.</span> <span id="s642">My father was...</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Before you go to that...</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: And then came an order...then came an order.</span> <span id="s645">Then on that particular time came an other that every David Star house, every, all of them.</span> <span id="s646">That means , King Street, or wherever they may be because I don't know where they all were around.</span> <span id="s647">They all have to move to the ghetto, without exception.</span> <span id="s648">So when...and they have to line up on this and this day.</span> <span id="s649">I don't remember the date.</span> <span id="s650">Maybe Perlasca will remember, maybe somebody else.</span> <span id="s651">We were lined up before the building.</span> <span id="s652">Everybody of the Jewish people lined up, and the ghetto from King street where the ghetto behind it .</span> <span id="s653">I would say...I..</span> <span id="s654">.</span> <span id="s655">I don't.</span> <span id="s656">I am thinking now in miles any more, so in miles would be maybe 2 miles because you know the streets are not as long as I think, in Fifth Avenue, so went to the main boulevard and from boulevard to where the left was, all Jewish section any how, more or less.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Before we go on.</span> <span id="s658">.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: That's where we put in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s660">Q: How did you get to the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: How we got to the ghetto?</span> <span id="s662">We were walked there, and they pushed in anywhere they could...the Hungarian Nazis.</span> <span id="s663">There were...there were no Germans there around, only Hungarian.</span> <span id="s664">I didn't see any Germans around the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: You had the Spanish pass at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: I had the Spanish pass in my hand.</span> <span id="s667">I didn't have any belongings.</span> <span id="s668">We didn't have anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">We had nothing with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: Magda, how did you get the Spanish pass?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: Well, I'm now I'm tell you this.</span> <span id="s672">Spanish Shutzpass , Havier, again Havier said, "We will give you the pass which and the Legation issuing for the Jewish population you can have.</span> <span id="s673">But you bring back the pictures.”</span> <span id="s674">I brought back the pictures next day right into the people.</span> <span id="s675">Havier was there.</span> <span id="s676">Havier took the pictures and took me into the room.</span> <span id="s677">Now Perlasca told me today, Mr. Perlasca, that I think I gave it to you.</span> <span id="s678">And I said, "I cannot be sure, but I think it was Spanish police who gave it to me.</span> <span id="s679">But Havier was there.</span> <span id="s680">Havier standing by...he said, "I'll see you back again at the David Star house.”</span> <span id="s681">Because I went back to David Star.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">And the truth is that Havier came at night 3 times or twice to the David Star, before we were taken to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s683">He came at night, and Anna let him in and called me down and said Havier brought us some food or some bread.</span> <span id="s684">I don't remember what else.</span> <span id="s685">I remember that he brought me a comb.</span> <span id="s686">I do remember that.</span> <span id="s687">A comb.</span> <span id="s688">Because I didn't have a comb.</span> <span id="s689">And he brought this there, and he said..."Where do we go?"</span> <span id="s690">I asked him.</span> <span id="s691">And he said, "You will be going to the St. Stephen's Park House," and he give the address.</span> <span id="s692">Either was St. Stephen Park 9 or 7.</span> <span id="s693">[NB: Subsequent to the interview, Mrs. Lapidus remembered that it was #35, not #7 or #9, St. Stephen Park] I have to verify this with Mr. Perlasca because he immediately knew that you were in the St. Stephen's House.</span> <span id="s694">And I don't remember... although I went back to the building in 77, and even now in 85, I don't remember the number.</span> <span id="s695">Anyhow, he told us that that's where we have to go.</span> <span id="s696">But apparently there was no...not enough time within the period that I had the pass from Havier and from the Legation.</span> <span id="s697">I didn't even understand the connection why the Spanish Legation will issue such thing because I was an intelligent girl,, and I knew that Franco is a fascist.</span> <span id="s698">And I know that Franco was neutral.</span> <span id="s699">I didn't think about any Blue Division.</span> <span id="s700">I learned this from Havier because Havier told me when I asked, "What is your name?"</span> <span id="s701">and he said, "My have is Havier , and my name is very famous because there was a Spanish poet in the same name.”</span> <span id="s702">I was telling you this before, and I tell you how I came to this .</span> <span id="s703">All the time, 45 years I had Havier in my mind, and Havier said, "You will go to St. Stephen House, but I tell you when.”</span> <span id="s704">Curiously enough when he came on that night and brought this little comb and brought the food, I will see you in the Spanish house because I was supposed to go there with my mother and my brother during the 3 hours was assigned to us.</span> <span id="s705">But I don't know why we didn't because we...we landed in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s706">They lined us up the ghetto.</span> <span id="s707">Now I had the pass.</span> <span id="s708">We had nothing.</span> <span id="s709">Really, we had this basket.</span> <span id="s710">We couldn't carry.</span> <span id="s711">So we went to the ghetto without anything.</span> <span id="s712">Just as we were, except the pass.</span> <span id="s713">No documentation.</span> <span id="s714">Nothing except these two papers.</span> <span id="s715">We went to the ghetto and when we arrived in the ghetto on the same day...the next day, they were not only the Hungarian autocrats people, they were Hungarian police force.</span> <span id="s716">The regular Hungarian police was...of l944.</span> <span id="s717">I remember exactly how they were in uniform because I was growing up.</span> <span id="s718">I made a little conversation because I was a young woman, you know, an attractive woman.</span> <span id="s719">I made a conversation with a police officer there and I said, "You know, I have here some document.</span> <span id="s720">I shouldn't be here in the ghetto at all.”</span> <span id="s721">Because I was...I was very frightened.</span> <span id="s722">We didn't have food.</span> <span id="s723">We didn't have nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">And I..</span> <span id="s725">.</span> <span id="s726">knowing what ghetto is from not only because I was so dumb.</span> <span id="s727">I knew about ghetto.</span> <span id="s728">I know...I heard of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s729">We heard every ghetto... ghetto?</span> <span id="s730">Why would I be in a ghetto when I grew up in a civilized surrounding?</span> <span id="s731">You know, I was frightened of the word.</span> <span id="s732">And I told this to this man.</span> <span id="s733">He was an old policeman.</span> <span id="s734">A fat, heavy set, mustache, pleasant Hungarian policeman.</span> <span id="s735">I don't remember his name.</span> <span id="s736">I only know that told him that I told him, "How can we get away?</span> <span id="s737">I don't have anything to give you.</span> <span id="s738">I..</span> <span id="s739">.</span> <span id="s740">we have nothing?"</span> <span id="s741">He said, "You don't have to give me.</span> <span id="s742">I bring you out there.”</span> <span id="s743">You know, in his Hungarian peasant way.</span> <span id="s744">We stayed in the ghetto and this street was Old.</span> <span id="s745">That's why I remember the street because it's a crazy name.</span> <span id="s746">Old Street.</span> <span id="s747">But that was Old Street, Old.</span> <span id="s748">Which was on the of the temple.</span> <span id="s749">He said, "I will bring you out.”</span> <span id="s750">I said, "I don't have to bring me out.</span> <span id="s751">I have a mother and my little brother as you see.</span> <span id="s752">You have to...three of us, we have to go.”</span> <span id="s753">He said, "I'll bring you out there.”</span> <span id="s754">And he did.</span> <span id="s755">One evening when it was curfew in the city, he came.</span> <span id="s756">He led us through the streets because the ghetto was really closed in as you know.</span> <span id="s757">But that was not closed in in that time by fence because when I went back to the ghetto in 1945, it was totally closed in with kind of an old fence, and I seen already when the...when the dead people were thrown into the truck.</span> <span id="s758">That was already sometimes in 45.</span> <span id="s759">So he took us on a very... because we were in a downstairs apartment you know.</span> <span id="s760">So he took us out and he said, "You have to run with me.”</span> <span id="s761">Now you can imagine that Oldsa, the ghetto area, and St.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Stephen Park....St. Stephen Park is in a modern...that time it was the modern...still is, .</span> <span id="s763">The town called Laport stadt, Laport area, that part of Budapest.</span> <span id="s764">I know it very well because it's just opposite the Margaret Island.</span> <span id="s765">The Danube River was below St. Stephen.</span> <span id="s766">I knew St. Stephen park anyhow, where it was, because from St. Stephen park, you walk maybe 500 yards, maybe a little bit more.</span> <span id="s767">You were in a main boulevard going to the...to the Margaret Island, to the entrance, so it was a very beautiful area of Budapest that particular time.</span> <span id="s768">It still is.</span> <span id="s769">As a matter of fact, when I went back.</span> <span id="s770">It's a distance from Oldsa from the policeman.</span> <span id="s771">He was so heavy.</span> <span id="s772">I don't even know how he could run.</span> <span id="s773">He had boots on.</span> <span id="s774">We had nothing.</span> <span id="s775">We had...we were already.</span> <span id="s776">We just had a coat and a cover and nothing else.</span> <span id="s777">And he said, "You run with me because if you don't run, you will be never seen because anybody can stop us and if somebody stops us, I will save you.”</span> <span id="s778">Because we didn't have the David Star.</span> <span id="s779">He said, "Take this off in town.”</span> <span id="s780">And we ran in that dark night, in that cold night with this policeman.</span> <span id="s781">I didn't even know how...where he takes me, exactly how he took us, but the took us in the main boulevard, and from the Olds, ---main boulevard, then side street.</span> <span id="s782">Always avoiding the main boulevard, which is a main...main boulevard even now which goes to the Margaret Island.</span> <span id="s783">If you been in Budapest I can show you on the map.</span> <span id="s784">And he took us to the Parposha is the main...main wide street before Santishon Park.</span> <span id="s785">I been visiting there now.</span> <span id="s786">And we went there.</span> <span id="s787">And in the building there were already lot of people.</span> <span id="s788">And I was amazed at why a lot of Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: Which people?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: In the Spanish protected building.</span> <span id="s791">It was already the Spanish Court of Arms and the Spanish flag.</span> <span id="s792">I don't know where the...the court of arms.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s794">I'm going to stop you at this point, Magda because we've run out of tape.</span> <span id="s795">But you can sit back now and take a drink if you like and then while everybody changes their tape....</span></p> <p><span id="s796">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: We went with car, driving around all night.</span> <span id="s799">I couldn't sleep there.</span> <span id="s800">I didn't like it.</span> <span id="s801">So the next day we went to the officer, and said, "You must put us somewhere else.”</span> <span id="s802">And curiously enough, which is, you know, circumstance in life, they put us in in district, not very far from Sanpart, maybe 3 streets, so we just walked there and back which was one of the places we wanted to visit.</span> <span id="s803">And they put us also in the...near to the building where we.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: Okay, Magna, I'm going to have to interrupt you now.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Fix your collar on your left.</span> <span id="s806">One of them was turned down.</span> <span id="s807">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s808">Thanks.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: We're going to go back now to the experience with the safe pass.</span> <span id="s810">We are going to ask you again as...as directly as you can to tell us the procedure that you went through...uh...with Havier to obtain that safe pass and how you then find yourself through the ghetto experience back in the Spanish safe house.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: Can I tell you now?</span> <span id="s812">Sure.</span> <span id="s813">Well...uh...just as I..</span> <span id="s814">.</span> <span id="s815">I mentioned before, my old professor, my professor met me on the street, on one of these 3 hours, indicated that the Spanish Legation is issuing Shutz passes , safety passes for some of the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s816">They come to the Legation, and that means for me that they will put us in a building assigned by the Hungarian government under the safety and the protection of the Spanish Legation.</span> <span id="s817">So that exactly we done.</span> <span id="s818">We went to the Spanish Legation.</span> <span id="s819">We went through with a hundred people.</span> <span id="s820">THey were standing there.</span> <span id="s821">We came into this little so-called, if I remember, fore-room like, not the Ambassador's room, but reception room.</span> <span id="s822">That would be the word.</span> <span id="s823">And as soon as we got in, we got to this young Spaniard who I didn't know that time, but whose name was Havier, because later on I learned, and he explained to us what he needs and he explained to us that through this document we will be able to move away from the David Star House to a protected house, which will be protected with the Spanish Legation, and hopefully, we can survive all this horrible upheaval in Budapest.</span> <span id="s824">So I was very grateful, and I said that I'm not only alone.</span> <span id="s825">I have my mother and my brother...and my father.</span> <span id="s826">I wanted...I told him my father is already taken, but still my father?</span> <span id="s827">He said, "Never mind.”</span> <span id="s828">He explained to me that I have to bring photographs of the family.</span> <span id="s829">"Do I have it.: I said, "Yes, I have it because my has a basket which is full of family pictures in a container and that also survived during the war, interestingly enough, and I can cut out some of the photographs.</span> <span id="s830">And I didn't ask much of him what we have to do.</span> <span id="s831">I just asked, "Do you know where we will stay?"</span> <span id="s832">And he said, "Well, at the moment he didn't know," but he said, "When you come with the photographs and when you have the pass and you have these documentations in you hand, we will direct you and we will tell you what happen.”</span> <span id="s833">Because, forget now the time is also short.</span> <span id="s834">We had an hour or two, I don't remember, to come and go.</span> <span id="s835">So I thanked and I left with my...my professor together, actually from the Legation.</span> <span id="s836">He done his business.</span> <span id="s837">He said goodbye.</span> <span id="s838">I never seen my professor ever after.</span> <span id="s839">I went back on next day on the same hour to the Legation.</span> <span id="s840">The Legation was equally crowded.</span> <span id="s841">I was looking for this man because he was my connect...contact at the Legation, so and I asked, "What's your name?"</span> <span id="s842">He said, "Havier," I didn't know that time that his name was Havier .</span> <span id="s843">I didn't even ask.</span> <span id="s844">I didn't care, but I said that he gave me the documents which was...he didn't give me really himself the documents.</span> <span id="s845">I think that time police gave me the document.</span> <span id="s846">He was only present to give me this document.</span> <span id="s847">He came with me out and said, "Keep this document because it's very important.</span> <span id="s848">I will let you know.</span> <span id="s849">I'll let you know...in that House in David House.</span> <span id="s850">Where you live?"</span> <span id="s851">And I said, "I am living King Street 95 or 93.”</span> <span id="s852">I don't remember exactly.</span> <span id="s853">And he came.</span> <span id="s854">It's true he came.</span> <span id="s855">Not the same night.</span> <span id="s856">Two or three days after, he brought us food and he said, "We learned that the Spanish protected buildings"...he mentioned a number of them..."You will go to the St. Stephens Park building.</span> <span id="s857">And I asked him, "Do I go now or tomorrow when I am free to go out from the building.”</span> <span id="s858">He said not yet, because the building is not hundred percent arranged apparently with the Hungarian government because I suppose the Legation had to discuss with the government who goes and who doesn't.</span> <span id="s859">The buildings were apparently, what I learned later, vacated with everybody who lived in the building and given to the Spanish Legation.</span> <span id="s860">All these buildings.</span> <span id="s861">The people, they lived in the building, whether they were Gentiles, Christians, whatever, they had to leave the building.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">So they had a hard time probably through this too.</span> <span id="s863">Any how, so Havier when he came to the house, to the David Street house, I asked him during the conversation...I told him that my father was already taken.</span> <span id="s864">He said, "He can be on the document too.”</span> <span id="s865">And he is on the document, his picture.</span> <span id="s866">I said, "Where...how will be this...this departure?"</span> <span id="s867">He said, "I'll let you know when you have to go to the St. Stephens Park when it's ready to be...to move there.”</span> <span id="s868">And on that particular night, I asked, "What is your name?"</span> <span id="s869">And he said to me, "My name is Havier .”</span> <span id="s870">That's how I remember those years.</span> <span id="s871">Forget that many years passed by and that name was in my mind since I speak Spanish, and in the meantime I learned Spanish.</span> <span id="s872">I lived in a Latin country and so I was in my mind.</span> <span id="s873">And he mentioned also right way, that is a very important name because a Spanish poet had this name, this same name.</span> <span id="s874">So I accepted that, and he also told me that...are you employed.</span> <span id="s875">I said, "Are you with the Spanish Legation?"</span> <span id="s876">He said, "No, I am...I am with the Blue Division.</span> <span id="s877">"Do you know what the Blue Division is?"</span> <span id="s878">he asked me.</span> <span id="s879">And I says, "Yes, I know the Blue Division is the...the Corps, the elite Corps of Franco.”</span> <span id="s880">And I knew that the Blue Division was fighting in Russia on Hitler's side.</span> <span id="s881">And h.He said, "How come that you hear it?"</span> <span id="s882">We are deserters.</span> <span id="s883">We left.</span> <span id="s884">The offensive came, and we just run away.</span> <span id="s885">There is some of them...some of us at the Legation.</span> <span id="s886">Which was proved to me today by Mr. Perlasca, because I didn't know that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">What was very interesting that in other time when he came again to the house, the David House, he said come tomorrow and said that I should come back to the Legation.</span> <span id="s888">And I did go back to the Legation on other time.</span> <span id="s889">And I don't know why he wanted to...that I should come back.</span> <span id="s890">And I came and he said, "I will show you some of the people that we are hiding here at the Legation.</span> <span id="s891">And I didn't ask yet...Mr. Perlasca, he has to tell me because there was a puzzle in my mind that he took me back in the Legation in a room or in a hiding place, there was a room divided with a little stairway and the stairway you go up and there were men sitting up there.</span> <span id="s892">Two men were sitting up there, and they were Hungarian Jews.</span> <span id="s893">I don't...I don't remember who they were.</span> <span id="s894">And we were talking to each other and I said, "I am from the King Street David Star House and I tried to go back to my mother and brother and take them to...to the Spanish Legation protected house and we just said goodbye and I never went back anymore to the Legation.</span> <span id="s895">So in my mind, it's still a mystery who were these people that Havier let me talk.</span> <span id="s896">Because we spoke German...Hungarian...I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s897">Havier didn't speak Hungarian a word.</span> <span id="s898">My conversation was with Havier only in I my good German and his broken German.</span> <span id="s899">And so I left, and I went back, said goodbye and I left back.</span> <span id="s900">This was the hour from 10 to 12 or whatever the hour was, and I never seen them again, him again, only at the Spanish protected house because after this, I was taken away with my mother to the ghetto and with my little brother, we lined up in marching to the ghetto and that where I was lucky and smart enough to make contact with this Hung...this old policeman, who risked his life.</span> <span id="s901">And not only that he risked his life.</span> <span id="s902">I'll tell you more about him.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: Before you tell me more about him, we would like to get you back to the relationship you had with Havier.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: That was the relationship that was...then emptiness.</span> <span id="s905">There was nothing happened until I got with my mother and brother to the Spanish protected house.</span> <span id="s906">When we got to the Spanish protected house, the policeman left us there.</span> <span id="s907">And there were so many people already in the building that they accommodated us in the basement in the building.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: That was in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: No, the ghetto is after the protected house.</span> <span id="s910">We left with the policeman after...I wasn't long in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s911">I must say that.</span> <span id="s912">Maybe 2 days or 3 days.</span> <span id="s913">Because I told this policeman, "I have this document.</span> <span id="s914">Please rescue us.”</span> <span id="s915">And he says, "I will," as he does...he done it.</span> <span id="s916">When he done...when we went to the Spanish protected house, there were a lot of people already there.</span> <span id="s917">He left us.</span> <span id="s918">It was night time.</span> <span id="s919">We were pushed into there, to stay there and we said, "Here is our document.”</span> <span id="s920">And there were no...no leadership.</span> <span id="s921">I don't remember any leadership in the house.</span> <span id="s922">Everybody went wherever they could stay.</span> <span id="s923">And I couldn't go anywhere with my mother except to the basement.</span> <span id="s924">And the basement was terrible, because the basement has water.</span> <span id="s925">And so we really suffered for a long, long while in the basement.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: How long were you there, Magda?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: Well, this was probably the end of October, beginning of November, and I was...we were liberated in January the 18 by the Russians.</span> <span id="s928">And when the Russian came into that building, we still stayed for quite awhile because there was war...that was a siege of Budapest.</span> <span id="s929">We didn't go out at least another 3, 4 weeks from the building.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: What did you do while you were in that building?</span> <span id="s931">How did you spend your time?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: Well, I'll tell you.</span> <span id="s933">First of all, I have to tell you that we didn't have anything as you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">We didn't have anything.</span> <span id="s935">We told the Hungarian policeman that if you want to help us, if you can, in the King Street on that building and I told him the address...93 or 95.</span> <span id="s936">I think it was 95.</span> <span id="s937">On the second floor in the apartment number so and so, there is a basket and that's all our belongings.</span> <span id="s938">Can you bring that eventually?</span> <span id="s939">And he did.</span> <span id="s940">He did bring it to the protected house.</span> <span id="s941">Not immediately, but after a few days where we had the two or three pillows in there, so we had some warm...warmer clothing and some pots and pans.</span> <span id="s942">But at that time, if I remember correctly, in the building there were no gas, no electricity.</span> <span id="s943">Nothing.</span> <span id="s944">So the people there had to cook.</span> <span id="s945">And my mother had two big bags of flour...I remember that...in the basket.</span> <span id="s946">Like this.</span> <span id="s947">And she didn't...we couldn't eat anything else.</span> <span id="s948">My brother and my...we didn't eat anything else during all the time until well after...even when the Russian came in...only snow water was...this was heavy snow...brought in at night from the street by others too in the building, which was made a little fire into the gas stove with the furniture, pieces whoever found it...little wood.</span> <span id="s949">Some people went even out...I don't know how they got it...some branches because the trees and the branches were all empty.</span> <span id="s950">No leaves.</span> <span id="s951">So they brought that in and we made fire on it.</span> <span id="s952">And my mother, in one of the pots of snow water, made...we called it, very funny now when that it comes to mind, we called it because it was flat like a pancake, but it was just flour and water.</span> <span id="s953">And it was delicious.</span> <span id="s954">That's what we eat.</span> <span id="s955">That was our staple.</span> <span id="s956">Well, we didn't do anything in the building, really.</span> <span id="s957">People stuck together if they could.</span> <span id="s958">They were bombing in the house...outside in Hungary, and afraid who comes to pick us up because there were a million rumors.</span> <span id="s959">Because, you know, you heard all the time, the shootings and the bombings and the time to the Spanish protected house, in the Margaret Island, we knew from rumors that there are still German soldiers and Hungarian autocrats people they tried to...to beat, to fight.</span> <span id="s960">And not only that, during that period...that time that we were in the protected house and later on we were upstairs...they accommodated us upstairs.</span> <span id="s961">And we were on the last floor, and I asked Mr. Perlasca today, "Was it five floors or was it nine floors?"</span> <span id="s962">And he said, "I think it was five floors.”</span> <span id="s963">And I think it was nine floors.”</span> <span id="s964">We were on the top on this protected house.</span> <span id="s965">On...during that period of time, there was an explosion and the Margaret Island bridge exploded totally.</span> <span id="s966">All the bridges, by the way, the Hungarians probably did, but we seen it through the window and the windows were all blown in, so there was no windows in the building.</span> <span id="s967">I only remember that I was standing in the window and I said, "Oh, my God.</span> <span id="s968">The bridge goes.”</span> <span id="s969">And my face and my hair was full of glass.</span> <span id="s970">And all little bloods running which I didn't know.</span> <span id="s971">But they says, "What happened to your face?"</span> <span id="s972">The little glass went into my hair and cut me.</span> <span id="s973">I put this down that there was a professor on the building, a Hungarian surgeon, whose name I don't remember and he cleaned by face with a little clip or something.</span> <span id="s974">Look, my face is still here.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Yes, it is.</span> <span id="s976">Magda, when you were in the safe house, how safe was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: It wasn't safe.</span> <span id="s978">It wasn't safe.</span> <span id="s979">There was nobody who...it was safe because it was protected by the Spanish flag, so maybe some Hungarians or some Germans maybe respected or respected not.</span> <span id="s980">But because we didn't know this, whether they would respect us, we were in constant fear.</span> <span id="s981">Also, there were all the rumors how the people got it...we only heard the rumors.</span> <span id="s982">I wasn't outside.</span> <span id="s983">I went only outside sometimes at night for water because the younger people...there were a lot of elderly people in that building, you know, not only my age and my mother...much older people they were.</span> <span id="s984">I know that in the room where I was, on the end, two people died.</span> <span id="s985">And they were very elderly, Mr. and Mrs. Elephant.</span> <span id="s986">So there were a variety of.</span> <span id="s987">.</span> <span id="s988">of people in the building.</span> <span id="s989">So we...we were protected by them, it's true.</span> <span id="s990">They risked their lives, but we didn't know whether we were protected.</span> <span id="s991">Why?</span> <span id="s992">Because we heard the rumors that the Hungarian...uh...Nazis, they are going to even to the protected homes and try to take out people.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: Did anybody try to take anyone out of your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s995">That's the last time...the building...not the home, in the building.</span> <span id="s996">That was the last time I seen Havier, and that's the last time when...I think and I believe that all so Mr. Perlasca and other Spaniards were at the building.</span> <span id="s997">This was on a..</span> <span id="s998">.</span> <span id="s999">on a morning hours at 5 o'clock.</span> <span id="s1000">It must have been...I think it must have been end of November.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: What happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: It happened the following.</span> <span id="s1003">On early morning, the shouting was in the building...I was actually downstairs at that time with my mother and my brother, downstairs in one of the rooms, and they came...the Hungarian Nazis and they said, "Everybody who is in the building has to come out and line up on the street.”</span> <span id="s1004">Mind you, it was very cold.</span> <span id="s1005">It was snow, ice.</span> <span id="s1006">That particular winter apparently was colder than others.</span> <span id="s1007">And everybody from the building, from top floor, they all have to come.</span> <span id="s1008">Because some people they even slept on the stairways.</span> <span id="s1009">They were...I don't know where they were.</span> <span id="s1010">Everybody has to line up.</span> <span id="s1011">When we lined up, we just didn't know exactly what will happen, only what we heard.</span> <span id="s1012">That these people will be marching us directly into the Danube and will kill us.</span> <span id="s1013">That much I knew.</span> <span id="s1014">I didn't tell this to my mother and little brother but I said, "This is the end of us.</span> <span id="s1015">If these people will take us out and the Spanish are not around to save us, we are dead.”</span> <span id="s1016">And it happened to other people I know after the war.</span> <span id="s1017">To us it didn't happen because...I don't know how.</span> <span id="s1018">That's what I have to find out from Mr. Perlasca.</span> <span id="s1019">How is it possible that on that morning, suddenly the Spanish Legation representative, one of them was Havier with a document in his hand and maybe Mr. Perlasca, because there were others...they were debating and shouting and discussing with the Hungarian Nazis downstairs that this is...they cannot...this is Spanish diplomatic protection, and they were really fighting for us...for us.</span> <span id="s1020">I only stood there...downstairs, because we were downstairs, and other people all lined up...on the stairway lined up, because there were at least 200 in my opinion in that building.</span> <span id="s1021">And they were shouting and discussing and in the meantime, we heard shootings.</span> <span id="s1022">It was already the end of the war for Budapest.</span> <span id="s1023">The Russians were all around.</span> <span id="s1024">And one minute to the other, it took us minute, my brother...my brother, George, had a little knapsack because that was in this...in this basket...had on his shoulder...had a little cap.</span> <span id="s1025">I see him as today...is behind me because I was in the front, my brother and my...and all the others.</span> <span id="s1026">There were others...lot of people in the same situation as we were.</span> <span id="s1027">We freight...what...how can we get away from this?</span> <span id="s1028">And the Spanish people from the Legation whether it was Havier or Mr. Perlasca, Giorgia Perlasca, whoever it was, they won over these Hungarian Nazis, and they tell, "You cannot touch these people because this is the Spanish government protection.</span> <span id="s1029">The Spanish government was befriended with the Hungarian government.</span> <span id="s1030">They got none because the Spanish Franco was a fascist, and the Spanish Legation was there until the Russians came in.</span> <span id="s1031">And that morning because it was still dark, Havier came to me and to my mother and to my brother and to others...I'm sure he said goodbye.</span> <span id="s1032">I only observe what he done to us, and he said, "We are seeing you last time.</span> <span id="s1033">The Legation must leave Budapest because we are surrounded with the Russians.</span> <span id="s1034">The Russian come in and close in the city any minute.”</span> <span id="s1035">And I said, "Where do you go, Havier?"</span> <span id="s1036">He said, "We go to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1037">Do you want to come along?"</span> <span id="s1038">And I said, "How do you go?"</span> <span id="s1039">I said, "By train and by car, we all...we will leave the Legation, whatever the Ambassador...everybody has to leave.</span> <span id="s1040">We close the Legation, what he said.</span> <span id="s1041">And he said, "you want to come along?"</span> <span id="s1042">And I said, "I will never go without my mother and brother, which is true, and we embraced and everybody embraced.</span> <span id="s1043">It was a terrible moment.</span> <span id="s1044">It's terrible even me for now.</span> <span id="s1045">And he left and disappeared in the blue yonder.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: Okay, at the moment that...that Havier and others argued against the Germans that convinced them to allow you to stay...</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: They convinced that we should stay.</span> <span id="s1048">They convinced them that this building is under the Swiss...Spanish Legation, Spanish government protection, and they cannot touch us because they are Spanish.</span> <span id="s1049">They are diplomat, and they cannot go.</span> <span id="s1050">And when I read the article is absolutely that's how it...how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: Was that the last problem that you encountered?</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: That was what is interesting what you asking me because, curiously enough, after that period of time that the Hungarians cleared the way, these Nazis and the Spanish, everybody cleared it away, the misery was there in the house because we didn't know that nobody else will bother us, but I don't recall in my mind, thinking about this million times, that anybody from the Hungarian Nazis, or the Germans or anybody or no Spaniards, nobody came to that building.</span> <span id="s1053">We were on our own.</span> <span id="s1054">I only know that there was a heavy shooting, bombing, all this December what I heard...if this was the beginning of December because I don't recall.</span> <span id="s1055">I don't recall that until the that anybody was bugging the building.</span> <span id="s1056">I don't remember that any Hungarian came.</span> <span id="s1057">At least, we were upstairs really with my mother and brother and, you know, we were hundred...I don't know how many people were in that apartment, probably 40.</span> <span id="s1058">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: What did people eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: We didn't eat.</span> <span id="s1061">Nobody ate.</span> <span id="s1062">Q: How did you survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s1064">I was...I was skeleton.</span> <span id="s1065">Q: During the period of these two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: Well, this was from the beginning.</span> <span id="s1067">I..</span> <span id="s1068">.</span> <span id="s1069">I don't think that it is right, but I wrote December, end of November.</span> <span id="s1070">This was sometimes in the first week or first 10 days of December when this happened and I was confirmed this with Mr. George Perlasca because I think I am one of really the people who are here this gathering who had at least their mind because of my age.</span> <span id="s1071">I really believe that.</span> <span id="s1072">Because I don't know whether the other remembers in other buildings how it was.</span> <span id="s1073">I don't know what happened.</span> <span id="s1074">But apparently it happened to others.</span> <span id="s1075">I only know from other friends and later other people conversing that in other building...not...not only Spanish, Swedish...the same thing happened, that the Hungarians were there and took them and some of them, took them and shoved them into the Danube.</span> <span id="s1076">I know that historically.</span> <span id="s1077">I know that it happened.</span> <span id="s1078">So while we were saved by the Spanish...that particular morning was saved our lives.</span> <span id="s1079">This is really the crucial day because it was crucial that they gave us the Shutz pass.</span> <span id="s1080">It was crucial to me that I was lucky to meet my old professor who says, "Go to the...with me," because otherwise I wouldn't...my faintest mind wouldn't set on the Spanish Legation because I heard Swedish and Swiss...uh...Swiss...because you hear always a little more.</span> <span id="s1081">We knew about...already in that time, we knew exactly Auschwitz, Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1082">We know exactly what's happening outside, but we didn't...I didn't know Spanish Legation, so this was really...they were our saviors.</span> <span id="s1083">No question about it.</span> <span id="s1084">My life and my mothers and my brothers, definitely!</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: That's a wonderful statement.</span> <span id="s1086">As we draw the interview to a conclusion, if we can just go back now to the realization that you have, that the war was ending and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: That was a..</span> <span id="s1088">.</span> <span id="s1089">that was a..</span> <span id="s1090">.</span> <span id="s1091">that was also very emotional moment, I'll tell you.</span> <span id="s1092">Because when nothing happened, when it was fairly quiet to...to say fairly quiet that nobody came to take us out or shoot us, but we heard the shooting and people in the building, you know, men.</span> <span id="s1093">They were men.</span> <span id="s1094">They were all talking.</span> <span id="s1095">Everybody was rumoring, "Where are the Russians.</span> <span id="s1096">The Russians are near.”</span> <span id="s1097">Because we heard...I knew from Havier.</span> <span id="s1098">Havier told me.</span> <span id="s1099">Remember he said that the Russians are all around the city, you know, and it was such a shooting, you know, everywhere that we knew that they come any day.</span> <span id="s1100">Every day we said now, today, tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1101">But December the 25th was the worst night of my life of the bombing because we were upstairs and Budapest was sounding like a drum.</span> <span id="s1102">Boom, boom, boom.</span> <span id="s1103">And I was so upset and we were so hungry and we were so miserable that I told myself and God should forgive me, I said, "Just a bomb should drop on us.</span> <span id="s1104">It should be a end.”</span> <span id="s1105">It didn't.</span> <span id="s1106">So it came other days and other terrible days and hunger and hunger and people were helping each other what they can.</span> <span id="s1107">Some people they just slept.</span> <span id="s1108">They didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s1109">And on the 18th of January, I know that we went out from the house where we lived and the professor who cleaned my face with his hands because we didn't have anything, suddenly I heard him saying and I seen him as now...he says, " .”</span> <span id="s1110">And the Russian soldiers appeared in the building.</span> <span id="s1111">And not one, not two.</span> <span id="s1112">Many!</span> <span id="s1113">They came all around the building and ripped off the David Star from us immediately so we thought it will be fantastic.</span> <span id="s1114">This our...our...this we are alive.</span> <span id="s1115">Of course, after this horrible thing, there were miserable situations because firstly, we didn't have food.</span> <span id="s1116">We didn't have water.</span> <span id="s1117">We didn't know where to go because nobody had homes.</span> <span id="s1118">Nobody had nothing.</span> <span id="s1119">So everybody really stayed for quite awhile in the building.</span> <span id="s1120">I think that I left with my...I left actually with my little brother.</span> <span id="s1121">My mother stayed.</span> <span id="s1122">Because I thought I'd go back to the street, not to the street, to the street, where we had our belongings.</span> <span id="s1123">And that was already I think in sometimes in the beginning of February.</span> <span id="s1124">Snow!</span> <span id="s1125">Ice!</span> <span id="s1126">Misery!</span> <span id="s1127">Dead horses on the streets, frozen!</span> <span id="s1128">Dead people frozen on the...on the street.</span> <span id="s1129">And I took my brother's hand and I was dressed like a mummy because I had a man's pair of shoe.</span> <span id="s1130">I don't know how.</span> <span id="s1131">I mean I..</span> <span id="s1132">.</span> <span id="s1133">I really looked as anybody can look in a war, and I had a scarf on my face, on my head.</span> <span id="s1134">I had no warm clothing and we said, we go back to and see if we have anything there.</span> <span id="s1135">We didn't get to needless to say, be cause from park, we had to go to this district, state district.</span> <span id="s1136">And we went to the modern district and you have to go through the...to the train station bridge.</span> <span id="s1137">There is...was a big train...have two train stations big in Budapest, east and west.</span> <span id="s1138">This was the west station, Rios, and through this leads a bridge.</span> <span id="s1139">And we had to go through this bridge into the area to reach and walk over to our place.</span> <span id="s1140">And when we got to the bridge before us, there was a woman walking, also in the same miserable condition as we were and they just called...I don't know whether she was Hungarian or Hungarian Jewish.</span> <span id="s1141">I don't know, but as she went in the middle of the bridge, she was shot.</span> <span id="s1142">went into her and she collapsed on the bridge like an accordion, bleeding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">And I didn't know what to do, so I ran back with my brother.</span> <span id="s1144">I..</span> <span id="s1145">.</span> <span id="s1146">I was afraid that we will be shot, you know.</span> <span id="s1147">Because, you know, there was shooting everywhere in Budapest in that time.</span> <span id="s1148">And this woman was dead, just collapsed...I have it like an accordion right there in the middle of this...it's not the bridge.</span> <span id="s1149">It's overpass.</span> <span id="s1150">Overpass.</span> <span id="s1151">So I..</span> <span id="s1152">.</span> <span id="s1153">then I went back to my mother and very much later, a few days or 3 later, we left the house.</span> <span id="s1154">We went back to the other street where we had friends and we asked if we can be accommodated and we were accommodated there and we stayed there.</span> <span id="s1155">Terrible condition.</span> <span id="s1156">No water.</span> <span id="s1157">No nothing.</span> <span id="s1158">The Russian were...the Russians were raping, killing, stealing, namely everything else was there.</span> <span id="s1159">It was a horrible period at that time.</span> <span id="s1160">And we were hoping that my father and brother comes back.</span> <span id="s1161">Nothing happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: What...what did you learn about your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: My father...I..</span> <span id="s1164">.</span> <span id="s1165">that's...that's a very important question because when we were still in the David Star House and my father was taken with me, we got two post cards in the mail.</span> <span id="s1166">One came in the name, , I have here the post card.</span> <span id="s1167">I will leave to this Museum if they need it.</span> <span id="s1168">The one post card is written by my father...it's in Hungarian, needless to say, and directed to Mrs. Yano Mezei, Mrs. John Mezei.</span> <span id="s1169">First of all, my brother was never married.</span> <span id="s1170">Secondly, he was never any more with us.</span> <span id="s1171">So I don't know why he had this idea to send it Mrs. Yano Mezei, to my brother.</span> <span id="s1172">Anyhow, it was written by my father, directed to my mother and came to the .</span> <span id="s1173">It had the correct address, everything, and says that...in the letter, translated that after a long walk, we reached Suring, which is a town in Hungary, but not in Budapest, further away toward...toward Vienna.</span> <span id="s1174">We reached Suring.</span> <span id="s1175">I am still well, and something like that.</span> <span id="s1176">It says...I'm not needed that I should translate that...that we should take care of my mother and George, take care of my mother and all these things.</span> <span id="s1177">That was one post card.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">And immediately after, maybe a week after, we got a other post card, brought over, handed to my mother from the family where my father was hiding originally.</span> <span id="s1179">Mrs. followed the column where the Hung...where the Jew because this is a very famous march.</span> <span id="s1180">Maybe it was the Wallenberg march, possible, which was very famous.</span> <span id="s1181">My father she followed.</span> <span id="s1182">She was so good friend to us, she followed.</span> <span id="s1183">Because she brought a post card to my mother which was directed to her, Mrs. , and was written by somebody else who I don't know...we don't know who it was.</span> <span id="s1184">And the card says in Hungarian, "Please take this card to Mrs. Mezei," to my mother, and tell her that Hendrik, my father is in Nagycnk in this sugar refinery.</span> <span id="s1185">Nagycnk, N-A-G-Y-C-N-K, Nagycnk which is near to the Austrian border.</span> <span id="s1186">Hendrik is in Nagycnk in the sugar refinery but he's unable to write.</span> <span id="s1187">This is...this is all the post card.</span> <span id="s1188">So that was the last which we had or still when we were in the David Star house and we kept this.</span> <span id="s1189">When after the liberation, after we settled into this street house where we could stay because we couldn't go back to our own apartment because every furniture, every piece was stolen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s1191">We couldn't...strange people lived there.</span> <span id="s1192">We couldn't get there.</span> <span id="s1193">When we went back to the street, the second apartment, there were totally strange people...Christian people, nice people...they lived in the building.</span> <span id="s1194">Nothing was ours.</span> <span id="s1195">So we were without absolutely any...anything at all.</span> <span id="s1196">The only thing we survived is.</span> <span id="s1197">.</span> <span id="s1198">was the basket which was still in the park.</span> <span id="s1199">And some pots and the pillows and old ragged clothing what was there.</span> <span id="s1200">And when we went back to street, we had friends.</span> <span id="s1201">They gave us beds.</span> <span id="s1202">Two beds and a wardrobe, you know, kind of a wardrobe and some help to us this , because people can occupy any apartment where they wanted to do.</span> <span id="s1203">There was no registration or or I rented or nothing.</span> <span id="s1204">We just went into this apartment and stayed in the apartment.</span> <span id="s1205">There were no window in the apartment.</span> <span id="s1206">In the whole building, there was no window.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: What happened to your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: My father...so we knew on the card after the liberation, that my father was in Nagycnk sugar factory, so...a sugar refinery, so we didn't know whether he's alive, but we were waiting that he comes back.</span> <span id="s1209">Time passed.</span> <span id="s1210">February, March, April, whatever, and May.</span> <span id="s1211">In summer time in 1945, there were...they created in the newspaper...the newspapers at that time, they printed 2, 3 pages of paper in Hungary.</span> <span id="s1212">One was called , a very communistic paper.</span> <span id="s1213">But everybody tried to read what's happening if they could get hold of a paper.</span> <span id="s1214">And we couldn't get hold of much but whatever we got back from people...they hidden on my mother's tablecloth and things they came back to us, we could exchange that for bread, for food, for paper for whatever.</span> <span id="s1215">A terrible inflation at that time because today you couldn't buy it, tomorrow... Anyhow, in that newspaper, there was a decree that people, Jewish men, they were taken on that and that day and on end of October on the march to the Nagycnk sugar refinery will meet at the Jewish community center again in the street area.</span> <span id="s1216">I don't remember where the center was, but it was somewhere there to get information about those people they survived or those people they...they did not.</span> <span id="s1217">I went there like a locomotor.</span> <span id="s1218">I made a sign with my father's name, Mezei, Hendrik.</span> <span id="s1219">It was in Hungarian.</span> <span id="s1220">is opposite .</span> <span id="s1221">And I stood there.</span> <span id="s1222">And there were...I would say people, relatives there, maybe 100, 150, so there's a plenty of people there and a few men.</span> <span id="s1223">And I was holding this up all the time, and they were explaining to us what happened.</span> <span id="s1224">That the Nagycnk sugar refinery...one they were totally evacuated.</span> <span id="s1225">They marched everybody and apparently, there were 30,000 people in that refinery jammed together.</span> <span id="s1226">I didn't know this.</span> <span id="s1227">And all the 30,000...whoever stayed alive...because many people died on this march from Budapest to Nagycnk, because Nagycnk is on the Austria-Hungarian border.</span> <span id="s1228">If you look at the map, it's a long way and a long walk.</span> <span id="s1229">But apparently, my father survived up to that point because he was a soldier in the war.</span> <span id="s1230">He...he played soccer all his life so he was very strong man.</span> <span id="s1231">They said that all these people were lined up again and they were supposed to march from sugar refinery through the Austrian border and I always think that much too tall because that's another gathering camp.</span> <span id="s1232">I don't know whether this is right or wrong, because I went in Jerusalem to the , and I researched this and I got information through a book where all Nagycnk is in the book.</span> <span id="s1233">And it just says that the Nagycnk gathering place where these people were supposed to march away, many of them were shot down on the way to Austria and many of them just died from hunger.</span> <span id="s1234">So I never knew really what happened to my father.</span> <span id="s1235">I spoke to these people.</span> <span id="s1236">I don't know who they are and I don't remember and I asked, "Do you remember Mezei?"</span> <span id="s1237">Nobody knew.</span> <span id="s1238">But there were so many, that those people they survived they knew their own bodies who survived with them because there were very few that survived.</span> <span id="s1239">On the whole march, apparently just maybe 100 or not even that.</span> <span id="s1240">So they were eliminated.</span> <span id="s1241">They were not supposed to go to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1242">I know that because it's in opposite direction.</span> <span id="s1243">But I know that my father's card I have which have...I will give it to you or to somebody else tomorrow, and I have my brother's...little brother's card.</span> <span id="s1244">My little brother has a totally different story.</span> <span id="s1245">A totally different story, not even matching to the Spanish protected house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: Magda, you have done...you have done a superb job of telling us your story.</span> <span id="s1247">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s1248">Half of my story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: Well, we certainly do appreciate that you shared this with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: I appreciate to you, to the Holocaust Memorial, that they brought me here that I can have a chat and enjoy George Perlasca, George Perlasca, and that I could speak and really maybe unknock, unknock the knock, this which is still in mind because certain things I don't...I just don't know.</span> <span id="s1251">I only know what I experienced.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: Well, you've told us very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: I'd also like to tell you this before anything that my brother was taken to Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s1254">He was in a concentration camp and he was liberated by the American forces on 5th of May in Gonskerchin, which is an forest of Mauthausen with 6,000 people were in that forest, which just a few hundred only stayed alive.</span> <span id="s1255">He was alive.</span> <span id="s1256">The American liberated...on the 4th, they took him to American Lazarette in Wales.</span> <span id="s1257">From Wales he was taken to Lindstadt near Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s1258">He stayed alive until September the 2nd, 45, and he died.</span> <span id="s1259">And unfortunately, we never seen him alive.</span> <span id="s1260">The American forces buried him in a military cemetery in , Austria, and when we escaped from Hungary in 1946, our goal was to go to the American zone which we did.</span> <span id="s1261">We landed there and we looked for my brother's grave and my brother's we found and then we exhumed him and reburied him in Linz in the Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s1262">And he's still there and I brought a photograph.</span> <span id="s1263">With other Jewish Hungarian boys they died during that period.</span> <span id="s1264">In short, the rest of the family were all gassed.</span> <span id="s1265">Everybody else.</span> <span id="s1266">Uncles, cousins, name it.</span> <span id="s1267">I have some cousins.</span> <span id="s1268">One in Australia and one is in Rio, but the rest they all exterminated.</span> <span id="s1269">And that's the sad story.</span> <span id="s1270">And I wish that everybody should remember for generations and generations and generations what people could do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">And not only to the Jewish people, but the Gentiles too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">Q: With your help, it will be remembered.</span> <span id="s1273">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: We thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">End of Tape #2 Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
