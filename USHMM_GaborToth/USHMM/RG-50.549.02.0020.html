id="s31">Okay.</span> <span id="s32">My name is Fritzie Fritzshall.</span> <span id="s33">You’re in my home at ***.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s35">And once again, thanks for taking time out to do this interview today.</span> <span id="s36">You have already done a video interview with the museum in Washington about your early experiences and your experiences during the war, and really the purpose of this interview, is sort of to pick up that story from where you left off and take it up to the present.</span> <span id="s37">So I would like to ask you, though, if we could go back maybe a step and if you could describe what your circumstances were right around the time leading up to when you were liberated.</span> <span id="s38">What it -- where you were, what happened and then how liberation took place.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Liberation from the camps or once we’ve gotten out of the camps?</span> <span id="s40">I mean, which part do you want to hear about?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Well, I was thinking sort of when the Russians picked you up.</span> <span id="s42">But if you want, you -- wherever you would -- wherever you would like to start from, actually, would be fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Okay, we can start --</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: It -- do you want to talk about how you got away from the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Well, actually, we were on the Death March and my particular group was liberated by the Russian army.</span> <span id="s46">After we were liberated, we were put into a holding camp, which was a DP camp.</span> <span id="s47">And, of course they had to delouse us.</span> <span id="s48">They had to give us medical attention and they feed us and try and sort of organize.</span> <span id="s49">I mean, we were a -- a -- a very displaced group, a very sick group at that point.</span> <span id="s50">And once they took our names and asked us if we had a home to go to, or whatever -- some of us chose to go back to our original homes and some of us stayed behind and stayed in the DP camps for a long time.</span> <span id="s51">I was in a DP camp for quite awhile and then I chose to go back home to my hometown, hoping that possibly my brothers or someone that had survived, had come back home and that we could reunite.</span> <span id="s52">But I truly was mistaken, because no one came back.</span> <span id="s53">One aunt, who survived Auschwitz concentration camp, went to Budapest rather than coming to our hometown in Czechoslovakia, thinking that I hadn’t survived, although sh -- she did see me in Auschwitz camp, so she knew I was there.</span> <span id="s54">But she thought that I, too had gone to the gas chambers, as millions of others had.</span> <span id="s55">And when she heard that I had survived, she too came back home.</span> <span id="s56">So actually it was just the two of us.</span> <span id="s57">We came back home and found our home -- my mother’s home that we lived in, destroyed.</span> <span id="s58">Our home was used for a lookout post.</span> <span id="s59">It was like on a little hill and the soldiers had used that and it was destroyed.</span> <span id="s60">My grandmother’s home -- which was my aunt’s home who came back, stood.</span> <span id="s61">The home was totally stripped of everything inside.</span> <span id="s62">There were nothing but walls and windows left.</span> <span id="s63">And w-we moved into this home.</span> <span id="s64">Actually, I was the very first one to come home in our community and I was the first one to move into my grandmother’s home.</span> <span id="s65">And I would go and meet a train that passed through our little town once a day, hoping that someone survived and people would come back.</span> <span id="s66">And little by little, some young people did trickle back.</span> <span id="s67">And -- including my aunt and we all lived in my grandmother’s home.</span> <span id="s68">When we came back we had no money, we had no food and we just had the clothes on our backs.</span> <span id="s69">Our neighbors had stripped our homes, our furniture was used by neighbors.</span> <span id="s70">We recognized some of our clothes that was worn by some of our neighbors.</span> <span id="s71">But no one came, no one offered and no one asked.</span> <span id="s72">What we had to do was go and dig for potatoes in the field.</span> <span id="s73">Gather some potatoes and whatever we could from the harvest.</span> <span id="s74">And this is what we lived on for quite awhile.</span> <span id="s75">And I knew my father was in the United States, but I did not know where.</span> <span id="s76">And I could have never found him, except that he found me.</span> <span id="s77">My dad had -- after the war, my dad had contacted some of the neighbors that he remembered and he wrote to the Post Office in our town, looking for his family, looking for survivors.</span> <span id="s78">And I had gotten a letter through the Post Office, from my dad and gotten his address and was able to get in touch with him.</span> <span id="s79">And he was able to send me American dollars through the letters that came.</span> <span id="s80">A five dollar bill, a 10 dollar bill -- which we were selling on the Black Market.</span> <span id="s81">At that time an American money, we were getting a lot for it, because the money in Europe was really devalued at that particular time, so we were able to buy food after awhile.</span> <span id="s82">We were also getting clothes through -- I believe it’s the United Restitutio -- I don -- I don’t know, it was called Unrah.</span> <span id="s83">I don’t know what it stands for, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: And we were getting clothes from them and I remember getting packages and opening the packages and getting clothes that was actually used already and getting shoes that didn’t fit and looking for the candy that was inside and we were getting gum.</span> <span id="s86">And we would open the package of gum and didn’t know that we were supposed to chew this gum and chew it, you know, we just ate it like candy, thinking, “Gee, this is kind of funny candy,” you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: You’d never seen gum before?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: I had never seen gum before.</span> <span id="s89">And we stayed in my grandmother’s home until some of the organiza -- some of the young people were able to get it -- in touch with some of the organizations and some of them were getting help in other ways.</span> <span id="s90">And I was able to get in touch with my dad.</span> <span id="s91">And then the borders closed.</span> <span id="s92">And I had gotten caught on the side of Communism.</span> <span id="s93">Both my aunt and I had gotten caught on the side of Communism and we were not able to leave.</span> <span id="s94">And I was not able to come to this country at that point, or get in touch with my dad any longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Can I s-stop you here one second?</span> <span id="s96">You said the borders closed, do you remember what year that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: No, I don’t.</span> <span id="s98">Actually, I don’t remember the year -- the exact year.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Why don’t we leave your story where it is at the moment, the borders have closed.</span> <span id="s100">I -- if you wouldn’t mind, I’d like to go back a couple steps and ask you about a -- a couple things you’ve -- you’ve mentioned already.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: And bring out a little more detail.</span> <span id="s103">First of all, could you just tell us th-this aunt that your -- you’ve mentioned, could you tell us her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s105">She was my dad’s sister and she’s the only one that survived on my dad’s side, actually, and her name was Freida Weiss.</span> <span id="s106">And eventually, she was also able to make her way to this country.</span> <span id="s107">My aunt had my dad, who was a brother and she had two other brothers living in this country and through them she was able to make her way to this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: And in your video interview, you talk about her and she was in the camp with you and you tell that story.</span> <span id="s109">I’d like to go back to -- oh, sorry --</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: No, the -- my aunt that I speak of in the video was my mother’s sister.</span> <span id="s111">The aunt that I’m speaking of now was my father’s sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: The aunt that I spoke of in the video had not survived the camps.</span> <span id="s114">We were separated in the camp and she was taken to another camp and I had found out years later, through someone that knew her and was in a camp with her, that she lived to see liberation.</span> <span id="s115">The day she -- the day her camp was liberated, she was still alive and died that day, the day the camp was liberated.</span> <span id="s116">But, I think of her often, because she was my inspiration all through the camp.</span> <span id="s117">She was the one that kept telling me every single day, “We will make it and tomorrow will be better.”</span> <span id="s118">I made it, she did not.</span> <span id="s119">But I couldn’t have done it without her.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Her name was Bella Davidovitch.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: And which camp did she --</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: She -- we were separated.</span> <span id="s124">We were in Auschwitz together and then we were separated.</span> <span id="s125">I was taken to -- actually, what happened was that our -- our barracks was emptied and we were put into a holding barrack and our barrack was to go into the gas chambers and we knew it.</span> <span id="s126">My -- they had a separation, my aunt was chosen to go onto a truck to be taken somewhere’s else and the last she saw of me was walking towards the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s127">And when she left me, she did not think that I had survived, she thought that we had all gone to the gas chambers, her entire family and she really did not fight for her life at that point.</span> <span id="s128">So, possibly, if she had known some of us had survived, she maybe too, could have survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: And you -- what you tell in your video, it’s a remarkable story, you actually were in the doorway, I believe, of the gas chamber?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: They -- people that were in Auschwitz, after they were in the camp for, I believe, probably an hour, they knew about the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s131">You know, one separation had taken place and once we were taken into the barracks and once we started to ask about our families, what had happened to our families, the people that had been in the barracks prior to us coming there, the prisoners, would point to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s132">This is how we found out what had happened to millions of others, to the children that we were separated from, to our parents, to the rest of our family, by just -- they would just raise their hand and they would tell us to look at the smoke.</span> <span id="s133">And of course, this is how we found out about the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s134">We lived with it day in and day out we lived with the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s135">We watched the trains coming in, we watched the separations, we watched people marching to the gas chambers, but there was no way we could help them or do anything.</span> <span id="s136">So, we learned -- we learned every single day, twice a day, there was a thing called a pell, where we all had to line up to be counted.</span> <span id="s137">When they called a pell in the morning and at night, nobody wanted to be in the beginning of the line, or at the end of the line, cause there was always punishment.</span> <span id="s138">People were always pulled from the beginning of the line or the end of the line.</span> <span id="s139">Sometimes from the center, but basically, it was easier to pull from the beginning or the end.</span> <span id="s140">So everybody fought to be in the center of the lines and there were only so many middles, somebody had to be in the beginning.</span> <span id="s141">Because my aunt was on this particular truck, leaving, I had -- was hoping I could go with her and so I was at the very end of the line and she watched all of us marching into the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s142">And in the very last moment, six of us were pulled out and put onto another truck to do s -- go to a factory to do slave labor.</span> <span id="s143">But her truck had pulled away already and she did not see me not walking into the gas chamber, so she assumed that I too had gone into the gas chambers with the rest.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s145">And do you know if she ever knew whether you had survived?</span> <span id="s146">Did word ever reach her somehow?</span> <span id="s147">Do you have any way of knowing?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: I have no way of knowing, but I believe she did not know, because the people that were with her, that told us that they knew her and she had died, remember her speaking about everyone being killed one way or another or going to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s149">So I -- I am assuming she did not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: And do you know the day she died, which was the day when her camp was liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: I don’t know the dates.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Yeah, no, no, not the date, but it was the day the camp was liberated that she died.</span> <span id="s153">Was that because of just, you know, illness or that she was in a run down condition, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: She was ill.</span> <span id="s155">She had gotten an infection in an -- in a leg -- is -- from what we had heard, and blood poisoning had set in her leg and at that point she really didn’t care.</span> <span id="s156">She -- you know, when -- when we were in the camps, there -- there came a point, during a low moment maybe or when hope was lost, where people didn’t care whether they lived or died, especially if they knew no one else survived, they just didn’t care.</span> <span id="s157">And at that point, I believe that she didn’t care.</span> <span id="s158">I don't know how else to express this, except that I -- I believe that she felt she was the last one of the family and -- and she too gave up.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Sorry to bring this up, but something just came on, is that the air conditioning, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Maybe.</span> <span id="s161">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s162">Could be the refrigerator.</span> <span id="s163">I don’t know how to shut it.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s165">You never turn that off, huh?</span> <span id="s166">Okay.</span> <span id="s167">Occasional noises you might hear in the background, they’re household appliances that can’t be shut off.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Well, it must be the air conditioner.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s171">But it’s hot in here and we need the air conditioner, guys.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s173">All right, we’ll just go -- we’ll go along with that.</span> <span id="s174">So -- do you -- you were -- do you remember -- did you even have time much, to have much of a reaction when they suddenly pulled you away from the gas chamber and sent you in another direction?</span> <span id="s175">Can you remember what you felt or was it just so hectic that --</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Do you know, things were happening in the camp where one didn’t have the normal feelings.</span> <span id="s177">We were, for the lack of a better word, dehumanized, maybe?</span> <span id="s178">We learned to accept life as it was on that particular moment and when you are with people in a barrack for a le -- any length of time and you see them marching into a gas chamber, you don’t think, “Well gee, I am the lucky one, I walked away.”</span> <span id="s179">Maybe I’m not the lucky one, maybe they are the lucky ones, because I don’t know where they’re going to be taking me and it might be worse than where I am now.</span> <span id="s180">So, the reaction was a -- was not, “Gee, I’m really glad because I’m still alive.”</span> <span id="s181">It just -- you accept it as it comes, that particular moment.</span> <span id="s182">The fear is always there, that you don’t know where you’re being taken, that you’re going to get less food than you had that particular moment.</span> <span id="s183">That you might be -- feel hunger more than you do that particular moment, because you’re already hungry, you’re already abused, you’re already skinny, you’re already sick.</span> <span id="s184">And the moment comes when you just say, “Okay, this is another thing that’s happening to me today.”</span> <span id="s185">And so you just flow with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Did you know w -- that -- where -- while you were still in the camp, did you know where your aunt was or where she’d been taken, or did you not find out what happened to her until the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: I did not know where she was being taken to.</span> <span id="s188">As far as I was concerned, she could have been taken to another camp and put to death in a -- in a gas chamber in another camp.</span> <span id="s189">I didn’t know what she did or -- or even if she was alive, until after the war.</span> <span id="s190">Actually, we found out -- you know, it’s -- it’s a big world, but it’s a small world.</span> <span id="s191">You know, you talk to people and one will say, “Well, I was in this camp,” or “I was in that camp.”</span> <span id="s192">And when you give a family name or when you start asking, people remember and people know and you get a little information.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: And this is how I found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: In your video, you describe it, maybe just very briefly here you could say, you -- you did get out of the camp and then you got into the forest, basically, towards the end of the war.</span> <span id="s196">Where -- where’d you -- can you tell us the name of the forest, where it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: No.</span> <span id="s198">We were -- what -- what they did is, I don’t know if you saw any other videos, but -- but -- or if you’ve read anything about the Holocaust, but towards the end of the war, when Hitler started to lose the war, he started -- I use the word he because of Hitler, but basically it’s -- he didn’t do it alone, obviously, he had his machinery that worked for him, all the people that ran the camps and gathered the Jews and drove the Jews to the death camps and drove the trains and so forth.</span> <span id="s199">I -- I will refer to them as his mach-machinery, because this is what it was.</span> <span id="s200">They -- the Germans started to empty the factories where slave labor -- labor was being done.</span> <span id="s201">They started to bring the people in from all over, wherever they did slave labor and they brought them together with the people in concentration camps and they created a group at that point, a huge, huge group.</span> <span id="s202">Men and women together at that point.</span> <span id="s203">And it is known today as a Death March.</span> <span id="s204">It was -- they brought us all together, we were in rags.</span> <span id="s205">I recall that I had -- my -- my shoes didn’t fit, my clogs.</span> <span id="s206">I could hardly walk in them because I had outgrown them, obviously.</span> <span id="s207">And it was very cold and I -- I recall taking rags and wrapping rags around my feet as I was walking.</span> <span id="s208">And they really walked us in circles, at least it seemed to us as if we were walking in circles.</span> <span id="s209">They walked us through the towns, they walked us through fields.</span> <span id="s210">They -- we slept in -- around haystacks.</span> <span id="s211">I mean they -- then -- and whatever.</span> <span id="s212">Most of us were very sick, some people had gotten dysentery and they had to stop, of course and they were being shot on the spot.</span> <span id="s213">They would walk us into -- through forest areas and I recall at one point sleeping on the fields and just watching the planes -- the planes, I mean, American planes coming down low, passing us and we were hoping that they would bomb us.</span> <span id="s214">We were sick, we were tired, we were hungry, we were thirsty and we didn’t care.</span> <span id="s215">At one point they started to walk us through a forest.</span> <span id="s216">We were on the road actually, but -- but the road was through the forests.</span> <span id="s217">And a friend and I realized that some of the people were trying to escape at that point.</span> <span id="s218">And it was also towards the very end of the war and the Germans were also tired, taking us through the fields, you know, and all of this.</span> <span id="s219">And when -- we were watching people escape and they were shooting at these people and -- and they were -- they were being horrible to us, even at that point.</span> <span id="s220">I recall, as we were walking through towns -- they would walk us through towns -- the people in town knew and saw and heard, we were like -- like a herd of cattles taking over this town and walking through the town.</span> <span id="s221">I recall shades being pulled down, windows being closed, doors being locked so that they wouldn’t -- they pretended they didn’t see and they didn’t hear.</span> <span id="s222">But yes, occasionally, a window would open and a piece of bread would come out, a potato would come out.</span> <span id="s223">Something would fly out a window.</span> <span id="s224">We all pounced on this because we were terribly hungry, they weren’t feeding us.</span> <span id="s225">And we would pounce on this food and th-the SS men -- the soldiers would shoot at us in groups.</span> <span id="s226">We didn’t care, we wanted that piece of bread, we wanted that food.</span> <span id="s227">When we came to this forest, my aunt and I -- my -- my girlfriend and I took our hands and looked at each other and said we’re going to try to escape.</span> <span id="s228">If they shoot us, they shoot us, but we cannot take this any longer, we will try to escape.</span> <span id="s229">And we picked a time where they -- other people also tried to escape on both sides and the soldiers were busy shooting at other people and we escaped and they did try to shoot at us at that point, then we came into a forest.</span> <span id="s230">If I tell you that every time I think of this escape, I can count my heartbeat even today.</span> <span id="s231">I mean, our hearts were -- we -- we took each other’s hands after we hid behind -- behind some bushes and trees, and we took each other’s hands and we were feeling each other’s hearts as our hearts were beating.</span> <span id="s232">It was like it was going to come out, pop out.</span> <span id="s233">And we stayed in that forest all night long.</span> <span id="s234">We stayed hidden and we watched people walking by -- the prisoners walking by.</span> <span id="s235">The next day, we stayed in the forest and when it started to get dark, we decided that we’re going to try and see if we can find a home, a farm, steal food somewhere, steal clothes somewheres.</span> <span id="s236">You need to remember, our heads were shaved, we were very skinny, we were in striped uniforms.</span> <span id="s237">I mean, you could -- you could spot us a mile away, we couldn’t lie about who or what we were, okay?</span> <span id="s238">We came to this farm, and we were two dumb kids.</span> <span id="s239">We were totally dumb children.</span> <span id="s240">We knocked on the door and I recall a man opening the door and staring at us and all we said is that we’re very hungry.</span> <span id="s241">And we spoke German, we lived in Germany.</span> <span id="s242">And he looked at us and he said, well, he couldn’t give us food, but he will take us into the barn.</span> <span id="s243">Well, he took us into the barn and he let us stay in the barn and he did bring us food, he brought us pieces of bread and he brought us some hot soup.</span> <span id="s244">And he let us stay in the barn and we were supposedly hidden in this barn.</span> <span id="s245">The next morning he came to us and he said he has to go into town and he has to get food stamps for us.</span> <span id="s246">Now here are two -- two Jewish kids that are hiding in a German barn, dumb, believing this man is going to go and get food stamps for us, because he has to had food stamps or whatever story he told us, in order to feed us, and we believed.</span> <span id="s247">We’re two stupid kids and we believed.</span> <span id="s248">And we stood there and we looked at each other and he left.</span> <span id="s249">And all of a sudden it dawned on us, this man is going to turn us in.</span> <span id="s250">I mean, what is he going to do, go and tell people he’s getting food ti -- food stamps for two Jewish kids?</span> <span id="s251">So we stayed there and we watched him leave.</span> <span id="s252">And his wife stayed in the house.</span> <span id="s253">And we left the barn and we went into the forest area again and we hid in the forest.</span> <span id="s254">And we were trying to pick, we picked snails.</span> <span id="s255">Today, it’s called escargot and it’s a delicacy.</span> <span id="s256">Do you know what snails look like when they come out of dirt and dirty snails?</span> <span id="s257">We absolutely had no water to wash them with.</span> <span id="s258">We dug for whatever food we could in the forest and we stayed in the forest and eventually we saw the Russian army come in and take over, and we went out.</span> <span id="s259">And the Russians took us and they put us on -- on a truck and they took us to an area where they already had -- had freed some prisoners, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: If I could just --</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: -- we joined this -- this group.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: I wanted to ask you -- you -- how did you -- how did you see the Russians?</span> <span id="s263">You -- you could just see --</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: We could see them through -- as they -- we saw their trucks.</span> <span id="s265">We saw their trucks coming and we saw their insignia and we knew it was -- we didn’t care who it was as long as it wasn’t the Germans.</span> <span id="s266">I mean, it could have been Pakistani for all we knew.</span> <span id="s267">I mean, it happened to have been the Russians, but at that point we didn’t know it was the Russian lead -- we just knew an army came and we were going to be freed.</span> <span id="s268">But it was the Russian army that came.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Do you remember exactly how you met them when you walked up to them?</span> <span id="s270">What -- if you could tell me what happened, what -- you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: I just recall walking out.</span> <span id="s272">My -- my friend and I, the two of us just walked out of the forest and they saw us and they knew -- they knew who we were.</span> <span id="s273">They gave us food.</span> <span id="s274">I remember one man, in fact, one of the soldiers, a Russian soldier, pulled up his sleeve and he had watches.</span> <span id="s275">He had an arm full of watches on his -- and he looked at me, he said, “Do you want to pick a watch?”</span> <span id="s276">I mean, the last thing in the world I ever wanted at that point was a watch and I said, “No.”</span> <span id="s277">And he had a man’s ring and he took off a man’s ring and he gave it to me.</span> <span id="s278">To this day I don’t know what I did with the ring, cause I don’t have it and I must have lost it somewheres, cause it didn’t fit me.</span> <span id="s279">He handed me this ring.</span> <span id="s280">He just wanted -- he wanted to be nice.</span> <span id="s281">He -- he -- he saw that we were these two hungry kids and he tried to be nice to us and he was.</span> <span id="s282">And they brought us into this -- which they established, a DP camp and there were people there already and they had given us a shower and they gave us -- they deloused us and they gave us clean clothes and they gave us food and they -- medical attention for those that needed medical attention and I remember them telling us, eat slowly, just a little bit of soup, just -- and -- and I just wanted to take all of that in at one point, you know, but I must say at that point, they were good to us, they were nice.</span> <span id="s283">You know, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Did you -- you know, you -- you mentioned the guy offering you a watch, did you even know what the date was?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: No and I don’t know to this day.</span> <span id="s286">I have no recollection.</span> <span id="s287">I have a bad memory for dates anyhow.</span> <span id="s288">I mean, I had to ask what today’s date was.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s290">I mean, I -- I wa -- my -- the -- the point -- my question is -- is -- given the circumstances you were in, at the time did you even know what the date was?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Did you even know what month it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Did you know what year it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: No, I didn’t -- I didn’t even know what day it was.</span> <span id="s296">I mean you lose -- totally lose track.</span> <span id="s297">I -- if you’ve ever been in a hospital and they give you drugs or -- or whatever and you’re there three days, you think you’ve been there a month.</span> <span id="s298">You just lose track of time and it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s299">I didn’t care.</span> <span id="s300">You know, there are -- certain people have certain priorities.</span> <span id="s301">I didn’t care.</span> <span id="s302">I just wanted to get out of -- of the clothes that -- that was biting me, that I wanted -- needed to be deloused and I needed to know that there was a taste of freedom.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Where was this camp, roughly?</span> <span id="s304">What country?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: It was -- I -- I believe it was in Germany -- a area of Germany they -- they took over, you know, and it was in Germany, but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s306">It was -- they had -- the particular camp was -- there were houses that I was put into, it was -- they had taken over like an apartment building.</span> <span id="s307">You know, like several -- actually several apartment buildings they had taken over.</span> <span id="s308">And I recall that they had put like -- like wires on the windows so that the soldiers -- the Russian soldiers couldn’t get at the women.</span> <span id="s309">They weren’t protecting us from their soldiers, they were protecting their soldiers from us, cause we were carriers of disease at that point and they were sure -- wanted to make sure that their soldiers wouldn’t get at any of the women.</span> <span id="s310">So -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview, with Fritzie Fritzshall.</span> <span id="s312">This is tape number one, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: -- wires on the windows so that the soldiers -- the Russian soldiers couldn’t get at the women.</span> <span id="s314">They weren’t protecting us from their soldiers, they were protecting their soldiers from us, cause we were carriers of disease at that point and they were sure -- wanted to make sure that their soldiers wouldn’t get at any of the women.</span> <span id="s315">So we were really being guarded at that point, you know.</span> <span id="s316">But, it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: But it was -- it was to protect you, or to protect them?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: To protect them.</span> <span id="s319">We still didn’t have medical attention, we were still not deloused at that point and you know, when you come out of a camp, who knows what kind of a disease you have?</span> <span id="s320">And these were soldiers and they were afraid of -- you know, that they would come and rape us, or whatever.</span> <span id="s321">And they were protecting their soldiers from us.</span> <span id="s322">So we were getting protection in the same way, actually, but it wasn’t for our protection, it was for theirs, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: And what happens next?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Well, I was there for awhile, until they gave me medical attention and they fed me and they deloused me and there was a lot of talk amongst ourselves, amongst the people that were freed.</span> <span id="s325">Amongst the Jews who -- where are we going to go?</span> <span id="s326">What are we going to do?</span> <span id="s327">Do we have a home to go to?</span> <span id="s328">Who has survived?</span> <span id="s329">Do we want to go back to our hometowns?</span> <span id="s330">These are the people that didn’t want us.</span> <span id="s331">We were afraid to go back to our hometowns.</span> <span id="s332">So there were a lot of discussions of what to do, but how long can you stay in a DP camp and how long are they going to keep you in a DP camp?</span> <span id="s333">Although today I know that many people stayed for many months in DP camps, but I didn’t know this at the time.</span> <span id="s334">I was anxious to get out of there and I chose to go back to my hometown.</span> <span id="s335">And the Russians did give me passage to go to my hometown.</span> <span id="s336">Didn’t give me extra money, did not give me any extra clothes, but did give me passage to go back to my hometown.</span> <span id="s337">And when I -- of course when I came home, I found nothing and no one.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Let me just ask couple things.</span> <span id="s339">One is, the friend that you escaped with into the forest, what was her --</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: We lost each other.</span> <span id="s341">I don’t -- I don’t even -- we knew each other by first names, but we never even knew each other’s last names.</span> <span id="s342">And sometimes that was done on purpose.</span> <span id="s343">When you were in a barrack with someone, you didn’t want to know their last name because today they were your friend and tomorrow they were in a gas chambers or they were laying in a ditch somewheres and we couldn’t -- we couldn’t handle it and it was much easier to handle if I just knew your first name.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: So, oftentimes we didn’t ask for last names.</span> <span id="s346">And after we were liberated, we just lost touch with each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: Do you remember her first name?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Her first name was Sima.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Sima?</span> <span id="s350">Could you spell that?</span> <span id="s351">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: I -- I think it’s S-i-m-a, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s354">And you decided to go back to your town.</span> <span id="s355">If you could tell us the name of your town and where it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: The name of the town was Klucharky and it is better known by -- there was a -- like a big city, which even today, it’s called Mooncartch or Mooncartchavo in the Czech language.</span> <span id="s357">Kluchark -- Mooncartchavo at that point was known for it’s Jewish culture, it was known for it’s -- the Yeshivas, which are Jewish universities and it’s even today a very well-known city.</span> <span id="s358">And we lived like -- it was like a suburb, like maybe Evanston to Chicago kind of a suburb and we used to walk to the big city all the time.</span> <span id="s359">And so I chose to go back home.</span> <span id="s360">And after I was in touch with my dad, I wanted to come to this country and of course he tried to get me to this country, but then Communism took over and the borders were closed.</span> <span id="s361">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: I -- If I -- again, I’m sorry to stop you here, but this is sort of where we left off before and you said that when you got back to the town that the people of the town -- if you could describe again what it was like to go back there, how they saw you returning.</span> <span id="s363">You said that you saw people wearing clothes, living in your houses.</span> <span id="s364">Tell us a little more about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: How does one describe of -- seeing someone or not seeing someone, okay?</span> <span id="s366">We were the people -- we were the Jews that came back, that our neighbors gave up, okay?</span> <span id="s367">One way or another they gave us up.</span> <span id="s368">They turned in our names when the Germans first came in.</span> <span id="s369">They may not have pointed all of us out on the street, but they did have to turn in our names.</span> <span id="s370">When we were being gathered -- when we were being taken to the train, while we were in the ghetto, in our hometown, these neighbors never came to ask if we needed anything, if they could help us, if we were hungry, if we were thirsty.</span> <span id="s371">We were in this ghetto as prisoners.</span> <span id="s372">When we came back, after the war, we were the people that didn’t exist.</span> <span id="s373">They looked through us.</span> <span id="s374">They didn’t speak to us, they didn’t acknowledge us.</span> <span id="s375">They didn’t ask us if we needed anything.</span> <span id="s376">They didn’t offer to give back my mother’s clothes or my mother’s furniture.</span> <span id="s377">They didn’t offer to make us a meal.</span> <span id="s378">We were just the invisible people, so to speak.</span> <span id="s379">So, we came back, but as far as they were concerned, they didn’t accept us back.</span> <span id="s380">And, when you go to a place where you’re not accepted, you in turn get this attitude of, well, they didn’t really want me, so I don’t want them either, okay?</span> <span id="s381">And we did the best we could without associating with neighbors.</span> <span id="s382">Which is very strange because, if you’ve been to Europe, the houses are close together.</span> <span id="s383">It’s -- you live as a community.</span> <span id="s384">Prior to the war, we lived as a -- as a community, we were part of the community.</span> <span id="s385">We went to school together, we lived together, we -- we played together.</span> <span id="s386">And here I come back home -- this was my home, I came back home.</span> <span id="s387">But there was nobody waiting for me and nobody to accept me back into this community.</span> <span id="s388">So, it was a very strange feeling and I have to tell you that I couldn’t wait to get away from there.</span> <span id="s389">I couldn’t wait to get out of there.</span> <span id="s390">I was afraid to go to sleep at night.</span> <span id="s391">I don't know if you can understand this today, but there was -- we -- we lived with the fear of bei -- being turned in again.</span> <span id="s392">There -- there was no freedom when we came back.</span> <span id="s393">We had to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Did you ever have any encounters with any of your former neighbors or acquaintances?</span> <span id="s395">Any -- any conversations, encounters in the street, anything you remember?</span> <span id="s396">Or you stayed in these sort of sep -- they were in their separate world and you were in your separate world at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: It was a totally separate world.</span> <span id="s398">It was strange because when my dad -- after I had contacted my dad and he had gotten my first letter, he called me long distance, of course, to -- to Europe, from the United States.</span> <span id="s399">We had one telephone in town and that was in the post office.</span> <span id="s400">So the postman came to tell me that I was going to get a long distance call tomorrow at three o’clock, from America.</span> <span id="s401">I mean America was this -- this big country, you know, the -- the symbol of freedom.</span> <span id="s402">When I came to the post office, the next day at three o’clock, to wait for my call, the entire town was out there listening and looking, but nobody acknowledged me, but the ears were all there.</span> <span id="s403">And, so it was kind of interesting, because obviously they knew.</span> <span id="s404">Everybody listened in and of course, when you are not used to speaking on a telephone, you shout.</span> <span id="s405">You think that you need to shout cause, you know, the ocean and -- and it’s going to get across the ocean, you know?</span> <span id="s406">And, so obviously they did hear my end of the conversation.</span> <span id="s407">I’m sure they heard it across the ocean, you know, cause I was shouting, but didn’t hear the other end of the conversation.</span> <span id="s408">But they were curious enough to leave their homes and to come to this.</span> <span id="s409">But no offer of any help.</span> <span id="s410">And, I think to this day, I live in a sense of amazement, shock, maybe wonder, that people could be that way -- that people could act that way.</span> <span id="s411">That if people see a hungry child, not to offer food.</span> <span id="s412">That, of people to see someone hurting, not to ask why.</span> <span id="s413">It was an amazing world and amazing people and to this day I don’t understand it.</span> <span id="s414">I don’t understand it.</span> <span id="s415">And probably, if I were to go back there today and speak to them about this, they would see it in a different way and they would remember it in a different way than I do.</span> <span id="s416">But I have a very clear hurt -- hurt memory of this, that even after the war -- I think I would have respected them more if they had come to us after the war and if they had said, “This was a mad world, we didn’t know what we were doing.”</span> <span id="s417">Or, “We did know what we were doing, but we misjudged.”</span> <span id="s418">Or, “How can we help you today, to overcome this?”</span> <span id="s419">Or, “We’re really sorry for what happened.”</span> <span id="s420">I would look at these people and I would say, “I can understand.”</span> <span id="s421">But I can not understand indifference.</span> <span id="s422">Indifference hurts.</span> <span id="s423">Indifference causes wars.</span> <span id="s424">Indifference causes children to be killed and causes hunger and I think we all need to care.</span> <span id="s425">And maybe we’ve learned from this.</span> <span id="s426">But right after the war, the lesson wasn’t there.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: I take it from what you’re saying that you’ve never gone back to the area?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: I’ve been back to Europe and I was not far and I was going to cross the border and I was going to go back there, out of curiosity.</span> <span id="s429">You need to know that there is a place that I was born in, I have wonderful memories of.</span> <span id="s430">And also very sad and very bitter memories.</span> <span id="s431">The draw is there to go back and relive some of my good memories, but the other part is that there’s no one I know there.</span> <span id="s432">Do I really want to see what my house looks like today?</span> <span id="s433">Do I really want to go back?</span> <span id="s434">And there’s this -- this constant fight, there’s this -- yes, part of me wants to go back and see and the other part of me says, “But you weren’t wanted there.</span> <span id="s435">You left there cause you weren’t wanted there, why do you want to go back?”</span> <span id="s436">But I’m also going to Europe in three weeks, through the Washington Holocaust Museum and this thought plays in my mind even today, am I going to go back, am I not?</span> <span id="s437">Cause I’m not going to be that far.</span> <span id="s438">So, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s439">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: The other time, you decided not to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: I decided not to go.</span> <span id="s442">The hurt was -- I couldn’t face it.</span> <span id="s443">I chose not to face it.</span> <span id="s444">The memories are too fresh.</span> <span id="s445">When I -- many people -- most of us were liberated from the camps 50 some years ago.</span> <span id="s446">I was liberated when I started to speak about my experiences and the memories are still too fresh.</span> <span id="s447">And I -- I can’t face the hurt just now.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Do you remember -- you s -- you were talking about -- talking to your father on the phone, now that was the first time in years you’d heard his voice, I’ve -- I guess, right?</span> <span id="s449">Cause he was in America while -- while all this happened to the rest of your family.</span> <span id="s450">Other than the people all being there and listening to you, can you re -- you remember much of that conversation or what it felt like to -- to finally be able to -- to speak with him again?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: I -- th-the one memory that I really have of is him crying at one end on the phone and me crying at the other end of the phone.</span> <span id="s452">And him asking of do I know if anybody else had survived and -- and telling me that he was going to try and bring me to this country, that he wanted me to come here.</span> <span id="s453">And my end was mostly, “Oh, yes,” you know.</span> <span id="s454">And -- and I remember the tears, just a lot of -- a-at that point they were tears of sadness and of happiness and -- and the first conversation was -- was a very sad conversation for both of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: How old were you at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: I think I was 15.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s458">So then I guess the next step is to get to America, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: Well, it’s not so easy to get to America when you live in Europe right after the war and you’re caught under Communism.</span> <span id="s460">So there are steps to be taken from there.</span> <span id="s461">Some o -- some of the Jews had left that part of the country and had gone to -- the -- the areas had become divided and part of Germany had become the Su -- the Sudatenlands.</span> <span id="s462">And my mother’s one brother had lived and gone to the Sudatenlands and he knew that I had survived and he was in touch with me.</span> <span id="s463">And he paid a man money to have me smuggled over the border from where I lived, under Communism, into the Sudatenlands.</span> <span id="s464">So, he paid this man money and this man was a professional smuggler of people.</span> <span id="s465">And there were several of us in this group, several women.</span> <span id="s466">And he collected the money ahead of time and he took us in the group.</span> <span id="s467">It was in the winter, in snow up to our knees, in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s468">We all gathered and had our little knapsacks on our backs and he is going to help us cross the border.</span> <span id="s469">So now, he takes us at night and he takes us into the forest and we’re going to cross the border, okay?</span> <span id="s470">We came into the forest in the middle of the night and he -- we walked -- after walking hours and hours and hours in snow in -- in -- in the forest and slipping and being cold and being hungry and he brings us into a little bit of a shack, some sort of a shack.</span> <span id="s471">And in this shack, there are beds and there’s hot soup waiting for us.</span> <span id="s472">And it was nice and warm and he told us that we are to spend the night in this shack and we’re to have the hot soup and get a good night’s rest.</span> <span id="s473">And he is going to come back the next day and he is going to lead us the rest of the way.</span> <span id="s474">And he leaves us and he forgets to come back.</span> <span id="s475">He never came back.</span> <span id="s476">So, we stayed in this little shack -- cottage -- whatever it was, for two days and three days and four days and we didn’t know whether we had crossed the border or hadn’t crossed the border.</span> <span id="s477">We didn’t know which way the border was and we didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s478">And we finally realized that this man is not going to come back.</span> <span id="s479">So, we decided we’re going to take a chance and just pick a direction and we’re going to go in a particular direction, which we did.</span> <span id="s480">And we made our way through the forest at night and when daybreak came, we came to a little town and we came near a river.</span> <span id="s481">And there were small boats near the river that were turned over -- like dinghies, I guess they call them, they were turned over because it was winter.</span> <span id="s482">And so we did -- in the -- in the day, we all climbed underneath these boats.</span> <span id="s483">You know, two or three of us would take one little boat and we climbed underneath the boat and we spend the day there and when evening came, we came out of the boats.</span> <span id="s484">At this point we’re hungry and we came out and we started to walk into town, three of us at one point.</span> <span id="s485">And we came into the town and when I looked up at the town -- I don’t even recall now, I remembered my grandmother had family living in this town.</span> <span id="s486">So, I started to ask questions and their name was Weissburger, so I stopped someone on the street and I asked, “Do you know where the Weissburgers live and did any of them come back?”</span> <span id="s487">And the person said, “Oh, yes,” he said, “there are two brothers that survived the war and came back,”-- excuse me -- and showed us where to go.</span> <span id="s488">So the three of us came to my cousin, who opened the door and when I -- they didn’t known me and I told them who I was and what we -- what had happened.</span> <span id="s489">They took us in and they went and brought the rest of the group to come to their home.</span> <span id="s490">At that point, when we crossed the bor -- when the man was going to bring us across the border, we all had families or friends waiting for us with falsified papers, so we could stay in the Sudatenlands, okay?</span> <span id="s491">My uncle was waiting for me with falsified papers and I also had one cousin that crossed the border with me and she was going to be met by someone else with falsified papers.</span> <span id="s492">Well, we stayed with my family there for several days and their friends and families were notified and they all came to get them with their papers, as did my uncle.</span> <span id="s493">My cousin couldn’t get in touch with whoever it was who was bringing her papers and she walked out one day and she was caught and sent back over the border.</span> <span id="s494">I had learned since that she stayed there and had married someone and had raised a family, but stayed under Communism.</span> <span id="s495">I, on the other hand, went to where my uncle lived and stayed with him.</span> <span id="s496">My uncle had a little grocery store and I helped him in this grocery store.</span> <span id="s497">After a while, he also smuggled my aunt, who came to stay with me in Europe.</span> <span id="s498">He had her smuggled out with someone else and she also lived with us in this little grocery store and we helped my uncle.</span> <span id="s499">I was able to get in touch with my father through there -- through letters, and he was able to send me papers.</span> <span id="s500">He also -- every time he wrote me a le-letter, there was either a dollar bill or a five dollar bill or a ten dollar bill in there.</span> <span id="s501">What I didn’t know was that my mail was being censored, okay?</span> <span id="s502">But it was handed to me.</span> <span id="s503">The day I was leaving on the train, with my feet on the train, with my passport in hand, the police came to ask me what happened to the money that my father had sent me, because that meant that I was selling at black market, right?</span> <span id="s504">My aunt is standing at the train, my uncle is standing at the train, my friends came to see me off, there are motorcycles all over the place that friends came to see me off cause I was leaving the Sudatenlands and going to Sweden.</span> <span id="s505">I am standing on the steps of this train as the police are looking at me and asking me what happened to the money.</span> <span id="s506">And I held up my passport and visa and I said, “Oh, I had to pay for my passport and my visa with that money.</span> <span id="s507">I had to go and pay.”</span> <span id="s508">And the train started and I left.</span> <span id="s509">It was like, I can’t believe I was thinking this fast.</span> <span id="s510">What made me give this answer?</span> <span id="s511">You know, so it was quite a -- quite an escape at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s513">You had mentioned before getting the -- you all were getting the packages from the UN with -- was that in this place, was that in the -- in your old hometown?</span> <span id="s514">Where were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: It was in my old -- in my hometown we were getting it, when we first came home, they were -- the Unrah packages were coming, you know.</span> <span id="s516">And I remember getting what we called the high button shoes, which -- you know, the shoes that were lacing up.</span> <span id="s517">You know, you’re a young girl, you come out of a camp and you gain a little bit of weight and -- and you think the world is all yours and here I’m -- I may not have had much, but I don’t really want to wear those ugly shoes.</span> <span id="s518">I mean, couldn’t they have sent -- I’m sure that in America, they have nicer shoes, I mean.</span> <span id="s519">But we didn’t care about the clothes, we wanted the food.</span> <span id="s520">We kept opening the packages and we wou -- there would be cookies in there.</span> <span id="s521">There would be candy bars in there, cigarettes, gum and also clothes and some canned -- canned goods were in there and so we -- we appreciated the food.</span> <span id="s522">We may have looked down on the shoes, but we did appreciate the food, because we were hungry even there and we needed -- everything was being rationed still.</span> <span id="s523">And we truly thanked -- every time a package came, we said thank you.</span> <span id="s524">We -- we did appreciate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Did you ever catch on that the gum was for chewing?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: Not until I came here.</span> <span id="s527">Not until I came to this country did I catch on that gum is to be chewed.</span> <span id="s528">No, it was very sweet and it was -- it tasted like candy and probably still growing in my stomach.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: So you get on the train and your next stop is Sweden?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Came to Sweden and we came to Sweden and stayed in Sweden several days and Sweden to me, at that time, was the land of plenty.</span> <span id="s531">It was Guttenburg, Sweden.</span> <span id="s532">And we were given all the chocolate we wanted, we were given food, we were given fruit.</span> <span id="s533">I remember I was given a banana and I hated -- I -- the smell of banana and -- and could never eat the banana, but there you could have had all the bananas you wanted.</span> <span id="s534">And from there I was -- I took a ship called the Grippsholm, which I believe is still in service today, it’s a Swedish liner.</span> <span id="s535">And I came over with many of our young people, many Jewish people that were lucky enough to get their passports and visas.</span> <span id="s536">Immigration was very, very tight right after the war, to come into this country.</span> <span id="s537">This country didn’t open it’s doors freely to us immigrants.</span> <span id="s538">And at that point, one had to show that one had family here or friends that could vouch for them, that th -- they wouldn’t be a burden on the government.</span> <span id="s539">The government did not want to support us in any way, so we had to prove that there was someone we were coming to.</span> <span id="s540">It took a long time to get the passports and the visas.</span> <span id="s541">I was one of the lucky people, because I was still what was considered under age.</span> <span id="s542">And so I was able to get my passport and my visa and came over on a child’s -- still on a child’s passport and visa, so I -- my -- the quota -- I did not have to wait for the long quota numbers at that particular time.</span> <span id="s543">And so when we boarded the ship, the Grippsholm, we tried to stay together.</span> <span id="s544">We did not have first class passage, let me tell you.</span> <span id="s545">And I remember my cabinmate -- is that what they call them?</span> <span id="s546">The person that shared the cabin with me was an American young woman.</span> <span id="s547">And -- a very pretty young woman and she had a birthmark on her face -- a dark birthmark on her face.</span> <span id="s548">We could not communicate in any way.</span> <span id="s549">She was a little older than I was and she ignored me very much at that point.</span> <span id="s550">And we couldn’t communicate anyhow, so it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s551">But I remember sitting up on my bunk bed and -- cause we had the -- up, and watching her put on make-up and I didn’t know anything about make-up at that point, but I remember watching her, how she was covering up that birthmark.</span> <span id="s552">And when she covered it up with make-up, one couldn’t see it and she was absolutely beautiful and really had this beautiful smile.</span> <span id="s553">But we would stay by ourselves.</span> <span id="s554">The young people -- the young Jewish people would stay by ourselves.</span> <span id="s555">And I need to tell you that I really wanted to come and see my dad and wanted to come to this country as freedom, but my first choice was Israel.</span> <span id="s556">I wanted to go to Israel, cause most of my friends, at that point, were going to Israel.</span> <span id="s557">I didn’t care that I was being smuggled into Israel, I didn’t care that I had to fight for the freedom there.</span> <span id="s558">I felt that was going to be my country and I wanted to go to Israel, but because my dad was here and the need to see him, I came to this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Did you ever -- either on the telephone or in writing to your father while he was trying to get you over here, bring that up with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: No.</span> <span id="s561">No, I never did.</span> <span id="s562">I didn’t want to hurt him in any way and I was just happy to be reunited with him.</span> <span id="s563">But my ultimate goal was to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s564">I mean, I was going to come here and then go to Israel.</span> <span id="s565">And I remember going into -- we left Sweden and we came to England and then we came to New York.</span> <span id="s566">And I had my dad’s brother and sister-in-law -- my uncle, whom I remembered from Europe, he left.</span> <span id="s567">He was one of the lucky ones, he was able to leave.</span> <span id="s568">He was like almost the last person able to leave Europe and come to this country.</span> <span id="s569">And I remembered skipping school.</span> <span id="s570">We still lived in freedom at that point and, skipping school and going to the train to watch him leave.</span> <span id="s571">Cause I love him, he was -- my dad was here and he sort of became like my dad.</span> <span id="s572">And I remember being punished for skipping school.</span> <span id="s573">So, when I came to this country, he was the one that met me in New York and he and his wife, who was American born, and -- took me to New Jersey.</span> <span id="s574">And at that point it was East Orange, New Jersey and I didn’t see my dad til the next day.</span> <span id="s575">But I remember my mother also had a sister living in Brooklyn and when my aunt and uncle came to meet me in New York, my aunt’s sister -- my -- my mother’s sister also came.</span> <span id="s576">Now this was -- one was my father’s brother and sister-in-law and one was my mother’s sister.</span> <span id="s577">My father and my aunt didn’t get along and -- and -- so one was pulling me to go to their house and one was pulling me to go to her house, cause I was her sister’s daughter and she wanted me to go there.</span> <span id="s578">But I wound up going with my uncle, whom I knew, because I did not know my aunt on the other side.</span> <span id="s579">I mean I knew -- didn’t even know she existed until I came into this country.</span> <span id="s580">And I stayed with my aunt and uncle and went to bed that night and I remember waking up the very next morning and someone was sitting on the edge of my bed, looking down at me.</span> <span id="s581">This man is sitting at the edge of the bed, staring at me as I am sleeping.</span> <span id="s582">And you know, you get that feeling and I opened my eyes and it was my dad.</span> <span id="s583">He -- he was -- that’s the first I had seen him in many, many years.</span> <span id="s584">In fact, I didn’t even remember him.</span> <span id="s585">So, it was a very strange feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: You didn’t know he was going to be there, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: Well, I knew he was coming the next day, but he must have either come in during the night or must have come very early that morning, and -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Fritzie Fritzshall.</span> <span id="s589">This is tape number two, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: -- have come very early that morning, and -- to see me, you know.</span> <span id="s591">Cause he was working and couldn’t meet me the day I came in, but he was there the very next morning.</span> <span id="s592">So, it was very strange.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Well, what happened?</span> <span id="s595">We were -- in -- in the very beginning --</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: I was -- I was thinking, right then, do you remember any more of tha-that scene right there?</span> <span id="s597">I mean, quite a scene.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: The scene is -- it’s very hard to describe.</span> <span id="s599">How does one describe a father seeing his child for the first time in many years?</span> <span id="s600">Or -- or a child seeing her father for the first time, in freedom?</span> <span id="s601">It was a lot of emotion.</span> <span id="s602">I don’t know, I can’t even describe it.</span> <span id="s603">And especially on my dad’s part, because I believe that all his life, he lived with the guilt that he left and he lost his family there.</span> <span id="s604">He lost his two sons, he lost his wife.</span> <span id="s605">He didn’t leave us by choice, he didn’t desert us.</span> <span id="s606">He left us to make a better living for himself and for us, so it isn’t that he walked away from us; he always supported us.</span> <span id="s607">But his feelings were always that maybe if he had stayed, he could have done something more.</span> <span id="s608">Or maybe if he -- maybe he could have sent papers sooner -- which he couldn’t.</span> <span id="s609">We had all our papers to come to this country.</span> <span id="s610">We just got caught in the madness of it.</span> <span id="s611">And he never should have felt guilt and he never should have blamed himself, because he did whatever he needed to do and the best he knew how.</span> <span id="s612">So, I honestly believe that all his life, he lived with -- with the guilts of that.</span> <span id="s613">But as far as I was concerned, he nee -- he -- he didn’t need to, because he couldn’t have done more.</span> <span id="s614">And he certainly did everything he could for me, once I came here.</span> <span id="s615">I was one of the lucky ones.</span> <span id="s616">Many survivors that came to this country didn’t have it easy when they first came here.</span> <span id="s617">Many tell the stories of being brought here, but families were sending them to work the next day and they had to live in -- in -- in the basement and they weren’t really welcome and they had very hard times.</span> <span id="s618">My dad was not a wealthy man, but he certainly provided for me when I first came.</span> <span id="s619">He gave me love.</span> <span id="s620">I never lived with him when I first came here, cause he lived in a small apartment and I lived with his brother and sister-in-law, who -- my aunt and uncle and my aunt, to this day -- she’s 82 years old and if she was my mother I couldn’t love her more and she couldn’t have been better to me.</span> <span id="s621">I came to a loving family.</span> <span id="s622">I came to a family that opened their arms to me and did the best they knew how.</span> <span id="s623">So I really was one of the lucky ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Where was your father living at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: My father lived here in Chicago, on Armitage Avenue.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: Okay, so he -- he met you in New York, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: Brought me back here.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: Brought you here?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: Brought me here and I lived here all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: And your aunt and the other people you’re talking about were also here?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: Lived here -- yes, lived here in Chicago and to this day my aunt is the most loving, most wonderful lady.</span> <span id="s632">Had three children of her own and raised me as her own.</span> <span id="s633">Taught me how to speak English.</span> <span id="s634">Taught me -- sent me to school.</span> <span id="s635">Made sure I learned how, when and where, the ways of this country and was just wonderful.</span> <span id="s636">So, I was one of the lucky people that came to a loving family.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: You talked about the -- the guilt your father felt.</span> <span id="s638">Is -- that whole situation.</span> <span id="s639">Did you and he ever discuss that or is what you just described basic -- comes from your understanding of him?</span> <span id="s640">Did you ever talk about it or was just something you -- you knew and felt?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: My father was a man of few words.</span> <span id="s642">You could be in the same room with my dad all day long and maybe you would hear five words out of him.</span> <span id="s643">I don’t know where I got the gift of gab, but certainly not from him.</span> <span id="s644">He was a very quiet individual.</span> <span id="s645">My dad talked to me once, actually -- deep talk, once.</span> <span id="s646">Do I know what happened to my mother and am I sure my mother died?</span> <span id="s647">Am I sure my brothers died?</span> <span id="s648">No, I wasn’t sure my brothers died at that point, cause I saw them alive once in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s649">My dad and I tried to trace them through organizations, but obviously couldn’t.</span> <span id="s650">He wanted to find his family.</span> <span id="s651">We talked about the war once and then we didn’t talk about it any longer.</span> <span id="s652">He didn’t talk to me because he felt that he was opening wounds.</span> <span id="s653">I didn’t discuss it with him because I felt the same way, but by his looks and by his actions -- he did remarry many years later -- many years later.</span> <span id="s654">In fact, I was married already and -- and -- excuse me -- I believe I was pregnant with my son when my dad remarried.</span> <span id="s655">So, it took him all of these many years to remarry.</span> <span id="s656">But I believe that he lived with his guilts all his life, cause he loved his family.</span> <span id="s657">He wanted his family.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: Herman Weiss.</span> <span id="s660">When I went back to -- to Auschwitz several years ago, back then -- ‘93, I believe, there’s a room in Auschwitz where it has all luggage, suitcases.</span> <span id="s661">I walked into this room and the first suitcase that stares at me is Weiss, W-e-i-s-s.</span> <span id="s662">That was my maiden name.</span> <span id="s663">Do I know if it was ours?</span> <span id="s664">No.</span> <span id="s665">Would I recognize it?</span> <span id="s666">No.</span> <span id="s667">Could it have been?</span> <span id="s668">Yes.</span> <span id="s669">Do you know what that does to one’s insides?</span> <span id="s670">Standing there, looking at that?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: When you did come over, what year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: I came over in ‘45, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: It was ‘45 and you’re -- are you still --</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: ‘45 -- 40 s -- ‘46.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: ‘46.</span> <span id="s676">So you’re still, what, 15 - 16, somewhere -- somewhere in there.</span> <span id="s677">Was it hard to -- you know, it sounds like in many ways you were in a really good situation with your family.</span> <span id="s678">Was it hard to adjust to this country?</span> <span id="s679">Was this a very strange place?</span> <span id="s680">Did you like it, did it kind of put you o -- how did you feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: When I first came -- when I first got off the sh -- the ship in New York and I’m in this car with my aunt and uncle and they take me into a Walgreen’s for a soda -- ice cream, okay?</span> <span id="s682">Now, here I am, in this Walgreen’s that is big and that has everything.</span> <span id="s683">Here it is selling medicine on one corner and you can buy a pair of shoes in the other corner.</span> <span id="s684">Now, in Europe, it’s an -- if it’s a drugstore, it only sells medicine, you know.</span> <span id="s685">Dat -- apotocare -- I can’t even pronounce it -- where it’s -- medicine is sold.</span> <span id="s686">And I remember sitting there and just sitting on this stool that would turn.</span> <span id="s687">What do they call those stools, where you could turn them and you could turn in all directions?</span> <span id="s688">By the counter, the counter stools.</span> <span id="s689">And I remember holding the soda in -- in my hand and just turning in this chair in amazement and looking around in this drugstore where you can just walk and take something off a shelf and just pay for it.</span> <span id="s690">There’s everything here in this drugstore and I’m saying to myself, “My God,” you know, “where am I, what is it?”</span> <span id="s691">And of course, New York City, do I need to tell you about the taxi cabs?</span> <span id="s692">I mean, it wasn’t as bad as it is today.</span> <span id="s693">In Europe, yes, we had cars and trucks and all of that, but I remember riding a motorcycle with my uncle cause we didn’t have a car and I remember getting a flat tire every other block, cause we didn’t have the good tires, you know, right after the war.</span> <span id="s694">And here is all the buses and the trucks and the streetcars and the -- and the confusion and the people in all directions.</span> <span id="s695">And it was like it was mind boggling that first day.</span> <span id="s696">Absolutely mind boggling.</span> <span id="s697">When I came to Chicago, I -- I had stayed with my aunt and uncle in New York for a few weeks.</span> <span id="s698">And when I came to Chicago, it -- it became now -- in New York, I lived in New Jersey, which is more of a small community.</span> <span id="s699">When I came to Chicago, I came into the city, okay?</span> <span id="s700">Now I’m living in this big city.</span> <span id="s701">I came from a little town in Europe, I did not come from this big city.</span> <span id="s702">So it was very different and very strange and I remember the clothes that I came -- that I brought from Europe was the wrong clothes.</span> <span id="s703">I came with all the wrong clothes, you know, so when I was in New Jersey, my aunt took that clothes away from me and she got rid of it and bought me new clothes.</span> <span id="s704">When I came to Chicago, to my aunt here, my aunt decided -- my aunt in Chicago decided that my aunt in New -- New Jersey bought me all the wrong clothes.</span> <span id="s705">So now she emptied out this -- this suitcase and she took me shopping for different clothes.</span> <span id="s706">So now I had to learn how to do this.</span> <span id="s707">My aunt was a young woman at the time also and she had three children.</span> <span id="s708">Now, I spoke German when I came here.</span> <span id="s709">I spoke Hungarian, I spoke Yiddish, okay?</span> <span id="s710">I spoke Czech, but did not speak English.</span> <span id="s711">My aunt spoke a little bit of German.</span> <span id="s712">So, between her little bit of German that she had and my German, we were able to communicate.</span> <span id="s713">And of course, with my dad, I s -- could speak Yiddish or I could speak, you know, in Hungarian.</span> <span id="s714">And it didn’t matter, you know, cause my dad’s -- when my dad came to this country, he didn’t have time to go to school and -- and he -- his English was with a very heavy accent, as we all have, but his, you know, he never really learned how to speak proper English, so to speak.</span> <span id="s715">My aunt decided that I was going to learn how to speak with her children, with her three children.</span> <span id="s716">And every time I would say something that wasn’t so, as I was learning, she would correct me.</span> <span id="s717">And to this day there’s a family joke where her little boy must have been two or two and a half years old at the time and she -- his name was Jimmy and she called Jimmy and he -- his answer was, “Here I are, Mommy, here I are.”</span> <span id="s718">And now, my aunt did not correct her two year old or two and a half year old, but she looked at me and she, with her finger goes, “Fritzie, you don’t say here I are.</span> <span id="s719">You never say here I are.”</span> <span id="s720">You know, so she made sure that I learned how to speak.</span> <span id="s721">And send me to school and -- and I think it’s due to her that I speak a little better English than some of us that came over here.</span> <span id="s722">And -- but I was always unhappy, I always wanted to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s723">Always, all the time and now I am starting to speak out loud and now I am telling my dad, “I really don’t want to stay here, it’s very hard, I don’t know the language.</span> <span id="s724">I don’t know, I don't dress properly, I don’t do anything, I’m -- I -- I want to go to Israel.”</span> <span id="s725">And he always said, “No, you’ll learn, you’ll learn.”</span> <span id="s726">And I guess one day he decided he is going to call my bluff and he looked at me one day and he said, “Okay.</span> <span id="s727">If that’s what you really want, if that’s what will make you happy, I will send you to Israel.</span> <span id="s728">When do you want to leave?”</span> <span id="s729">And at this point I go, “Well, maybe I really don’t want to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s730">Maybe I really like it here,” you know.</span> <span id="s731">And I have to tell you that I love this country.</span> <span id="s732">Yes, I am a flag waver, with it’s politics and with all that’s going on, I feel it is my country and -- and I treat it as such.</span> <span id="s733">I love it.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Did you go to public schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: I went to a special school originally, it was called Adante School.</span> <span id="s736">And I remember taking the streetcar from where we lived to -- and it was quite a way to go, it was about 35 minutes by streetcar.</span> <span id="s737">And I remember coming there once and ha -- needing to get off, because the streetcar wasn’t stopping and I’m standing at the back door and I’m hollering, “Up, up, up,” instead of saying that I need to get out.</span> <span id="s738">I didn’t know how to speak and everybody is standing there laughing at me because I am hollering, “Up,” instead of that I need to get off this -- this streetcar.</span> <span id="s739">And eventually somebody caught on and said, “I guess she needs to get off,” you know and they pulled that bell or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s740">And then -- so I would go to school and then my dad worked for Vienna sausage company where -- which was like maybe a block away and I remember after school every day, I would walk to Vienna sausage company and have a sandwich there and wait for my dad to finish work and then I would -- he would drive me back home.</span> <span id="s741">So this -- this was going on for quite awhile.</span> <span id="s742">And I hated to -- I -- I -- I learned to hate corned beef sandwiches, cause I had one every day.</span> <span id="s743">Today we find out it’s cholesterol heaven, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s745">What -- what neighborhood were you in?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: We lived -- originally, when I came here, we lived in East Rogersburg.</span> <span id="s747">1348 and a half Esther Street.</span> <span id="s748">I li -- we lived in a four room apartment with three little children, my aunt, my uncle and Fritzie.</span> <span id="s749">And originally I slept on -- they had those chairs that converted into beds at that time.</span> <span id="s750">That was my bed, because we were really cramped until we moved into bigger -- a bigger apartment.</span> <span id="s751">But, it was very hard in the beginning.</span> <span id="s752">It was -- this is not an easy country to come to.</span> <span id="s753">You need to remember that during the time we came here, right after the war, the Americans were not the travelers they have become today.</span> <span id="s754">The Americans, at that time, were not as tolerant of an accent as they are today.</span> <span id="s755">Because today they travel and they’ve become the foreigners in the foreign lands and they -- they know what it means to learn a different language.</span> <span id="s756">They were not tolerant of us; we were called the greena in -- in Jewish.</span> <span id="s757">We were called the refugees.</span> <span id="s758">We were told not to speak our -- about our past, we should forget about it.</span> <span id="s759">Nobody wants to listen to us, nobody wants to hear it.</span> <span id="s760">Some of us could not speak about our past, but some of us needed to speak about our past and nobody would listen to us and nobody wanted to hear it.</span> <span id="s761">We were told to keep quiet.</span> <span id="s762">We were just -- people did not tolerate us and were not always nice to us when we first came here and was very difficult.</span> <span id="s763">This is a very difficult language to learn.</span> <span id="s764">One word can have different meanings and especially to spell, my God, I mean, I’ll never learn how to spell.</span> <span id="s765">I still don’t know why there is a k in front of a knife, you know, but -- the word knife.</span> <span id="s766">But it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s767">Most of us found it very difficult when we first came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: You were saying that you were told to forget about what had happened to you, that -- that people didn’t want to hear wh -- who was -- who was telling you this?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: The families.</span> <span id="s770">The j -- the other Jewish people, the people that -- that one needed to talk to, our neighbors, everybody.</span> <span id="s771">Nobody wanted to listen, nobody wanted to hear about what happened in the past.</span> <span id="s772">Whether it was from guilt, that nobody did anything here or what it was from.</span> <span id="s773">I remember when I got married and -- and -- and my husband and I went to the movies, the Chicago theater, downtown.</span> <span id="s774">And in those days they used to show a newsreel before the movie started.</span> <span id="s775">I recall a newsreel coming on while we were sitting in the theater and it showed openings of camps and -- and the atrocities of some of it, during that time.</span> <span id="s776">And I couldn’t face up to it and I walked out.</span> <span id="s777">And my husband followed me and we came to -- we were in the lobby of the Chicago theater and as we’re standing there, people are saying, “I don’t understand while -- why they are showing those atrocities.</span> <span id="s778">We know that didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s779">Those things could have never happened the way they are showing them.”</span> <span id="s780">And I’m standing there, me, who has just come out of one of those places and not answering, because of ignorance of people.</span> <span id="s781">So, they didn’t want to know.</span> <span id="s782">How many of us close our eyes and close our ears to things that are going on in the world today?</span> <span id="s783">We don’t want to know.</span> <span id="s784">And maybe we could help and maybe we can’t, but we don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: You mentioned in your video interview that your way of dealing with the Holocaust and your experiences was that for many years, I think the phrase you used was you put them on the shelf and you sort of kept them to yourself.</span> <span id="s786">Why -- is that what happened and why -- why did that happen?</span> <span id="s787">Was it because of these messages you felt like you were getting, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: We were getting very mixed messages and we were also -- each one of us needs to handle a death or an atrocity or a tragedy in our own ways.</span> <span id="s789">We -- we can’t predict how we’re going to react and we should never judge the next person of their -- of how they are handling it.</span> <span id="s790">I have learned this.</span> <span id="s791">My aunt and uncle that I lived with in Chicago -- I’m just going to use this then, as an example, were -- were going on vacation.</span> <span id="s792">My uncle had just sold his business and they were going to take their first vacation and they were driving to California and they got into a terrible accident.</span> <span id="s793">It was a head on collision and my uncle was killed instantly.</span> <span id="s794">And I remember getting this call that my uncle was killed and that the rest of them were all hurt and -- in this automobile accident.</span> <span id="s795">Now, I loved my uncle as much as I loved my father or anyone in the family, cause I lived with him, he became my father image.</span> <span id="s796">And I recall getting this call and going hysterical laughing.</span> <span id="s797">Laughing and crying, tears, but -- but -- like I was in -- in a hysterical -- now that was my way of accepting it at that time.</span> <span id="s798">The concentration camps were similar, but a different story.</span> <span id="s799">The shock of the camps, the things we saw, the things we lived through.</span> <span id="s800">And you might sit here for two weeks listening to some of the things that we had gone through in one day and listen to two different people from the same place, experiencing the same thing, but seeing it and experiencing it in a different way and both reacting in a different way.</span> <span id="s801">When I got out of the camps and when I came here, I -- I couldn’t live with those thoughts.</span> <span id="s802">I couldn’t handle them.</span> <span id="s803">I just -- I would have been -- they would have put me in an institution if I had lived with it day in and day out.</span> <span id="s804">So, I guess my way was to pretend.</span> <span id="s805">I pretended.</span> <span id="s806">All of those people were in a camp, my family and all the other Jewish families, they were all in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s807">All those babies were killed in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s808">The gas chambers were going day in and day out.</span> <span id="s809">I saw them in a movie, it never happened to me.</span> <span id="s810">I was not there.</span> <span id="s811">This was a nightmare.</span> <span id="s812">I needed to walk away from it.</span> <span id="s813">I couldn’t think about it, I couldn’t live with myself.</span> <span id="s814">I couldn’t watch my dad’s sad eyes.</span> <span id="s815">So, I went into a pretend world.</span> <span id="s816">I needed to be a young girl.</span> <span id="s817">If I am going to be this young girl, I am going to be this normal young girl and live a normal life, right?</span> <span id="s818">So you put yourself in this pretend world and you live your days this way and it works.</span> <span id="s819">For the most part, it works.</span> <span id="s820">Then come the nights.</span> <span id="s821">You don’t have control over your mind at night when you’re sleeping.</span> <span id="s822">You don’t have control over your dreams and your nightmares.</span> <span id="s823">So, yes, you do pretend in the daytime, but the reality sets in through your dreams and through your nightmares, every single night.</span> <span id="s824">Every single night, somebody had to wake me and tell me it was -- “it’s a dream, it’s okay.</span> <span id="s825">You’re okay now, you’re free.”</span> <span id="s826">To this day, when I speak about it, my husband still has to wake me and tell me, “It’s okay -- you’re okay.”</span> <span id="s827">So, for many years, I needed to live a different kind of a life and deny the fact that I was there.</span> <span id="s828">And I did this for many years.</span> <span id="s829">When our son was old enough to go to school, they didn’t teach anything about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s830">I don’t know if they did when you went to school, but there was very little in those days.</span> <span id="s831">It isn’t like today.</span> <span id="s832">We didn’t have a Washington Holocaust Museum to tell us.</span> <span id="s833">He learned about the Holocaust in Sunday school and he’d come home and ask questions.</span> <span id="s834">And I couldn’t answer them.</span> <span id="s835">I pretended that it didn’t happen to me, but I didn’t say this to him, I just said, “I don’t want to talk about it, we’re not going to talk about it.”</span> <span id="s836">Yes, my me -- my family knew I was a survivor.</span> <span id="s837">My in-laws knew, my husband knew.</span> <span id="s838">I didn’t pretend in front of them.</span> <span id="s839">I never hid it from anyone, I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s840">I have this accent, I’m Jewish.</span> <span id="s841">I came from Europe, how do I hide it?</span> <span id="s842">But, in our home -- immediate home, we couldn’t speak about it.</span> <span id="s843">It was not a subject that was brought up.</span> <span id="s844">When our son went to high school, he would come home and ask questions and I would give very little information.</span> <span id="s845">I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s846">When he got married and our first grandson was born, he needed to know more.</span> <span id="s847">For his own sake, he needed to know more.</span> <span id="s848">And those were the days when they were beginning to find some of the Germans that had lied about what they did during the times of the war and lied about taking parts in concentration camps and came to this country and they were finding some of them.</span> <span id="s849">And those were the days when there was a janitor that lived in Hyde Park, I believe, I’m not quite sure where, and they found out that he was a Nazi in one of the concentration camps and they wanted to prosecute him and all his neighbors stood up and said, “Well, how can you do this?</span> <span id="s850">He’s such a good man, he’s such a good neighbor, he’s such a good janitor.”</span> <span id="s851">The fact that he committed murder the times before -- God only knows of how many, didn’t count, okay?</span> <span id="s852">But maybe if he had killed their sister or their brother or their mother, he wouldn’t have been this wonderful person.</span> <span id="s853">And I’m saying to myself, “They don’t know.</span> <span id="s854">These people don’t know.</span> <span id="s855">They weren’t there.</span> <span id="s856">He didn’t kill their family.</span> <span id="s857">He, like the rest, needs to pay for his crime.”</span> <span id="s858">This is a country where we need to account for our -- for ourselves, for what we’ve done.</span> <span id="s859">Then my son came to me and said that he saw this article that was put in through the Holocaust foundation in Skokie, about asking for survivors to come forth and have their stories recorded.</span> <span id="s860">And yes, I saw it many times.</span> <span id="s861">But those were still the days when I did not speak out.</span> <span id="s862">So all this was beginning to come to a head.</span> <span id="s863">My son needed to know.</span> <span id="s864">The janitor needed -- the people needed to know what happened in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s865">And I started to think about this and I said, “Maybe some of us do need to speak out.</span> <span id="s866">Maybe it’s going to hurt, but maybe we can set the world straight.”</span> <span id="s867">And when my son called and said, “Mom, you need to do this because I need to know and your grandchildren will need to know.”</span> <span id="s868">And this is where a grandma and a mother gets caught.</span> <span id="s869">And his words were, “Don’t ask for anything.</span> <span id="s870">Sign whatever they want you to sign.</span> <span id="s871">Take a blank tape and ask for a copy of a tape.”</span> <span id="s872">Which is what I did.</span> <span id="s873">And I went and I was interviewed.</span> <span id="s874">And I remember sitting in this room for the very first time, coming to this home to be interviewed and I was interviewed by Dr. Leon Stein, who is head of the history department, I believe, at Roosevelt University, who has since become a friend, but this is the first time I’ve met him.</span> <span id="s875">I remember he came there with cameras and as we started this interview, the camera broke down.</span> <span id="s876">And I said, “See, I’m not supposed to be doing this.”</span> <span id="s877">Okay, so they asked me would I come back the next day -- and I had a friend go with me the first day and the next day.</span> <span id="s878">And I said, “I don’t know, you know, I don’t know that I can go through this.”</span> <span id="s879">But I did go back.</span> <span id="s880">And we still have a tape of that first interview, which was terrible, because I couldn’t speak and it was a very bad interview.</span> <span id="s881">The -- the questions didn’t come the way they should.</span> <span id="s882">And I remember was a short interview and my friend that came with me and I went back into my car and we sat down and when I got into the car, the floodgates opened.</span> <span id="s883">And I went hysterical, crying on her shoulder.</span> <span id="s884">This is the first time I have given this interview and I -- it just -- it just opened this gate.</span> <span id="s885">And then I said, “They didn’t ask me anything.</span> <span id="s886">This is what I could have told them, that’s what I could have told them, this is what I should have said.</span> <span id="s887">But they didn’t ask and I didn’t think of saying anything and I’m never giving another interview, this is too painful.</span> <span id="s888">I cannot do this and -- and I’m never doing another interview.”</span> <span id="s889">The next day I get a call from this professor and he says to me, “You know, there’s going to be a panel discussion at the university, would you come and go on this?”</span> <span id="s890">And I go, “No, I’m not a public speaker, I don’t know how to do this.</span> <span id="s891">I am not going.”</span> <span id="s892">He said, “I live in your neighborhood.</span> <span id="s893">I will pick you up, I will bring you home and let’s do this.”</span> <span id="s894">Well, this is how it started, where I beca-gun to speak out.</span> <span id="s895">One thing led to another and I started to go into schools and I started to go into universities, started to go into synagogues and I started to work -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Fritzie Fritzshall.</span> <span id="s897">This is tape number two, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: -- do this.”</span> <span id="s899">Well, this is how it started, where I beca-gun to speak out.</span> <span id="s900">One thing led to another and I started to go into schools and I started to go into universities, started to go into synagogues and I started to work with Mayor Daly, our mayor in Chicago.</span> <span id="s901">When Mayor Daly came into office, he had a Day of Remembrance.</span> <span id="s902">He was the first mayor that ever had a Day of Remembrance.</span> <span id="s903">And I started to work with him in the schools and when he had a Day of Remembrance, I was his first keynote speaker at the Daly Center and I spoke out at the Daly Center.</span> <span id="s904">And then I started to work -- Mayor Daly every year has a Day of Remembrance, but prior to everybody going, what most people don’t know is that he holds a breakfast and invites two students from every Chicago school -- the high school and they have a breakfast first -- beautiful breakfast and then there’s a speaker that speaks to these students first and I have been his speaker for many years.</span> <span id="s905">This last year was the first time that I did not speak, cause I said, “Enough is enough.”</span> <span id="s906">And little by little, I have started to speak out and have realized the importance of a survivor to speak out.</span> <span id="s907">I have realized that only through survivors can the rest of the world learn, cause we were the ones that had the experience.</span> <span id="s908">I realize that as we’re getting older, there are not going to be many that can stand up and speak out and the revisionists are doing their work now.</span> <span id="s909">I realize that there are hundreds of books that the revisionists are writing, calling us survivors liars, that it never happened.</span> <span id="s910">They’re on the internet today, with programs, teaching children that the Holocaust did not happen.</span> <span id="s911">So, I have realized the importance of all of this.</span> <span id="s912">When Washington was first in the talking stages, before there was a hole in the ground, I was asked to appear on Milt Rosenberg’s show and speak about the Holocaust and speak about the importance of the Washington Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s913">I was one of the very first to jump onto this bandwagon and have been speaking out for the Washington Holocaust Museum and about it’s importance, it’s teachings, where it brings children in from all over the country, to teach about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s914">And now that I have gotten older, my grandchildren need to know.</span> <span id="s915">Their grandchildren will need to know, as will yours and as will sti -- as will the generation that will be here after us.</span> <span id="s916">And this is one of the big reasons that I speak out today.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: I’m curious about when you first went to that first interview, the thing that sort of set you off on this road that yo -- that you’re on now, of ta -- of talking about it, was because of your son and him wanting to know what had happened to you.</span> <span id="s918">And you got a tape of that first interview made, but you said it wasn’t a very good interview.</span> <span id="s919">Have -- did you go on to have discussions or talk to him directly about what happened, or did you -- did you leave it to the tapes, you know, I mean, especially since that first one wasn’t very satisfactory.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: This is very interesting.</span> <span id="s921">When I was the keynote speaker the first time with Mayor Daly, my daughter-in-law came to listen as did some friends and family.</span> <span id="s922">My son did not.</span> <span id="s923">I think it’s too painful for him.</span> <span id="s924">That was recorded, as was the first tape.</span> <span id="s925">I’ve been on television, I’ve been in newspapers.</span> <span id="s926">And the tape from Washington, of course.</span> <span id="s927">My son has never come to listen to me speak in person.</span> <span id="s928">But he has saved every little print, everything that has been written, every tape that’s been made.</span> <span id="s929">And I expect a copy of this and he also wants it and he saves everything.</span> <span id="s930">Last year, our synagogue, where my grandchildren go to Hebrew school and Sunday school had asked me to come and speak to the class.</span> <span id="s931">This is the first that my son came to listen.</span> <span id="s932">It was like -- they gave me maybe a half hour and you speak to children and you speak different than you speak to adults, because you don’t want to send them home crying that this lady scared them and Mommy calling me the next day.</span> <span id="s933">So you speak different, but my son came with his video camera, to listen to me.</span> <span id="s934">My oldest grandson chose to sit in and listen to me.</span> <span id="s935">My youngest grandchu-son -- chose not to.</span> <span id="s936">He chose to go to his class, which he had -- which we allowed him to do.</span> <span id="s937">I was very conscious through this entire speaking time, that my son was standing there with the camera and listen to his mother relate this story.</span> <span id="s938">And we’ve talked about it.</span> <span id="s939">We’ve talked about different aspects of it.</span> <span id="s940">He’s read about it.</span> <span id="s941">He’s read Michael Beerenbaum’s book where I’ve been quoted and they’ve also sent it to my grandson for his -- for his Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s942">And of course my grandchildren -- my oldest one now is in high school and he has written about the Holocaust and he has been to Washington.</span> <span id="s943">So we do speak about it, but very little, very little.</span> <span id="s944">We don’t -- he’s watched every tape and he wants everything.</span> <span id="s945">And he puts everything away.</span> <span id="s946">“Mom, I need a copy.”</span> <span id="s947">You know?</span> <span id="s948">But, we speak about it very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: So y -- so you and your son have never sat across a table or sat in the living room or whatever, an-and --</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: He will ask questions and I will answer them, but we’ve never had this kind of a discussion, this serious kind of a discussion, you know.</span> <span id="s951">An-And it’s interesting, because when I was a -- first time I was on television and I came back and I said to him, “Well, what do you think?”</span> <span id="s952">And he says, “When did you start speaking with an accent?”</span> <span id="s953">I mean, this is what he -- you know, but we don’t go into the deep end of it.</span> <span id="s954">Like, I’m going back to Europe now and his question to me is, “Why do you want to put yourself through this?</span> <span id="s955">Why do you need to put yourself through this?”</span> <span id="s956">You know?</span> <span id="s957">And he hurts for me and he’s afraid for me.</span> <span id="s958">So, you know, it’s -- it’s hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: Once you did start speaking about it more, did the nightmares decrease in number?</span> <span id="s960">Did it have any affect on that part of your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: You know, it’s interesting, cause oftentimes I speak at group meetings and I -- for fundraising for the Washington Holocaust Museum and we get different groups of people in and they -- people analyze survivors and they’ll sit there and they’ll stare at you and they try and analyze you.</span> <span id="s962">And this particular evening, we had a group of doctors from one of the hospitals and I know I’m being analyzed.</span> <span id="s963">I mean, I just -- I can feel it.</span> <span id="s964">You don’t -- you know?</span> <span id="s965">So we were all done and we had this small discussion afterwards and -- and I don’t know one of the doctors.</span> <span id="s966">And he was asking me different questions and whatever, I don’t know how we came to it and -- and I’ve often said that probably I do need to be analyzed, cause there are many things that I -- that I cannot remember, and -- things that -- during the times of the camps.</span> <span id="s967">And I looked at him and I said, “So, you analyzed me,” I said, “so what do you think?”</span> <span id="s968">He says, “Well, I think that you live with a lot of guilts.”</span> <span id="s969">And I said, “Oh?</span> <span id="s970">Well, what kind of guilts do I live with?”</span> <span id="s971">And he said, “Well, survivors guilts.”</span> <span id="s972">He says, “You -- you feel guilty that you survived and a lot of people didn’t.”</span> <span id="s973">And when I hear that I -- I -- I get angry.</span> <span id="s974">And I said, “You know,” I said, “you are reading the wrong books.”</span> <span id="s975">I said, “I don’t have any -- I may have lots of guilts that I live with, but that is not one of them.</span> <span id="s976">I did not survive at anyone’s expense.</span> <span id="s977">I did not steal with anyone -- from anyone.</span> <span id="s978">I did not steal their food.</span> <span id="s979">I did not kill anyone.</span> <span id="s980">I was one of the lucky ones.</span> <span id="s981">If there’s one thing that I don’t live with, is the fact that I survived and others didn’t.”</span> <span id="s982">I said, “So you’ve been reading the wrong books.”</span> <span id="s983">And I’ve heard this from many people, that survivors live with the guilts that they survived and others didn’t, and maybe some of us do.</span> <span id="s984">I don’t.</span> <span id="s985">I -- that -- that’s one thing I don’t.</span> <span id="s986">I -- I -- that’s one thing that’s n -- I don’t have, is the -- the guilt that I survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: I question it.</span> <span id="s989">I question why my brothers didn’t survive.</span> <span id="s990">I ques-question that other people didn’t survive.</span> <span id="s991">I live with the guilt of sending my mother into the wrong line.</span> <span id="s992">I do not live with the guilt that I survived and others did not.</span> <span id="s993">So, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: What about the nightmares, did they go down or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: The nightmares, that was the question.</span> <span id="s996">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: It was a good answer, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: That was the question.</span> <span id="s999">I got sidetracked.</span> <span id="s1000">When I first started to speak, people told me that once I speak out, that the nightmares would go away.</span> <span id="s1001">The answer is no.</span> <span id="s1002">The nightmares have always been there and I believe the nightmares will always be there.</span> <span id="s1003">Not just for me, but for all of us that have gone this horrible route.</span> <span id="s1004">My husband always knows when I have had to speak.</span> <span id="s1005">When I did a fund-raiser when I was in a school, it just brings it all back and the pictures all there.</span> <span id="s1006">The screen is showing it all and you know, it doesn’t make it easier.</span> <span id="s1007">It doesn’t make it easier.</span> <span id="s1008">It open -- this is -- this is a wound that does not close.</span> <span id="s1009">Just because we speak about it, doesn’t make it go away, it makes it deeper.</span> <span id="s1010">But we speak about it, because we realize the importance of speaking out.</span> <span id="s1011">We know the wound is there.</span> <span id="s1012">We don’t need to open it.</span> <span id="s1013">Survivors don’t need to open it.</span> <span id="s1014">But what we’re trying to do, is prevent this from happening again.</span> <span id="s1015">And I do believe the old saying, what goes around, comes around.</span> <span id="s1016">Yesterday it was Jews.</span> <span id="s1017">Today, they’re fighting over other things, religion, in other parts of the world.</span> <span id="s1018">Tomorrow it might be blue eyed people, or a different ethnic group.</span> <span id="s1019">But it does -- the wheel turns, it does go around.</span> <span id="s1020">And if we don’t speak out and if we don’t teach and if we don’t show a -- what a gun can do and if we don’t show what hatred can do, what bigotry can do, what racism can do -- then we need to live with -- with fear, with hate, all our lives.</span> <span id="s1021">We need to teach our children.</span> <span id="s1022">Our children are not born with hatred, we teach hatred.</span> <span id="s1023">I don’t like you because you’re blue eyed or because you’re black or because you’re Jewish or because you’re Christian.</span> <span id="s1024">I teach you, my child, to hate instead of si -- teaching them nice things, do I need to teach them to hate?</span> <span id="s1025">When I go into a school -- when I go into a school, I ask these children, how many of you are guilty of tormenting someone because they’re too fat or too skinny or too blonde or they don’t meet some of your quali-qualifications?</span> <span id="s1026">They don’t speak the way you think they should speak?</span> <span id="s1027">What makes you the judge?</span> <span id="s1028">What makes you different?</span> <span id="s1029">Why do you think that you can sit in judgment of me?</span> <span id="s1030">How many of you children have been guilty of this?</span> <span id="s1031">Of tormenting another child?</span> <span id="s1032">You’d be surprised how many sit there and shake their hands.</span> <span id="s1033">They know.</span> <span id="s1034">They know.</span> <span id="s1035">But maybe I can touch a nerve.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: How do you feel about -- I know that in -- you said you’ve gone back to Europe, how do you feel about Germany and Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: When I go back to Germany, my skin crawls.</span> <span id="s1038">When I look at the old Germans, I wonder where they were and what they did during that particular time.</span> <span id="s1039">But that doesn’t mean that I hate the young Germans or the young people.</span> <span id="s1040">They are not the guilty ones, they didn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1041">But I think that every one of them and the Polish people and all the other people in the world that didn’t help -- we need to remember that there were 12 million people killed during that time.</span> <span id="s1042">A million and a half babies.</span> <span id="s1043">Babies, okay?</span> <span id="s1044">Somebody did it.</span> <span id="s1045">Somebody’s father did it, somebody’s grandfather did it.</span> <span id="s1046">And I want to question the young people, “Do you know what your father or your grandfather did during the time of the war?”</span> <span id="s1047">But that doesn’t mean that the young person of today is guilty of what their father or their grandfather did.</span> <span id="s1048">But the country itself, or Poland itself, just because it is Germany and just because it is Poland and just because this is where all the horrible atrocities were taking place, make my skin crawl.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: When -- on trips back, you -- so you have been in Germany?</span> <span id="s1050">[indecipherable] ever been for any length of time or just for a day or two, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: Have to tell you one story.</span> <span id="s1052">Several years ago, very first time I went back to Germany and Austria, I went back on business.</span> <span id="s1053">And I traveled with a young woman who was very blonde and very bu -- blue eyed and very Christian.</span> <span id="s1054">She -- I am the Jew and she was the Christian person that I was working with at the time and we went back to Germany.</span> <span id="s1055">And, when we flew into Germany -- we were taking a train -- we decided to take a train from Munich to wherever we were going.</span> <span id="s1056">And we got on the train and we came into this compartment and it was winter and pe -- we put down our luggage -- we were the only two people in the compartment, and we closed the door.</span> <span id="s1057">And we -- it was cold and we walked into this -- to this warm compartment and both of us started to doze.</span> <span id="s1058">Next thing we knew, the door opened and it was the conductor asking for passports, in German.</span> <span id="s1059">And Kay, who was my friend that I traveled with, took out her passport and handed her passport and I froze.</span> <span id="s1060">I totally froze.</span> <span id="s1061">I am this Jewish girl that is back on this train, seeing this conductor coming at me, in German, asking for my passport.</span> <span id="s1062">And he kept going, “Passport, fraulein,” and I kept staring at him.</span> <span id="s1063">Finally, Kay, went with her elbow at me, “Fritzie, show him your passport.”</span> <span id="s1064">And I got there -- that far, I have to have one, right?</span> <span id="s1065">She finally realized what happened and she reached into my purse and she took out my passport and if I tell you this conductor studied me and studied this passport for a good three minutes, cause I don’t think he understood what happened.</span> <span id="s1066">He left.</span> <span id="s1067">Kay handed me back the passport and I started to cry.</span> <span id="s1068">And she looked at me and she said, “Well, why?”</span> <span id="s1069">And I said, “I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1070">But took me back to another time, in another place, on another train.</span> <span id="s1071">And it just totally took me back.”</span> <span id="s1072">And I been back since, and I’ve been back to Poland since, and I feel very uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s1073">But I want to tell you that that pwa -- passport is going to stay with me, because that was our lifeline during the time when we needed it and couldn’t get it, that would have been our lifeline.</span> <span id="s1074">And I feel very uncomfortable being in those countries, cause I’m not sure I’m loved, as a Jew.</span> <span id="s1075">But I’ll never forget that first time going back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: Is that when this incident on the train happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: The first time I went back.</span> <span id="s1078">When the Washington Museum opened -- I don’t know if you’ve been there, but they have a boxcar that took children to a concentration camp, that the Polish people sent to Washington and one needs to walk through the boxcar to go through the museum.</span> <span id="s1079">You can walk around it, but one really should walk into this boxcar and walk through it.</span> <span id="s1080">And the very first time, after the museum opened, I couldn’t walk into it.</span> <span id="s1081">I could not walk into this boxcar.</span> <span id="s1082">And Maggie Daly, Mayor Daly’s wife, walked with me and held my hand and took me through this boxcar.</span> <span id="s1083">And I often tell students that go to Washington, that when they stand in that boxcar, if they stand very quietly, they will hear voices.</span> <span id="s1084">Voices of children that were taken to their death in that boxcar.</span> <span id="s1085">I think the turning of the wheels and the trains will always have a certain fear, a certain reminder to all of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: Let’s change sub-subjects a bit.</span> <span id="s1087">I wanted to ask you how you met your husband.</span> <span id="s1088">Let’s talk about something more pleasant for awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1090">I have to tell you about my husband, first of all.</span> <span id="s1091">How well do you know your World War Two history?</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: Oh, it’s -- for somebody my age, it’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: My husband is American born, was a Marine on Wake Island during the war.</span> <span id="s1094">My husband was taken prisoner on Wake Island and was a Japanese prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s1095">So he had his own horror stories to tell.</span> <span id="s1096">My husband’s a decorated soldier and -- and he’s very proud of this, as he well should be.</span> <span id="s1097">But he always -- he was always able to speak about his experiences and he always told our son about the horrors and what -- and -- and we went back to reunions with his group and there are just really a handful of them left, that fought on Wake Island and they’re a very brave, wonderful group of people that defended Wake Island.</span> <span id="s1098">When I first came to this country, after I lived with my aunt for awhile, I shared an apartment with a friend of mine who had friends that were Hungarian people.</span> <span id="s1099">They came here prior to the war, Hungarian Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1100">And she took me -- these friends of hers owned a small grocery store and she took me to visit them, her friends, and -- in the grocery store.</span> <span id="s1101">And, while I was in the grocery store, my husband, who at that time -- whom I didn’t know at the time, and his mother, walked in.</span> <span id="s1102">They -- they were next door neighbors and they walked into the grocery store.</span> <span id="s1103">And we started to talk and my mother-in-law, who became my mother-in-law later on, looked at me and said, “You’re going to be my daughter-in-law.”</span> <span id="s1104">It was like a premonition, but I -- I met him in a grocery store.</span> <span id="s1105">You know, so it’s a funny story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: What’s his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: Norman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: Norman?</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: Fritzshall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1111">And when -- what year was it you met him, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: I met him in -- in ‘48.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: So you had been here maybe two years, I guess, when you met?</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1115">Right.</span> <span id="s1116">But he always had his own story.</span> <span id="s1117">And I honestly think that the fact that he was a prisoner and he had the hard life that he had, he knew how to cope with me and my life and my nightmares.</span> <span id="s1118">And I must say that he has supported me from day one.</span> <span id="s1119">With the Washington Holocaust Museum, with my going with the fundraising, with the Skokie Holocaust Museum, where I’m also active and with the schools and he helps me and supports me in everything I do, so it’s been -- it’s been -- made life easier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: When -- when you and he first got -- when you met and when you got married, was -- were you already in the period where you were no longer -- basically, you were no longer speaking about what had happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1122">I did not speak about it at all, during that time.</span> <span id="s1123">Actually, we did -- we didn’t discuss it until -- well, he and I did, you know, but not publicly, I didn’t, or with anyone else.</span> <span id="s1124">I mean, I never denied it to him.</span> <span id="s1125">But, as far as speaking out publicly, I didn’t, until actually our first grandson was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: But -- but you -- I’m j -- I’m just -- want to know, did you speak much about it -- talk about what had happened to you with him much, or it was just, he knew you were a survivor, you’ve had it -- you sort of had this understanding that that was true, but you didn’t talk about it much?</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s1128">We did not -- we did not go into a deep discussions.</span> <span id="s1129">He did know I was a survivor.</span> <span id="s1130">He did know I was in Auschwitz camp.</span> <span id="s1131">If he would ask me a question, I would answer it, but we did not go in -- into any deep discussions about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: And what about his own wartime experiences?</span> <span id="s1133">Was it -- was it the same way with him?</span> <span id="s1134">Did he not speak much about what happened to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: His wartime experiences, he always spoke about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q: He did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">A: And his wartime experiences should be recorded and one day they should -- there -- there’s a book written, but they should record these experiences, cause they really just -- there are just a handful of survivors and they had their own horror stories.</span> <span id="s1138">They were the ones that worked in the coal mines and they are the ones that built the River Kwai and -- and -- that you saw in the -- and had their own bloodshed and had their own hardships.</span> <span id="s1139">So, their stories are hard stories and they’re history and they should be recorded.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: You mentioned that you have a son, is that your only child?</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: And his name is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: Steven.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: And then hi -- your grandchildren?</span> <span id="s1145">Their names, ages --</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: We have two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: -- all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: We have two grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1149">Our older one is Scott.</span> <span id="s1150">And Scott is 15, he’s second year high school and our younger one is Andrew and Andrew is 11 and he’s in sixth grade.</span> <span id="s1151">So, it’s kind of neat.</span> <span id="s1152">They’re neat kids and I love them much.</span> <span id="s1153">And they’re -- they’re just wonderful.</span> <span id="s1154">These are -- these are the dividends and the pleasures and I often look at them and I often wonder -- I look at them often, and I say -- especially when they were younger, the innocence of children and here Hitler went and killed all of this innocence and -- and -- and killed all of these children that had so much to live for and so much to give and so much to teach.</span> <span id="s1155">And -- and God only knows what they would have been and he took these lives, these -- these innocent lives.</span> <span id="s1156">And I often look at my grandson of 15 and I say, “God -- I hope to God the test never comes, but -- could he, would he have survived?”</span> <span id="s1157">America teaches different than Europe did, we had a different kind of life, although I too, came from a pampered home, so you can’t judge it that way.</span> <span id="s1158">But the strength -- one doesn’t know until one is tested.</span> <span id="s1159">I really believe that one needs to be tested to find one’s strength, cause we don’t know what we’re capable of.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: Have you been to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: No.</span> <span id="s1162">One day.</span> <span id="s1163">My dream.</span> <span id="s1164">One day.</span> <span id="s1165">We were going to go last year, but my husband wasn’t well enough to travel.</span> <span id="s1166">But we will.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: That time that your father said to you, “Okay, when do you want to go to Israel?”</span> <span id="s1168">And then you said, “Well, maybe I’ll stick around here for awhile.”</span> <span id="s1169">Was that -- did that end your feeling?</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: What it -- what it ended was -- no, what I discovered at that time was that I really did want to stay here, that I love this country.</span> <span id="s1171">This is my country and I love it.</span> <span id="s1172">But Israel is home to the Jews, as you well know and someday I really do want to go there and -- and -- and feel the freedom of Israel, feel the freedom of what it’s like to walk down the street where -- where your people are and you don’t have to watch your back because of your religion.</span> <span id="s1173">And I need to do this and I will do this.</span> <span id="s1174">But there’s a different feeling for Israel than there is for this country.</span> <span id="s1175">This is my country, with it’s faults.</span> <span id="s1176">Israel is my home as a Jew.</span> <span id="s1177">Does that make sense?</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: As a Jew, I -- I feel Israel is my home, but this is my country, where I live, that I love.</span> <span id="s1180">And yes I am a flag waver, but -- but Israel is, to all Jews I think, home.</span> <span id="s1181">I -- I honestly believe and -- if we had an Israel during that time -- during the time of the Holocaust, this would not have happened.</span> <span id="s1182">Millions of people would have been saved, if we had an Israel.</span> <span id="s1183">But we didn’t.</span> <span id="s1184">We had to fight for it and we have to fight to keep it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: Was your family in Europe very political in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: I don’t remember them as being political.</span> <span id="s1187">I don’t remember any politics being discussed.</span> <span id="s1188">I remember the whispers when Hitler was going to occupy us.</span> <span id="s1189">I remember the fear of Hitler, because we’d begun to know that a lot of Jews were being taken away from their homes.</span> <span id="s1190">We didn’t know where they were being taken to, but we knew they were -- a lot of homes were already being taken from them and they were put into ghettos.</span> <span id="s1191">We know about the -- the Jews that were sent ba -- o -- back over to Poland.</span> <span id="s1192">When Hitler came into power, the Jews that came -- that immigrated to Germany from Poland, to make a better life for themselves.</span> <span id="s1193">They fought for Germany, they became Germans.</span> <span id="s1194">They -- they considered themselves German first, Jews second.</span> <span id="s1195">Everything was taken away from them and sent over the border, and we knew this.</span> <span id="s1196">But, politically, as far as fear, yes.</span> <span id="s1197">But I don’t remember as a child, any politics being discussed in our home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: I was wondering if maybe, you know, yo -- cause you -- you came out of the war with such a strong feeling about going to Israel and about Israel, I was wondering perhaps if, you know, there was any --</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: -- you know, the Zionist trend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: Well -- well, you need to remember one thing that we didn’t discuss, so you can’t remember it.</span> <span id="s1202">I came -- I was raised as an Orthodox child, I came from an Orthodox home.</span> <span id="s1203">I remember my grandfather saying his prayers twice a day.</span> <span id="s1204">I remember -- there’s a Jewish word, it’s -- it’s -- I don’t know what they call tefillimin and it’s a parchment that the Jews use for --</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: Tefillin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: Tefillin -- in -- in saying their prayers.</span> <span id="s1207">I remember all of this.</span> <span id="s1208">We kept a kosher home, we went to synagogue.</span> <span id="s1209">The synagogue I went to, the women had to sit upstairs, separated from their men, so I was raised in a strict, Orthodox home.</span> <span id="s1210">And it was always someday Israel, you know?</span> <span id="s1211">It wasn’t called Israel at the time, but -- but it -- this wa -- End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Fritzie Fritzshall.</span> <span id="s1213">This is tape number three, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: -- saying their prayers.</span> <span id="s1215">I remember all of this.</span> <span id="s1216">We kept a kosher home, we went to synagogue.</span> <span id="s1217">The synagogue I went to, the women had to sit upstairs, separated from their men, so I was raised in a strict, Orthodox home.</span> <span id="s1218">And it was always someday Israel, you know?</span> <span id="s1219">It wasn’t called Israel at the time, but -- but it -- this was always that someday -- this is how the prayer ends, that -- or maybe it begins, I real-really don’t know, but it’s -- was always with someday, next year in Israel or next year in Palestine.</span> <span id="s1220">So, we knew.</span> <span id="s1221">I was raised with this, okay?</span> <span id="s1222">And especially after the war, especially after the war, when the Jews were being persecuted.</span> <span id="s1223">Where was I going to go to have this freedom if not Israel, if not Palestine?</span> <span id="s1224">So it was always there.</span> <span id="s1225">Plus, I -- I was this young person and I knew that it was hard to get into Israel, we’d have to fight our way in and I -- I wanted to fight for it.</span> <span id="s1226">This was going to be my home and this -- I wanted this freedom.</span> <span id="s1227">I wanted to fight for their freedom.</span> <span id="s1228">I would go fight for it today if I weren’t too old.</span> <span id="s1229">But -- so Israel was always part of my Jewish upbringing and part of my religion.</span> <span id="s1230">You know, and my strong feelings are still there for Israel.</span> <span id="s1231">I mean, I may be an American, but I am a Jew.</span> <span id="s1232">An American Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: Did -- after you got married, did you -- did you work?</span> <span id="s1234">Have you -- you know, have you had a -- a career?</span> <span id="s1235">Did you stay home and raise a child?</span> <span id="s1236">How did -- what’d you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: I worked prior to being married.</span> <span id="s1238">I worked after I was married.</span> <span id="s1239">I worked til I was in my seventh month for my son.</span> <span id="s1240">Then I stayed home til he was almost nine years old.</span> <span id="s1241">I was a home Mommy and then I went back to work and I work to this day.</span> <span id="s1242">I need to work for my brain, for myself, for -- and I also consider my volunteer work that I do as part of my work.</span> <span id="s1243">I work in a soup kitchen in Evanston.</span> <span id="s1244">On Tuesdays I serve lunch at a church, it’s a black church.</span> <span id="s1245">And I go and do that on Tuesdays.</span> <span id="s1246">I help with the fundraising and -- for the Holocaust Museum in Washington.</span> <span id="s1247">I am on the board in the Skokie Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s1248">I go into the schools and this is part of my giving back.</span> <span id="s1249">This is my way of saying, “Thank you, God,” and I am giving back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: I’m -- I’m wondering, if it’s possible to say, how mu -- I mean just as you, you know, go through your life now -- you know, this is -- what happened to you, happened 50 years ago -- if there’s any way to -- to know it or figure it out, just as you go through your normal routine of the day, with nothing special happening.</span> <span id="s1251">No special reminders, you know, in the air or the newspaper or in a conversation or whatever, about the Holocaust or any of that.</span> <span id="s1252">When none of that is just in the atmosphere, I’m wondering how often you might think of it?</span> <span id="s1253">Whether on just a regular day, any thoughts of that pass through your mind, or are there long stretches where you don’t think of it any more?</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: Every single day and I believe for as long as I will live, it will be every single day, I miss not having a family -- extended family.</span> <span id="s1255">I miss when the holidays come, not having my extended family with me.</span> <span id="s1256">I miss not having a brother.</span> <span id="s1257">I am an only child.</span> <span id="s1258">If you’re an only child when you’re born an only child, I think it’s different than when you had siblings and they’re not there.</span> <span id="s1259">They tell us that one misses their mother more as they get older and I’m here to tell you it’s so.</span> <span id="s1260">I miss not having a mother.</span> <span id="s1261">I am very sorry that she’s not here to see her grandchild or her great-grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1262">I think she would have been very proud of all of them, cause they’re wonderful human beings.</span> <span id="s1263">I think my father missed his family terribly.</span> <span id="s1264">I sometimes look at a family, a whole family, with generations and I envy them.</span> <span id="s1265">I on -- don’t envy their wealth, I don’t envy anything that other people have, but I envy their extended family.</span> <span id="s1266">I miss going to a doctor and not having history to tell.</span> <span id="s1267">I miss for my grandchildren, not knowing a grandparent.</span> <span id="s1268">I miss a life I had and I often dream that I really have it.</span> <span id="s1269">These are things that we will never have.</span> <span id="s1270">These are things that have been taken away from us, that other people have and have had.</span> <span id="s1271">And why was it taken away from us?</span> <span id="s1272">Simply because we were born a Jew.</span> <span id="s1273">Not because we committed a crime.</span> <span id="s1274">We don’t look any different from other people.</span> <span id="s1275">We don’t feel any different from other people.</span> <span id="s1276">Yes, I go to a synagogue and you go to a church, but am I so different from you?</span> <span id="s1277">I miss the same things that you have and that you have had and I don’t have.</span> <span id="s1278">And I miss them every day and I think about them every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: Well, I’m sort of out of questions.</span> <span id="s1280">Is there anything that you’d like to add, that we haven’t talked about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1282">I can’t think now.</span> <span id="s1283">Probably when you walk away, I will.</span> <span id="s1284">But I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1285">I don’t know, it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: You know, I’ve done several of these interviews with people and there’s -- I always come away from them, you know, that it’s -- it’s impossible to talk to anybody who -- who lived through any part of this, you know, and I’ve ju -- some of the people I’ve talked to were never in concentration camps, managed to escape getting put in them or whatever.</span> <span id="s1287">But it’s impossible to have any of these conversations without feeling how much -- you know, what a depth of emotion is inside, you know, is constantly with the people who -- who live through this.</span> <span id="s1288">That’s -- that’s what I always walk away, sort of -- you know, whatever the specifics are, that’s the -- that’s the thing that sort of sticks with me the longest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: I think -- there are also several reasons for this.</span> <span id="s1290">When one loses a parent -- it is normal for a child to lose a parent, one has a cemetery.</span> <span id="s1291">I know I have comfort, because my father is buried in a cemetery here and I can go and I can visit.</span> <span id="s1292">Those of us that watched our families killed in Europe, we don’t know -- we don’t have -- we can’t visit.</span> <span id="s1293">They’re scattered.</span> <span id="s1294">When you watch babies walking towards a gas chamber, when you watch religious people walking towards a gas chamber as they are praying still to God when they’re walking towards the gas chamber, when you watch someone dig a grave and then you see them shot and fall into the grave they have dug for themselves, when you watch innocent blood spilled, there’s a hole that there’s no cover on.</span> <span id="s1295">The cover will not fit, the hole doesn’t close.</span> <span id="s1296">You live with it.</span> <span id="s1297">It’s like an ulcer that eats away at you.</span> <span id="s1298">Some of us handle it better.</span> <span id="s1299">Some of us live with it easier, but the wound is always there.</span> <span id="s1300">Maybe if we had seen a normal death, which, we expect a normal death, we would get over it.</span> <span id="s1301">But this was -- there was nothing normal about his war.</span> <span id="s1302">There was nothing normal about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1303">We cannot forget.</span> <span id="s1304">We cannot forgive for those people that have done it and we must never forget of what has been done to the Jews, to the Gypsies, to the innocent people that got caught during the time of the war.</span> <span id="s1305">But we must re -- also remember, that maybe a lot of people would have been put in danger, had they helped.</span> <span id="s1306">They could have helped.</span> <span id="s1307">We must honor the people that helped.</span> <span id="s1308">We must honor the righteous.</span> <span id="s1309">They were the ones that stood up and said, “This is wrong, we will help.”</span> <span id="s1310">We must always remember those people that did stand up and did help.</span> <span id="s1311">Unfortunately, there are not many of them.</span> <span id="s1312">Israel has honored them, Israel has planted trees for them.</span> <span id="s1313">The forests are not overgrowing with trees.</span> <span id="s1314">We have an Avenue of the Righteous in Evanston.</span> <span id="s1315">It’s not overgrowing with trees, but there were the few, there were the Schindlers, but not enough.</span> <span id="s1316">And so I honor those people and I teach about those people.</span> <span id="s1317">But we can never forgive and we can never forget, for the ones that did not help, that ni -- that did not stand up, that turned in the Jews, when they didn’t need to.</span> <span id="s1318">They didn’t benefit by it, other than taking our possessions.</span> <span id="s1319">Is it worth to give a life for possessions?</span> <span id="s1320">I hope that the ones that are still living, that committed the crimes, I hope that they think about what they did.</span> <span id="s1321">I hope they live with it every single day, in their minds.</span> <span id="s1322">I hope they can see the bloodshed that was done and not forget.</span> <span id="s1323">And I hope we can all learn from the past.</span> <span id="s1324">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Q: Actually, I had one more question, if you don’t mind me asking.</span> <span id="s1326">That was a great place to end, but there was something.</span> <span id="s1327">You triggered something in my mind, which was, in your video interview, you mentioned every day having to run, in front of Dr. Mengele or Dr. Mengele’s lieutenants.</span> <span id="s1328">And -- you know, off and on, through the years, there were stories, possible sightings of him, you know, people searching for Mengele.</span> <span id="s1329">It was maybe -- what was it, maybe 10 years ago or 15 years ago, where supposedly they found these bones in -- where was it, Paraguay, I think, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: Paraguay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Q: Yeah, and some of that was happening, I believe, during the period where you were being silent about your experiences in the Holocaust and when that -- when -- when you would -- did you ever encounter these stories in the news or whatever and I’m ju -- I just was curious --</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">A: About Dr. Mengele?</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Q: Yeah, about him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A: About the death of Dr. Mengele or what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: Or before that, you know, it was like, where is he?</span> <span id="s1336">There were -- you know, every once in awhile there’d be a story that oh, he was seen in Brazil or he was possibly in this place, there were people hunting for him.</span> <span id="s1337">I mean, I was just curious whether --</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: People hunting for him and people hiding him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: And there are many others that are being hidden in Paraguay and other places.</span> <span id="s1341">And it’s amazing, because they are le -- still living in freedom.</span> <span id="s1342">I mean, some of them might be older now, but I -- I do believe that they need to pay for their crimes.</span> <span id="s1343">Dr. Mengele, I believe -- I’m not sure that there has been proof that those were -- that he died and all of that.</span> <span id="s1344">I would have loved to have seen him taken alive.</span> <span id="s1345">It would have been a great day if they had taken him alive and if he could have paid a little bit for some of the crimes that he committed, some of the experiments that he did, some of the atrocities that -- that have come out that he has done.</span> <span id="s1346">But, unfortunately he died without -- without -- okay, so he dow -- died in drowning, but big deal, you know?</span> <span id="s1347">He should have felt some of -- of the pain that he caused for so many, many hundreds of pe -- of people, you know?</span> <span id="s1348">But yeah, he -- he -- Dr. Mengele was one of the doctors that did the selection and -- in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1349">And he did the experiments on pregnant women and -- and he did a lot of the experiments without drugs and -- and so forth.</span> <span id="s1350">He was one of the doctors and -- with his entourage that would -- would have selections in the morning.</span> <span id="s1351">We would have to get undressed and not walk, but run in front of him.</span> <span id="s1352">But we knew there was going to be a selection and oftentimes when our hair started to grow back and -- and then somebody’s hair would be gray, we would take dirt and rub it into that person’s head and hair -- to try and cover the gray hair so they looked younger.</span> <span id="s1353">We would try and pinch cheeks to show that they -- we still had a little color in our face, that we didn’t look so pale and dead, even though we were hungry and hardly had any strength.</span> <span id="s1354">But let me tell you, strength came from somewheres when there were selections, because not -- we did not walk, we ran in front of them -- Dr. Mengele, as he stood there with his entourage, with his stick and -- and pointing one way or another.</span> <span id="s1355">And some went into one line and some into another.</span> <span id="s1356">One never knew which was the good line.</span> <span id="s1357">One -- one line went directly to the gas chambers, while the other line walked back into the barracks.</span> <span id="s1358">But he was one of the -- one of the big players in -- in Auschwitz and -- and I’m really sorry that he didn’t stand trial and didn’t pay for his crime.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: I’m curious about -- about you, though and whether these stories or mentions of him in the news or whatever, would --</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: Well, every time -- actually, every time we did hear about him and -- and it brought back memories.</span> <span id="s1361">Just the name itself, you know, Dr. Mengele, my God, you know, you can visualize this man standing there with his gloves and his -- and his stick in his hand.</span> <span id="s1362">I mean, I can just see him in front of me.</span> <span id="s1363">And the prayer was always there, please catch him, please get him.</span> <span id="s1364">And I know they’ve gotten close to getting him [indecipherable] but you know -- and then, it hurt when -- when I heard and read afterwards -- read afterwards that his son visited him.</span> <span id="s1365">He had a son who -- who knew where he was and his son visited him and -- and all of that.</span> <span id="s1366">And I kept saying, “Sure, he,” you know, “he’s -- he’s still living a good life and look what he did to all the other people.”</span> <span id="s1367">But there are many of them that are still living, you know, and denying, and -- [knocking] It’s open.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q: Well, we were sort of at the end of our interview anyway, so now that the plumber is here to -- which sink is it that he’s looking at?</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A: Bathroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: Oh, okay.</span> <span id="s1371">So he’s here to fix the sink in the bathroom.</span> <span id="s1372">Life goes on, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A: Life goes on.</span> <span id="s1374">Luckily, I have two bathrooms, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: Well listen, thanks for taking -- taking this time out to do this interview with us, it’s very nice of you to do that.</span> <span id="s1376">This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Fritzie
