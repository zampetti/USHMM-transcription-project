<p><span id="s6">A: I’ve got a Jewish name, but I was told about it.</span> <span id="s7">It has never been used, as is usually the case.</span> <span id="s8">It was Leah Tova.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: And what was ‘Smith’ in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: That’s my married name.</span> <span id="s11">My maiden name was Kreisler.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: And when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: In June, 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: What town and country were you born in?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A; Krakow, Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q; Could you tell me your parents’ names, your grandparents’, your great-grandparents?</span> <span id="s17">How far back can you trace your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: My grandparents, yes.</span> <span id="s19">My mother was from Tarnhof and my father from Krakow.</span> <span id="s20">His name was Heinrich and his father’s name was Mauritz -- Morris.</span> <span id="s21">Those were the Kreislers.</span> <span id="s22">My mother’s family was Grunhut.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: What were your parents’ occupations?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: My father was a chemist and he had a small factory, that he produced ink for printers.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: And this was in Krakow?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: This was in Krakow.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q; Did you have brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: You were an only child.</span> <span id="s30">Was this a business he had founded himself?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s32">His father had a shop where he was selling paint.</span> <span id="s33">At that time it was not in cans, but a powder.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Did your father make some discovery himself on how to make the printing inks?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: He had some problems with it, because he was such a good discoverer, that he was discovering or rediscovering each time, and he was not too good in keeping once discovered colors!</span> <span id="s36">(Laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: But he did make a living.</span> <span id="s38">What languages were spoken in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Can you describe what your home was like?</span> <span id="s41">How you observed the holidays, what kind of neighborhood you lived in, things like that.</span> <span id="s42">I realize that I’m asking you to think back to when you were very small.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: We were quite assimilated Poles, and I did not know I was Jewish ‘til war started.</span> <span id="s44">I didn’t know there were Catholics or Jews.</span> <span id="s45">It was not mentioned.</span> <span id="s46">But I knew there were holidays, and that was mostly my uncle, my mother’s brother, took me to Temple a few times.</span> <span id="s47">But I still didn’t connect it, that there was anything specific.</span> <span id="s48">It was rather that it was entertaining.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: So then you hadn’t really started school yet when the Germans came into Poland in 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: No, I started when they did come to Poland.</span> <span id="s51">That was the year I was supposed to start.</span> <span id="s52">And I went for one month before I was told not to come any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Can you describe what happened then?</span> <span id="s54">When the Germans came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: I had to stop going to school and I couldn’t go to public parks any more, but it wasn’t terrible at the time.</span> <span id="s56">We went on foot on the river Vistula or some other places, and kind of found alternate places, and played on the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Did you have a boat on the Vistula, or were there boats you could rent?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: No, not on a boat.</span> <span id="s59">We used to go walking, like along the Mississippi.</span> <span id="s60">The same way.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: And you and your mother would go.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Usually it was not my mother.</span> <span id="s63">She still had a kind of maid.</span> <span id="s64">Actually it was at that time that I began to hear that there were German Jews -- this was a little bit before the Germans came to Poland --German Jews started to come to Poland.</span> <span id="s65">And there was a German woman who was employed by several women to take children for a walk.</span> <span id="s66">So she was going with me, and several other children, to take us someplace, like the river, the Vistula.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Would you like to just tell me the story instead of my asking you questions?</span> <span id="s68">I think chronologically, step-by-step, you would like to tell me what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Gradually, somehow, I don’t know how it happened that I started to get this Jewish conscience, but of course during the war, it was quite clear.</span> <span id="s70">I was tol I couldn’t go to school; because I was Jewish, and so it was more and more clear to me that I was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Did you have to wear the yellow star?</span> <span id="s72">Any kind of mark on your clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: No, not yet.</span> <span id="s74">At that time, it was not ordered right away.</span> <span id="s75">And besides, I was under ten, and that was for only ten years and older children.</span> <span id="s76">So we stayed in Krakow for about a year.</span> <span id="s77">My father went to Lemberg and stayed there for a while, it was Russian, and my mother decided to go back to Tarnhof, where she was from.</span> <span id="s78">And meantime, Poles who claimed to be German -- they were not Volksdeutsch, but Stamdeutsch, something in between, or even fake -- occupied our apartment and told my mother to go out.</span> <span id="s79">And this was at the time my mother wanted out anyhow.</span> <span id="s80">I was already in Tarnhof.</span> <span id="s81">But they came and took the apartment, and she couldn’t take any furniture or anything So she also came to Tarnhof.</span> <span id="s82">My mother had half the house, that she had with her sister, and her sister left the apartment and rented a room for herself in another apartment and let us live in this apartment.</span> <span id="s83">It was a one bedroom apartment.</span> <span id="s84">And then we stayed there.</span> <span id="s85">It was maybe another year or so.</span> <span id="s86">I’m not quite clear about it, it blends with time.</span> <span id="s87">And then it started, during that time, that things got worse.</span> <span id="s88">There was action started, even before ghettos.</span> <span id="s89">And my mother had two uncles, who were brothers of her father, who were much younger than her father, so they were practically like her cousins, almost her age, and they had children, wives, and one day Germans came and both of them were killed, shot in the street.</span> <span id="s90">One of them had a son who was just after Bar Mitzvah and the son was taken separately away and then the wife.</span> <span id="s91">We were told that we are going to have to go to ghetto, and they had this apartment already redecorated, but the whole family was taken even before ghetto was created.</span> <span id="s92">So we ended up in that apartment, with a million other people.</span> <span id="s93">But before that happened, we were hiding.</span> <span id="s94">My mother told me, not a long time ago.</span> <span id="s95">Why she did what she did.</span> <span id="s96">There were posters, you have to come here and here at that time---</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: You mean that put posters up on the walls?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s99">And make an appearance at a designated place.</span> <span id="s100">Well, she never did.</span> <span id="s101">She just didn’t go.</span> <span id="s102">She said that there was another cousin, her mother’s sister’s son, who lived in Lemberg, with whom she didn’t have much contact, and suddenly, quite unexpectedly.</span> <span id="s103">He sent her a postcard, saying, “ Do not trust Germans, and don’t do what they say to do.”</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: And that postcard got through?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: That postcard got to her, and she decided to follow that.</span> <span id="s106">He himself didn’t survive.</span> <span id="s107">We never heard what happened to him.</span> <span id="s108">His brother did survive.</span> <span id="s109">But my mother always hid.</span> <span id="s110">Whenever there was any sign of an action, whenever anything was starting, we were always hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Where were you hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: The first time it was in the attic, in our house.</span> <span id="s113">We were also lucky.</span> <span id="s114">There was a Ukrainian who was assigned by Germans to administer this house that was ours and who was a very decent person.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: This was the house in Krakow or Tarnhof?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: In Tarnhof.</span> <span id="s117">So he stayed downstairs.</span> <span id="s118">He was studying German there and he stayed in our apartment.</span> <span id="s119">Apparently they were ordered to go up to the attic, and he said, “ Oh, as far as I know, no one is there.”</span> <span id="s120">He helped us, that we sell our ties.</span> <span id="s121">And then one of my mother’s uncles was shot in the store, and another time we were hiding in this store.</span> <span id="s122">And then we went to ghetto, and even in ghetto, we were hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Where were you hiding there?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: There was a man, an engineer, who made it.</span> <span id="s125">There was a cave for coal under this house, not really a basement, and he covered the door.</span> <span id="s126">He put bricks so it was absolutely impossible to see that there was a door ever, and left only a small passage underneath, and one could go just on the belly, crawl under.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: You’re a very small person, even now.</span> <span id="s128">Is your mother also a very small person?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: No, she is about maybe like you.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Five-two.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Maybe even somewhat taller.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: And so you’d just crawl underneath whenever the Germans were coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: Right.</span> <span id="s134">So we were crawling, and then we were pushing a crate, to cover this passage underneath.</span> <span id="s135">And somehow, they never found us.</span> <span id="s136">So we were there a few times, and sometimes it lasted several days.</span> <span id="s137">There were babies that were drugged that they wouldn’t cry.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: You mean there was a group of you that were hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: There were people from the house, many.</span> <span id="s140">But not everyone succeeded.</span> <span id="s141">For example, the man who made it, could never use it, because he was caught on the way there.</span> <span id="s142">But he never told anyone about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Do you remember how many of you would be hiding there all t the same time?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Maybe twenty.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: And you had food supplies in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s147">We took with us some, but of course it wouldn’t be much.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: And how did you know when to come out?</span> <span id="s149">Did you just not hear any more noise?</span> <span id="s150">Did somebody go out to look?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Right.</span> <span id="s152">Eventually my father, who was in Lemberg, he bought there false document -- a real document of some Poles -- a Catholic certificate of baptism.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: For you and your mother, and for himself?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Right.</span> <span id="s155">And for himself.</span> <span id="s156">He had from a different family.</span> <span id="s157">But I and my mother had the same name.</span> <span id="s158">And he sent them to us.</span> <span id="s159">But before that he took me out of ghetto through someone, so I stayed with some Polish family in Krakow for about six weeks and that was just after one action.</span> <span id="s160">They were supposed to have me there, and they were waiting for money, and that was my more hungry time in my life, because they had several small children, they both worked, and they went to work at six o’clock in the morning or so, without leaving any food.</span> <span id="s161">And they were coming back in the evening, and cooked some watery soup with some potatoes in it.</span> <span id="s162">So I was really very, very hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Was this a Jewish family?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: No, it was gentile.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: You mean the food was in such short supply that this was all they had to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: I assume so, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: And so you were with them for six weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: I don’t know exactly.</span> <span id="s169">Later on we, with those cards, when we were pretending that we were gentile, we were getting more to eat.</span> <span id="s170">We were never that hungry, as I was with these people, and they both worked, so I really don’t know what was the situation, why it was that bad.</span> <span id="s171">But my father sent my cousin, who was only 18 at the time -- he was an only son of his sister -- with money, and it was a great mistake.</span> <span id="s172">I don’t know why he did it.</span> <span id="s173">My cousin went out and bought some bread because he was so hungry, but he also went with this man who had the crazy idea to buy some gold, to sell to a gypsy.</span> <span id="s174">They were caught by Germans, and I was promptly sent back to ghetto.</span> <span id="s175">As it turned out, just the six weeks there was no action.</span> <span id="s176">When I left was action, and when I came back, right after, it started, so we went back to that cave.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: The “action” -- we should define the word for some people who will be reading this transcript and listening to this tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: It was not constant killing all the time.</span> <span id="s179">Of course it happened that the Germans would shoot someone, and I was told not to go and play on the balcony.</span> <span id="s180">At the beginning there was a group of children, and we played on balcony, and there was ruin of synagogue next to the house.</span> <span id="s181">We played there, too.</span> <span id="s182">But then most of the children were gone, taken by these actions.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: So in an action they would just come into the ghetto and --</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: In an action, they would come into the ghetto and take anyone in sight, practically, and especially children, and families with children.</span> <span id="s185">So when we were hiding, we escaped it.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: So now you were back in the ghetto then with your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: We were in the ghetto, and it was getting worse and worse.</span> <span id="s188">My father sent us these papers and so we had papers, and somehow, through someone, my mother got in touch with a gang, kind of, that specialized in getting people out, for money.</span> <span id="s189">There was a house that was one side in the ghetto and one side out of the ghetto, on the border.</span> <span id="s190">The house was being used for delicing people.</span> <span id="s191">So we went there, pretending that we wanted to get deliced, and these people prepared the door on the other side that was open, and we went just across, through.</span> <span id="s192">And they were waiting.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: The gang.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: The gang, right.</span> <span id="s195">It was kind of toward the evening, and we took the night train to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s196">We separated.</span> <span id="s197">Someone went with my mother in one compartment and I was with someone else in another compartment.</span> <span id="s198">Then we arrived in Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Which was not the safest place to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: For us it was, because no one knew us there.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: By now you were pretending to be Christians, because you had the false identity cards.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: With false identity, and there was less likeness that someone knew us, and would recognize us.</span> <span id="s203">First we went with them to a place in the old city, that is now rebuilt.</span> <span id="s204">But at the time it was original and it looked original and smelled original, too.</span> <span id="s205">(Laughs) And we located a type of apartment, long, and the woman who owned it was kind of a madam or former madam or still a part-time madam.</span> <span id="s206">So there was a couple, left the bed, and we were showed that that would be our place.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: I can tell this was not the best part of town.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: We stayed there for some time.</span> <span id="s209">We had some belongings, and we were waiting for it, and eventually it came, but not much of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: These were clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Clothes, and especially there was a very precious thing for my mother, a comforter.</span> <span id="s212">The down comforter.</span> <span id="s213">And they were looking for some treasure there, so they cut it open, but my mother repaired and still has it.</span> <span id="s214">And my mother began to feel more and more uncomfortable, thinking that they are waiting to see how much they can still squeeze out of us, and after that they would denounce us.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: And all the money you had to live on was what your mother’s cousin had brought from Lemberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: That was for giving those people, for keeping me.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: How were you living, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: My mother had some jewelry, some rings, which she sewed in her coat, and was selling from time to time.</span> <span id="s219">She also had some from the store of my uncle, it was kind of a drugstore, like the perfume department of the drugstore, combs, and such things.</span> <span id="s220">So she had a variety of objects that she deposited with some friends, and they sent some of it.</span> <span id="s221">Some didn’t, but we made it somehow.</span> <span id="s222">And we also had a lot of blackmails, which was part of living in hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: You were paying blackmail?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Blackmail.</span> <span id="s225">Some policeman, or someone, who wanted to make some money.</span> <span id="s226">It was not necessary always to kill us, but just take advantage of the situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: You mean he suspected you were Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Yeah, and really took advantage of it.</span> <span id="s229">Would follow, and take whatever he could.</span> <span id="s230">So my mother, after a while, moved.</span> <span id="s231">We found another place, and we didn’t tell this gang where we were going.</span> <span id="s232">We lived there for almost a year, I think.</span> <span id="s233">That was a wife of a prisoner-of-war, a Polish officer, and her two daughters.</span> <span id="s234">At that time the ghetto burned.</span> <span id="s235">That was the uprising of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s236">One daughter said, “ Well, let them burn.</span> <span id="s237">Main Street used to be theirs.”</span> <span id="s238">But at the same time, quite knowingly, they also kept a Jewish man, who underwent surgery, to hide his circumcision.</span> <span id="s239">So it was kind of a double.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: It was like they didn’t like Jews as a group, but a few Poles would do good things like that for an individual Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Not out of kindness, but for money they would do it.</span> <span id="s242">Then, there was an administrator of that house.</span> <span id="s243">It was a big complex, a lot of people lived there, and my mother went to him and asked if he didn’t know someone, because we would like to move.</span> <span id="s244">There were just too many blackmails, and it began to be kind of a “hot” situation.</span> <span id="s245">So he said, “ Yes, actually my parents are looking for someone,” and he said to be quiet and just try it with them.</span> <span id="s246">That happened to be on the right side of a suburb of Warsaw, because we lived there, again, some time, and when the uprising started in Warsaw, we were not there.</span> <span id="s247">So that was really lucky, that we were out of that situation.</span> <span id="s248">Then we moved again, but still in the same village.</span> <span id="s249">And they were fighting in Warsaw, but also where we were.</span> <span id="s250">The Russians were already there.</span> <span id="s251">They were fighting between Russians and Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Do you remember the name of the suburb?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Yes, it was Kobilke.</span> <span id="s254">We were hiding again, this time with gentiles, because of bombs and whatever was falling around.</span> <span id="s255">So we went to a house and many neighbors who had wooden houses went to the house that was made of brick, thinking they would be somewhat safer.</span> <span id="s256">The house was owned by a woman who had a little dead girl, and there was a whole company of people, and there was a priest, it was his housekeeper.</span> <span id="s257">There were all kind of people, some woman that came with her mother and child from Warsaw for vacation and couldn’t go back, and a German, at one point, got us out, and started to direct us towards some place.</span> <span id="s258">So we walked and walked and walked, and then we went to some other village, where there was a lot of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Now, this was not Germans gathering you up, this wasn’t an action.</span> <span id="s260">This was just, “Get out of the way, because we are fighting the Russians.”</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: There was a camp next to Warsaw called Pruszkow, where the Germans put everyone, and it was quite possible that that was our destination, at that point.</span> <span id="s262">However, we spent the night in some other village and I remember, we stayed in some store, some empty place, and there was a lot of Polish women praying novenas, that repetitious type of prayers.</span> <span id="s263">And they were saying this absolutely the whole night.</span> <span id="s264">But in the morning my mother got to some German officer, and spoke German, and told him we are Ukrainian, and somehow she got from him permission that our group could go back.</span> <span id="s265">So this priest, and the whole company, set out to return and when we returned, it was absolutely quiet, because no one was there, in the village.</span> <span id="s266">So we returned to that house and we went back to our cave, and someone went out after a while, and came back.</span> <span id="s267">“There are soldiers here.</span> <span id="s268">Hiding!”</span> <span id="s269">But someone else went to look, very quietly, and there were no Germans, they were Russians.</span> <span id="s270">There were two Russians on two horses, and so at that moment we all rushed out and then that was the end of the hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Do you remember about what date that was?</span> <span id="s272">What time of the year?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: It was 1944, and I think it was fall, probably September.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: To back up for a minute, before you tell me what happened next, all this time that you were in hiding, you weren’t getting any schooling.</span> <span id="s275">Or was your mother giving you lessons?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: No, I wasn’t getting any schooling.</span> <span id="s277">I had some before we went to ghetto.</span> <span id="s278">I had a good friend, actually it was a cousin of my cousin, so he was a little bit related, and we played together, and one day, we were six, and we got married.</span> <span id="s279">He was my first husband, (Laughter).</span> <span id="s280">So we had a together a woman who was teaching us for a while.</span> <span id="s281">She taught us even a little bit of Hebrew, and a little German, and even some religion, and she was quite demanding and very stern.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Did you know what became of your father, where he was?</span> <span id="s283">When you were liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s285">I knew before that.</span> <span id="s286">What really killed him was his inability to write down his formulas, in a way.</span> <span id="s287">Because when he was in Lemberg, he was still selling his formulas, and at a certain point he sold one of his formulas to a Russian, a paint for trains.</span> <span id="s288">And this paint wasn’t drying!</span> <span id="s289">(Laughter).</span> <span id="s290">So they were after him, and he was afraid.</span> <span id="s291">So instead of being taken to Russia with a lot of other people who did survive, and probably he would, too, he was hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Yes, a lot of people did survive that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: In fact, that’s something we should talk about, too.</span> <span id="s294">I often wonder, because even if it was not a Russian design to do it, the fact is, that they did save a good number of people, and as long as we say a lot of bad things about it, maybe for fairness, we should also admit to the fact that they got them inside Russia and they didn’t leave them in the Ukraine to be killed by Germans.</span> <span id="s295">Most of the people who were taken to Russia, that I knew, came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: So what became of your father?</span> <span id="s297">The paint wasn’t drying---</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: My father was afraid, so he did not go.</span> <span id="s299">He was hiding, in order not to be taken to Russia.</span> <span id="s300">So when the Russians withdrew from Lemberg he was there, ready and waiting for the Germans.</span> <span id="s301">At that point be bought those papers for us and eventually he also came to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s302">He lived separately, but he was visiting us.</span> <span id="s303">And one day, it was kind of during the time we were moving to the countryside, there was sabotage on the train station, that was carrying merchandise, soldiers, whatever, that was done by the underground, the resistance.</span> <span id="s304">But my father unfortunately lived close to the train station and the Germans took all men from surrounding and once he was in their hands, they probably found out that he was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: So you never heard.</span> <span id="s306">So, the war ended, at least in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s307">The Russians are now occupying and you came out.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: We came out, and at that point I went to school.</span> <span id="s309">We lived with Russians, and they were waiting for the Germans to finish Warsaw.</span> <span id="s310">They decided to stay and not move any further, and they left the Germans to do the dirty work.</span> <span id="s311">There were two organizations, AK, the Armia Krajowa, and Armia Rudova.</span> <span id="s312">AK was not sympathetic to the Communists, and in fact they probably “made” the uprising, to prove that they liberated Warsaw, and not the Russians.</span> <span id="s313">It was about six months, and I have really a very happy memory of that time, because life started to be quite pleasant, relatively speaking.</span> <span id="s314">We didn’t have to hide any more.</span> <span id="s315">We were not afraid to be killed.</span> <span id="s316">The Russians settled in this house where we were, and there was a kitchen, and they shared food with us, and they were showing movies, and we had a good relationship.</span> <span id="s317">There was a Russian woman soldier who was put in the same room where we were, with the owner of the house and me and my mother, together in a very small room, in which they were showing movies, and where, sometimes, a Russian soldier who was being sent back home, he saw party in our room, too, a good-bye party.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: A little girl with all these grown-ups.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: For them it wasn’t so entertaining, but for me it was.</span> <span id="s320">And I learned Russian at the time, mostly from this woman.</span> <span id="s321">I had a very good memory of her, she was such a nice person.</span> <span id="s322">She was an architect.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Had you shown artistic talent then?</span> <span id="s324">Were you the kind of little girl who drew pictures?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: I have some, a copybook of that time.</span> <span id="s326">(Brings out drawings)</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: You were telling me about a teacher you had right after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: She had sixty children in her classroom.</span> <span id="s329">And no books.</span> <span id="s330">Nothing.</span> <span id="s331">And she was able to keep, not only discipline, but also to teach us, and to correct, and she was choosing rather good quality literature, and she spent a lot of time simply dictating, and she really taught us how to write, and also a certain sensitivity toward literature.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Did you have to write some stories of your own, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: No, only some sentences, for grammatical examples.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: And here’s your copybook with the arithmetic problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: She taught us everything, so I just had the one copybook, and put everything there.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: Let’s see.</span> <span id="s337">There you were learning subtraction.</span> <span id="s338">Five equals nine minus four.</span> <span id="s339">Here’s algebra.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Which I haven’t used much lately.</span> <span id="s341">Here’s another one.</span> <span id="s342">That was somewhat later, after we left, and we went back to Krakow.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: When did you leave Warsaw, to go back to Krakow?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: When Warsaw was taken, and Russia took Poland.</span> <span id="s345">First we went to Tarnhof, before we went to Krakow.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Was any of your mother’s family left there?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: No.</span> <span id="s348">Nobody was there.</span> <span id="s349">There were some acquaintances, but otherwise, no.</span> <span id="s350">But we already knew that all those people were gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: How did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: Well, they were killed.</span> <span id="s353">They were shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Oh, you mean these were the ones who were shot before you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Right.</span> <span id="s356">And I think we kind of thought even that it was worse than it was, probably, that everyone was killed.</span> <span id="s357">So when people were coming back after the war, every one was a surprise, that they were coming from concentration camp, or whatever.</span> <span id="s358">I don’t remember that anyone would say something, but we did see Warsaw burning and people being killed, so we didn’t have any doubt.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: How did your non-Jewish neighbors treat you when you went back to Krakow?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: When we went back to Tarnhof, the director and principal of the school, who was my mother’s favorite teacher, with whom she had great relationship, when she was taught by her when she was little, in spite of that, this principal suggested that we don’t say that I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s361">So I had quite a difficult time.</span> <span id="s362">I was there only a few months, and then we went to Krakow.</span> <span id="s363">I remember that there was a kind of place where we ate dinner, it was a kind of custom during the war that certain people make their living by making home cooked meals, like a restaurant, but at home.</span> <span id="s364">You could eat, and you’d pay something for it.</span> <span id="s365">It was definitely a Jewish place, and one girl from school saw me being there, so she put two and two together and started to persecute me later.</span> <span id="s366">I remember still a priest who had religion lessons there, making fun of Yom Kippur, and how wonderful that Christians just go to confession while Jews put everything in gold, and he made quite a circus out of that.</span> <span id="s367">Strangely enough, my only friend there in that school was a girl who was a daughter of Stamdeutsch people, a very mild and rather nice girl.</span> <span id="s368">(Laughter).</span> <span id="s369">At that point she was not in a good spot either</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Because the Germans were not popular at this point, either.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: Right.</span> <span id="s372">But that was a short time.</span> <span id="s373">Then I went to Krakow and the same thing happened.</span> <span id="s374">When I went to school this time I was under my own name but the principal also said, “ Don’t say you are Jewish.”</span> <span id="s375">So I was still hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: And they did have religion lessons in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: They had them many years after the war.</span> <span id="s378">In fact, at the end of my study -- I finished high school, it was maybe ’51, something like that -- in public school, they had religion lessons.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Catholic religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Your mother couldn’t have been supporting the two of you all that time, selling what was left of the jewelry.</span> <span id="s382">How were you managing?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: My mother came from rather wealthy family.</span> <span id="s384">So there were some houses left, and she was selling them.</span> <span id="s385">There was some relatives here in the States, and I think she sold some land for about five hundred dollars, and these relatives were buying some shampoos, Helene Curtis, and sending them.</span> <span id="s386">So this five hundred dollars supported us for a long time.</span> <span id="s387">Those kind of things.</span> <span id="s388">But we were living quite modestly.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: So then you graduated high school in 1951.</span> <span id="s390">Then what happened?</span> <span id="s391">Were you talking about coming to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Well, then I went and studied at the Academy of Fine Arts, and people were leaving, practically everyone was leaving for Israel, and somehow my mother was very ambiguous about it.</span> <span id="s393">On one hand she was saying that we would leave, and on the other hand she was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: What finally made you decide to come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: I didn’t.</span> <span id="s396">I went to France, first.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: By yourself or with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: By myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: To study art?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Well, I finished study, so that was supposed to be kind of an artistic trip, because I was in art.</span> <span id="s401">So after a long time I got a passport, quite a long time, but I finally got it.</span> <span id="s402">It was a tourist passport.</span> <span id="s403">.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: This was when?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: 1959.</span> <span id="s406">It was just the time I was finished with my study.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: So you left your mother behind?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: So you went to Paris.</span> <span id="s410">You went to France in 1959, and you stayed.</span> <span id="s411">How did you get a permit to stay?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: That is not needed for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: We’d like to know when you came to the United States, how you and your mother were reunited.</span> <span id="s414">And did you have a job?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: No, I got married, to an American.</span> <span id="s416">When I come here, that’s how.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: In France?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s419">That was Smith.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Was he an artist, a student living there?</span> <span id="s421">(Shakes head no) But you met him there and then you came to the United States with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Well, not right away.</span> <span id="s423">We lived there about eight years.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: So then you came to the United States in ’67.</span> <span id="s425">And when did your mother rejoin you?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: She left Poland two years after me, and she went to Germany.</span> <span id="s427">When I came here, she followed me.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: You helped her get her visa.</span> <span id="s429">What got you to St. Paul?</span> <span id="s430">Was this where Smith was from?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: No, he got a job here for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Was he Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Have you gone back to Judaism?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Yes, I never left it, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: And so you’ve identified with the Jewish community here in St. Paul.</span> <span id="s437">You belong to the synagogue, organizations.</span> <span id="s438">Did you do that in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s440">Not so much.</span> <span id="s441">My mother didn’t give me that much.</span> <span id="s442">She had strong identity, and at the same time a good deal of self hate.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: You said that you did not come from an observant house.</span> <span id="s444">So then when you came here you didn’t really have to have any contact with the Jewish Family Service, agencies like that who help newcomers to this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Well, that was a very unhappy experience I had.</span> <span id="s446">I tried.</span> <span id="s447">At that time there was one woman there, when I came, and I needed just a little bit of help at the time.</span> <span id="s448">I separated from my husband, I haven’t been living so long here.</span> <span id="s449">I had a baby.</span> <span id="s450">I didn’t know language that well.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: You were beginning to learn English.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Well, I knew English, but I was not proficient in it.</span> <span id="s453">What did I ask her for?</span> <span id="s454">Was to help me find work, and look for an apartment.</span> <span id="s455">And I didn’t get even that.</span> <span id="s456">She had absolutely no one else there, nothing particular to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: I think a lot of times the people who do succeed with the system are the people who keep on going back until they find somebody who will help.</span> <span id="s458">But it’s hard to know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: At that time it seems to be just her.</span> <span id="s460">It was very small, it wasn’t like today, that you have other people to choose from.</span> <span id="s461">At that time there seemed to be just that one woman.</span> <span id="s462">And maybe there was one director who was coming and going.</span> <span id="s463">She was really interested in making interview and getting my life history, but finally they just said they wouldn’t help.</span> <span id="s464">I had car.</span> <span id="s465">I didn’t know how to drive it, I needed to drive it to get some employment.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: So how did you work it out?</span> <span id="s467">Did you find a job?</span> <span id="s468">And somebody to take care of your son?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Yes, actually, but not through Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: What kind of work have you done since you came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: I was teaching handicapped.</span> <span id="s472">I was teaching art.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Did you have any training for teaching the handicapped?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: Actually not, but it was combination, to teach art to handicapped, and I had to devise ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Was this in the school system?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: No, it wasn’t.</span> <span id="s477">Handicrafters, or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Oh, an agency, an organization.</span> <span id="s479">And you taught in workrooms or classrooms?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: No, I was driving to people.</span> <span id="s481">At that time I already learned.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Now we get to these closing questions.</span> <span id="s483">Can you tell me what it has meant to you, to be a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: I think that, initially, I thought not much.</span> <span id="s485">I was taking things for granted.</span> <span id="s486">I was taking things as they came.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Either the past or the meaning of what had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Meaning of what had happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Did you feel alone?</span> <span id="s490">You didn’t have aunts and uncles and cousins.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Very much.</span> <span id="s492">I felt terribly alone.</span> <span id="s493">But it was also part of it, my mother made it even worse.</span> <span id="s494">( Turn off machine while she describes problems with mother.)</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: So, if you can, after your experience during the Holocaust, can you describe how you feel about human nature, about non-Jews and Germans?</span> <span id="s496">Why this happened, how people could do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Right now I think that everyone would be capable of doing that.</span> <span id="s498">I do not think that the Germans were particularly worse than other people, even if they did it, because I suspect that if it happened in some other nation it could happen the same way.</span> <span id="s499">It happened in Cambodia, for example.</span> <span id="s500">And there are some nations, of course, like Denmark, or even Italy, that didn’t do it.</span> <span id="s501">But even the United States sent those boats back, and they interned Japanese, so I think that potential is there.</span> <span id="s502">I also think that too much obedience is not healthy for anyone, generally.</span> <span id="s503">For myself, it affected me, that I am still hiding, in a way.</span> <span id="s504">I started to see that only not that long ago, when I was looking into myself and my behavior, that in many ways I could not go forward, that I was hiding a lot of what I was, and that I could not be open.</span> <span id="s505">It took me a long time to learn to be open.</span> <span id="s506">To talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: About who you are, and what happened to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Right.</span> <span id="s509">Even sometimes professionally, like going out and having exhibition of painting, or going out and trying to accomplish something.</span> <span id="s510">I am kind of still living in hiding, especially that I lived also during fifteen years or so after the war in Poland under Communism, so there was still another part of me that needed to be hidden.</span> <span id="s511">And with so much hiding and hiding, it’s very hard to go forward and to be like an American six-year-old child, who just is, nothing to hold back.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Do you have any vivid memories of what it was like to be in Poland under Communism?</span> <span id="s513">Anything that really stands out in your mind?</span> <span id="s514">You had said that the Russians were very good to the Jews when they chased the Germans out of Krakow, but then when you were living under a Communist government, that was different.</span> <span id="s515">Did you feel anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s517">Definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: By now you were being identified as a Jew.</span> <span id="s519">How did that affect you?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Strangely enough, I had friends, some.</span> <span id="s521">So it was not like I was ostracized in school.</span> <span id="s522">It happened when I applied and got accepted for stage design.</span> <span id="s523">I was one of five who were accepted, and I had a friend before that who also applied, and she was not accepted.</span> <span id="s524">At that moment she stopped being my friend, and started to campaign that I was accepted because I was Jewish, and because I had some special favors.</span> <span id="s525">So this kind of things.</span> <span id="s526">So I was ostracized at that point by the other four people that were accepted, and had really hard time there.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: But you did finish your course in stage design?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: I didn’t, because, well -- that will be all.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: It was hard to be ostracized.</span> <span id="s530">I notice you’re reading Shoah, the script of the film.</span> <span id="s531">Have you read other books, and seen other films about the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s532">Do you feel that they accurately depict it?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: No.</span> <span id="s534">I don’t know how I would do it.</span> <span id="s535">The impression that I get when I see a movie like Towering Inferno, for example, it was set in soap opera sensationalism.</span> <span id="s536">I’m afraid the Holocaust is being treated the same way.</span> <span id="s537">And then people say you don’t understand, like Elie Wiesel.</span> <span id="s538">And when they say you don’t understand, they probably mean inside, being there, because you cannot understand it when you see it.</span> <span id="s539">It’s a soap opera.</span> <span id="s540">When my son went to religious school, he was taught about Holocaust, and he got a lot of statistics and he got a lot of ghoulish stories and it turned him completely off.</span> <span id="s541">I can understand that, too.</span> <span id="s542">It would turn me off, too, because after a while I got desensitized, rather than sensitized to it.</span> <span id="s543">After you see so many pictures, even the most horrid pictures, somehow those people become like historical objects, like mummies, and there’s something emotional lost there.</span> <span id="s544">I can’t put my finger on what exactly it should have been like, but it’s kind of this relationship, painting this two-colored picture, or this painting, this soap operish picture, and there’s truth between the two.</span> <span id="s545">I got A total dislike for martyrdom, first in Christianity, hearing about Christian martyrs, while I was being Christian, and then I hear about even now, Central American martyrs, and this martyrs, and I feel very cynical toward it.</span> <span id="s546">I can’t get too much sympathy.</span> <span id="s547">On the other hand, I’m writing letters for Amnesty International, and I have worked with refugees for years.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: What kind of refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Jewish Russian refugees, and Hmong refugees, and Cambodian refugees, and Ethiopian refugees.</span> <span id="s550">I should be a little more active again, for Ethiopian Jews who are still in Ethiopia.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Yes, they didn’t all get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Just last September I went to visit my son, and I was also in Washington for a conference about Ethiopian Jews, so I don’t withdraw from being active.</span> <span id="s553">But I wouldn’t like to do it through crying “martyrdom.”</span> <span id="s554">There’s something wrong with it.</span> <span id="s555">It also puts you or that particular person in the position of victim, and there’s something wrong, definitely wrong, for me with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: You can’t really know what it was like to be a victim and that may be part of it.</span> <span id="s557">Do you feel that way about Shoah, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: No.</span> <span id="s559">Precisely because Shoah doesn’t do it that way.</span> <span id="s560">It’s the only one that doesn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Shoah was criticized by some people because it’s so repetitious.</span> <span id="s562">You see so
