States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr. Raymond Turgel conducted on November 8, 2012 in Potomac, Maryland.</span> <span id="s13">My name is Inna Novoselskis (ph) and I want to start out by thanking you, Mr. Turgel, for agreeing to meet with us today.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Answer: You're most welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: To talk about your experiences, to talk about the way that the Holocaust impacted your life, and as we do with all of our interviews, we'll start at the beginning.</span> <span id="s16">We'd like to know a little bit more about you, your background, your family.</span> <span id="s17">So let's start off with the simplest of questions.</span> <span id="s18">Where were you born, when were you born and who were your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: I was born on February 28, 1924 in Berlin and in a second floor walk-up apartment on Potsdamer Strasse, which is near the center or close to the center of the town.</span> <span id="s20">Both my parents were medical doctors.</span> <span id="s21">My father was practicing and my mother was a psychiatrist and we lived in that same house, same apartment, until we left Berlin, except for, I think, one week after the Kristallnacht where we heard some rumors that the Gestapo was coming and looking for people, so we moved to my grandmother's apartment, which was in West Berlin, in a different area which just temporarily.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Just temporarily, and then you came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Well, I'm not -- not quite sure because I left in 1938 on the kindertransport.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: We'll get to that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: Yes, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: We'll get to that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Let's still stay in the 1920s, the early 1920s.</span> <span id="s29">You said that both of your parents were physicians.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Yes, my father--</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: That's quite impressive.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: My father practiced -- had his practice right in the apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: He was a GP?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: uhu.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: Well, actually he was a orthopedic surgeon, but for--for--to make a living he--he was a GP because it was more difficult to get working in the hospital, even at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: And that would have been because of what reasons?</span> <span id="s38">A: I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s39">I'm not sure, but I know that he had a sign outside the building that said praktischer Arzt, which means GP, and that's all.</span> <span id="s40">You know, I was, all after, very little so I didn't--I did not know about all the various complications that come in to being.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Did you have brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: You were the only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: I was the only child, yes.</span> <span id="s45">My mother's health wasn't that great.</span> <span id="s46">After I was born she had pleurisy and some other -- and she was not able, I think, to have another child.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: What would you say would be your earliest memory?</span> <span id="s48">A: My earliest memory, the apartment had fairly large rooms, was a peculiar long shape.</span> <span id="s49">You had to go through the dining room to go into the rest of the apartment, and my earliest I had my crib was in my parents bedroom but the bedroom was very large.</span> <span id="s50">There was not only the beds and wardrobe, since they didn't have closets, and a large table like a dining room table.</span> <span id="s51">My crib was on the other side of that so it was a large room, but I was standing up in the crib and looking at the rest of the world.</span> <span id="s52">Ha-ha.</span> <span id="s53">Q: Yeah, ha-ha.</span> <span id="s54">Did you have -- after your mother had you, and you say she -- she was a bit sickly, did she still practice?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Well, she had a few patients, but not have many.</span> <span id="s56">Not -- my father was busy every day of course but no, she didn't have too--</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Too many.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Too many, no.</span> <span id="s59">But at age, I think, five they hired a French governess for me so she was free to do things without having to supervise me all the time.</span> <span id="s60">We also had a live-in maid that cleaned -- my mother liked to cook, but not to clean up, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: There are people who --</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: -- that don't like those things ha-ha.</span> <span id="s64">How would you describe your parents as individuals?</span> <span id="s65">What kind of personalities did they have?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Well, I think they were fairly easy going.</span> <span id="s67">Occasionally they'd some -- my parents had some loud disputes, but not too often, ha-ha.</span> <span id="s68">But I think from a -- we had -- they had a large number of friends and I think my father was a very good host and he was liked.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Was he an extrovert?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: Well, sort of.</span> <span id="s71">Not -- not, you know, the bravado kind, but he was pleasant to be with, you know, respected others and.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: And your mom?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: She was shyer.</span> <span id="s74">She was shy in many ways and a little more quiet perhaps.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Who were you closer to?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: My dad.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Did you have shared interests?</span> <span id="s80">Were there things that you felt comfortable talking to him about, you know, ways that you were together?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Well, here's the thing.</span> <span id="s82">My dad, in his spare time, used to do all kinds of small repairs and he actually made a lot of toys for me.</span> <span id="s83">I had an electric train set when I was a little older and he built a whole station with the baggage lifts and all kinds of --</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Cool.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: -- complicated things, so of course you know--</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Oh cool, that's so nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s88">The set actually all together was so large that I could only use it on weekends because it went from one room to the next, ha-ha, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Oh God what train set delight, to have it through the whole apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: That's quite a gift.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: You know, because it's not that a kid gets a gift it's--</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Actually the way the apartment was arranged you came in from the front stairs into what was the waiting room for the patients and the front three rooms, one was my father's office, the one next to it was the examination room which was not too large, and next to that was the living room/sitting room, whatever you want to call it.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">And when we had guests there were two curtains drawn between my father's office and the other rooms so you didn't see all those medical instruments and things.</span> <span id="s96">You just walked through from one room to the other, and the sitting room had a baby grand, and a fireplace which was unusual for--</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: -- that kind of set up, but during -- unless we had guests we don't -- or I was practicing the piano ha-ha, we didn't use that room very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Who was the player, the piano player in the family?</span> <span id="s100">A: Well, my dad played without lessons by ear and I took lessons until age 12, 11, 12.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Did you like it?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: I did, yes.</span> <span id="s103">I did.</span> <span id="s104">My mother played violin, but I never remember hearing her play.</span> <span id="s105">I know she had one, but I don't have a vivid memory of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Well, I'll confess to you when I was little my parents also gave me piano lessons and I was the world's worst student.</span> <span id="s107">My teacher was a composer who was a refugee and he was reduced to giving piano lessons to kids who didn't practice.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Ha-ha.</span> <span id="s109">No, I actually practiced and I liked it, ha-ha, but I probably -- I wasn't, you know, wunderkind talent, something like that.</span> <span id="s110">I had to do my scales and things and -- but after age 12 there was just not, not time and opportunity to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Let's--</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Now let me add one thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: The front of the apartment looked out on Potsdamer Strasse and was diagonally opposite the sports palace where Hitler had all his speeches so I was many times at the window looking down seeing Hitler coming down the center of the street in his open Mercedes and saluting the lines of the SR men either side, forming a guard for him.</span> <span id="s115">Q: And do you remember how old you were?</span> <span id="s116">Was this before '33 or after '33?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: After, after '33.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: After '33.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Before 33 he was not, not in power so he wasn't able to do this.</span> <span id="s120">Also, in the ground floor of the building there were -- it was customary in European cities there were stores and one happened to be a beer hall and that was not the best because when I slept at night I could hear them sing songs like "Jewish blood spurts from the knife, life is twice as good."</span> <span id="s121">Ha-ha, that was my--</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Your lullaby.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Cradle song, yeah.</span> <span id="s124">Ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Ha-ha.</span> <span id="s126">Oh my gosh.</span> <span id="s127">What an atmosphere.</span> <span id="s128">What an atmosphere.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Yeah that was not good.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: Was the neighborhood Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: No.</span> <span id="s133">It was -- was it mixed?</span> <span id="s134">Was it was it sort of like?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: The way an urban place could be?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s139">Who were your neighbors?</span> <span id="s140">Did you know them?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: No.</span> <span id="s142">I don't even know the people who lived on the same -- there were two apartments on each floor.</span> <span id="s143">I don't even know the people who lived in the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Were there other doctors nearby?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: No.</span> <span id="s148">Well, nearby, within a few blocks perhaps, yes.</span> <span id="s149">And one of my school friend's father was a dentist and that's the dentist I visited.</span> <span id="s150">He lived two blocks away, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: So, were there other Jewish shops on your street?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Not that I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s154">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: So there wasn't really much interaction with the others who would be your neighbors?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: No playing with the kids or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Not the neighbors, no.</span> <span id="s160">The only people I played with were people my parents knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: So how would you describe your parents' social circle?</span> <span id="s162">Who were the folks who were their friends, their acquaintances?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Well, one of them is if you turn around, the painter that's Erich Wolfsfeld.</span> <span id="s164">He was one of the friends and he painted.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Wolfsfeld, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: He moved to England later in, I think '37 also.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: This looks like graphic?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: It's a lovely picture.</span> <span id="s170">Is it a self portrait?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Yes, that's a self portrait.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Erich Wolfsfeld.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: And this was given to your parents in 1945 it says, 4-45?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s176">He moved to England when my parents were living there too and we -- that's over the mantle piece, that's--</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: That's also his?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s180">So -- and he was in your family circle?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: You remember him as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Did you go visit him in the studio?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Well, in fact I have a picture in the next room.</span> <span id="s186">He painted one of my dad and one of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Oh, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: How cool.</span> <span id="s190">And did he live close by to Potsdamer Strasse or further away?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: No.</span> <span id="s192">I don't know where he lived really.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s194">Okay.</span> <span id="s195">This one, you know, has a look that I've seen in Keta Kovitz's (ph) sometimes.</span> <span id="s196">It's not the same kind of art, but the human expression.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Well, he was a professor at the academy, so before</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Before Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: And, of course, he had to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s202">Tell me more about the, you know, the people who would come to visit and, you know, as guests.</span> <span id="s203">A: Well, friends, other doctors who lived in different parts of the city.</span> <span id="s204">Occasionally -- one time I remember -- I don't know where she came from or why my parents knew her, was an opera singer and she sang some arias from the marriage of Figaro for my dad was playing the piano.</span> <span id="s205">Q: Oh, oh.</span> <span id="s206">Well, you know, the way they used to entertain in the--</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s208">Well, that's another doctor.</span> <span id="s209">They lived in different part and of course all the different doctors, the doctors knew each other from university I guess, and so we--</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: I don't hear you mention though any relatives, like aunts and uncles and things--</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: I did have -- I -- my grandmother, my maternal grandmother.</span> <span id="s214">I never really remember my paternal grandmother.</span> <span id="s215">I think they died either when I was very young or before I was born.</span> <span id="s216">I just know their names and I've seen their photographs, but I don't know.</span> <span id="s217">But my maternal grandmother, her husband also was a physician, a well known one and--</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Max Lerventau.</span> <span id="s220">(ph)</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: In fact, the picture in the hall as you came in here, you might not have noticed, that was my great-grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Yes, I did notice it.</span> <span id="s224">I did notice it.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Her name was Theresa Abrams.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: And this was on your mother's side?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s230">My father, my father moved to Berlin or his family moved to Berlin when he was three years old so I don't know any other relatives from there, other than he has a sister who also lived in Berlin and my cousin who was nine years older -- well, actually there were two cousins.</span> <span id="s231">She had a son and a daughter and my -- the son was nine older than I was and then the daughter was 18 years older than I was so I didn't have much social contact with them other than at family reunion.</span> <span id="s232">They were out of my age range, so to speak.</span> <span id="s233">Yes, oh yes, my uncle who left -- my uncle had real estate, owned real estate in Berlin and one of his tenants was the Nazi party.</span> <span id="s234">That was before 1933, and they didn't pay their rents so he sued them so when Hitler came to power, he moved to Paris within weeks, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Didn't collect the rent, ha-ha?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Didn't collect the rent, no.</span> <span id="s237">Incidentally, his wife was an artist and she made this -- this -- these tiles, this tile table.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: How lovely that you have so many mementos and, you know, things that surround you in life that really come from that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: This actually is in both ways because my dad made the table and my aunt made the tiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s241">He really had a talent for -- I wonder did he also enjoy it?</span> <span id="s242">Was it--</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: You know--</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: He liked to do things, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: It's a lovely table.</span> <span id="s247">I describe it -- is it cast iron here or wrought iron?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s249">This is wrought iron.</span> <span id="s250">That's a good frame.</span> <span id="s251">Q: A dark brown wrought iron table with a lot of design elements to it with colorful painted glass tiles as the table top with figures of young girls and in a background that has a forest and these are -- these look like black either puppies or sheep or?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: I don't know what they are.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Yeah, but they're very pretty and dainty and--</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Graceful looking.</span> <span id="s256">Would you say that your home was a quiet place or a very lively place as you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Oh, fairly quiet.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: uhu.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: In terms of you mean noise or?</span> <span id="s260">Q: The people coming in and out.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Well, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: And always being full of-- A: Well, the patients came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: And, you know, they're waiting room was right adjacent to the dining room so I could hear.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Did you ever know any of the patients?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: There was a real -- there was a real separation between--</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Well, they were local, you know.</span> <span id="s269">People didn't come from afar, they didn't drive to go to the doctor, they walked, and so they were from the neighboring five or six blocks or something like that and there were mainly working people.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Was -- did you know any people who were non-Jewish, gentile Germans?</span> <span id="s271">Were they part of the social circle?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Social circle?</span> <span id="s273">I don't ... I can't remember, really.</span> <span id="s274">Mainly the -- the people I -- by the time I had sort of socializing -- Hitler was in power and non-Jews were out of the question at that point because they wouldn't come to a Jewish home.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: And before that I think the social circle was just family and friends that my parents knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Where did you go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Well, now that's interesting.</span> <span id="s279">The first school I went to was a Montessori's school and that was for the first three years I guess, and I had to take the -- the subway to go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Which stop to which stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: From Bulow Strasse.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Bulow Strasse.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: To Friesen Strasse.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: I remember Friesen Strasse.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: I had to change trains actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: And the Montessori school was on Friesen Strasse?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s288">Close to it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Close to it, and you were how old?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Six when I started.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Can you imagine today letting a six-year-old go to -- yeah, walk to school?</span> <span id="s292">Ha-ha.</span> <span id="s293">Did you like it--</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: -- from what you remembered?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s297">Yes, I did like it and there was only one teacher and one I think occasionally one assistant, but the mixed grades is in Montessori and you usually do your own thing and I was very proud.</span> <span id="s298">I learned how to calculate a square root because they do it on a board with little, little pellets, you know; a board that has little holes in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Yeah, yeah, pegs.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Graphically.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: That's an accomplishment.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: Ha-ha</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Because I couldn't do it even in high school, ha-ha, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: Ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: It could have been a premonition of a future career.</span> <span id="s306">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s307">Well, actually speaking of this, I -- in subsequent schooling I went to the Jewish school which was on the Kaiserdomm.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: uhu.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: And there too I had to travel and then last one was in Klopstock Strasse.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: Klopstock Strasse.</span> <span id="s311">Yeah, I do recall that street.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Yeah and -- but I was always interested in mathematics.</span> <span id="s313">In fact, I bought books to learn how to do calculous before they taught it in the school, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: You know, your schooling then starts -- well, I would assume if at six years old that's 1930 and--</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: uhu.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: And politics and what's happening in Germany is becoming more and more and more tense.</span> <span id="s317">How did you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">I mean, did you feel that as a young child?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: How did it impact your home life?</span> <span id="s321">How did it go from beyond the curtain and up from the bierstube into the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Well, that was after, after '33.</span> <span id="s323">From '34, that's really became tense and before that I once witnessed -- there was also a small park across and there was a fight between -- it was later explained to me -- communists and Nazis.</span> <span id="s324">They went at each other with clubs and stuff like that in the park.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: And that was before '33?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: That was before '33, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: And did you witness that from the window?</span> <span id="s328">A: I think I might have been in the park with the governess.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: What did they look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Do you remember what they looked like?</span> <span id="s332">Was it a big group?</span> <span id="s333">Was it young kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s335">There were, I would say, people in their twenties and thirties, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: And were they men?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s339">No women?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s341">Woman did not figure in the social life of how they work, working life.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: How did you become aware of what was going on in the larger society?</span> <span id="s343">I mean, you're a child.</span> <span id="s344">Did your parents try and shield you or did they talk to you?</span> <span id="s345">Did others talk to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Well, certainly when -- when Hitler came to power you could read it in the newspapers and all the brown shirts and people with arm bands with the swastika on it, and as I said, I got it firsthand.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: From the bierstube?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Yeah, not only from the bierstube, but looking down at Hitler driving up in his car.</span> <span id="s349">To this day I will never buy a Mercedes.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: But you were a nine-year-old boy so how did you know to be -- I mean, certainly from what do you remember from it?</span> <span id="s351">A: Not too much at first until you saw all the Hitler youth coming around and they were sort of ruffians.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: Did they pick on you?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: No.</span> <span id="s354">I was never picked on fortunately.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: Did they pick on other people that you knew or--</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Well--</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: -- others in the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: I didn't witness any particular ones but they -- they did pick on some people and certainly in -- later on in Kristallnacht I went to school that day and I was late, you know, leaving late but then the school was closed so I went back home again and everything was -- windows were broken on all kinds of stores.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: On the way home?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: On the way home, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: And what about if your father had a sign out in front, you know, on Potsdamer Strasse and he was a praktischer Arzt, so anything happened to his practice, his office?</span> <span id="s362">A: Well, not until -- I'm not quite sure if that was '37 or so that the non-Jews were not allowed to go to Jewish doctors, but the name did not signal, you know -- if anybody walked in they wouldn't know from the name, like my Grandfather Lowenthaul, they wouldn't know that he was Jewish, but Turgel or Torgal, (ph) that doesn't, that doesn't--</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Where does the name come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Well, I think I mentioned to you on the phone I believe it comes from a little town near Walnius (ph), that's Torgelow.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Torgelow, yeah.</span> <span id="s366">So that's where your father's family would be from?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Originally, but my father I think was born in Vellna.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">(ph)</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: Aha, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: So at least he said, but it may have been, you know, his parents but I don't -- as I said, I really do not remember my paternal grandparents at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Did you see a drop off in the number of patients that were in the room?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Well, they suddenly ceased to come altogether and I think he closed down his practice.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: After 1933 did your parents demeanor change?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: No.</span> <span id="s375">Well, I think we went to synagog more often.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: I forgot to ask this earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Were you a religious family?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: No, no, not -- not -- not really.</span> <span id="s380">We never kept a kosher household and they went to high holidays perhaps, but not on sabbath or time like this, but after Hitler came there was more, especially on Friday nights my -- my mother went to various synagogs and the way the synagogs were arranged in Berlin, the Jewish community operated all of them and they were paid for by tax, the church tax, the ten percent church tax and the Jewish taxpayers that went to the Jewish community so you didn't have to belong to a particular synagog, you can go to any one of them.</span> <span id="s381">In fact, they -- the rabbis rotated sometimes from one place to another.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Well, were there these distinctions as there are here with reform?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Oh, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s384">Well, there was just -- I guess it's reform or so the of reform and the orthodox were separate.</span> <span id="s385">I never went to an orthodox synagog.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Was the synagog far from your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Well, the one we went to most of the time was in Fasanenstrasse, that was quite far.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Oh, occasionally there was some others we went to, Friedenstempel.</span> <span id="s390">I don't know exactly where it was, but it was walking -- not quite walking distance.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Did your parents have a car?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Yes, but not until about '35 or '36, something.</span> <span id="s393">My dad bought a little Fiat, but before that no, and the house calls my father did were all in the neighborhood so a car wouldn't have been any good.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s395">The house calls were all in the neighborhood, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Yeah, so it was walking distance for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: How did the relations change or did they change with your governess and your maid?</span> <span id="s398">I would assume they weren't</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: No.</span> <span id="s401">Well, the governess was French.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Aha.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: One was French.</span> <span id="s404">The next one was from Switzerland from the French part of Switzerland and that was -- well, I was five so that was '29, yeah.</span> <span id="s405">That was before.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Did she teach you French?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: I'm still fairly fluent.</span> <span id="s410">Not as fluent as I was, but still good enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: And your language at home?</span> <span id="s412">I assume your parents and you spoke in German?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s415">Did they know Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Only a few expressions, but it's difficult to speak Yiddish and German at the same time because of the similarities.</span> <span id="s417">You go from one to the other and you don't know it, but you know a few terms for which there are no, no equivalents.</span> <span id="s418">The one thing that always amused me is that even the -- the Hitler people used a Jewish term which they got from the underworld and that is to stand guard, snearl (ph) stehen.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: snearl (ph) stehen?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: From shomer, to guard, in Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: And they never knew it, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: I'm sure the Germans didn't know that, but that meant, you know, the look-out post there, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: So you say your parents' demeanor didn't change but their lives did and their--</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Oh, their lives did, yes.</span> <span id="s427">Instead of going on vacation to the North Sea where my aunt had a house or a little bed and breakfast type of place, we went to Switzerland in northern Italy just to get out of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s429">To get some reprieve.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s431">Except it eased up in 1936 because of the Olympics.</span> <span id="s432">All the antisemitic signs disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Oh yes, and my dad and I got tickets for the olympic games and saw Jesse Owens win his 100 meter run.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: No kidding?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Now I'm -- in my mind--</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: From my time in Berlin there was a very well-known stadium, Olympiastadion, I think it's in the western, northwest part of the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Is that where you went to have the games?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: But the Sportpalast is somewhere else?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: That was in Potsdamer Strasse and that was used for bicycle racing and boxing and stuff like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: Not for--</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Was it an enclosed area?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s449">It was like the Verizon Center here or something.</span> <span id="s450">Not quite as big perhaps.</span> <span id="s451">I don't know.</span> <span id="s452">I was never in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: You were just across the street from it?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Yeah, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Yeah, ha-ha.</span> <span id="s456">Didn't want to attend those rallies?</span> <span id="s457">A: No, I didn't, and boxing matches weren't my thing either, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s459">So did your parents talk to you about their worries or did they try to keep those things from you?</span> <span id="s460">A: No, I think they did after I was, you know, in my teens certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Yeah, but after 1933, when you were still a nine-year-old boy, you don't remember anything about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Well, it sort of came on gradually.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: Now, I had some cousins.</span> <span id="s465">My mother's sister was married to a man who operated a supermarket, a chain of supermarkets in Berlin and they had a house out in the east of Berlin near Finsterwalde and driving there later on they had in the square of the village there was a big elaborately carved sign saying "Jews not wanted here" but, you know, the big thing was the carving and painted and somebody really spent a lot of time doing this, but that was the sign that was in there.</span> <span id="s466">But they had a house on a lake and a housekeeper who lived in the basement of that.</span> <span id="s467">I spent a lot of weekends there sometimes, after my dad had a car, because we couldn't get there without a car.</span> <span id="s468">Q: Talk a little bit, if you can about, you know--I'm trying to take things up to 1936, 1937, and so when you're older then you're already an adolescent, maybe 12, 13 years old, did you have close friends at that age?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Yes, from school.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: From school.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: From the Jewish school that you went to.</span> <span id="s473">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s474">Except the other one was the son of the dentist who lived nearby.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Because he was close always because it was walking distance, I mean, five, ten minutes, something like that.</span> <span id="s477">Q: And did you share what was going on in your lives and what was, you know, what you were seeing in the streets and on the newspapers?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: I can't really recall that.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Was there talk of what to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Well, yes there were talk about emigrating to then Palestine and, in fact, I learned in the Kaiser's school and the Kaiserdom, I learned to conversational Hebrew, you know, not the religious study Hebrew.</span> <span id="s481">I really never had a separate course in biblical Hebrew, whatever you want to call it, but I learned Hebrew like a foreign language, conjugation, nouns and verbs, and all this kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s482">Q: So as a young boy you spoke German, French, Hebrew and a little bit of Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Well, just a few.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Just a few words.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Just a few words like tinnif and well, halosis (ph) ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: What did I want to ask now?</span> <span id="s487">I'm going to go back a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Would you describe your family life as a happy life, as--you did say it's quiet, home was quiet.</span> <span id="s490">Would you say it was a warm atmosphere?</span> <span id="s491">Would you say it was a place of safety?</span> <span id="s492">How did you feel when you were at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: Oh, I--</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Or were you lonely?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Or were you a lonely boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Well, reserved, yes but not lonely, no.</span> <span id="s498">I did have people to--to come and visit and play, play with me, especially with the train set and that, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s500">That would make it, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Ha-ha, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Ha-ha.</span> <span id="s503">But was it a place of warmth?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s505">Yes, definitely, and I never felt desperate or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Did you ever feel unsafe?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: Well, not directly threatened, but indirectly, knowing what was going on, but it was still safe to walk on the street.</span> <span id="s508">At least I was never in any situation on the street where I was being harassed by anyone.</span> <span id="s509">Maybe I didn't look Jewish enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Well, that could be.</span> <span id="s511">That could be, you know.</span> <span id="s512">Take us up to the time--explain a little bit from your school days, from your parent's conversations, from how things developed that you--and please bring in more, if you can, detail about Kristallnacht that brings us up to the time when you're going to leave on a kindertransport.</span> <span id="s513">I'd like to--</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Well, that's--</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: How things developed.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: That decision was done by my parents without my--any input from me obviously because, you know, they decided that was a big sacrifice for them because they didn't know whether they'd ever see me again.</span> <span id="s517">I--I remember on the station, you know, waving out of the window and seeing two sad people receding into the background, but we did--as I said, we did, for a time anyway, move to my grandmother's apartment and I remember one little detail.</span> <span id="s518">We took a taxi and I said to my dad, let's take a taxi to the train station and bahnhof so and get into another taxi so the taxi driver can't tell where we went.</span> <span id="s519">That was--they followed my advice on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: It makes sense, it makes sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: Because you go to the station, that's a legitimate taxi ride and coming back--</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: From the station--</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: You take another taxi from the station and you go to Vitschlob (ph)Strasse and where my grandmother lived.</span> <span id="s524">Q: We'll get to the part where, you know, you leave and you meet your parents.</span> <span id="s525">I want to record all that, but what happened to this larger family, your grandmother and some of the--</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: Well--</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q --other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: Well, my--my cousins--as I said, my cousin's father was in the grocery business and he had connection with Swedish companies, so he managed to get money out fairly easily because--and they moved first to Sweden, then to Israel and then--well, then my--my uncle died and his wife and the children moved to Israel and then moved back to England.</span> <span id="s529">Well, South Africa too, yeah.</span> <span id="s530">I forgot that.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: What was their name?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Grchevski(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Grchevski(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: What was the name of the supermarket chain?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: Bhutan (ph)nordstern, north star.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: North star?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: North star.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Did you go shopping in that supermarket?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: No.</span> <span id="s543">We shopped locally within walking distance because we didn't have a car, no.</span> <span id="s544">So it was about less than ten-minute walk to the marketplace and five minutes to the delicatessen store and meat market.</span> <span id="s545">The dairy market was, you know--milk was bought not in bottles but you brought your own.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Own?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Your own container and they sort of very unhygenically took a big jar and dug it into a vat of milk and then poured it into your jar, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s549">I remember seeing that--not in Berlin but that kind of distribution.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Yeah, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: So when you left on the kindertransport, this was after Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Yes, in I think the fall of '38.</span> <span id="s553">I don't know what month it was, but maybe September.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s555">Can we pause for a minute?</span> <span id="s556">You were going to say something?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s558">In the--we went to my grandmother on Friday night, usually the whole family, including my father's sister and her husband who was Polish and lived with my grandmother after my grandfather died, and they always had a big meal.</span> <span id="s559">I remember a large menu that was, you know, soup, fish and meat and then two desserts which I was waiting for ha-ha, and that took place almost every Friday in my grandmother's apartment.</span> <span id="s560">That was sort of a-- Q: Tradition?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: Tradition, yes.</span> <span id="s562">And other holidays we spent with my cousins.</span> <span id="s563">They had a house, you know, where the knee was in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A (?</span> <span id="s566">Coofersdam?)</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Yeah, yeah, a little turn.</span> <span id="s568">A: Turn, the knee, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Never heard of it, yeah, referred to that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: They were off that in a little street but they had a private home, a three-level private home and that was unusual for the--</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: It is.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: But they had money, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: It's like having a brownstone in New York City, not everybody can.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: And when you--okay, so let's--let's go back to Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s578">You go to school, school is closed?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: And?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: I went back again and I saw all kinds of crowds out and broken windows and graffiti on other things, so went straight home.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Did you--</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Took me a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Did you ever hear antisemitic comments from people on the street?</span> <span id="s585">Let's say your grocer or?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: No, not--not--not from the grocers, but from the people in the beer hall, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: Yeah, yeah, but aside from that would you ever--did attitude, you know--did the experience change?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: Not really to my face, no.</span> <span id="s589">I mean, the newspapers yes, of course, the Sturmer, the Goebbels and diatribes on there, but.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Did you have a radio at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: Did you--did your parents listen to it because clearly they would only have been German broadcasts?</span> <span id="s593">A: Yes, but you could get short waive, you could get other--</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: Oh, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: You know, you could get other stations too, but they didn't--they spoke some French but not English, but my mother's brother was an engineer and he was, of course, able to do all of these things, but he left for Spain and unfortunately he was killed in the Franco war.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Was he a soldier?</span> <span id="s597">Did he fight in it or was he in crossfire somehow?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: I don't really know the details.</span> <span id="s599">I never knew.</span> <span id="s600">But I know that he died.</span> <span id="s601">Whether it was of wounds or of illness or combination of the two, I really don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: When your parents told you that you are going to go on the kindertransport.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Were you surprised?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: Well, I don't know, but I can't quite recall my immediate reaction was, but I heard of others having gone on it and they said that they had made some arrangements.</span> <span id="s606">I don't know how they made the arrangements either, but they must--they knew some people.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: Had you studied any English by then?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: Well, yes.</span> <span id="s609">I did--we did have an American student who gave me some English lessons using the Saturday Evening Post as a text book, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: It's not a bad way to learn, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: No, because it has colloquial--</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A --English in it rather than literature, which is not quite appropriate.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s615">You can't quote Shakespeare going to buy milk.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: So I knew of--I knew some but my English wasn't good.</span> <span id="s619">That's when I got to England I was sent to a school which was for students younger than us.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Let's go back then.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: You're in the train station.</span> <span id="s623">Did you realize you may not see your parents again?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: Yes, of course I did because I knew the train was one way and I wouldn't come back the next day, and I did not know what arrangements--they were trying to get out but they--my father made an application for an American visa but because at the time he was born Vilna was Polish, he was of the Polish quota which was always filled so he could not get a visa.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: And your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Well, that doesn't matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: It doesn't matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: My mother was born in Berlin so.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: But she wouldn't have been able, as a German citizen, be able to bring him out.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: On her--</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s636">Do you remember anything of the train ride?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: Not much, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: What would be your first memories then of when you land in England, what did you find?</span> <span id="s641">What did you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: Well, I was, of course, anxious whether somebody was going to meet me, you know, because you're in a foreign country, the language you don't quite understand and--but the headmaster of the school met me and drove me to the school which was in north of London between Enfield and Potters Bar on the ridgeway and it was a boarding school so I didn't feel that I was separate from the other kids who were also not with their parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Do you know how it came to be that you were sent to a boarding school rather than taken in by a family?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: No, I don't.</span> <span id="s645">But the arrangement--I don't know anything about the arrangement my parents made, either for the kindertransport or for my schooling in England.</span> <span id="s646">I don't know where the money came from or what the connections were.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Let's go forward.</span> <span id="s648">So tell us about the school.</span> <span id="s649">What were your impressions of the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Well, the school was quite different from what I was used to.</span> <span id="s651">There was one other German refugee boy there and we got along fairly well I think, but I had to do a lot of catching up in terms of how school was conducted, homework, and English of course was the big big problem but I did pretty well, I think.</span> <span id="s652">By the time the summer vacations came along I was quite comfortable there.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: So after one full--almost a full school year if it was</span></p> <p><span id="s654">November?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s656">Well, one term because--</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s658">Okay, so it's not--it was November to May or November to April, something--</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: Well two terms actually, yeah.</span> <span id="s660">Well, I got there in October or something and--</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: The year ends in June or so and then in June I traveled to North Wales to stay with friends of the family I never heard of, but they somehow--</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Were friends of the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: Yeah, they put me up for a couple of weeks and I enjoyed going to the beach in North Wales in Llandudno.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Llandudno.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: Llandudno.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: It must be like this long.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: No, it's double L. It's L-l, double L, that was the beach town.</span> <span id="s669">They actually lived in Coburn Bay, which is easier to pronounce, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: And so did you spend a few weeks there or the summer there?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: No, just--just part of the summer.</span> <span id="s672">Then I traveled to Paris because I had heard that my parents were managed to get a flight booked out of Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: So here's a question I had.</span> <span id="s674">Did you have regular correspondence with them when you were in the school or no?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: I think I had correspondence, but I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s676">I'm not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: I couldn't--I'm sure that they could write letters at that point, but then yes, I must have had because they told me to go to Colwyn Bay and I wouldn't have known about that and then to--I guess even the phone conversation to go to Paris, so I managed to buy a ticket and go to Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: Did you stay with your uncle?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s681">My uncle lived in Neuilly at this time.</span> <span id="s682">It's a suburb of Paris and I had a good time there.</span> <span id="s683">I had been to Paris before but.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Not under these circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: Circumstances, no and then when my parents came they originally had planned to take a vacation in France with my uncle and aunt, but because of the situation we went straight back to London after a couple of days or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: Together, all three of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: When they came, did you have--do you remember having discussions, your uncle, they, you about what that situation was and I--I mean--when they--if they only came for vacation it must have been that they--</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: No, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: -- left the apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: They left but they were going to relax in--</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: That's the official version.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: So they had finished up their affairs?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Yes, they were finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: They were finished, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: In fact, I believe at one point--at least that's the story I was told--that our apartment furniture, etcetera was sent to the United States on a ship which was sunk somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Oh?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: That's the story I had.</span> <span id="s700">Whether it's true or not I never know, but it doesn't make much difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: No.</span> <span id="s702">I want to go back to another point--</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: -- that I didn't tie up earlier and that is your maid.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: How long did the family have a maid in Berlin?</span> <span id="s707">Did she disappear after things got really tough?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s709">They always had one.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Did you know her well?</span> <span id="s713">Did she help in any way?</span> <span id="s714">Did the relations change because of politics?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: I don't think so, no.</span> <span id="s716">We had a maid and for some reasons we also had a cook who came in to do some because my mother wasn't feeling well and no, I don't think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: And my--my grandmother also had a maid and she actually married an Iranian and she ended up in--ha-ha--in Tehran.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: Oh, my goodness, how exotic.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: And do you think that the maid then, in that case, was involved in wrapping up your parents affairs?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: You don't know?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: I was gone by then.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: I left.</span> <span id="s727">I left everything behind, let them clean up, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: What happened to your wonderful train set?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: Who knows?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: Who knows, yeah.</span> <span id="s731">All right.</span> <span id="s732">So they're in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: They decide that they don't want to go back?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s736">They never had the idea of going back.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: That was just--</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: They decided not to stay in France for a vacation.</span> <span id="s739">They were planning to go to England anyway because they had a visa for England.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s741">So even in France it was getting tense?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: Well, no, but they were getting tense because of the impending war, that they might not be able to leave Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: That's right, so this was the summer of '39?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: Summer of '39.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Of course the war started very quickly.</span> <span id="s746">A: In fact, when I got back to--in September '39 I remember that part, it sticks in my mind, I went back to the school in Potters Bay there and the car radio of the headmaster was on and the announcement was the BBC, "we are now in a state of war with Germany".</span> <span id="s747">The next sentence was cricket results for the day, ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: Ha-ha, ha-ha.</span> <span id="s749">Life goes on.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: Yeah, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: It's kind of absurd, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s753">The BBC had really got some other things which later on I remember distinctly.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: Such as?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: Such as in approximately 20 seconds it will be exactly six o'clock, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: Ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Or when my parents moved to Yorkshire later they said intermittent rain will be followed by local showers, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Ha-ha, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Other--the other way, local showers will be followed by--</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Intermittent rain?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: Yeah, that's the gems.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Well, it has a ring to it, you know, when you start thinking about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: Ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: Ha-ha.</span> <span id="s765">So your father and mother then come to England.</span> <span id="s766">Did they already have arrangements as to where they'd stay or did they have a way of paying for a place?</span> <span id="s767">How did that--</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: They first moved into an apartment somewhere in Golders Green.</span> <span id="s769">I don't know.</span> <span id="s770">They didn't stay with my grandmother at that time.</span> <span id="s771">They moved into an apartment in--somewhere in Golders Green.</span> <span id="s772">I don't know where they got the money from and then what happened next is that I was sent to a different school which was more appropriate for my age group, and that school was in Cranbrook, Kent and that's closer to the English channel.</span> <span id="s773">By then the war had broken out and the English got kind of scared that Hitler might jump the channel and--</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: He promised that he would.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: He promised and now this school was therefore in the danger zone and, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: Was it also a boarding school?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: Boarding school, yes.</span> <span id="s778">It's still in existence.</span> <span id="s779">The other school is not.</span> <span id="s780">But it was, I think, something like 15 miles from the coast or something like that, so very close, and when I turned 16 my status turned from refugee to enemy alien because I had a German passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: Tell me again, when is your birthday?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: On February 28th.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: So it was February 28th you became an enemy alien?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Did that mean that you had to leave school March 1st?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: I had--I didn't have to leave the school, but I was--the police picked me up because I was being interned.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: So they took you out of school?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: They took me out of school.</span> <span id="s789">The school wouldn't care, you know.</span> <span id="s790">I could have stayed there for, you know, for--I started there in--when the school term started in September sometime.</span> <span id="s791">Yeah, September until--until February I was there and I could have stayed longer as far as the school was concerned, but I was now--</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: An enemy alien.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: An enemy alien and picked up together with several other refugees who happened to be at the school.</span> <span id="s794">Some were teachers and others were.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: Do you remember the attitude of the policeman?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: He suggested follow me, pack your bag.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: So it was sort of impersonal?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s801">They had no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: And what happened then after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: I was sent to the other man.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: And what was your circumstance there?</span> <span id="s805">What was the Isle of Man look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: It was a former hotel or boarding house or something like that, several--it was fairly large.</span> <span id="s807">I forget the name of the town.</span> <span id="s808">I'll have to look that up, but it was right on the water.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Right on the water?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s811">The Isle of Man isn't very big so.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: And so everybody was housed or, you know, interned in this former hotel?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: Well, Ashley has put together a wonderful packet that she showed me.</span> <span id="s815">Does that look familiar, that photograph?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: I really don't have a recollection to tell you how it, how the--it looked.</span> <span id="s817">Where does it say, we were in the main city, Hayward.</span> <span id="s818">I don't what's the capitol of the Isle of Man.</span> <span id="s819">I'd have to look it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: We'd have to look it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: But it was in that--it was in that place, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: We might have a map of that here.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: Well.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: What memories do you have of, you know, what it looked like, what it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: Well, it was very crowded and we were restricted, we could not walk out.</span> <span id="s828">I don't know whether there was barbed wire or not, but we were certainly closed in.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: There's a place called Ramsey Mooragh, a central camp Hutchinson camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: Central camp I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Russian.</span> <span id="s832">Something wrote that we had classes in literature and languages and theology and philosophy?</span> <span id="s833">A: That was later, yeah.</span> <span id="s834">I think you have the wrong map there.</span> <span id="s835">Would you like to give it to me?</span> <span id="s836">I can find it more easily.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: So it was crowded?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: It was very crowded, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: Did you have any official announcements, any official, you know--anybody come to talk with you about--here we have a map sheet.</span> <span id="s840">Here's this Isle of Man.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: Douglas, yes, Douglas.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: Douglas.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s844">That's what I was looking for.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Douglas.</span> <span id="s846">War time use of Cunningham's Young Men's Holiday Camp and world war 2 camps was Granville, Sefton, Hutchinson, Central, Palace and Metropole and I'd like to get a picture of what went on.</span> <span id="s847">You arrived there, it's crowded.</span> <span id="s848">Were you like three to a room, four to a room?</span> <span id="s849">Were there other German Jewish kids--</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q -- that you were with?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: Yes, there were Jewish kids and some Jewish teachers too, but.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: Any grown-ups?</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: Grown-ups too?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: Yes, oh yes, grown-ups of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: I wondered.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: There were refugees that lived in the coastal area that--that had moved there earlier, that had moved to England over since 1933 and they didn't have a chance to become British citizens.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: Was it only people from that coastal area that's called a danger zone that were interned or was it also anybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: No, it was just that at first.</span> <span id="s861">Later on they interned some other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Well, your parents, for example, wouldn't have they also been?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: My dad I think was for--just for a week, but later, much later.</span> <span id="s864">I was gone by then.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: Was there a way for you to let them know what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: No, I think the school called.</span> <span id="s867">I had no--no way of sending any--any mail or phone calls, and cell phones had not yet been invented, ha-ha.</span> <span id="s868">Q: Were you taken by surprise?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s870">It was, you know--you don't know what comes next, whether you're going to be become bombed or just put away somewhere, and actually we stayed in the Isle of Man for, I don't know, several months and then we were sent to Huyton, near Liverpool, which was a new housing development which had never been lived in and they just put us into the semi-finished houses and from there then we were shipped to Canada.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: Before we get there--</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: Do you recall what a daily routine was in the Isle of Man in this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: You got up in the morning, you get fed in the mess hall something and then you--there was nothing much to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: So there wasn't--</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: Except sit around.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: So there wasn't a sort of like there wasn't libraries or?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: There weren't things you were forced to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: Was there a library?</span> <span id="s882">Was there--so just sort of you eat and you sit?</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s884">Yeah.</span> <span id="s885">Well, no.</span> <span id="s886">At that point the teachers weren't organized into doing anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: The question was did the teachers help?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: It came so suddenly that most people didn't take--I mean, I had one little suitcase with the clothes I had.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: At school?</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: At school, that was all I had.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: Do you recall when you--did you have direct contact with your parents at some point while you were in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: So you just assumed that they would know where you were because of the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: Or hoped that they did?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: And they weren't able to write to you or contact you?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: Not until we got to Canada.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: So that was separate, that is, your parents had one route and you had another route?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: But their route was not as an enemy alien or was it?</span> <span id="s904">A: Well, yes of course, they were also German citizen but they lived there.</span> <span id="s905">They had moved out of London to some place, I forgot where, a small village north of London because of the bomb scare or something like that so--and then, because my father was trained as an orthopedic surgeon, he applied for and got a--a license to be a doctor in Britain without going through the exam.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: Which was huge.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: Which was huge, yeah, and so he got a job in a coal mining district in Yorkshire, in Wakefield and they moved to Wakefield and they first lived in a small house and then later on they bought a much larger house because nobody else had, in the war time, wanted to buy a large house.</span> <span id="s908">They got it cheaply and then, in fact, we were just in England last October and I went to look at it.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: Yeah, it's still there.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: So while their son is in a camp, they're able to become home owners?</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: Well, that was later, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s914">I'm confused.</span> <span id="s915">What does later mean?</span> <span id="s916">Still during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: A year later I think.</span> <span id="s918">This was '39-1940.</span> <span id="s919">I think they bought this in '41.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: That's a nice looking house, brick, large.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: uhu.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s923">Then explain it a little bit to me.</span> <span id="s924">You are in a camp in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: Right, from March 1, 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: uhu.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: You're in the--you're taken to the Isle of Man, several months you're there?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: uhu.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: Sitting around basically?</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: And then at some point, was it the summer of '40 you were taken to Liverpool?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s935">And how long are you in Liverpool?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: I don't know, two, three weeks, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: And then shipped to Canada?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: All the while your parents are--your father's arrested for a week and yet then he's released, he gets a job, he's able to become certified as a doctor, as an orthopedic surgeon?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Moves to Wakefield?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: uhu.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: And is able to buy a--first a smaller then a larger house?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: Well, I think the first one they rented.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: Oh, okay.</span> <span id="s946">But then buys this larger--</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: --kind of house?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: And they must have been, of course, frantic to know where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: Well, by that time they had some news or it was in the newspaper or something like that I was in--in Quebec.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s953">So let's talk about that a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: All right.</span> <span id="s955">The boat ride was slow.</span> <span id="s956">We were in a convoy with destroyers on both sides.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: Well, you were a dangerous group?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s959">This was the--</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: You brought things.</span> <span id="s962">I think the HMS Sobieski, but they had packed it so full that I had to sleep on the dining room table during the crossing, which was about a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: Oh, my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: Or more, more than a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: So the boat was the HMS Sobieski?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: And it was--and there were U boats in the waters?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: Well, I assumed because they had them escort the destroyers.</span> <span id="s969">There were several ships going.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: Some supply ships I guess, but they wouldn't tell us of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: And we ended up going up the St. Lawrence all the way to Three Rivers, Quebec.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: I don't know where that is.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: It's halfway between Quebec City and Montreal.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: That's quite far north.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: And what do you remember from that?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: Well, the first thing I remember is that they had a prisoner of war camp in that city and the Canadians, in their wisdom, wanted to put us refugees in with the prisoners of war.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: You were enemy aliens.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: Yeah, that's right, but the prisoners of war being protected by the Geneva Convention objected to have Jews in their camp so they Canadians had to build another camp right next door to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: It is a bit of a theater of the absurd, isn't it?</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: Well, that sort of verifies the Jews and the military intelligence.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: Ha-ha.</span> <span id="s985">That could have been another BBC kind of proclamation, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: Ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: Very well put, ha-ha.</span> <span id="s988">And was this the closest that you came to actual enemy aliens of the United Kingdom?</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s990">They were about 400 feet away.</span> <span id="s991">We were on the boat and they were—</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: Ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: --ha-ha, off the river.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: And so how long were you in this newly constructed--</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: Camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: Camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s998">Must have been about a year or so and-- Q: That ends up being a very long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1000">In fact, I learned all about baseball because in the dining hall, if you piled several tables on top of one another and then climbed on top there were skylight windows and you could look out into the baseball field.</span> <span id="s1001">That was a professional baseball field that was next door so we had nothing else to do so we climbed up and watched baseball, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: That's really weird.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: Somebody in the camp, I don't know which camp this was, but I think it might have been the one in Quebec, took--smuggled the camera and put it in a shoe box and took pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: Oh, my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: That was strictly--</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: And you have some of those?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: Yes, I have pictures of those.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: Well, the people who were running these places, whether it was in the Isle of Man or Liverpool or Canada, how did they treat you folks?</span> <span id="s1009">Did they know how absurd it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Did they realize?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: No, they were dumb, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: Ha-ha, that's--</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: We were then shipped to a camp in--near Fredrickton in New Brunswick and there that was in the middle of the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: Yeah, nowhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: Middle of nowhere.</span> <span id="s1018">We were cutting--taken out of camp to cut trees to thin out--</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: The forest?</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1021">I learned how to cut trees with an ax, and saw stuff, split wood and every good thing like that and one of the things I remember, one of the guards who were all veterans of World War I, I believe, since the others were used in sat down on the cut of tree stump and we had to help for him to get up because he couldn't get up, ha-ha, but here are the pictures.</span> <span id="s1022">Now, I'm not sure which camp--this may have been the camp in Three Rivers because of the table things up here.</span> <span id="s1023">Here's a typical room we were in.</span> <span id="s1024">It's not pictures of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: Yeah, of the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: Of the place, and here's barbed wire fences and sort of.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: It still looks kind of bloomy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: Industrial places, yeah.</span> <span id="s1029">Here's one.</span> <span id="s1030">Oh, this fell off.</span> <span id="s1031">Well, that was a--the hall, the dining hall somewhere and you can see the barbed wire here.</span> <span id="s1032">Let's see, there's some more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: Were you angry that all of this was happening?</span> <span id="s1034">A: Now here's something to note.</span> <span id="s1035">We all had to wear blue shirts with a big red circle on the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: Target practice?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: Target practice, yes.</span> <span id="s1038">Here's the view of the camp.</span> <span id="s1039">I don't know how he took these pictures, but he did a good job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: Can we keep this?</span> <span id="s1041">Okay, thank you.</span> <span id="s1042">This is a photo of the HMS Sobieski, which we will include in the information that we've got, thank you.</span> <span id="s1043">That is, I come back to my question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: If somebody had picked me up when I'm 16 years old and I had just fled from danger and they're calling me an enemy alien, I'd have a few very distinct feelings about this whole system.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: Well, yes and no because you're being removed, you didn't have any choices.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: Of course not, you had no choices.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: They didn't give you a choice.</span> <span id="s1049">You can do this or that.</span> <span id="s1050">You just go, you know, and you know, if the--I guess the drive is to keep alive, not jump the barbed wire fence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: No, not jump the barbed wire fence, but did you feel anger and resentment towards the British authorities or panic?</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: Panic more, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: What was--what did you feel panicked about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: Well, what's going to be next.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1056">Because none of this is known.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: None of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: None of this is known, no.</span> <span id="s1060">Now, some of the internees that were in the camp, and in this one and the one near Frederickton were German seamen who happened to be in British ports at the time who were also interns.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: So they weren't refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: They weren't refugees and the other one, which I remember distinctly was two, two acrobats who were performing somewhere and they were--and I remember them because they were diligently practiced every day.</span> <span id="s1063">They did the kind of acrobatics where you lift somebody and do contortions and, you know, without--just for floor exercises and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s1064">Q: This was in the Isle of Man?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: No, that was in Canada.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: In Canada?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: The Isle of Man there wouldn't have been floor room to sit down and stretch out, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: You know, like they say, sometimes you can't make this stuff up, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: Ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: You know, who would think, ha-ha, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: Ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: Were they--were--did you talk to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: Oh, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: And were they sort of like, were the discussions and interactions normal?</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: Oh, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: So it wasn't they had a feeling of oh, my God?</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: They--they had--</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: Here's these Jews.</span> <span id="s1079">We don't want to be with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1081">They weren't Nazis.</span> <span id="s1082">They didn't practice—</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: {Coughs} Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: And I think the people who were seafarers are more international minded anyway because they called on various ports, so they didn't have the indoctrination.</span> <span id="s1085">They weren't always home either to see that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: {Coughs} Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1087">{Coughs}.</span> <span id="s1088">I don't know how to suppress these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: Would you like a cough drop.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: No, I'm fine.</span> <span id="s1091">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: We have those, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: That's okay.</span> <span id="s1094">It just came on unexpectedly.</span> <span id="s1095">Are we on again?</span> <span id="s1096">Okay.</span> <span id="s1097">Well, you know that's interesting, I have a theory that the Netherlands is the way it is because of exactly that reason.</span> <span id="s1098">It was a seafaring country.</span> <span id="s1099">It's economy for hundreds of years was in trade by and I think that's one of the reasons it was such an open place to the world maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: Maybe even a bit too open.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1103">This is not from the camp, but that's about what the New Brunswick thing looks like, all the piles of wood and little trees that were cut down to thin out the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: And how long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: Until 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: You made friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1108">Permanent--well, we made friends really after we left because we all traveled to Winnipeg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: So explain that a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: You weren't friends with people--well--</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: Oh, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1113">There were friends there and, in fact, in one of the camps they organized--the teachers organized some classes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: This is already in Canada?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: Yeah, that's in Canada, so we had some schooling.</span> <span id="s1116">Not very much but some.</span> <span id="s1117">But I was with some others to pass the metric form, gill.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: That's not bad.</span> <span id="s1119">That's not bad at all, ha-ha, you know, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: Ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: Jeepers, for being pumped out of school at the age of</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">16, ha-ha and--</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: And did you attend Magill?</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A: No.</span> <span id="s1128">Well, I couldn't.</span> <span id="s1129">I was behind, but no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: Magill was kind enough to pass the exam papers to the teachers and so we could--</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: Take them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: Take the exam in the camp, that's why that's Magill.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s1135">Were the classes in German or English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: In English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: In English, so the teachers were not refugees themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: They were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1141">What they were teaching in English too so they had to know some English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: So what happened?</span> <span id="s1143">What happened when it all came to an end?</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: Well, through the good auspices of the Canadian Jewish Committee and, in my case and some others, the auspices of the alumni of Sigma Alpha Mi fraternity who financed four of us to come to Winnipeg, stay in a boarding house, attend--finish high school and then attend university.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: Well, before we get there--</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: What made it happen that you were no longer enemy aliens or were you still?</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: Oh, yeah, we still were but we were in Canada now and the Germans were not going to leap the Atlantic to—</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: To Canada?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: Also the--we were Jewish and the Canada Jewish committee vouched for us somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: I mean, the English just didn't differentiate between a Jew and a non Jew in terms of it's just--</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: It was a passport issue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1155">The passport issue and the passport I had didn't have the J on it like they did later, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: Then my next question is is that were there people that you left in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1159">So it was only because of the vouching of the Jewish, Canada Jewish committee?</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: --committee and the financial assistance from the fraternity alumni.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: Well, tell us about this, because who is this fraternity alumni and what is this organization and how did your path interflow across it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: Sigma Alpha Mu is a fraternity that was founded 101 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">{Someone speaks, inaudible}</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: He should say it because we're on tape, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: Yeah, they had brought some refugees over from Germany before that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: To Canada?</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: To Canada, yes and--</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: Was it a Jewish--</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: Yes, it's a Jewish fraternity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: And there was this particular group were alumni from the city, in the city of Winnipeg, from the University of Manitoba, and they got together and, you know, there were most of them I think were in the garment business at that time so they were reasonably well off.</span> <span id="s1172">Not billionaires, but they managed to finance the four of us and of course university--that's the mail.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1174">It's okay.</span> <span id="s1175">We can keep on going.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1177">The university fees at that time were much lower than they are now.</span> <span id="s1178">I mean, it's--you're talking about $100, $300 a year or something like that so it wasn't enormous amount they had to come up with but it was very nice of them.</span> <span id="s1179">We traveled all the way to Winnipeg and stayed in a boarding house and I'm still friends with one of or--well, one of--two others and I kept close touch even after we graduated and one kid there lived in New Jersey and he died a few years ago and Hans Sadler lives in Ottawa and he's still there, at least last time I talked to him which was about a half year ago, so we're still in touch.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: Was this the first freedom, was this essentially freedom?</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1182">I was unfettered.</span> <span id="s1183">I mean, we could go anywhere in theory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: And the Canada-Jewish community vouched for you, but there were so many other kids left in the--what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: Well, some others got somewhere else but I don't know about them, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: I think they may have released more at that point.</span> <span id="s1188">What happened to the rest of them somebody wrote a history of this, but I don't know.</span> <span id="s1189">I don't have the address saying they kept sort of details of what happened to the other internees, but ultimately of course they were released.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: Well, you were then in Winnipeg.</span> <span id="s1191">Is that the first you were able to freely correspond with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: No.</span> <span id="s1193">We had those, you know, the war-time letters, the blue envelopes.</span> <span id="s1194">You could send one a month from the intern camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: And you were half away world from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: Yes, a long way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1198">So you finished your undergraduate studies in Winnipeg?</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1200">I finished grade 11 and 12 in less than a year because I had some--some credits already and then I took a degree in mathematics and physics, physics and mathematics, which ever way you want to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: It happens to be my daughter's favorite course, by the way, physics.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: And that was your undergraduate degree?</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: And by that time the war is over, isn't it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1207">I graduated in '46.</span> <span id="s1208">The war was over and I traveled from Winnipeg actually to Washington, just to sightsee.</span> <span id="s1209">I stayed one night or two nights in the fraternity house here.</span> <span id="s1210">They had a fraternity house at that time and then traveled to New York where my cousin lived, and then traveled to England to see my parents because I hadn't seen them since 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q: That's amazing.</span> <span id="s1212">I mean, that part of this is so amazing is that everybody is in safety, relative safety, but that you are--that you are prevented--</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: Oceans apart.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: Oceans apart and that they're leading a reasonably normal life in a war time--</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: --place, but they're not in any more danger than anybody else would be and you are in a camp--</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: --you know.</span> <span id="s1219">Did they know of such details of what your life was like or were you only able to tell them then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: No, I wasn't--well, the details are hard to communicate in a letter that's only this long, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: One of the little details in the camp in New Brunswick, we used to go out to cut wood but most of the time we spent.</span> <span id="s1223">We also learned to make camouflage nets, macrame.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: macrame.</span> <span id="s1225">Was that useful in later life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: Well, I learned how to do knot things.</span> <span id="s1227">The amusing part, at one point there were a lot of deer around.</span> <span id="s1228">Normally when you go to the zoo the deer are behind the fence.</span> <span id="s1229">This time we were behind the fence, the deer were looking at us from the outside, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: There's something ironic in that picture, ha-ha, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: Ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: Oh my, oh my.</span> <span id="s1233">Well, when did the panic stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: Well, by the time I was in Canada I think I felt more--more secure and people were in the same boat, you know.</span> <span id="s1235">We didn't panic anymore.</span> <span id="s1236">We were not happy, you know, to be behind barbed wire but not--not unhappy or repressed or fearful that something would happen.</span> <span id="s1237">I mean, the military still were kind of stupid, to put it mildly.</span> <span id="s1238">I mean, I remember one time the inspecting officer came into the kitchen, which was also staffed by the internees, and sort of put his fist into the soup or something and--ha-ha, educated people, you know, they just stood there like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: What do you do?</span> <span id="s1240">What do you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: When you saw your parents again had they changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: They had grown older, but I think basically not, basically not.</span> <span id="s1244">My dad was happy to be employed in medical things, in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1245">He had good friends in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1246">They all liked him.</span> <span id="s1247">My mother was able to exercise her child psychiatry and she went to various clinics in Bradford and Wakefield and Leeds I think and she traveled from one to the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: When did their citizenship change and when did your citizen zip change?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: My citizenship changed when I stayed four years -- five years in Canada.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: So you became a Canadian citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: And theirs, did they become citizens of the U.K.?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: Oh, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: And did you stay with them then when you went back to England or did you not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: Well, I stayed with them on the weekends.</span> <span id="s1256">I went to the University of Birmingham, which is far away and I stayed there and in a lodging house or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q: And what were you studying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A: Physics.</span> <span id="s1259">Nuclear physics actually at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: And after you finished was it a Ph.D program?</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1262">In '49 I got my Ph.D and I got a job in a company, Associate Electrical Industries in a research lab in Aldermaston, which is near Redding, that's west of London, and I stayed there for a year and a half or two years, I'm not quite sure.</span> <span id="s1263">The work was very interesting because that was at the time that semi conductors were just becoming useful and the university--and actually took some courses at the University of Redding on semi conductors because the work I was doing in that research lab was growing semi conductor crystals and whatnot, so that was trying to duplicate the work done by Bell labs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: What happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: Well, the work was interesting but the pay was terrible.</span> <span id="s1266">I mean, they paid so--so little that in--in future job applications I always put the--what I earned down in British pounds because it wasn't obvious how few dollars it was, ha-ha.</span> <span id="s1267">And after that I was lucky to get a two-year appointment to the with the Canadian government to work in their research lab in Ottawa so I went back to Ottawa and I worked for two years, two-and-a-half years there and then the appointment ended and I worked for Canada Air in Montreal in their research lab.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: My mother worked for them too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: Oh, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1271">As a secretary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s1273">And I worked there for, I don't know, one or two years, or something like this and then my cousin who was in living in New York by that time said why don't you come down to New York and I can find a job for you and this was for a small company that made scientific instruments, so I emigrated from Canada into New York by car, ha-ha, and I worked in New York for eight years, nine years.</span> <span id="s1274">Six years when I met you so eight years I guess, and it was interesting work in a way that I had to do anything from designing circuitry to supervising the assembly line to designing the cabinets and having them photographed for of the advertising brochure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: Did you end up in the advertising brochures?</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1277">A photographer did this but I told him watch what angle to take and what to emphasize and whatnot and this company made things like PH meters and photometers under their own name and also for some other brands and.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: And mainly for the--well, for the printing business and for the pharmaceutical industry and always when marking objects to buying a generic brand, I always think of what the--the--the instruments that were bought by America and other big companies looked like when they came back to the company I worked for for servicing.</span> <span id="s1280">You would not believe that an instrument which uses colored light beams to examine the concentration of chemicals looked like it was thrown into a vat of paint.</span> <span id="s1281">They were dirty, they were incredible.</span> <span id="s1282">I just looked at them, how could they even use them in this condition?</span> <span id="s1283">So my--the--the white coat image that the advertisers like to project was destroyed forever, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: Ha-ha.</span> <span id="s1285">When or did you go back to Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: Only after the Burgermeister from Berlin invited us to go there.</span> <span id="s1287">In fact, we had to pay our own way to get there.</span> <span id="s1288">The fair we had to pay-- {Unidentified woman interrupts:} They paid fair for some people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: Yeah, but they put us out for a week in a fancy hotel and--</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: What year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">A: The year before the Berlin Wall came down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q: So it was Mumpers probably, Mumpers was the mayor.</span> <span id="s1293">I remember hearing right around that time of--of such--such events.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A: Well, they had many many groups.</span> <span id="s1295">Thousands came back, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1297">Did you go see where your apartment was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: Ha-ha.</span> <span id="s1299">The number--the house number is still there but the buildings are completely destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: So they were bombed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: They were bombed.</span> <span id="s1302">They built up some new stuff, jerrybuilt some stuff that looked pretty awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: Not the building I lived in was beautiful.</span> <span id="s1305">It was a very old building.</span> <span id="s1306">I had two courtyards and the entrance actually went through a entrance big enough to drive the horse-drawn garbage truck through and there was a door on the side that led to the staircase, but they had the horse-drawn garbage truck come in and they emptied the garbage can from the back yard and they came back out again.</span> <span id="s1307">You must know something about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: Oh, yeah, ha-ha.</span> <span id="s1309">So that building probably that was destroyed was probably--</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: --was probably a 19th century building.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: Or something like that.</span> <span id="s1314">Did you have coal ovens, was that how the hospital was heated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: Yes, yes, briquettes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: I remember the briquettes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: Tile, tile ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: Sometimes they were quite beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: Yes, they were quite good.</span> <span id="s1320">They kept warm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1322">So the number was there but the building was gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">Q: Was the sport palace still there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A: I think so and--yeah, on the corner there was an office building which I remember from my youth because unlike the--most of the building, it wasn't a stucco structure, it had stone sort of facing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">A: The flat stone with sharp edges.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">Q: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">A: And as a kid I used to walk along and sort of drag my finger along the sharp edge just because it felt funny, you know, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Q: Ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">A: And that building was still there.</span> <span id="s1332">The pharmacy on the block was still there and some other store was still there, but.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Q: Was there any kind of connection for you to what you were seeing or was this like it could have happened to another person a long time ago?</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A: Well, it's, you know, it's--it's no personal loss because I was much better off by that time.</span> <span id="s1335">It was interesting to see that the aubonne (ph) was still there but, in fact, they closed down.</span> <span id="s1336">They had used it as a store or something like that, something peculiar there.</span> <span id="s1337">The trains didn't run that day or maybe they had some, but otherwise it looked drab as usual, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: Hmm.</span> <span id="s1339">Well, I've come, I think, close to the end of the interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: The last thing I'd like to ask is sort of like to wrap it up is your personal connection.</span> <span id="s1342">You met in New York I believe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: And your wife's name is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: Marjorie.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: Marjorie.</span> <span id="s1347">Do you have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1349">We have two children, a boy Jonathan and a girl Valerie and they--Valerie lives in Germantown and Jonathan lives in Pointed Rocks and is about to move even farther away, but we have ten grandchildren altogether.</span> <span id="s1350">Some are his, hers and theirs and my son married twice so he has a blended family of seven children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: Uhu.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: And my daughter has twins and one other girl, a boy and girl twin and another girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q:And--</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: And there are pictures over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: Oh, I see there's lots of them {Unidentified woman: Everybody is over there.}</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: Everybody is over there, yeah.</span> <span id="s1357">Have they expressed an interest--have you talked to them about all that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: My daughter, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">{Unidentified woman: My son.}</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: My son isn't interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s1362">Is there something that you think needs to be part of the story that we didn't cover that I didn't ask that you'd want people to know about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">{Unidentified woman: You became a U.S. citizen.}</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: Yes, I became a U.S. citizen after I lived in New York and I got a job with the National Bureau of Standards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Well, I had to be a U.S. citizen for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q: Did you keep your Canadian citizenship?</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A: No, I couldn't at that time.</span> <span id="s1368">It wasn't possible.</span> <span id="s1369">I should have maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">{Unidentified woman: At that point it wasn't dual citizenship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A: No.</span> <span id="s1372">I think I missed one point.</span> <span id="s1373">I felt most desperate was when I was entering the University of Manitoba, what courses to take.</span> <span id="s1374">I couldn't ask my parents, I couldn't consult with anybody.</span> <span id="s1375">I sort of knew what I wanted to do but, you know, it's nice to talk it over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">A: And I had never--it just wasn't--by mail it wasn't--my parents wanted me to be medical, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q: Of course, that's what they were, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: But I wasn't interested in that, but I felt very much alone, lonely, making that decision what course to take and what subjects to--</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: Well, English is such a language that has such, you know, you have words that have so many different meanings and when you talk about what course to take one can understand it by should I take physics or how should I direct my life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">A: Yeah, well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: Ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: And in a sense the two are related.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A: Because after all, it makes a difference if you take, I don't know, mining, engineering.</span> <span id="s1386">You'll have a different life than if you take--</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: Did you regret the decisions--</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: --that you took?</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: No, I didn't but I was unsure of myself at that point what should I do.</span> <span id="s1391">I think in order to sort of--in a sense of guilt I took a first-year course in biology in the university, although I really wasn't that interested in it, but I thought at least something that pre med, you know, ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: To make parents happy.</span></p>
