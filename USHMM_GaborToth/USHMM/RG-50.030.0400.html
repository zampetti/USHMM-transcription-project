friends and my other, too, but mostly the friends were Jewish.</span> <span id="s205">I want to explain, as I remember the times in Poland, for Jewish people, Jewish youths, they don’t have a big field where to go.</span> <span id="s206">When they finish school, high school, they were bright people, and they couldn’t get government position.</span> <span id="s207">They -- it was very, very hard to get into university in that time, and they didn’t have where to go after school, only in a professional school, like at a tailor, a tishler, a shoe -- shoemaker, a bookkeeper, a nurse.</span> <span id="s208">Poland in that time start to be under the influence of the Germans, so anti-Semitism start to grow there, more than bi -- than right after the World War І.</span> <span id="s209">So mostly the people -- it’s very little, people who get doctors and lawyers, they’re very little bit from the very rich and who have connections, of course there are, but very little.</span> <span id="s210">Mostly the peppele -- population wasn’t so successful.</span> <span id="s211">That’s the truth, whatever they want.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Was that something that was understood and spoken about in the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Yes -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Ho-How would you -- how would you talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: They saw there were very bright people between them, and they want to get into the university.</span> <span id="s216">For example, I have a nephew, a -- a cousin, who was very bright, his name was Tolchinski, Boris Tolchinski, and he finish a Polish high school, a very famous po -- and he want to get a doctor -- to be a doctor, and it was impossible to get in university, in spite that his grades were excellent.</span> <span id="s217">And he came to my mother -- as I told you, they we have a mill, and the people will leave their grain in the morning, and the end of the month, the boss of the farm came to us to pay for the whole month that his people use our mill.</span> <span id="s218">And his name was Professor Zehofsky, he always -- was -- had the farm, and he was a professor in a university.</span> <span id="s219">And as my mother told me about -- because I was small that when her nephew finished and he was -- wants so much to be a doctor, he went to the farm.</span> <span id="s220">And th -- make an appointment with this Professor Zehofsky is -- he knows her from the coming for years, for years with the account of his farm.</span> <span id="s221">And she ask him if he could help to put him in to the -- the -- showing him that he finish a Polish gymnasium, a Polish high school, with excellent grades.</span> <span id="s222">And he is sleeping thinking about being a doctor, and he help him, and he get in, and he finish medicine, yes.</span> <span id="s223">And he was in Poland so -- survived the war, and then he came to Canada, and worked as a doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: A-And the professor that --</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: It was my cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: -- your mother went to, to ask for help --</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Professor Zehofsky.</span> <span id="s228">He was Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: He was Jewish, or non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: He was not Jewish, he was Polish, but he was like a friend for us, after so many years, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: You said that anti-Semitism a -- as you grew older, you were beginning to be more aware of it, what -- was this something that was talked about ever, for instance at the dinner table?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Or did you ever hear your parents talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s237">For example, we have neighbors who lived in our house for as mu -- as long as I remember, and they were enough poor they work, and sometimes they didn’t have the money to pay rent, and my mother was waiting for months, for months until, you know, they -- their situation improved, and then they paid off.</span> <span id="s238">People who were -- normally who were like friends, specially the kids were playing together, and when we went to the ghetto, all our goods were -- we used to push to the neighbors, because we have only 15 minutes to go out from the house.</span> <span id="s239">And we could take very little with us.</span> <span id="s240">We thought the war will be maybe a couple of weeks we’ll return, and we’ll have better good -- better goods.</span> <span id="s241">But it works out different.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: What were the names of those neighbors?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Leshchevska, Kachinska, Millefsky.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: They were Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: They were Polish --</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: -- Polish, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: So what you’re describing is a lot of pretty relaxed interaction between non-Jews and Jews --</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Yes, yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: -- in Wilna.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: -- and then they were so very, very friendly between us in that time, before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Do yo -- and can you speak a little bit about what language was spoken at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: At home I spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s254">And in the school in the beginning, I was in the -- in a Jewish Polish school.</span> <span id="s255">It was Jewish children, but the main language was Polish, the first four years.</span> <span id="s256">And then I changed to a Jewish gymnasium, after the six years.</span> <span id="s257">And then I was starting gymnasium until the beginning of the war, until it was destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: A-And then you had to speak Russian?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Russian I have to start to speak in 1939 when the -- when Poland was divided, and Wilna start Russian for a short time, and then they gave it to Lithuanian after two months.</span> <span id="s260">And it was Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s261">But in the first years when it was Lithuanian, the main language was Russian, because the population was not Lithuanian, the Lithuanian was otherwise.</span> <span id="s262">Little by little they start to come from the counties after the war.</span> <span id="s263">After the war for a long time, Vilnius was Lithuanian but the main language was Russian.</span> <span id="s264">For a long time, and then they start to protest th-that they want -- when they have enough people already in Wilna, they came from all kinds of the counties, they start to talk Lithuanian, in the stores, in the banks, in that -- but before it was rush -- Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: What were the political beliefs of your family?</span> <span id="s266">Were they very clear to you as a young girl, or as you got older?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: I was mostly under the influence of my sisters, like socialists.</span> <span id="s268">And my parents never was in their way, but my father was religious.</span> <span id="s269">He was religious, and maybe he was upset a little bit that the children went out, but it was such a direction in that time in the Lithuanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: And when you say that you were under the influence of your sisters and they were socialists, what did that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: They believed in working people.</span> <span id="s272">They belong to organizations, I wer -- and the school was also a little bit in the left direction.</span> <span id="s273">And they believed in Russia, in the Soviet Union, because we didn’t have any information what’s doing there.</span> <span id="s274">But the propaganda was so high.</span> <span id="s275">The people saw th -- especially for the Jewish people, they look and study, they’ll be able to study, they’ll be free, they will -- for example, I’ll tell you a story.</span> <span id="s276">I was in my school, as I told you, it also was with a left direction, and when Russia gave Vilnius up to the Lithuanian, they came with their propaganda to the schools, and ask the children if they want to study and have their freedom, they can go to Russia, to Byelorussia, to Ukraine.</span> <span id="s277">And they can study free, and they can became teachers and engineers and what, and they’ll have their freedom.</span> <span id="s278">A lot -- and who wants?</span> <span id="s279">We can make lists, and tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, they can leave.</span> <span id="s280">And lots of the older classes of the children, they scribed themself in the lists.</span> <span id="s281">And they are going to Byelorussia to work, to -- to study, to the schools, and they -- and they left very warm and nice families.</span> <span id="s282">And left during the week to Russia.</span> <span id="s283">And weg -- they came there -- of course they came into the schools, to the university, one -- get the teacher th -- and they -- but they saw the hard life of there.</span> <span id="s284">They saw that the reality is different.</span> <span id="s285">And they didn’t have a way back.</span> <span id="s286">They couldn’t go back to their parent.</span> <span id="s287">And you know, children, they tried, that -- but they left their parents, their homes, and it was lot of them.</span> <span id="s288">And one of them was a sister of a good friend of mine.</span> <span id="s289">And they went after, and they start to study, of course they were hungry, they didn’t have what to wear, they have -- and they were homesick.</span> <span id="s290">And after a couple of months, or a half a year, they came again with lists.</span> <span id="s291">Who wants to go to see their parents, to the -- of course lots of people said they want.</span> <span id="s292">And the sister of my friend also [indecipherable] she want to go to Wilna, back to see the parent.</span> <span id="s293">And they instead to send -- and after awhile, instead to send them back to Wilna, they send them to Siberia.</span> <span id="s294">A lot of them.</span> <span id="s295">And this girl, her name was -- now she [indecipherable] after the -- after the war she get married.</span> <span id="s296">And she went there, and she was working very hard, and she was in the forest to cut the trees, and they gave her a little warm jacket, and some big shoes, and the [indecipherable] worked very, very hard, and we didn’t have any information.</span> <span id="s297">One thing was good, the whole family was killed, and she was alive.</span> <span id="s298">And she worked very hard, and in -- it was the -- the patriation from the -- the Polish citizens after the war.</span> <span id="s299">I think it was in ’47 - ’48 that they can return to Poland to get their Polish citizenship.</span> <span id="s300">She describe herself [indecipherable] return to Poland and then she went to -- to [indecipherable] or somewhere, and finally she came to the United States.</span> <span id="s301">When I came to the United States in ’76, I met her, and she told me all the stories.</span> <span id="s302">Her family was killed, and she was working the place I am working now, and she recognize me as the friend of her sister.</span> <span id="s303">And she said, “You know what, I have a job for you.</span> <span id="s304">If you will be accepted,” she said, “I am working for the Jewish labor committee in New York, and I am getting married” -- he -- a second time her husband also died young.</span> <span id="s305">“And I’ll introduce you, because they need a Jewish secretary.”</span> <span id="s306">My English was very poor in that time.</span> <span id="s307">And she bought me in, and only one person spoke Yiddish, the other spoke English, was a broken English.</span> <span id="s308">She introduced me to the executive director, it was a [indecipherable] in that time.</span> <span id="s309">And he said, okay, if you will take a course of English, if you would take a course of -- of typing.</span> <span id="s310">If you would take this and this, come after three months, and she’s working o -- for three months you’re working, and we’ll -- she’ll show you the work, and then we’ll come and we’ll see.</span> <span id="s311">I did everything he said, I took a course of English, I took a course of typing.</span> <span id="s312">My Yiddish was -- it was very good years ago, but for the 30 years I was in Russia, I forget also.</span> <span id="s313">But I try to remember, and I worked very much the job because I was 52, and I still don’t want to be a bargain on my children.</span> <span id="s314">I want a little bit my own life.</span> <span id="s315">And she’s show me a lot, the girl.</span> <span id="s316">And after three months I came.</span> <span id="s317">Of course my English was very poor, and my typing a letter that I supposed to type now in five minutes, I type in that period of time for an hour.</span> <span id="s318">But the Yiddish was okay.</span> <span id="s319">He said we’ll take you to try, three months, and I was trying, but it still was very hard.</span> <span id="s320">And the most horrible thing was for me to take the telephones.</span> <span id="s321">I mixed up the names, I -- he dictate me an letter, my boss, and I tried to write everything like he said.</span> <span id="s322">And when I came for his signature he crossed out one, two, three, four.</span> <span id="s323">I said, “Why are you crossing out?</span> <span id="s324">I typed everything you said.”</span> <span id="s325">He said, “And I said I didn’t say, but you are a secretary, you have to make the letter -- letter right.”</span> <span id="s326">Later on, when he gave me a letter, I get friends with some of the other secretaries, who are English secretaries, Linda, please check, make the correction.</span> <span id="s327">She made the corrections, I [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s328">Anyway, it was three months and they still didn’t -- we’ll take another three months.</span> <span id="s329">I was nervous, will I stay at the job?</span> <span id="s330">And the Yiddish start to be a little bit less, and nobody knows the Yiddish, only English.</span> <span id="s331">Only one person.</span> <span id="s332">Finally they -- I think that get -- they get used to my personality, and they accepted me.</span> <span id="s333">And during the years I learned, and they gave me things that I don’t need too much, the language like traking -- taking track of the membership, or of the federation stuff, who was -- and they picked up, and meantime I learned, and I am there for 23 years.</span> <span id="s334">Still working, in spite when I came was 18 people at the staff, and now is seven, I am still within the seven, not knowing so well the language.</span> <span id="s335">But I doing other things that are enough important and the [indecipherable] were occupied.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: Let me take you back --</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: -- still sort of before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Sorry for digressing.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: No, no, that’s fine, it -- it helps to

have Jewish schools, and we have Jewish synagogues, and we have [indecipherable] in that time in Poland.</span> <span id="s351">Other were very assimilated, like people before the World War -- World War І, it was Russia, as you know.</span> <span id="s352">It was changed in the politics in the country [indecipherable] in spite being in one city.</span> <span id="s353">And the -- for example, my mother spoke a lot of Russian.</span> <span id="s354">The parents of my friend Solamid, they came from Leningrad originally.</span> <span id="s355">And the -- at home they speak only Russian.</span> <span id="s356">And the -- then it came Poland, and a lot of people spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s357">They were assimilated, and Polish was the main language of their home.</span> <span id="s358">But in my home they spoke Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: S-So you’re describing it almost a -- a kind of insular quality that at some point th-the city was Russian, then it was Polish, but you and your family were -- were simply always Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Can you talk a little bit about the years leading up to when Poland was divided, and -- was it something that you were expecting a -- you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: When the war start in ’39?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: It was --</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: So maybe ’37 - ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: In ’37 - ’38 was a very big anti-Semitism in pole -- in Wilna in Poland.</span> <span id="s367">They were under the influence of Germans.</span> <span id="s368">For example, ev -- next to the Jewish stores -- there were a lot of Jewish stores, usually stayed the students -- the Polish students, they were calling [indecipherable] don’t buy in Jewish stores.</span> <span id="s369">They didn’t let in Polish people to get into the Jewish stores.</span> <span id="s370">In the university, some Jewish people were in the university, and the students [indecipherable] said the Polish people have to sit on their right side in the room, and the Jewish on the left have to sit.</span> <span id="s371">The Jewish people never sit on the left, they were staying, listen the lectures, and make the notes, staying.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Standing?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Standing, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Oh, as a form of protest?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: And -- as a form of protest.</span> <span id="s376">And sometimes they start to

yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: And then in ’39, Poland was divided, and Wilna start to be Russian, and wars -- and Warsaw is Poland.</span> <span id="s381">And there were no [indecipherable] and the -- a letter was going from there for months, three or four months.</span> <span id="s382">And then when the start -- the war start for us, because my sister was in Warsaw, and I remember my mother was always try -- est -- crying, and people from Warsaw run away the first days, and as I said, my sister couldn’t because she was in charge of that school.</span> <span id="s383">And people from Warsaw who run away, lived in our house because every family who was able took a couple of the -- of the people who run away [indecipherable] how they call here -- like the people who run from Bosnia now, or from --</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: Refugees.</span> <span id="s386">Every family who could took a couple of refugees in their homes.</span> <span id="s387">In my home were refugees from Warsaw who knows my sister, and my sister was in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s388">We [indecipherable] once in three, four months, we got the letter.</span> <span id="s389">We send the package, they got it after four months, in the beginning.</span> <span id="s390">Other people were not killed, then they was -- it was a ghetto.</span> <span id="s391">And school where my sister works was on the territory of the ghetto, so the nursing school was still going on, and the Jewish people from the ghetto in Warsaw, the young girls have studied.</span> <span id="s392">Even the nurses from the school were taken out of the ghetto for work to the hospital, even to the German hospital.</span> <span id="s393">And -- but -- but from -- for us, for the family it was war, because my mother was alway -- all the time crying about her sisters in Warsaw and their grandchildre --</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: For --</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: -- about her daughters and the grandchildren, in spite -- in the -- ’39, in the beginning, before the war start, they were all in Wilna, at our summer house, and when their vacation finished they went -- the sister with the brother-in-laws went to Warsaw, and the children was ver -- left with us.</span> <span id="s396">It was two children from my one sister, and one boy from the other sister.</span> <span id="s397">And with the last train we send them back with the women to Warsaw, thinking that the safest place would be Warsaw because the propaganda was very high in that time, that Poland is very strong, and she does -- she is not afraid for everybody.</span> <span id="s398">S -- so that capital, the Germans will not come.</span> <span id="s399">And all of a sudden, it changed.</span> <span id="s400">And the ghetto was smaller, smaller, but people were not killed in that time.</span> <span id="s401">We know there was hunger, then there was -- there is no clothes, it was [indecipherable], and there were ne -- not enough place for them, but they’re alive.</span> <span id="s402">And when the war start, the Germans came to Wilna, after the war start with Russia, we thought, okay, it will be like in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s403">Some people run away, some couldn’t.</span> <span id="s404">My family didn’t run away, I don’t know why, but some run away and had to return because Russia didn’t allow it in the beginning, to go in.</span> <span id="s405">They thought that we are spies, or what.</span> <span id="s406">They still don’t -- and you know -- but we said okay, we’ll survive the war, like in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s407">In Warsaw they started killing later -- later on.</span> <span id="s408">As it start to be in all the countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Was there ever any discussion in your family of sending people out?</span> <span id="s410">I mean far away, like to another country?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: We couldn’t.</span> <span id="s412">We couldn’t.</span> <span id="s413">First of all it was a lot of money, and it has to be relatives.</span> <span id="s414">You are thinking e -- before the war, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Yes, before, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: But you know, it was -- it was complicated, especially from Wilna.</span> <span id="s417">Life was not bad there, and some people went to the United States, but very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Wh-When do you remember first hearing about Nazism?</span> <span id="s419">Was this before the war?</span> <span id="s420">Before --</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Before the war, before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: C-Can you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Before the war, when Hitler came to the power, after years, of course we have stories about anti-Semitism there, about -- even, I think, Kristallnacht [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s424">We were ver -- very afraid if the Nazis will come, if Germany will come here.</span> <span id="s425">And as soon as they hear that the war start, a lot of people run away to Russia.</span> <span id="s426">Luta’s family run away to rush -- and they went until Minsk, and they didn't allow them to go through the -- through the border.</span> <span id="s427">And they returned when the Germans were there, they returned little by little back to their homes, because they couldn't go through, and then they went through the whole ghetto, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Let me -- did you ever hear Hitler on the radio?</span> <span id="s429">Do you remember hearing him on the radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Hitler?</span> <span id="s431">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: No, no, I could -- I -- I don’t remember what we know.</span> <span id="s433">A lot was going on in the -- Germany.</span> <span id="s434">And we saw the situation in Poland like they start to be like Nazis.</span> <span id="s435">Not everybody, but especially between the students, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: How do you explain that, that young people did it at first?</span> <span id="s437">Students standing outside of shops, that -- that sounds so unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Yes, yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s439">Not the socialist, but they have to choose between the Russia and Germany, and they like better the ru -- German.</span> <span id="s440">They didn’t expect what will happen, you know?</span> <span id="s441">Then, when they lost the war right away, the situation changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Was there ever any discussion in your family as the war drew closer, or began, of -- of hiding people, perhaps even further out in -- in the countryside, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: But the Polish people were very afraid.</span> <span id="s444">They were very scared, because there were several situations that they show -- they hang th-this Pole for hiding a Jew, or -- and they show it on the market openly, the people saw it --</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: In Wilna?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: -- and they were afraid, yeah.</span> <span id="s447">They were afraid.</span> <span id="s448">And then, when the people went to the ghetto, most of the people didn’t believe that it will be for long.</span> <span id="s449">They said a couple weeks and the war will be ended.</span> <span id="s450">And all their goods they put to the Polish people, and then they didn't want to give it -- it back.</span> <span id="s451">So they were happy, others thought, oh, they were nice people, too.</span> <span id="s452">And I think if we would burn everything what we have, that the people would be nicer to us.</span> <span id="s453">Secondly, I’ll tell you, when the Russians came, the Jews were happy.</span> <span id="s454">I’ll to -- I told you, they thought they’ll have finally their freedom.</span> <span id="s455">They’ll can study, they’ll can be like the -- all the people, like it was in the very beginning, in spite that the -- the situation was hard to leave, that they were poorer or whatever.</span> <span id="s456">But they had a little bit their freedom in the very fa -- beginning.</span> <span id="s457">And -- and the Poles saw how they were happy with that.</span> <span id="s458">And the reality was different.</span> <span id="s459">After two or three years the politics changed there.</span> <span id="s460">Maybe that was the reason.</span> <span id="s461">But there were nice people also.</span> <span id="s462">I have in our mill, when we went into the ghetto, for seven months or for a year, I worked on a farm five miles from our home, early before the war.</span> <span id="s463">And we have a person who were working in our mill.</span> <span id="s464">He was a -- a bachelor and -- and he saw me once that I am going with a [indecipherable] on the middle of the street with another 200 people to the farm.</span> <span id="s465">For an hour, for an hour and a half we march until we came to work, to nine o’clock.</span> <span id="s466">This person saw me once and all of a sudden I see that he is going with a package behind our -- our group, and he is going for five miles, until they -- they find a situation and they start to go to the end to talk to him.</span> <span id="s467">He was afraid, but he gave me the package, bread with a bottle of milk, and disappeared.</span> <span id="s468">Every day until I worked there, this person, a Polish boy who worked for us for a couple of years, did it.</span> <span id="s469">I would never expect that this person can be moved.</span> <span id="s470">It too --</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: Hi-His name was Mironchik, but I don’t know the last name.</span> <span id="s473">I meet him after the war, he was still the same bachelor living wa -- in one of the rooms in our house, poor, of course.</span> <span id="s474">I came, I supported him, and then he came to me in the end, maybe a five years because I left, he said, I want to get the -- to get a pension and I can’t get a pension because I don’t have enough years, but I worked for your father for a lot of years, maybe for 10 years, but I don’t have anything from them.</span> <span id="s475">Maybe you can come and tell.</span> <span id="s476">And I came and tell.</span> <span id="s477">I didn’t want to tell that we were capitalists, that we have a store because [indecipherable] it was not rich, we were very low middle class because I have a lot of -- you know.</span> <span id="s478">But I went and he said, he worked for your father, your father had -- I said, yes, my father in that time was sick and he couldn’t work by himself, and he took this person for -- and I remember him very well.</span> <span id="s479">I want very much him to get the pension.</span> <span id="s480">And -- and I can guarantee that he work for the 10 years, and -- and he believed me, and he got the pension.</span> <span id="s481">I was happy that I can -- of course I gave him money, I gave what to wear after the war when my situation was better.</span> <span id="s482">But, that I could do by him this thing, because he was really a simple person, but he was -- he had a heart.</span> <span id="s483">Can you imagine that in the ghetto he brought in a half a loaf of bread with a bottle of milk?</span> <span id="s484">Maybe it saved the life during the hunger.</span> <span id="s485">It was not so easy to get in with it to the ghetto, but somehow I hide it in -- between my pants, somehow came, if I could.</span> <span id="s486">If I saw that some Germans had -- staying to the entrance -- to the entrance of the ghetto, we can go around on the middle of the [indecipherable] for hours until we saw that it’s cleared up and we can get in to put in the little thing that we have, we worked on a garden, they gave us a little bit carrots and potatoes and -- to put in somehow hide it.</span> <span id="s487">And we can do it only if nobody works with -- only was a Jewish policeman at the entrance of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s488">So I s -- we saw there were Polish -- Polish, were lot of people.</span> <span id="s489">Luta will also tell you a story about the people who worked in her house for -- for many years, and how they helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Okay, let’s stop now.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: We are a little -- End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Before we begin s-speaking about the changes in the ghetto, can you tell us about your friend, who you call Luta, that’s her nickname, but tell us her name, and then tell us how you first met her.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Luta’s name was Sulamit Shrey -- Shreyber.</span> <span id="s495">I was in one school with her brother Josef.</span> <span id="s496">Her brother was a class higher than me.</span> <span id="s497">We were the same age, but he was a class before.</span> <span id="s498">In 1939 we were at the summer house in a place called Nemencheny, and there, the place we were, were three houses.</span> <span id="s499">In one lived Luta’s family, in one was -- in the second was the family of my brother-in-law from Warsaw, and the third house was ours.</span> <span id="s500">And in that time, as I told you, the children and the grandchildren of my mother and her children from Warsaw came and also stay with us at the hou -- summer house.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: Luba?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Luba and Riva, but when -- with their husband.</span> <span id="s503">Well -- but when their vacation finished and they have to return to Warsaw, the children were staying with us.</span> <span id="s504">And we were very friendly with the family of Shreyber, with Luta’s family.</span> <span id="s505">And her father was the director of a technical school, and my sister, being in the last year in high school, also took courses in the technical.</span> <span id="s506">So her father knew very well my sister and my brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s507">And we were young people, and they were very friendly with her brother.</span> <span id="s508">And she was a little girl in that time.</span> <span id="s509">She is five years younger than me, was a very beautiful girl and we all like her, but I was friends with her brother, with Josef.</span> <span id="s510">And then the war start, and with the last train we send the children to Warsaw to their parent, because my mo-mother believed the children has to be with their parent, and that Warsaw was the safest place in Poland.</span> <span id="s511">And then the war starts, and everybody went to their own place, and as there were the pact between Molotov and -- and Hitler and Poland was divide, Wilna start to be Russia, Lithuanian, and Warsaw was cut off.</span> <span id="s512">And then we start a normal life.</span> <span id="s513">We were going back to school in ’39, and sa -- we very happy with us, as each other, I start to date her brother, and we meet every evening in -- in school.</span> <span id="s514">And he was coming to our house, and I was going to their house, instead what we would live in different corners of the city.</span> <span id="s515">And ‘99 was a very happy year, and before 1940, until ’41 when the war started in Russia and Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: When Wilna was divided, when Wilna became part of Russia, what were the changes that you experienced?</span> <span id="s517">Can you talk a little bit about that, in the city?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s519">First of all, they took out the property of the rich people.</span> <span id="s520">And then everybody start to work, to find something -- work.</span> <span id="s521">The ch -- they make changes in the school system, as I told you, this was gymnasium, and al -- they make 10 - 11 classes, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s522">Everybody -- everything start to be in Russian, Russian -- Russian was the main language, with a little bit Yiddish, because it was hard to go through.</span> <span id="s523">There was no anti-Semitics, there was -- the people were very nice there, one who came in the beginning, but you saw that they were -- they didn't know the -- the life that we have before in Poland.</span> <span id="s524">The soldiers, everybody who came from Russia, they empty out right away all the stores.</span> <span id="s525">In the beginning, the owners of the store was happy because before business wasn’t going so well.</span> <span id="s526">And then, all of a sudden people start to buy -- buy everything.</span> <span id="s527">They bought nightgowns and went to the [indecipherable] in them, and th-the -- the wifes of the soldiers, of the officers who came to Wilna.</span> <span id="s528">And -- but then they saw that okay, they’re buying everything, but they don’t have where to buy new stuff, to hold the business.</span> <span id="s529">So they were a little bit scary.</span> <span id="s530">And then, after awhile, they start to pick up the rich people, send to Siberia.</span> <span id="s531">And they organized the youth to help them, the [indecipherable] and there were a lot of Jewish people also involved with the [indecipherable] that they didn’t know, they believed them.</span> <span id="s532">And they were very upset.</span> <span id="s533">They took them to homes, and told the people to pack -- pack bag, they’re going on -- on the tracks to the trains and they’re going somewhere to rau -- to -- to Siberia, to Russia, and -- and people were upset, why, what?</span> <span id="s534">But finally it was good for them because the one they took out, they survive the war, and the one who stayed got killed, mostly.</span> <span id="s535">Most of them were killed by the Germans.</span> <span id="s536">But in -- the time being, it was horrible.</span> <span id="s537">People who were not rich, they had a little store maybe, they suffered for surviving with the little store, all of a sudden they get the [indecipherable] they get -- rich people they have to go out, Capitalists they have to go out of the city.</span> <span id="s538">And they send them far away, deep in Russia, and it was very sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Wh-Wha -- was your family afraid that you would be labeled rich afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s541">But they didn’t touch us.</span> <span id="s542">We were not enough rich to -- we have the mill, we have the house, but we were -- you know, have a lot of loans to pay, so we have problems.</span> <span id="s543">And all of -- all of the family start to work -- to work, you know, hard.</span> <span id="s544">My sisters, and -- and I was study in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: But you continued to go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: Yes, until the war started between Russia and Germany when they cut off the schools and everything.</span> <span id="s547">And I was dating Josef all this time, we were very good friends, and the families were friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Tell us a little bit about him.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: He was a brilliant student.</span> <span id="s550">She was a very good person, he was intelligent and an aristocrat.</span> <span id="s551">I was very in love with [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s552">And we were study in school, were meeting in school, and after school he used to take me home.</span> <span id="s553">And then in the evening we meet aga -- again, we never have enough of each other.</span> <span id="s554">And we were good friends, and when we came into the ghetto, or to the ghetto later -- the first year was quiet, and then I was working in a farm.</span> <span id="s555">Before I worked in Judenrat, do something, and they want to go out from the ghetto, it’s very hard for to stay all the time.</span> <span id="s556">And I went to work for a farm and he went to work, to Gestapo.</span> <span id="s557">On the ho -- on the yard of Gestapo, doing all kind of cleaning something -- he was very capable, so he did for them in the -- in their workshop something, in the -- I don’t know what.</span> <span id="s558">And it start to build up in the ghetto, Wilna partisan organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: Before it was organized, it took a little time in the ghetto, and then the youth people of all organizations, Zionist, and Bundist and communist, who belongs to the youth organization [indecipherable] young people, and religious, and they get together and they start to think how to fight, what to do.</span> <span id="s561">Not to go like -- they saw the people disappear, disappeared from the ghetto, and before the ghetto and they didn’t return.</span> <span id="s562">And they start to think about organize something in the ghetto, and whoever works outside the ghetto, wherever they have a situation to bring in some weapons, to -- to have something, in case.</span> <span id="s563">And he worked in the [indecipherable] of the Gestapo, and somehow he had the possibility to take from them something.</span> <span id="s564">And he -- it was very dangerous I remember, until I saw him again coming from work, from out the ghetto, knowing that he is carrying something.</span> <span id="s565">I was very, very scared.</span> <span id="s566">And [indecipherable] organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s568">[indecipherable] to the -- to the ghetto, can -- can you tell us -- it was established in the fall of ’41, correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Yes, the fall ’41, or the begi -- yes, on the beginning of ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: So the months before that, what was going on?</span> <span id="s571">Let’s say the spring and the summer before, how were things changing?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: I will start with the beginning order --</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: -- of the ge -- how it come to the ghetto before.</span> <span id="s575">After a -- as soon as the Germans came into Wilna, they surround themselves with the [indecipherable] of the population.</span> <span id="s576">And what do I mean?</span> <span id="s577">The thieves, the bandits, the -- the one in the -- in every yard has a -- a cleaning person or were -- who were different, some were good and some were bad.</span> <span id="s578">But it was the bad people they surround.</span> <span id="s579">Because how they knew who is a Jew, and who not.</span> <span id="s580">I for example was blonde, and the blue eyes in the beginning and who could tell?</span> <span id="s581">If the person who saw me or knew me, that was just [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s582">After a week they start to catch men on the street.</span> <span id="s583">Men -- they ever saw a man, and they said he is Jewish, they catched him to a party, and put a party of 150 people, and they disappeared.</span> <span id="s584">And they said to take with them a towel and a piece of soap.</span> <span id="s585">Later on I’ll tell you, I find out after the war for what it was.</span> <span id="s586">And people start disap -- the men start disappearing.</span> <span id="s587">Or they ring in an apartment, if a man opened the door, he may be in slippers, he may be without a shirt.</span> <span id="s588">They gave him a [indecipherable] they came over with three or five people to a door, and get him out -- out to the street, and they disappeared.</span> <span id="s589">Before that, a week after the Germans came in -- five days after they came in, they find out who are the leader -- the Jewish leaders of the si -- because what did the population -- what do they know, the whole population?</span> <span id="s590">They are living their normal life and that’s it.</span> <span id="s591">But there were leaders who had big positions, who had -- can say a word to government about their people, who can stand up from the -- the first thing they came, they picked up 60 famous people and they shot them right away.</span> <span id="s592">Was several people of my friends.</span> <span id="s593">So there were nobody to tell the world what -- wh-what happened to the Jews, get th-the famous people who -- like famous doctors or famous lawyers, or famous politicians.</span> <span id="s594">And there were a lot because this was a big Jewish community.</span> <span id="s595">Wilna, who had in that time 400 -- 250 population, 74 of the population were Jewish.</span> <span id="s596">It means a third of the population are Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: H-How did you hear about that, the leaders?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: I knew it, I knew it.</span> <span id="s599">Right away people knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s602">It was a Dr. Ragovski, and Ailitch and Kaplan Gablanksi, it was famous people in the [indecipherable] who always stand up for the Jewish people and have connections with the government.</span> <span id="s603">There were even people who were in the same.</span> <span id="s604">And they disappeared, they were shot.</span> <span id="s605">So the population get with less people, and le -- and without leaders.</span> <span id="s606">Then, after three weeks, it was a rumor that in the Jewish center of the city, there was a Jewish center, a small streets, with big buildings in a yard, maybe with four buildings, not the rich people, were Jewish peop -- it the Jewish center.</span> <span id="s607">Most of the Jewish people were living there, all the -- the cleaning people were not the Jewish [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s608">And all of a sudden it was a rumor that in that area a German was shot.</span> <span id="s609">And in one night they came in and they cleaned up everybody from the area.</span> <span id="s610">It was about six, 7,000 people.</span> <span id="s611">And they made it so fast, right from the bat on the street.</span> <span id="s612">They could be in the nightgowns, it was out sleeper [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s613">A lot of people came from the bandit, from the soldier, Lithuanian, Germans were, and they throw it out the middle of the street, and when all the area was empty up, they went out and they took them to Ponary.</span> <span id="s614">Ponary was a beautiful forest behind Wilna, and they shot them.</span> <span id="s615">After a week, they established a ghetto.</span> <span id="s616">They were going from all areas of the city, it was five boroughs, and going from home to home.</span> <span id="s617">Put them everybody on the street, and they were driven to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s618">For example, into our house, my father, before that, was taken -- we called them the harponi.</span> <span id="s619">They catched, they harped mans, and he was taken to such a party with the men, and he was an old man, he was in the -- in that time 67 years old.</span> <span id="s620">But my mother, she was very energetic, she was going after them and asking, and -- let him go back, let him go back, he’s an old man, what do you want to -- and finally they let him go back.</span> <span id="s621">After that, it was establish a camp -- a five miles after our area where we lived, for turf, work with the turf, you know what’s turf?</span> <span id="s622">Turf is earth, and they worked it up.</span> <span id="s623">And then it was like to heat the ovens like coal, like --</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Limestone?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: Stuff for heating up, it was coal, coal --</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: -- [indecipherable] in English also.</span> <span id="s628">And it was establish such a camp, so -- and my father and my brother-in-law was taken to this camp, the -- it was behind [indecipherable] it was called Rasha.</span> <span id="s629">And they were working a lot of people at that, three, 400 people were working on the camp in the Rasha.</span> <span id="s630">So when -- when we were driven to the ghetto, my father and my brother-in-law wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s631">But it was as I remember, my sister lived -- has an apartment in our yard, in the other building, with a little child of two years.</span> <span id="s632">And in our home I was with my mother with another sister.</span> <span id="s633">And it was about three o’clock at night, and all of a sudden we heard that somebody is knocking in the door.</span> <span id="s634">And seven, eight people; one soldier, one German, one Lithuanian, some other people, first -- first we have you in 50 minutes you have to go, take whatever you have -- can took in your hand, and go out to the street.</span> <span id="s635">We -- the only thing was we did in the 50 minutes, that the best things were put to our neighbors.</span> <span id="s636">And my sister took the child, she took the wagon of the child, she put in the wagon whatever and the child and we put some -- it was September, it was hot.</span> <span id="s637">We even didn't think about the winter, and we took whatever we had, other things we hide and then some were in the basement, some were [indecipherable] and we went out to the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Let me just stop you there.</span> <span id="s639">From the time they knocked on the door, can you des -- describe even in more detail who did what, was your mother in charge, who ran next to the neighbor, what did you give them?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: My mother and my sister would give us our line and our dresses, our winter coats out, whatever we can took from the closet [indecipherable] and to the -- especially to [indecipherable] she wi -- she was living there for 20 years.</span> <span id="s641">So then they went -- so we came into the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: So how did you get there, did you walk?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: We walk.</span> <span id="s644">We walked in the middle of the street, the whole part until the end of the street, it was a long street.</span> <span id="s645">And they were go -- when I came in, lots of people were staying with the -- their packages, with the children, with the -- waiting until everybody will go out.</span> <span id="s646">And then when they empty out all the houses, nobody can be leaved -- left in the house, there were too many.</span> <span id="s647">And we went to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s648">And from different boroughs in the same day, they bring the people to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s649">And we came in, we find -- me and my mother and my sister and my little nephew, my second sister, we came to a yard who my school was.</span> <span id="s650">And we find a corner in a little room, because it was lots, lots of people.</span> <span id="s651">And th -- in a room who was one person or a -- maybe 20 - 25 people, everybody has a little corner, a little middle to -- to sit down.</span> <span id="s652">And after awhile it starts then -- it starts to organize stores, little -- for people to give that -- to have some cards that we can have some bread, some butter.</span> <span id="s653">It was organized before, potatoes they give us [indecipherable] can be, somehow to survive.</span> <span id="s654">And they start to organize groups to go out for work on some places where the soldiers are, on gardens, on some plants, on some -- somewhere to work and people went out -- some were working inside the ghetto from the very beginning.</span> <span id="s655">After maybe three weeks in the ghetto, it was Yom Kippur or maybe after a month.</span> <span id="s656">All of a sudden were rumors in ghetto, that this night the Germans will ke -- come for people.</span> <span id="s657">And they make all kinds of lists, and the lists were done in my area where I lived and my sister has a friend who were a Jewish policeman in the ghetto, and he s -- and somehow she find out that I were in the lists.</span> <span id="s658">So she said, what should I do?</span> <span id="s659">She said, I will cross her out.</span> <span id="s660">But better that she will not stay at home, because they were ta -- they will take people from this area in ta -- in case they didn’t have enough, they can take from the one who are close [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s661">And I went to my boyfriend, to meet Luta.</span> <span id="s662">She lived in Shtrashona too -- Shtrashona, I don’t remember exactly the number, but it was a yard and four big buildings.</span> <span id="s663">And in every building, in every apartment, who normally lived a family of three or five, lived 40.</span> <span id="s664">in one part.</span> <span id="s665">And the Germans came in the middle of the night, it was Yom Kippur, it was raining, it was cold, it was terrible conditions, people were sleeping, everything was going on in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s666">And they didn’t go to the area they promised, they didn't look at a list, they came to one street, where my boyfriend and I was hiding and they surrounded two big buildings.</span> <span id="s667">In every yard was four big buildings.</span> <span id="s668">And they picked up the people and they took them everybo -- I remember they came to my -- to our apartment and Luta’s father said, should we take some food, so -- some thing, some food.</span> <span id="s669">You want you can take, you don’t want you can take, you can take a piece of bread, was strange.</span> <span id="s670">And they took us out to the main street of the ghetto, Rudnitska.</span> <span id="s671">And Luta, she was all the time out of the ghetto, but this time she came to the ghetto for awhile.</span> <span id="s672">She was 13 years old in that time.</span> <span id="s673">And we came to Rudnitska, a lot of people were staying already, driven out from the house, and we were staying in the party, and Luta start, she was -- they f -- and the father said, “You young, you will be taken to work, I don’t know about us, but” -- she said, “No, we’re -- all will be killed.</span> <span id="s674">They are taking us to kill there.”</span> <span id="s675">And she start -- and her mother was scared from her shouting up.</span> <span id="s676">And the mother knew perfect German.</span> <span id="s677">And in charge of the whole -- of the whole German, the people who took care of the whole party was in black -- in a black suit with a swastika [indecipherable] head with the -- with the --</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Hat?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: -- all kind of the signs.</span> <span id="s680">And she went to him and she says, my husband is an engineer, and my husband lives in the Judenrat, let him out, where are you taking us?</span> <span id="s681">And he pushed us away.</span> <span id="s682">She went a second time to him, let us go, my husband is an engineer, my husband works for the Judenrat, my husband did this and my husband [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s683">Let us go home.</span> <span id="s684">He pushed us again.</span> <span id="s685">She went five times, and the Lithuanian soldier came and gave her a push and she fall down and then she came back to us and she said, is nothing I can do, or they don’t listen to me, what should we do?</span> <span id="s686">And we were staying upset, prepared to go with all the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s687">All of a sudden, the German in the black, who was in charge of the whole a -- goes through the older group of the people, said, “Where is the frau from Judenrat?”</span> <span id="s688">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s689">“Who is the woman from the Judenrat?”</span> <span id="s690">One person came, he said, “No it’s not you.”</span> <span id="s691">Then another person, no it’s not you.</span> <span id="s692">And we were staying not thinking about anything, and he came, “You,” to her mother.</span> <span id="s693">“Take your family and stay next to me.”</span> <span id="s694">We took our family, and some other people came like they are the family, and we were staying next to him, and the Lithuanian soldier don’t want us to stay next to him, and they pushed us again.</span> <span id="s695">And -- and we tried to stay next to him, and they pu -- then th -- he said to them, “Let them -- let them stay, don’t touch them.</span> <span id="s696">And he go after me and he went unti -- we went with him until the end of the whole group of people.</span> <span id="s697">And we saw that he was counting, one, two, three, four, 900 -- 900 -- 998, and he give a short mark with the hand, go forward with the whole group surround by all the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s698">And to us he said, “You can go home, you are saved.”</span> <span id="s699">It was maybe five o’clock in the morning, 5:30, it was dark, it was raining, we were wet.</span> <span id="s700">And all the soldiers are looking, how come your -- you understand, the Germans are a very accurate.</span> <span id="s701">If they have to take 998 people, they’ll never take 999.</span> <span id="s702">They’ll take 998 like they were told.</span> <span id="s703">And it was a little bit more, and maybe the mother came to his mind that she was bothering him, bothering him, said ah, anyway, some people has to be left, let the woman with the family be left.</span> <span id="s704">Somehow it came to his mind.</span> <span id="s705">No explanation.</span> <span id="s706">I am sure, instead of us went somebody else, because he needed the amount of the people.</span> <span id="s707">So we -- and another maybe 10 were left over.</span> <span id="s708">They have more as they need.</span> <span id="s709">And we came back -- we didn’t go back right away, we went to our basement, we were trembling all, and we were downs -- and it was raining very much, we went to the first basement and hide, and everybody was looking at us.</span> <span id="s710">And we came back to our place we lived.</span> <span id="s711">The light were on, all the apartment were empty from the two yards, from the eight big buildings, w-we are the only one who return from it.</span> <span id="s712">And when we came back in the morning I saw my family, my mother and my sister, with the child of her hand, crying.</span> <span id="s713">That they know -- they knew that I went there to sleep over, and they knew that people from there were sent to the -- they all were sent to Ponar and Vershat.</span> <span id="s714">And after the war when I go -- went to Ponar, I saw the place there was -- they were shot, and they fen -- find out who they were because after the war people take out this and they saw this or this skeletons, and that.</span> <span id="s715">Why, when they picked up the mans on the st -- the man on the street, and the man from the houses, why did they tell them to take a towel and soap?</span> <span id="s716">When they bore them to Ponary, to the forest where they killed them, they made a big hole, and put a disk over the hole.</span> <span id="s717">And the people -- the man were a little bit far away.</span> <span id="s718">One after the other, and they have to binch their eyes.</span> <span id="s719">And one by one they put them to this hole, through -- when they came to the disk, they shot them, and they fall to their hole.</span> <span id="s720">In one side or the other where they shot until the end, or half alive.</span> <span id="s721">Nobody came from there back, you know [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s722">But this -- this way they told them to take a towel and a piece of soap, not to under -- the piece of soap not understand and the towel to be in their eyes, not to see the last moment of their death.</span> <span id="s723">You have one, I told you that an accident.</span> <span id="s724">I could be [indecipherable] what come to his mind, to save this woman with her family, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: At that point what did -- how did people understand what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: They didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Did you understand that -- that -- that you were taken --</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: They didn’t know, they said they are taken to a camp for work.</span> <span id="s729">They are -- were lying terrible, people -- later on people understood, and I’ll tell you a little bit later about it.</span> <span id="s730">Otherwise it finished.</span> <span id="s731">In that time, my mother was hiding somewhere, and they didn’t find her.</span> <span id="s732">No, in this time they di -- she didn’t hide, because they picked up the two buildings and this area where my mother was, they didn’t -- they didn’t touch anybody from there.</span> <span id="s733">But after awhile was another -- another story.</span> <span id="s734">It went another two months quiet, people were working, people were eating, the young people were laughing, you know it -- you -- you -- young people, they want to live.</span> <span id="s735">There were secret schools where the young people were educated.</span> <span id="s736">About Luta’s father she’ll tell he -- you by herself, how he organized a school for students, for people to -- to learn something.</span> <span id="s737">Young people they have what to do.</span> <span id="s738">And it was so -- everything secretly because th-the Germans didn’t want people to -- to learn, to study, to -- they want only to work, whatever they could, not to -- and the Jewish people want to study, they want to learn.</span> <span id="s739">They want to like literature and the -- them -- organize the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s740">Th -- they di -- they want to live.</span> <span id="s741">But about her father, you’re a -- she will tell you hers-herself.</span> <span id="s742">There was another -- another action.</span> <span id="s743">We call it action when there were rumors that the Germans are coming for people.</span> <span id="s744">All of a sudden they find out that people who are working have to have pink certificates.</span> <span id="s745">And the pink certificates were given at the work where the people -- at the working place where the people worked.</span> <span id="s746">Like my boyfriend worked in Gestapo, he got such a schein.</span> <span id="s747">They were -- called it a schein, a pink schein.</span> <span id="s748">Some people from the ghetto who worked in the ghetto in Judenrat have so -- pink schein.</span> <span id="s749">And these pink scheins were [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s750">And the person with a pink schein can des-describe to him a wife and children before 16.</span> <span id="s751">My boyfriend jo -- Josef has such a schein, and he want to describe me as his wife.</span> <span id="s752">But we lived together with -- with his cousin, a woman who was more than 30.</span> <span id="s753">And then his father ask him, you know what, Rochola is so young, she can go with my daughter of 16, but Dina is old, and she can’t go with my [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s754">Can’t you describe Dina as your wife?</span> <span id="s755">And I will describe Rochola as my daughter, because he also has a pink schein from the Judenrat.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: Rochola was your nickname?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: In Yiddish they called me Rochola.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Rochola, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s762">And then [indecipherable] 17, I was still Rochola, lot of people called me until now Rochola.</span> <span id="s763">My other sister was described to another person as -- as his wife and my other sister also find a guy who describe her as her wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: So people were essentially sort of listing friends or relatives as their wives and children?</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: Y-Yeah -- not -- not that.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: To keep them safe?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: You know, some people has -- had pink schein and they didn't have anybody, they were bachelors, or what.</span> <span id="s768">So if they know each other, they describe them as a wife, and went out with them as a wife.</span> <span id="s769">My mother didn’t have such a -- and she -- she didn’t have a hiding place, and she was still in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s770">And my sister was with her all the time looking, something for her.</span> <span id="s771">And she left her of five minutes, she has to go to somebody, ask if they have for her a hiding place.</span> <span id="s772">And my mother saw that she is -- my sister will not leave her alone, and she was [indecipherable] what should she do.</span> <span id="s773">And she has in her pocket a couple of da -- of rubles, of money.</span> <span id="s774">She said, I have to meet her in five minutes, but I’ll try to go to the exit.</span> <span id="s775">Maybe somehow I will go out [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s776">And she went to the exit -- no, I’ll tell you about -- later how she went out.</span> <span id="s777">My sister returned to the place where my mother has to meet her, my mother didn’t return.</span> <span id="s778">She come to there, where is my mo -- I can’t find the mother.</span> <span id="s779">And she was crying and I was crying and we’re looking for my mother, my mother disappeared.</span> <span id="s780">We went to the working place, and to the places where they put us.</span> <span id="s781">They put us to the other ghetto, before it was two ghettos, from one side of the street and from the other, and all of a sudden they liquidated one ghetto.</span> <span id="s782">And they put them to the Ponary.</span> <span id="s783">And in that ghetto they liquidated the [indecipherable] and the people from the ghetto out, somewhere out to the places where they’re working and some were to the second ghetto wa -- what was empty out, for the couple of days.</span> <span id="s784">And I was wer -- crying.</span> <span id="s785">My mother wi -- I didn't know where she is, she was killed, she was shot, or -- all the three day -- three days we were in the other place.</span> <span id="s786">My friend Josef was working for the Gestapo -- the Gestapo [indecipherable] yeah, doing all kind of -- of hard work.</span> <span id="s787">And he has a Polish woman who worked in their house for 40 years.</span> <span id="s788">And she used to come to him where he worked, every day.</span> <span id="s789">And he went out -- we were in the second ghetto, and he went out for the w-work every day.</span> <span id="s790">And he knew how I was crying and he told Vera, the woman, what happened to my mother, and the -- and they don’t know where she is, and Rochola is crying all the time.</span> <span id="s791">She said, “You know what, I’ll go to the place where she was living before the war, maybe somehow she went out of here.”</span> <span id="s792">She went to the place when -- where I lived, and she find a letter from my mother, that she gave some money to the policeman and he let her out.</span> <span id="s793">She took out her stars, and she went out the place to the camp my father and my brother-in-law was all -- almost working at the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s794">And she went by our house where we lived before, and she -- she saw that we will be concerned, and she left a letter that she’s safe and she went to my father.</span> <span id="s795">And this woman, Vera, risk of her life, and she went there -- she went -- and next day she brought my boyfriend Josef the letter from my mother, and he brought it in the second ghetto, and telling that my mama is alive and she is together with my father on to -- in the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s796">We returned after awhile to the ghetto to find that lots of, lots of people were taken out.</span> <span id="s797">They said that they take that -- took them to work.</span> <span id="s798">They said that they -- they are alive.</span> <span id="s799">But somehow thoughts came in that people who are alive, they may be surround with the -- with the worst enemies, but somehow one of the thousands, thousands of people can find a connection and send something to the relatives, a sign that they are alive.</span> <span id="s800">If such signs doesn’t come from anybody, it means that they are not alive.</span> <span id="s801">But people, they don’t believe in this, they’ll believe in life.</span> <span id="s802">They said, maybe, maybe they are working like we, they are somewhere, they are surround by the soldiers, they can’t send anything.</span> <span id="s803">And they -- you know, they think that they are killed, but in the underground they said that they are still alive and they can’t believe that people can kill people.</span> <span id="s804">For what?</span> <span id="s805">We were in the ghetto another year, and it was all kind of feelings, feelings.</span> <span id="s806">A couple of people worked for a plant somewhere.</span> <span id="s807">All of a sudden we heard they didn’t return from work.</span> <span id="s808">They took them out to the yard and shot them, couple of hundred people.</span> <span id="s809">A couple of hundred people worked somewhere in Bilavarka around Wilna, also in turf, and they disappeared, they didn’t return home after work to the ghetto, they were killed.</span> <span id="s810">They said they send them to another camp, but no, they were killed.</span> <span id="s811">One time it were maybe a -- of -- over two years, or a year and three quarters living in the ghetto, there were rumors that all the people from the -- from the shtetla -- from the towns that surround Wilna were bringing to the Wilna ghetto.</span> <span id="s812">And from the Wilna ghetto they are going to Kovno, it was a city in Lithuanian, to build a big plant, a big factory.</span> <span id="s813">And people came from the -- you know, from the little towns around Wilna and they looked good, and they were -- were good dressed yet, and they came with all families, with the old and with the sick and with the little children.</span> <span id="s814">They were about four and a half thousand people, and they all came to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s815">And they made a lot of friends they were study in the school, because our gymnasium was the only one in Poland with the Yiddish language, who had right for coming in after finishing to go to the university.</span> <span id="s816">So from all Poland, people used to come to our school.</span> <span id="s817">And some of these people from the shtetla were in school, I knew them and they looked well, because you know, in the little shtetla they are [indecipherable] air is good, and th -- and they were for a week in the ghetto, and -- and they were [indecipherable] and we saw that, and after a week they said that the trains are ready and they are going to Kovno to the -- to view the factory.</span> <span id="s818">And everybody was going by themself without things.</span> <span id="s819">They are going to build a plant.</span> <span id="s820">They went to the wagons [indecipherable] with their kids and older people and the -- and the sick and all kind, and when they all get in, they thought that the wagons were [indecipherable] they were closed with not to get out.</span> <span id="s821">They said why are they bombing the -- the trains?</span> <span id="s822">The wagons that we ge -- we are going by ourself.</span> <span id="s823">We are told to go and we are going, why should we be closed?</span> <span id="s824">And they were chec -- they were watching, and a lot of people, young people, they know the area.</span> <span id="s825">They know how to go to Kovno.</span> <span id="s826">And -- and they thought all of a sudden they are going to the forest from Ponar.</span> <span id="s827">So it was clear of them that they were not going to by -- but they were -- are going to shot them.</span> <span id="s828">Then they broke the windows of the going train, and they start to jump through the windows, whoever could, all over the forest.</span> <span id="s829">As soon as the Germans and the Nazi they saw it, they start to shot.</span> <span id="s830">And the whole forest was shot with dead people.</span> <span id="s831">Very little could run out and survive, very little.</span> <span id="s832">Mostly they were shot.</span> <span id="s833">And the whole forest were with the dead, shot people.</span> <span id="s834">So tomorrow they came to the ghetto and they told the story, the German.</span> <span id="s835">And they asks Gens, Gens was in charge of the ghetto, to give him men to clean up the forest.</span> <span id="s836">They were afraid to show the other people what they did.</span> <span id="s837">So they want the people and they guaranteed Gens.</span> <span id="s838">And Gens -- you know who Gens was, yeah, had a big power.</span> <span id="s839">So the German.</span> <span id="s840">And he guarantee that the people --</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: Jacob Gens.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Jacob Gens.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: Yeah, Jacob Gens.</span> <span id="s845">And they guaranteed that the people who did the work of cleaning up the forest will return, that they will not be shot.</span> <span id="s846">But [indecipherable] these people were the [indecipherable] who were taken to clean up the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s847">He came back.</span> <span id="s848">He promi -- that what he promised, he did, the people came back.</span> <span id="s849">They were all -- they find a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s850">They told them to pick up of the dead people the teeth, the golden teeth, the jewelry, the -- whatever they can.</span> <span id="s851">If they have good shoes, the shoes, da, da, da.</span> <span id="s852">It was terrible, and put into them [indecipherable] dead [indecipherable] half dead [indecipherable] you know.</span> <span id="s853">And it was 4000 people, and to put them to the holes, to put with the -- all kinds of stuff to burn.</span> <span id="s854">And when the people came back, some were crazy, they couldn’t [indecipherable] and they told the real story.</span> <span id="s855">And that’s what the story is, we find out what is Ponary, and where all the people were gone.</span> <span id="s856">When I came back from the concentration camp, the first thing I went to was [indecipherable] to the Ponary, and I find out all the places where was the this, the -- the man who were, the beginning of the war taken from the city, and this people, and the other people, and from [indecipherable] night where we were inside.</span> <span id="s857">And the children all of a sudden they picked up all the children until 16 years, and they put them in big trucks, and the kids didn’t know, they even were singing on the trucks, they are taking them to a camp for a co -- a couple of months.</span> <span id="s858">And they took them to Ponary and they sho -- shot them.</span> <span id="s859">It helped me out of a -- to save Luta one time.</span> <span id="s860">I’ll tol -- tell you another story when we got to the camp.</span> <span id="s861">And that was the story and in the end, and -- and the FPO organization to which I belong to the ef -- I came to the FPO much later than my boyfriend.</span> <span id="s862">It was very cyclically and they were afraid, they were afraid not only for the Germans, they were afraid for the Jewish population because the Jewish population were against -- if you fight, they will kill all the ghetto.</span> <span id="s863">Otherwise, some will survive.</span> <span id="s864">And everybody was thinking, if somebody will be -- will survive, it will be me.</span> <span id="s865">Not another, but me.</span> <span id="s866">They were thinking with the -- you know, people don’t believe in death, as I told you.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: Rachel, when you heard about the -- the -- the people from shtetls who were killed in the forest, was that one of the first times that it -- you really began to realize what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: Lots of people, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: C-Can you talk a bit about that, I mean, do you remember what you were thinking, or how it dawned on you?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: It was very terrible.</span> <span id="s871">When his cousin -- her cousin came, I had told her the story, and the -- all my friends who I meet two days ago, were shot on such a -- and you know, it was very terrible, but what can we do?</span> <span id="s872">What can we -- the [indecipherable] we -- we didn't have a place to hide, nobody would take us.</span> <span id="s873">Where should we go?</span> <span id="s874">And there lo -- then, all of a sudden, and the [indecipherable] organization, a couple of hundreds people, we prepared some lamps with -- with stuff who can -- who can shut out, you know, in case when the Germans look and we’ll throw whatever we have in the hands and we’ll fight.</span> <span id="s875">It was very hard to get connections with the people from the forest.</span> <span id="s876">We were alone.</span> <span id="s877">And until we get a connection to take out some people in the forest.</span> <span id="s878">It took a lot of time.</span> <span id="s879">A lot, a lot of time.</span> <span id="s880">And finally people saw that this is nonsense, to fight against the German where we don’t have any weapons.</span> <span id="s881">When we don’t have military people to rule us.</span> <span id="s882">And we’re thinking about the forest [indecipherable] but how?</span> <span id="s883">And all of a sudden, it was maybe a month before the liquidation of the Wilna ghetto, yes, and we in the partisan organization of the ghetto, every night some people were sleeping in the apartments whose window go out -- outside the ghetto, little, little pieces, and they have watch.</span> <span id="s884">If they saw that soldiers are surrounding the ghetto, they have to come to their leaders and say the parole Lisaroft.</span> <span id="s885">Lisaroft was the parole of [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s886">I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: That would be the head?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: Yes, yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: Lisaroft?</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: Lisaroft.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s893">And they find out that tomorrow they are coming for people.</span> <span id="s894">And they said, okay, took whatever you have and go on some places that was chosen, that we’ll fight from the places.</span> <span id="s895">And you wait until it will be the -- it will tell you somehow, start when the ta -- when the Germans will come, and the -- and the Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s896">The morning they came over the places and said you have to go, and me [indecipherable], and my boyfriend Josef.</span> <span id="s897">[indecipherable] this will be your place when you start to take over [indecipherable] the lamps with the -- with the stuff that arouse how -- how you -- can I say?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: Oh, is this a Molotov cocktail?</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: Yes, a cocktail.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: Something that you throw?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: And you throw and -- and we were staying waiting.</span> <span id="s904">I was next to Josef.</span> <span id="s905">All of a sudden the Germans and the Lithuanian and the group of -- of 12 or 15 people, together with one of our leaders, came to the yard and they said, don’t fight [indecipherable] in Russia -- in Yiddish [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s906">Don’t fight.</span> <span id="s907">Whatever you have, put -- they are taking you to Estonia for work.</span> <span id="s908">And we decided not to fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: You decided not to fight?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: Not to -- we didn’t have -- they didn’t tell us.</span> <span id="s911">We can’t do it by ourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: We’re waited for --</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: You waited for the order.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: -- for the order of the -- above --</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: The resistance leaders.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: -- of our leaders in the resistance and one of them came and said, don’t.</span> <span id="s918">You are --</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: Oh, one of the resistance leaders came and said don’t?</span> <span id="s920">A: One of the resistance -- they decided in the last minute not to fight --</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: -- but the population was so angry that before of -- that several hundred of you, how many were we, 400, the whole ghetto will be shot.</span> <span id="s923">And our leader was [indecipherable] up, Wittenberg, the -- the main leader of the FPO.</span> <span id="s924">And we didn’t have a choice, put it down, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Can you wait to --</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: -- we all went to the middle of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: Please stop for a second now.</span> <span id="s928">We’re just going to change tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: So -- so let’s pick up with that story.</span> <span id="s932">You’re describing a night where some people in the resistance movement were going to have an action, you were going to rebel.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: And you were all ready, and you were waiting for the order.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: Yes, and we didn’t have the order.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: Let’s pick up there, you didn’t have the order.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: The order.</span> <span id="s938">And all of a sudden, my boyfriend Josef said why, why can’t you fight?</span> <span id="s939">[indecipherable] them whatever we have.</span> <span id="s940">We will -- we’ll die, we’ll die, but we’ll do something.</span> <span id="s941">But without an order you can’t do, we were told do -- do -- don’t do anything without an order.</span> <span id="s942">And the order come because they decided all of a sudden to go out to the forest, not to fight in there.</span> <span id="s943">But it was too late.</span> <span id="s944">Until they find the connections, until they decide that the -- until the story for it -- for itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: Do you think -- did you agree with your boyfriend that -- with Josef, do you think you should have fought?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s947">I wouldn’t be alive, but you know.</span> <span id="s948">I don’t know, I do -- I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s949">From the other side, they would kill us in -- in a second and then what use?</span> <span id="s950">What use, they would kill us, kill the others people, and what use?</span> <span id="s951">Their decision will -- was already made.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: They liquidate the Jewish people in the ge -- in the Wilna ghetto.</span> <span id="s954">And we have rumors from Warsaw what’s doing there, and my brother-in-law was one of the leaders of the -- of the resistant of Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s955">And they heard -- being in the ghetto they were killed.</span> <span id="s956">They didn’t know exactly how and what.</span> <span id="s957">After -- after the war I find out that my sister is still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: At this point, where is your mother, and do you have any contact with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: She was still in Rasha at the turf.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: But the last month they brought there from the turf in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s962">In the last month she was in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s963">But I was still with Josef’s family, that was -- I’ll tell you soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: And can you talk a little bit more about how you be -- at least became part of the resistance group?</span> <span id="s965">Did -- did you have any meetings, were they secret meetings, how did they train you?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: Ye-Yeah -- yeah, I’ll tell you, I will tell you.</span> <span id="s967">I came late to the resistance.</span> <span id="s968">[indecipherable] end -- we were meeting, five of us, five girls has one leader from the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s969">And they were -- told us what to do, what we can do.</span> <span id="s970">I can’t do too much because I was inside of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s971">I couldn’t bring weapons.</span> <span id="s972">But one of our friend, he was a chemist, he was almost of the fifth grade of university [indecipherable] and the tel -- taught how to make the cocktail for --</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: He was a chemist?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: -- and we’re hi -- yeah -- and we’re hiding and trying to do and once a week before, we also want to resist -- a week?</span> <span id="s975">Two days before.</span> <span id="s976">And we were gathered in a building of strashunatur.</span> <span id="s977">And in the last minute we heard that the Germans are going to destroy this building.</span> <span id="s978">And this was an order fast to go out from the building.</span> <span id="s979">And one on our -- -- on our friends has a cocktail lamp in his hand, and he running from the [indecipherable] then he fall down and he was killed with his own lamp in his hand.</span> <span id="s980">And then we were -- he was a boyfriend of my close friend.</span> <span id="s981">And we went to look him for the -- no, it was in the same day that we were on [indecipherable] resistant.</span> <span id="s982">And we find out -- we find him in the morgue and -- house that he is dead, and we recognize his jacket, he was covered.</span> <span id="s983">And then, when everybody went out, they destroy the building, a big building.</span> <span id="s984">Somehow they find out --</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: Who -- who destroyed the building?</span> <span id="s986">The Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: The Germans, yeah.</span> <span id="s988">But the people went out, he was the only one killed by himself because he fall down with the face on his cocktail lamp, and he was killed, a young, nice boy.</span> <span id="s989">And here where we were up in the -- were the -- one of our leaders came, telling us not to fight.</span> <span id="s990">They said throw out whatever you have in the hand on the side, we -- that we did, and go to the middle of the yard.</span> <span id="s991">We went to the middle of the yard, and they separate the women from the boys.</span> <span id="s992">And we want to go w-with them, and they didn’t allow it, and they took the boys and they took them to a place, and later on they went to Estonia, and with this group went Josef my friend, and I came back without him.</span> <span id="s993">And you could see that’s the end of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s994">And after that they organized all kinds of group, promising Gens -- Jacob Gens, that they are going to Estonia for work.</span> <span id="s995">What they did, they send the people to Estonia and they work.</span> <span id="s996">The -- Josef was in Estonia, also maybe for a year and worked.</span> <span id="s997">Then the -- the -- the -- the last day of the war, when they saw that the war is lost, they shot them all and killed.</span> <span id="s998">Only a couple was hiding, maybe eight, nine people, and they survived.</span> <span id="s999">And they shot them all, and they didn’t have enough time to burn them, and when the Soviet army came, they find the people in the -- and the one who survived saw everybody.</span> <span id="s1000">And there was her father, and because when they liquidated the ghetto --</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: Luta’s father, and Josef.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: -- and yes, and Josef.</span> <span id="s1003">And my father and my -- because they -- when they liquidated the ghetto, yeah -- and that was three weeks before the liquidation from ghetto.</span> <span id="s1004">Then nobody went out for work, and then some partisans group went out to -- partisan.</span> <span id="s1005">Maybe a couple of hundred people, yeah.</span> <span id="s1006">And how did they get out?</span> <span id="s1007">Jacob Gens was sure that some people, with his connections, with his power with the Germans, he will survive a-at least a couple of thousand people from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1008">And he could -- his wife was Lithuanian, his daughter was Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s1009">They would hide him very, very fast, together with themself.</span> <span id="s1010">But he believed very strongly that some people with his -- and in the end, you know the end of him?</span> <span id="s1011">In the end when the people from the ghetto were survo -- were taken to the place from where they were taken to Estonia.</span> <span id="s1012">You know where Estonia is that.</span> <span id="s1013">From there, I even get a letter from Josef.</span> <span id="s1014">Yes, somehow it -- he send out that.</span> <span id="s1015">And Gens came there, maybe the -- to -- to see the people.</span> <span id="s1016">And all the famous bosses of the ghetto, like Weiss, like Himmler, and -- from the Germans, who were very close, good friends with Jacob, and they listened to him, and -- also came.</span> <span id="s1017">And Gens came.</span> <span id="s1018">And then they want to shot th -- him.</span> <span id="s1019">And one said I can’t.</span> <span id="s1020">Weiss said can’t.</span> <span id="s1021">Himmler said, I can’t shot him.</span> <span id="s1022">And he said, give me the weapon, I’ll sign -- shot myself.</span> <span id="s1023">Then came a stranger who knows him very well, and shot him too, and Gens disappeared.</span> <span id="s1024">But Gens, Gens was a Lithuanian general during the war.</span> <span id="s1025">When the communists came, they were looking for him, they want to arrest him.</span> <span id="s1026">I know very well a woman who were a communist, her name was Hannah Borofska.</span> <span id="s1027">And Hannah Borofska knows very well Gens.</span> <span id="s1028">It was before the ghetto, it was th-the -- the Russians came over, and the -- and he came to her, asking her, telling her the story, that the Germans -- that the Russians want to arrest him, and can she help him, to hide him, and she did.</span> <span id="s1029">And she was a communist, one of the leaders of the partisan organizations.</span> <span id="s1030">And somehow, she has a connection to him, and whatever she ask him something, he did for her.</span> <span id="s1031">And he know a [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1032">If you wou -- wi -- he would be enough wise, he would help, little by little to go out, people in the night to the forest.</span> <span id="s1033">Thousands of people could -- could, even the time when they got the connection.</span> <span id="s1034">He let them go out, the last couple of week, the last months before so closed door from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1035">And ha -- how did they go out, you know, from -- the last group to the partisans, you know?</span> <span id="s1036">A friend of mine, his name was Kapinski, and he was -- it was described in somewhere -- he was a [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1037">Before the war, he worked with the canalizations from all the -- so he knows the road, through the canalization.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: The tunnels?</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: The tunnels.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: From the whole city.</span> <span id="s1042">When the whole group of 200 people, 220, went through, he was going through the -- you know, on the street, how so th-th-the round people -- the round places where the people are going to repair the canalization?</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: The sewer holes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: The sewer hole.</span> <span id="s1045">He went down, and after him the people, and he went with a pump to clean up the water, and people went after him until the [indecipherable] of the city.</span> <span id="s1046">And when the people went through, he push -- he let the water go again.</span> <span id="s1047">So little by little they went out.</span> <span id="s1048">And then they divided in two and three and they have the plan how to go to the forest, and they went to the forest to find a connection with the partisans.</span> <span id="s1049">Mi --</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: I want to go back to -- to Jacob Gens --</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: -- because he’s -- he’s an interesting figure --</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: A very interesting figure --</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: -- as you said, he -- he --</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: -- a very interesting figure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: What -- what did people think about the choice that he made?</span> <span id="s1057">After all, he was Jewish and he was the head of the Jewish police.</span> <span id="s1058">So he was the head of the Jewish police in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: When people talked about him --</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: What did they think --</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: -- did they respect him, or did they -- did they -- were they angry with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: They afraid of him, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: Afraid?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: -- he -- for example -- because he helped to organize all the cleanings from the ghetto from one side, but he didn’t have a choice, I think.</span> <span id="s1066">Otherwise we were -- otherwise he was killed right away and they picked up another one.</span> <span id="s1067">I’ll tell you a story.</span> <span id="s1068">My sister -- and my family was in Rasha for turf, but they went out in September when the -- it was very hot.</span> <span id="s1069">And the winter came, and they didn’t have a coat, they didn’t have anything to wear.</span> <span id="s1070">So my sister picked up -- said, I’ll go to my neighbors, and I will pick up some clothes.</span> <span id="s1071">And she went, and she picked up -- they gave her something and she came back.</span> <span id="s1072">Next time, a week later, they didn’t have what to eat, so sh -- they -- they sold something of the clothes she bought, and she went to buy something -- the peasants, and she went to buy a chicken or something, and other people saw her, and so the Gestapo -- she was arrested, she was arrested and bring to the prison.</span> <span id="s1073">And my other sister came to the ghetto somehow, hiding, asking what to do.</span> <span id="s1074">And we went to the Hannah Borofska.</span> <span id="s1075">And Hannah Borofska went to Gens asking hi -- her -- because she was a good friend of ours, to pick up my sister some, and he did and she was re -- they let her go out, you know, for awhile.</span> <span id="s1076">Then it was the liquidation of ghetto, before the liquidation of get -- of the ghetto, they bought every -- all the people from all the [indecipherable] worked with the turf, and the other places to the ghetto, and they liquidated.</span> <span id="s1077">When -- and we ha -- and us, me and Luta, they didn’t took with us through the canalization.</span> <span id="s1078">And they said it is a big group and we can’t go so many people in one time because we will all [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1079">You are not similar Jews, as Jews, and they gave us --</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: You are not what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: Similar as jew -- you can go like Poles, you think al --</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: Oh, oh, you don’t look like Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: -- we are not look like Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: And you can take out your stars, and you have the direction how to go to the forest, and you come by yourself.</span> <span id="s1086">We were five of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: They said you were on your own.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: On our own.</span> <span id="s1089">But we ge -- they gave us the direction how to go.</span> <span id="s1090">And the last night, when they gather -- when most the older people were out from the ghetto, we still were looking for a place to go out, yes, and they s -- they told us attic who were connected with the na -- attic of the Aryan side, and in that attic was a hole with a door, go out through the hole to the attic on the other side, and somehow you will divide it in two, and you will go to the forest by your -- yourself.</span> <span id="s1091">We were looking the whole night for the attic.</span> <span id="s1092">A whole night five of -- I was, and Luta and other three girls.</span> <span id="s1093">Five or six of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: You were in a building just trying to find this secret door inside?</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, in at -- the attic.</span> <span id="s1096">And it was dark and the attic was very big, and finally we find the -- and one of our girls was very brave and she said, I am running the first -- first, and she runs through the hole, and we heard -- heard [indecipherable] somebody was there, they catched up the hole, and this girl was catched.</span> <span id="s1097">We don’t know what happened to her, we never saw her again.</span> <span id="s1098">And we start to run back [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1099">And we were trying to go out, we couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1100">So we came back from all the attics to the ghetto street, they were empty.</span> <span id="s1101">The Ukrainian soldiers were liquidated the Wilna ghetto, and we were trying to find another exit and we couldn’t and we don’t know where we are.</span> <span id="s1102">We are alone, five girls, and don’t know what to see.</span> <span id="s1103">And then somehow somebody goes through, and this is the last of the police, Aryan -- the yard of the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s1104">So we went to the Judenrat and we [indecipherable] there, and with the last group we went to Rosa where they -- where all the people from the ghetto was there.</span> <span id="s1105">It was a rainy night and a rainy day and they were sitting on a big place on Rosa, and in the dis, and when we c -- in the dirt, and as soon as we came to the -- to the place, right on the corner I saw my family.</span> <span id="s1106">My mother and my two sisters with the little child of three years.</span> <span id="s1107">And my mother saw me, why are you here?</span> <span id="s1108">And you are here, why did you come?</span> <span id="s1109">And I was crying and she was crying, I said, where is -- and she told me right there, the men were separate right away, my father and my brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s1110">I said, and -- and -- and sh -- Luta’s father.</span> <span id="s1111">And I said, “And where is Luta’s mother with her aunt?</span> <span id="s1112">Why are you not -- not together?”</span> <span id="s1113">And she said, “Luta’s mother and the aunt are sitting down the hill, a little bit below, not far.”</span> <span id="s1114">I said, “Luta, come, we’ll go to find your mom, and you’ll bring here, we’ll be all together.”</span> <span id="s1115">And we went to find Luta’s mom.</span> <span id="s1116">And we find them, and all of a sudden was an order to go out everybody, and everybody stand up, and we were going, but the people who were in the first place, next to the exit, they were already throw out, and my mother with my sister, with the other sister, with the little three years old child, and they threw them out right away to the left.</span> <span id="s1117">And we were going through the [indecipherable] so the children were left alone without mothers, and -- and we were going, and Luta’a mother and the aunt was before, and when we came to the exit they pushed them right away to the left, the mother and aunt, and me and Luta [indecipherable] to the right.</span> <span id="s1118">We came, there were maybe 800 -- 1800 dollars -- people, or 2000 people, young until 20.</span> <span id="s1119">No children, nobody.</span> <span id="s1120">A group on the right side.</span> <span id="s1121">And the one who were on the left side were taken to Treblinka, Majdanek.</span> <span id="s1122">And we were taken to Riga to Kaiserwald.</span> <span id="s1123">Luta will tell you the [indecipherable] about her mother, and that was the last.</span> <span id="s1124">Another story I forgot to tell you, when only I came to Rosa, to the place where all the people from the liquidation of the ghetto were taken, I saw a little farther a big, tall building.</span> <span id="s1125">And from the roof of the building were three [indecipherable] like they are going to hang somebody.</span> <span id="s1126">Three.</span> <span id="s1127">We said, what’s this?</span> <span id="s1128">And all of a sudden, three people from the partisan organization of Wilna, the three I was quarreling with them, why are not taking you with us, and he said we are a group people, we are full of weapons, and we can go with a group people.</span> <span id="s1129">It was a friend of mine, Asia Bik, Janka Kaplan, and Abrashak Voynich, he was a leader of the Bund.</span> <span id="s1130">And all of a sudden I saw that they went on the [indecipherable] and the [indecipherable] around their head and they were hanged.</span> <span id="s1131">And the mother of Asia Bik was around, we start to hide in her, not to see.</span> <span id="s1132">The same day of the liquidation of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1133">And all the years I was in the concentration camp, I was thinking, what happened to our old group.</span> <span id="s1134">Were they all kotched?</span> <span id="s1135">Why are these kotched, what happened to the other, I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1136">When I came back to Wilna after the -- the liberation, I find out that these three people with the weapons, get lost.</span> <span id="s1137">Instead to go to the left, they went to the right, and they meet a group of Lithuanian and German soldiers and they were looking at them, that they start to shot, and it was a fight and they were kotched and bought on the face of the whole population of the ghetto, they were hanged.</span> <span id="s1138">This I found out when I returned in 1945 from the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1139">And the other people, who went the right way, they survived, mostly survived.</span> <span id="s1140">A couple were killed during the -- being in the Holocaust, from all kinds of people.</span> <span id="s1141">And the -- the other people survived then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: I-I-In talking to your mother or Josef or your father, ha-ha-had you ever prepared for a day like that, I mean, had you made p-plans, or said good-bye?</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: No, we didn’t [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1144">I will tell you.</span> <span id="s1145">Luta’s father has connections and they have a house where the ladies who worked in their house for 40 years were still living.</span> <span id="s1146">They were out but the Polish women, they -- and the engineer came to him and asked the permission to build up a hiding place in their apartment.</span> <span id="s1147">And he came to his son, telling him about it.</span> <span id="s1148">As -- the -- his son, Josef, said, no, you have to fight the Germans.</span> <span id="s1149">In that time we were full of, you know, excitement, we’ll find and we’ll fight, we’ll do this, we’ll do this, we’ll -- we’ll [indecipherable] young people, they always believe in something.</span> <span id="s1150">And he said, not -- I am not going.</span> <span id="s1151">We have to fight the Germans.</span> <span id="s1152">We’ll go hide, and the other people won’t.</span> <span id="s1153">And the father said, to save my old life -- old life, my son don’t want.</span> <span id="s1154">And he said to the person no.</span> <span id="s1155">The worst thing was that people don’t -- didn’t believe in death.</span> <span id="s1156">They thought maybe the people are in -- in camps, maybe they are working, maybe we’ll survive, maybe we’ll -- we’ll [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1157">Because they were lying.</span> <span id="s1158">They said that -- but this little Luta?</span> <span id="s1159">She was small and [indecipherable] they are killing us, they are killing us.</span> <span id="s1160">Nobody will survive, nobody will survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: Did you believe her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: I also don’t believe.</span> <span id="s1163">After -- after especially Josef was taken, I didn't believe that we will survive.</span> <span id="s1164">The Germans [indecipherable] won the war with the Jews [indecipherable] survive how many survive.</span> <span id="s1165">In the camps also was situations when somehow we survived that we could be shot.</span> <span id="s1166">But this is later on, maybe [indecipherable] how about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: Just a few questions about the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1168">You had described that there were two.</span> <span id="s1169">Was there a name or a number of one of the ghettos that you were formerly in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: One was a big ghetto from once -- one side of Jerma street, and the other was a smaller ghetto from the other side of Jerma street.</span> <span id="s1171">It was a [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1172">It was the Jewish center, as I told you, who was empty up in the beginning before the ghetto started.</span> <span id="s1173">And in their houses they put in the people from the whole city.</span> <span id="s1174">And the other ghetto was existed -- existed for not long, maybe a half a year.</span> <span id="s1175">In the other ghetto was the big synagogue y -- as a city, very famous, who was built 600 years ago, and there was the Wilna [indecipherable] was started there in the -- lot of years ago.</span> <span id="s1176">And a big writer, Haim Grada describe in his books about this big synagogue, it was like a city.</span> <span id="s1177">And a lot of people lived there who were destroyed and th-their place, and they -- as the Germans want to o -- every other month or couple of week, liquidated a lot of people, so it was the easiest way, they said okay, this ghetto is liquidated, why the Jews have to have two ghettos, it’s enough one ghetto.</span> <span id="s1178">But what should we do with these people?</span> <span id="s1179">They put them, everybody in the wagons and they put them to Ponar and shot them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: Towards the end of the time in the ghetto, h-how is your health?</span> <span id="s1181">I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: My --</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: -- presumably you’re not eating very well, but how -- how -- what is your state of health, physical health?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: My health was good, and a lot of them helped me that they went out from the ghetto to work for a farm.</span> <span id="s1185">We worked very hard, but we were at the -- at the [indecipherable] all the time, and at the fresh air, and after that we have vegetables.</span> <span id="s1186">And we have carrots, and we have beets, and we have this and this, and I told you that the -- the worker of my house bought us every day a little bit bread and milk.</span> <span id="s1187">Mostly I bought it back to the ghetto, but a little piece I took.</span> <span id="s1188">So sometimes I was afraid to come to the ghetto on the face of everybody who was very pale and very -- I, personally, looked good.</span> <span id="s1189">But mostly the people were very, very, very pale, or very upset, and ver -- didn’t know what to do, get [indecipherable] get -- get lost, you know, a lot of people were left alone because a mother or a brother or a father went to work and they were catched up and they were taken away.</span> <span id="s1190">They thought that’s to a camp, but as we find out later they were shot right away, and kids were -- be left without the -- without parents and s -- parents without kids and husbands without wives.</span> <span id="s1191">I have -- I had a friend, he was in school together with my sister Luba, and he worked for the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s1192">And one time he and an artist from [indecipherable] and somebody else, three of them, get the permission to go out for awhile from the ghetto, outside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1193">And they bought something -- some vegetables, a little piece of bread, and wa -- they went to the ghetto back and the -- at the entrance was Morra, the fuehrer of the ghetto, a German.</span> <span id="s1194">And he saw that they have a package with them, and they were arrested, and people were ask Gens to do something, his wife, to took them out from the prison, but when he came it was too las -- too late.</span> <span id="s1195">They took them right away to Ponar and they shot -- shot them.</span> <span id="s1196">And the wife with the little children were staying in the ghetto, lost and didn’t know what to do, and finally they went to Estonia with a group, and they were killed, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: You talk about people being lost, or people without mothers.</span> <span id="s1198">Towards the end Josef had been taken, you were separated from your mother, what was your mental state?</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: I was crying, I didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s1200">And after awhile, you know, when you were -- were left alone, you don’t care about yourself, really.</span> <span id="s1201">What will happen will happen, you’re alone.</span> <span id="s1202">Otherwise you are [indecipherable] from this person, from that person, you get along.</span> <span id="s1203">What will happen, will happen.</span> <span id="s1204">And when I was left with Luta, I was yo -- always cared about Luta and she about me.</span> <span id="s1205">And we were afraid that something can happen, so we tried our best to go through, and we didn’t have a choice.</span> <span id="s1206">You know, people, when they are healthy, they can kill themself.</span> <span id="s1207">It was not too many suicide in that time.</span> <span id="s1208">I was wondering -- it was a little bit, but not much, not many.</span> <span id="s1209">Other people will -- said, my God [indecipherable] why are we living, what for?</span> <span id="s1210">I’ll commit suicide.</span> <span id="s1211">But not too many commit suicide, not in

towards the end and it’s becoming clear that you and Luta will be together, and Luta’s father gave you some advice about being together.</span> <span id="s1220">Can you tell that story?</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: She -- she -- no, no, she -- where we in the ghetto have to go out to the forest, we were dressed like normal people, made up our hair nice, and have nice pocketbook and were prepared to go out like Polacks, and maybe we will -- can reach the forest.</span> <span id="s1222">And before we came to say good-bye to her father and mother.</span> <span id="s1223">And the father looked at her and he said -- Luta was in that time 15.</span> <span id="s1224">And he said, “Luta, you are a child, you are left alone.”</span> <span id="s1225">I said, “She’s not alone, she’s with me.”</span> <span id="s1226">And he said, “You are also a child.”</span> <span id="s1227">I was 20 in that time -- 19 and a half [inaudible].</span> <span id="s1228">And he said, you are also a

used to live before the -- before the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1248">And all of a sudden she said, “Girls, I am running.”</span> <span id="s1249">And she disappeared from the party.</span> <span id="s1250">She saw that next to her were -- the Germans were not around or something, she saw her place where she lived, and she jumped into the yard where she lived.</span> <span id="s1251">She thought that all of us will go after her, but we couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1252">The Germans was right here.</span> <span id="s1253">I met her after the war, and she still good friends with Luta, she went out and she came to the yard she was living, and she came into a apartment.</span> <span id="s1254">And the -- pull open the door, and she closed before her eyes [indecipherable] go away.</span> <span id="s1255">And she went out to the attic, and there was a little window in the attic, and she looked through the window until the whole group will go by.</span> <span id="s1256">The group was still going to the place they gathered all the people, and she looked --</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q: Marching by?</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A: -- yeah, like the people marching

thing to cover her head, and she gave her some food.</span> <span id="s1261">And she explained to her the way how she can go to the forest.</span> <span id="s1262">And she went to the forest and she reached the forest, and she reached the partisans, and she was -- her sister was already in the partisans and she was older, until the end of the war with the partisan.</span> <span id="s1263">And we meet her when Luta, on her way to the United States, in Italy she came specially to see her, and then she was in New York, and I saw her and she told me that she -- the story with the Polack that one of them give her to -- what to eat then show her the way to go to the partisans.</span> <span id="s1264">So she has the -- the way, like they gave us everybody, the directions how to go to the partisans, everyone from us has it.</span> <span id="s1265">And she went to the partisans there, she reached them and she survived the war in the partisans.</span> <span id="s1266">And we went to the concentration camp [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: You -- you mentioned in that case a -- a Polish person who helped somewhat, but -- but generally did -- could you rely on Polish people to help you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: On some, but very little, very little.</span> <span id="s1269">Some were afraid.</span> <span id="s1270">Some were -- but I were -- like I told

Poles, like Lithuanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: H-How did you know though, who to trust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: It was very hard.</span> <span id="s1275">It was very hard.</span> <span id="s1276">Some -- sometimes [indecipherable] and sometime [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1277">I know a family, no -- were -- we’re connected with them through the marriage, and they lived in Lithuanian, and his wife was very energet -- his mother was very energetic and she saved a lot of kids, giving them to the Lithuanian family.</span> <span id="s1278">And one of them was her little daughter, she was about two or three years.</span> <span id="s1279">And the little daughter, the Lithuanian family who she knows, took her as a daughter, and the family survived the war.</span> <span id="s1280">Survived the war, and when the war finished they went to look the Lithuanian people, where their daughter were.</span> <span id="s1281">Their sister, the daughter left, and they couldn’t find it.</span> <span id="s1282">As soon as the -- they didn’t have any children, as soon as the German lost the war, they moved and took the girl, and they look for her maybe 20 years, and they still

<span id="s1286">And when he was 19, in the family was an old woman, an old grandmother, and she was dying, and she was on her heart that she has to tell the boy who he is, his roots.</span> <span id="s1287">And she told him that he is Jewish, and that his parents left him when he was two years old, and the parents perished from the Holocaust, and that’s it, but he was Lithuanian through and through.</span> <span id="s1288">She was a engineer and he was a writer, and he was very touched with the story he heard.</span> <span id="s1289">And after he heard the story, he wrote a book.</span> <span id="s1290">In Yiddish is the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1291">The Internal Check.</span> <span id="s1292">You know the checks, the play?</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: Mm-hm,

checks with a German.</span> <span id="s1296">And he have to -- he have to or -- he have to lose, and if he will win, he can be shot.</span> <span id="s1297">He didn’t want to lose to give hi -- the satisfaction the German to win, and he can’t win because he could be shot.</span> <span id="s1298">This is the story of the book.</span> <span id="s1299">And as soon as he feel that he is going to

water, in the dirts, upset, and you know, not believing in survival.</span> <span id="s1314">And then everything was so fast and with such a -- with such a noise, with such a rush, and sch-schnell, schnella, schnella, schnella.</span> <span id="s1315">People couldn’t think.</span> <span id="s1316">Like animals.</span> <span id="s1317">They were -- they were pushed to the wagons, th-they were the place to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: And where was Luta at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: With me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: Were you holding hands?</span></p>

<p><span id="s1332">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1333">And they were right away sent to Majdanek, I think, and there they were sent to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1334">And I want to tell you, if we -- me and Luta wouldn’t go to look for her mother, what it took, five, 10 minutes, we would stay with my parents and we will -- would send also to the left.</span> <span id="s1335">But were -- in the begin -- in the beginning, all the people were sent to the left, especially when there was a little child.</span> <span id="s1336">I remember one person, she has two little children, she was young, had her little children and she has a package on her shoulder with some blankets, or some clothes.</span> <span id="s1337">And she heard right away that with little children, people were sent away.</span> <span id="s1338">So she empty up her bag, and she left only a little blanket, and both of her children, three years and two years, she put into the -- to the bag, put up her shoulders

<span id="s1342">And I can’t say that she did wrong.</span> <span id="s1343">I was thinking if my sister would leave the child, maybe she would be alive.</span> <span id="s1344">But you know, it’s -- it’s a terrible situation.</span> <span id="s1345">You can’t say that she did wrong, that she’s a bad person the way she did that, because in that moment, she get like crazy.</span> <span

and we were sure that one of -- on the left side will be shot, because they were sick, they were old, they were little children.</span> <span id="s1354">We were crying, we were -- don’t have the right to cry.</span> <span id="s1355">The Germans would go through and see somebody crying, go to the left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: A-And so, when you went to the right, where did you go?</span> <span id="s1357">On-onto a train, or trucks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: Yeah, we went -- the separation was ready, they put us to truck, very crowded trucks, and they -- they -- we didn’t know

us.</span> <span id="s1433">Va -- show that we are strong.</span> <span id="s1434">And if we didn't sing so nice, we were punished, we have to walk for another hour and a half before we’ll have our dinner.</span> <span id="s1435">And then we came back.</span> <span id="s1436">So we worked in the Yugalas manufactury for all the time.</span> <span id="s1437">Some people were sent to another factory where -- where they did silk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: What were you making, Rachel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">A: We were making the linen, like the thick linen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Q: Linen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">A: Linen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1444">And in the morning we go over there, in the evening we came back.</span> <span id="s1445">One story I must to sell -- to s -- tell you.</span> <span id="s1446">As there were all from Wilna, mostly the people knew each other.</span> <span id="s1447">And once, girl who were starting in school with me, came to another girl, a friend of me, and said to her, Leia -- Leia was her na-name, do you want to go to the earlier -- because the people from the silk factory used to go a half an hour early home, and our group went a half an hour later.</span> <span id="s1448">Do you want to change with me, I’ll go with your group, and you go with my group, because th-they che -- only they need the account.</span> <span id="s1449">So she said, why not, I am tired, I want to come to a little bit earlier to have a rest, and she went.</span> <span id="s1450">When our group went back, she didn't show up, Lola, the person who ask her to go home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">Q: Leia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">A: Leia was the one who she ask to go instead of her --</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q: Oh, okay, all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A: -- with the first group.</span> <span id="s1455">And she’s supposed to go with the second group, and she didn't show up.</span> <span id="s1456">So our group came and when they count, was one person less.</span> <span id="s1457">Which means that one disappeared.</span> <span id="s1458">And they s -- tried to find out how could it be.</span> <span id="s1459">They were count, the first group came, everybody came who disappeared from the other group.</span> <span id="s1460">It was not too hard to find out, then they find out that one person from this group came before with the other group.</span> <span id="s1461">Anyway, they find out that the girl Leia came instead of Lola.</span> <span id="s1462">And Lola has a mother also there.</span> <span id="s1463">And they said, why did you come instead of her?</span> <span id="s1464">They find out that this Lola is disappeared.</span> <span id="s1465">Anyway, they took her out and together with the mother of Lola, and they took her out somewhere we don’t know, we never saw her again.</span> <span id="s1466">I heard that they put her to the -- to prove the main roads, because sometimes the m -- the roads around Riga, there were main -- mines around, so they took people to go on the roads until they fall on a mine and they were killed on the mine.</span> <span id="s1467">You understand, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q: They used her as a [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: They [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1470">And her mother was killed right away because after awhile they bought the clothes back to the -- what happened, this girl Lola decide with another two men, they find somehow a hiding place, and they want to hide there.</span> <span id="s1471">And not to find it out right away because they have to go out, they have to -- somehow they arranged with somebody, I don’t know hi -- how, the girl survived.</span> <span id="s1472">She asked the girl to go instead of her so the Germans will not find out that somebody was mix -- missed.</span> <span id="s1473">So the girl was killed instead of her.</span> <span id="s1474">She hide then, and she was hidden for a long time, maybe a couple of months, a half a year, until their food finished and they were very hungry and one of the guys went out somehow to find something to eat, and he was kotched, and th -- caught, and the whole group, the three of them were caught.</span> <span id="s1475">But they didn’t kill them, they send them to Stutthof and they made [indecipherable] Stutthof and this -- this girl survived the war.</span> <span id="s1476">I met her, her name was Lola Gittelson.</span> <span id="s1477">Maybe she is still alive in Leningrad until now.</span> <span id="s1478">But the other girl who came -- so even to run away, even to hide then, it was very hard.</span> <span id="s1479">Even if they find out the connection.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q: A-As you’re describing it, there -- there are not a lot of choices.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">A: No.</span> <span id="s1482">She’s -- she’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Q: And yet, you’re making daily choices that in some way keep you alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">A: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: Well ha -- what were the things that you felt that you were doing that were keeping you alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A: Even when she would come to me, ask me --</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">A: -- I don’t know if I would leave Luta.</span> <span id="s1489">But -- but if you would be alone, she would ask me, will I -- will you go before me, I will go with your group and you go with my group, I would go.</span> <span id="s1490">I wouldn’t think about that something is wrong.</span> <span id="s1491">I -- she didn't tell me that she want to hide, that she disappear.</span> <span id="s1492">And I wouldn’t think about.</span> <span id="s1493">So the girl didn’t think about it too.</span> <span id="s1494">But she did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">Q: Well I guess one thing I was -- I’m -- I was also asking is that how -- how were the small ways -- what were the smaller things that you did on a day to day basis in the camp that kept you going?</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">A: First of all, I try to keep myself clean.</span> <span id="s1497">In the bathroom -- in the -- to make a shower.</span> <span id="s1498">We never had hot water, it was hard to wash yourself.</span> <span id="s1499">As bad as it was, I would every day to take a shower.</span> <span id="s1500">A shower to wash myself, to [inaudible] my body.</span> <span id="s1501">Secondly, I was together with Luta, it help -- we were together, we were -- then I thought a lot of my boyfriend.</span> <span id="s1502">I thought he was taking to a camp, I am taking on a camp, maybe he’ll survive, maybe I’ll meet him, so it hold me to survive, to -- to -- to -- to -- to eat.</span> <span id="s1503">Even that -- that the soup is terrible without taste, I ate it, even I could.</span> <span id="s1504">And again, I was with Luta.</span> <span id="s1505">I was caring with her, she was a little girl, still she was a small child.</span> <span id="s1506">Her [indecipherable] she was a strong -- a strong [indecipherable] we were together.</span> <span id="s1507">Sometimes she was taking care of me, sometimes I was taking care of her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: How did she take care of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A: I [indecipherable] we were together.</span> <span id="s1510">And I were with the other two girls with whom we were -- we wanted to run away.</span> <span id="s1511">And we were young.</span> <span id="s1512">We were still young, and we can survive the portion they give us to eat.</span> <span id="s1513">And somehow we survived on our way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">Q: Did you sleep in the same -- did you sleep next to each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">A: Four ap -- yeah, four across.</span> <span id="s1516">Four people across.</span> <span id="s1517">Friends.</span> <span id="s1518">There, when we came to our room, we were alone.</span> <span id="s1519">The Germans were some very -- we were go -- go out from our yi -- you know, went to work or what, and were -- we were still working.</span> <span id="s1520">We didn't have anything from them, but we were going to work, we had a little bit fresh air on our way, by foot.</span> <span id="s1521">And then we worked.</span> <span id="s1522">For ourself, but not -- not -- the mind was a little bit busy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">Q: W-Was there a danger with so many girls and then German guards that -- that some girls might be raped?</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">A: No, but there were some that they were girlfriends of the -- of the people who looked after them somehow, I don’t know, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Q: So some of the girls from Wilna might --</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A: Very little were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">Q: -- become friendly with a guard or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">A: Yeah, there were some, very little.</span> <span id="s1529">Two, three.</span> <span id="s1530">[inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Q: How did the other girls view that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">A: What can they do?</span> <span id="s1533">They said it dangerous, but you know, it happened, it happened.</span> <span id="s1534">This was all about Strassenhof and some girls came pregnant from the ghetto in the beginning, they had the husbands.</span> <span id="s1535">The husbands were taken off, and one wa -- friend of mine came there, she was in the six months pregnant.</span> <span id="s1536">They were three of them from the girls who came to Riga.</span> <span id="s1537">And then they took them to Kaiserwald back, and promised to bring them back.</span> <span id="s1538">And they make them abortions and they came back.</span> <span id="s1539">Was how they -- they destroyed the pregnancy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">Q: The -- the -- the woman who had a six month old baby?</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">A: Yes, they made the -- it’s not an abortion, it’s a like taking birth, and then they came back to the Strassenhof and they were working.</span> <span id="s1542">They survive the war, too.</span> <span id="s1543">A lot of the people who were sent to Riga, to Strassenhof, on the left, a lot of them -- I’ll tell you another story.</span> <span id="s1544">When we came to Kaiserwald, before we went to Stutthof, they make -- the Germans make lists of the people they who they sent to Strassenhof.</span> <span id="s1545">They wrote the name and the last name, where they were born, their age and -- I was staying with Luta, she was 15 years old and I was 19.</span> <span id="s1546">And somehow when the [indecipherable] when they made the list, I was thinking that there were an action in the ghetto where they took the children until 16 years, and they took them away for a camp, but they so -- shot them.</span> <span id="s1547">And Luta was 15.</span> <span id="s1548">I said, Luta, we’re describing us the same age.</span> <span id="s1549">What will happen to you will happen to me.</span> <span id="s1550">We’ll make us both 18.</span> <span id="s1551">I am 18 and you are 18, and we are sisters-in-law.</span> <span id="s1552">She said why do you want what -- makes o-old?</span> <span id="s1553">I said, Luta, this is the way I want, and we’re making.</span> <span id="s1554">And she was 18 and I was 18.</span> <span id="s1555">After a ye -- not a year, after maybe eight months, all of a sudden they took the whole party from the rooms to the yard and they start to count us.</span> <span id="s1556">And they count us, I don’t remember how many people.</span> <span id="s1557">And all of a sudden they called up people before 18 and after 20 -- after 22.</span> <span id="s1558">If Solanis -- Luta was written her real name, that she’s fo -- 15, in that time she was 16, she was taken out for death.</span> <span id="s1559">They took them out, and people were very upset.</span> <span id="s1560">From the room they knocked in the windows, that I am not 20, and I -- you know that -- and they were took aga -- somewhere, and next day all their clothes were brought back to the -- they were all shot.</span> <span id="s1561">If Luta would describe her real age, she would have been shot.</span> <span id="s1562">Nothing helped.</span> <span id="s1563">You couldn’t ask because different people, different soldiers came to pick up this action.</span> <span id="s1564">And about, I would say two or 300 people were taken away and shot.</span> <span id="s1565">After a couple of months they took us to Germany, to Stutthof.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Q: How long were you in the camp in Riga?</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">A: In Strassenhof I think we were two weeks about, if I remember.</span> <span id="s1568">In Riga we maybe in 11 months.</span> <span id="s1569">I have wrote here how long we were in Riga.</span> <span id="s1570">Strassenhof from October ’43, prin -- til August ’44.</span> <span id="s1571">In August ’44 all of a sudden, they came and they said -- because the Russian army came next with -- they took us from Riga to Stutthof, to Germany, when in Wilna already were the Russians, were liberated.</span> <span id="s1572">The -- Wilna was al -- already liberated, and I remember the German boss came to us, to our big group and said girls, you are my Jews.</span> <span id="s1573">In case when the Russians come, I put on your clothes and I am a Jew.</span> <span id="s1574">[indecipherable] he was caught in the end and he was shot from these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: Were there ever any Germans that you came across whether in the ghetto or in the camps that -- that -- somebody who helped you perhaps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: Not me, not me, but there were.</span> <span id="s1577">Very little there were.</span> <span id="s1578">I had, when I -- as soon as the Germans came -- as soon as the Germans came, it was in ’41, I worked at the German place where the soldiers were.</span> <span id="s1579">And I was working in the yard, you know, the cazarnes where the soldiers were during the day and during the night, and they need help to clean the yard, to clean the walls, and they took girls from -- before it was the actions of the pink scheins, he know -- he knew about that, that something wrong can happen.</span> <span id="s1580">And he was so bad th -- a young guy in the brown clothes with the swastika, and he didn’t even allowed us to talk to each other, we were five girls.</span> <span id="s1581">And all of a sudden he came to me and he said, “Look, do you have a pink schein?</span> <span id="s1582">Because something will go on in the ghetto.”</span> <span id="s1583">I said yes.</span> <span id="s1584">And I was -- I was afraid, why is he asking?</span> <span id="s1585">He’s such a bad person.</span> <span id="s1586">And I came and I told the other girls what he told to me, what -- what he told me, and they said, oh, we don’t have anything.</span> <span id="s1587">We are afraid to go to ghetto.</span> <span id="s1588">What -- ask him, maybe they -- he can do something for us.</span> <span id="s1589">We have neighbors on -- in Zarinyitz, on such and such street.</span> <span id="s1590">I said I am afraid.</span> <span id="s1591">He said, go, ask, we don’t have a choice because we don’t have a place to hide, we don’t have a ra -- a pink schein.</span> <span id="s1592">And I came to him and I told him.</span> <span id="s1593">You know what he said?</span> <span id="s1594">I am okay, but my friends, two girls, they lived somewhere there behind the bridge, and they don’t have anything.</span> <span id="s1595">And he said, “Tell them as soon as they can,” in German he said, “let them go to the street, let them take off their -- their signs -- their stars, and let them go over the bridge, I will catch them.”</span> <span id="s1596">Somehow we went with the -- with the group, and they find the [indecipherable] that they took out the stuff, and they went to the pavement, and they went through the bridge -- [indecipherable] blonde girl.</span> <span id="s1597">And they were going, all of a sudden this guy went through the bridge and took the boys -- girls under the hand, and they said, go wherever you [indecipherable] and I’ll go with you.</span> <span id="s1598">And they came to the street, and he said go and ask if the people will take you, and I will wait for 15 - 20 minutes.</span> <span id="s1599">If they want to take you, you’ll stay.</span> <span id="s1600">Otherwise you will return and I will took you to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1601">And can you imagine that the -- that the neighbors let her stay, and he was waiting, waiting.</span> <span id="s1602">We never saw him again, she never saw it again.</span> <span id="s1603">What it was, I can’t explain.</span> <span id="s1604">He was so bad to us if we were talking to each other.</span> <span id="s1605">Maybe he was 19 years old.</span> <span id="s1606">She was with the -- with the stick, he was hurting us, we were afraid for him.</span> <span id="s1607">In that moment he saved the girl.</span> <span id="s1608">She perished another time because there were lot, lot of time, but it happened, a German boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">Q: During those 11 months that you were there and you were working, just what was your general state, what was your frame of mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">A: We hoped that someday we’ll be liberated.</span> <span id="s1611">We knew the war is going to be -- to the end.</span> <span id="s1612">Somehow you know -- we were working with Lithuanian people, Lithuanian were guarding us.</span> <span id="s1613">Not Lithuanian, but Latvian people.</span> <span id="s1614">It was Riga.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">Q: And they were telling you things?</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">A: Sometime.</span> <span id="s1617">Very little.</span> <span id="s1618">That the war is going -- th-that the Germans will lose the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Q: At this point did you know anything about your mother or your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">A: I hoped that maybe, maybe, but I had little -- little hope for the people who were s -- were sent to the left, because it was a lot of children, a lot of old people, a lot of sick people.</span> <span id="s1621">Mothers went because of their children, they didn’t want to leave them alone.</span> <span id="s1622">But still a little hope was maybe.</span> <span id="s1623">And they return after the war to Lithuania, to Wilna because I hoped that somebody of the family will stay alive, and we said to each other, wherever the war will finish, wherever you be, you return to Wilna, and it’s here we’ll meet.</span> <span id="s1624">This way, we returned to Wilna and then we didn’t have a place to go back and you know, start to build up their own life how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q: Did you pray at all when you were in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">A: No, I wasn’t religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">Q: Were you -- wa -- anything that brought you solace?</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">A: I thought if God would exist, it wouldn’t happen.</span> <span id="s1629">And if it happened [indecipherable] righteous, it means that there is not God in the world.</span> <span id="s1630">Maybe I was wrong, but you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">Q: Can you tell us about th-the switch, a -- I guess it -- you were saying it was August of ’44, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q: -- what was going on, and you were moved to a new -- a new camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">A: August ’44, we were working, we came for wor -- from work, and they saw it, they came to our room and said, be ready, tomorrow we are going by boat to another camp.</span> <span id="s1635">We didn’t know where, we didn’t know what.</span> <span id="s1636">And we were ready, and we went to Gdansk, Gdansk and they put it to a big boat on the bottom.</span> <span id="s1637">Very crowded.</span> <span id="s1638">They put up all the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1639">And we were going with the ocean -- with the Baltic Ocean.</span> <span id="s1640">And we were hungry, we didn’t have what to eat, it’s so crowded.</span> <span id="s1641">And I never saw an ocean.</span> <span id="s1642">And I saw Luta, somehow let us go to the top to see the ocean.</span> <span id="s1643">I want to see an ocean.</span> <span id="s1644">I don’t remember how, but we went to the top and we saw the ocean.</span> <span id="s1645">And we came back to our place, and we came to Stutthof.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">Q: What was the ocean like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">A: Baltic Ocean.</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">Q: But can you describe seeing it for the first time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">A: You know it’s big.</span> <span id="s1650">[indecipherable] of water, we saw only water, water without a beach, without a land, from all the [indecipherable] you know?</span> <span id="s1651">Interesting [indecipherable] came back, and it was so crowded, it was so dirty, it was so [indecipherable] and dark, and people were -- we didn’t know where we are going, to what and to when.</span> <span id="s1652">And then they brought us to the Stutthof, that terrible camp.</span> <span id="s1653">And we saw the people like death were going around here and there, and -- and again sounds that -- and the -- and they was shouting, and ri -- people were -- they lost their mind, they -- they -- how can you survive it, fr-from the noise, from the -- I remember they bought her to her room, and a crying woman was the [indecipherable] it means the oldest of the -- of the rooms we were, it’s a big room, and they make there the per -- a peu.</span> <span id="s1654">It means -- it means they want the count.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">Q: A roll call.</span> <span id="s1656">A roll -- oh count, the roll call.</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1658">And we were staying to five -- five people here, next to them another five, next to them another five, next to them another five until the end of the big hall.</span> <span id="s1659">And all of a sudden they said, sit down where you stand.</span> <span id="s1660">And one were sitting in the feet of the other.</span> <span id="s1661">One with another, five of us.</span> <span id="s1662">And there were a little empty room, and another group five [indecipherable] they said, sit down.</span> <span id="s1663">And here how they live.</span> <span id="s1664">And they gave us a little bowl, and said this is for your food.</span> <span id="s1665">This is if you want urinate.</span> <span id="s1666">This is what -- this what you have.</span> <span id="s1667">You couldn’t wash it, you couldn’t change it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">Q: You couldn’t wash it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">A: Or you couldn’t change it, there was nothing.</span> <span id="s1670">That’s all they did.</span> <span id="s1671">And we were oy -- and Luta start to say here we’ll die, we’ll die from the -- the -- the -- Rochola, Rochola, she said, will we die, will we survive?</span> <span id="s1672">I said, yes, we’ll survive from the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">Q: Did you believe that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">A: I told her to give her a little bit hope.</span> <span id="s1675">I didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1676">[inaudible] hope.</span> <span id="s1677">And then, after awhile and we didn’t work, that was the worst.</span> <span id="s1678">But still there was a washroom with cold water, and seldom were of all the people were going to the washroom to wash themself.</span> <span id="s1679">They didn’t have energy.</span> <span id="s1680">They didn’t have the -- they were not strong any more.</span> <span id="s1681">And we went out only from the room for awhile.</span> <span id="s1682">It was soon winter, we saw big mountains of dead, dead naked bodies around the corner of the [inaudible].</span> <span id="s1683">We returned.</span> <span id="s1684">I tried to take a shower every day, as bad as it was, as cold the water as was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">Q: Did Luta --</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">A: And I took Luta also as -- and she was afraid that it’s the end.</span> <span id="s1687">And we lived there maybe for a month or six weeks.</span> <span id="s1688">It was very terrible, very dirty.</span> <span id="s1689">And all of a sudden we heard that people were taken to work on farms, somehow.</span> <span id="s1690">Some people were afraid, but we saw one group went.</span> <span id="s1691">They picked up some people.</span> <span id="s1692">And we said to each other, Luta to me and I to her, let’s go, let’s try.</span> <span id="s1693">And somehow we went out to the group, and we were picked up to go to work to there, because the German people, the men, they were all taken to the army, to the front, to -- t-t-to fight.</span> <span id="s1694">And all the women were left with the big farms, and the winter was coming, and they have to pick up the -- th-the beets and the carrots and the potatoes, and the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">Q: The harvest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">A: -- they didn’t have.</span> <span id="s1697">So [indecipherable] people get some people from the camp.</span> <span id="s1698">And they got as five of us, and we went.</span> <span id="s1699">This may be also changed a little bit our life and helped to survive.</span> <span id="s1700">We worked very, very hard.</span> <span id="s1701">We came to a place, and the women were -- was very, very bad.</span> <span id="s1702">But there was a housekeeping woman, and she cooked for us once a day.</span> <span id="s1703">In the morning we wake up, we went to the field to -- that’s right, the field, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">A: To work.</span> <span id="s1706">It was very hard to pick up from the earth th-th-th-the -- the carrots and the beets, and the -- and the beets for the -- for the calfs, you know, the white one.</span> <span id="s1707">And -- with the hand, we didn't have it -- and she, th-th-th-th-th-the -- the wife of the Nazi was after us, urrr.</span> <span id="s1708">And they brought Ukrainian people also, the one who were caught from -- I don’t know, from the army or from what.</span> <span id="s1709">And they were shouting of the -- with the worst things on the woman --- on the woman, the boss.</span> <span id="s1710">And she came to us, can you tell me what they said?</span> <span id="s1711">And they said terrible words, I said, we don’t know Ukrainian, how can we know what they said, we don’t know.</span> <span id="s1712">And they were angry, you know, they were not so afraid like me, they were not so tired.</span> <span id="s1713">And we were there maybe for four months.</span> <span id="s1714">So we were on the fresh air.</span> <span id="s1715">They said that the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">Q: So you spent the night there?</span> <span id="s1717">You lived there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">A: Yeah, they gave us a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">A: -- little room for five people, and once a day they -- th-the housekeeper make the best for the food, that we were not hungry.</span> <span id="s1721">And on the fresh air and from time to time we can catch a -- a carrot to eat, a -- and we were a little bit strong, yeah.</span> <span id="s1722">And maybe it saved our lives, but -- later on.</span> <span id="s1723">But they also, one of our people, of the girls, they -- she want to go to the bathroom, and it was far away the yard, and it was a little bit too dark, and she went to the bathroom on the yard, and all of a sudden, you know who sent a dog to her, and the dog went after her and bite her in the foot, and she start to shout and cry very much.</span> <span id="s1724">From that time I was afraid for a dog for a long, long time.</span> <span id="s1725">And then she came to us and we tried to make a disinfection and to help her.</span> <span id="s1726">Such things happen.</span> <span id="s1727">And still, when the four or five months finished, the winter came, and they se -- they send us back to Stutthof.</span> <span id="s1728">And this was really a terrible time.</span> <span id="s1729">But being there in the room by ourself, we wash ourself, we hold ourselves clean, we wasn’t so hungry.</span> <span id="s1730">But when we came he -- back, and they put us back to Stutthof again, one in each other, where people were dying terrible, it was dysenteria, it was typhus, it was all kind of sickness.</span> <span id="s1731">And we went to sleep and we wake up in the middle of the night, Luta waked up first, and we were terrible surround with lice.</span> <span id="s1732">Big, I ma -- the lice were this big.</span> <span id="s1733">And there were not a -- and Luta start to cry, sta -- Rochola this is our end, this we’ll not survive and we don’t know how to clean up for -- from it.</span> <span id="s1734">And we were here a couple of nights, and they sit at -- the girls who came with us start to cry, water, water.</span> <span id="s1735">We didn’t have the water.</span> <span id="s1736">After an hour, one is dead.</span> <span id="s1737">Again another, water, water, she has the same condition as me, she was also working for the -- but she came out and maybe the typhus catched her very badly during a night or two.</span> <span id="s1738">And people were running and they were picked up right away and they disappeared.</span> <span id="s1739">We were five, we were 10 around, we were eight, we are seven, we are [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1740">This is -- we’re sure that the end, we’ll die from the si -- from the sickness for -- during the day where we went to stay for raba -- we’re out, they counted.</span> <span id="s1741">Sometimes they count in the room, and sometimes we went out outside.</span> <span id="s1742">You see there were less and less and less, and we saw girls we were so strong and nice and happy at the -- at the farm.</span> <span id="s1743">All of a sudden they go, and th-th-they have diarrhea and we see the wagon came and put it on the wagon -- wagon and took them to the [indecipherable] and home because there was such a place where they took the sick people and they -- of course they shot them right away.</span> <span id="s1744">For a little while we were there, and all of a sudden me and Luta find out that they need people to clean potatoes for the -- for the camp.</span> <span id="s1745">Come, she said, come.</span> <span id="s1746">And I was so upset, I didn’t have any more energy.</span> <span id="s1747">But I said we have to go some, we have to do something.</span> <span id="s1748">We went out and somehow they pick us out a -- pick us up to the place where we are cleaning the potatoes for the camp.</span> <span id="s1749">And a group of people, all of a sudden -- the worst were the women Nazis.</span> <span id="s1750">They came, they were so bad.</span> <span id="s1751">The men also was bad, but -- but not so terrible as the women.</span> <span id="s1752">And I was wondering, how can a women, a women be so bad, but they were.</span> <span id="s1753">We were cleaning the potatoes, a group of maybe 150, or maybe hundred, I don’t remember how all.</span> <span id="s1754">All of a sudden somebody came, the Germans, and threw the potatoes, wherever it fall, it fall.</span> <span id="s1755">To your head, to our face, or -- who catched it, catched it.</span> <span id="s1756">One time was such a story.</span> <span id="s1757">A little girl, she came not far, they bought her from Hungary -- Hungary.</span> <span id="s1758">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1759">And she came, and she also came to the potato [indecipherable] but she was -- she was looking well, she was a healthy -- she was not so long in the camps as we.</span> <span id="s1760">And she was -- and all of a sudden a German, drunk German came, look very good, and they were around, going around, drunk.</span> <span id="s1761">And all of a sudden he came to the girl, and he start to talk to her, and she get [indecipherable] sudden, she was afraid.</span> <span id="s1762">And all of a sudden he gave her a pick and put her on her -- on her knees.</span> <span id="s1763">Sit -- he sits where she was, and put her on her knees.</span> <span id="s1764">And she did so, you know, frightened.</span> <span id="s1765">And he start to talk to her, and all of a sudden such a n -- Nazi woman came in.</span> <span id="s1766">And she saw it and she gave her a slap and she start to beat her up.</span> <span id="s1767">Whore, she start to talk to her, with all the terrible w-words, and she put her away.</span> <span id="s1768">What she do -- did with her, I don’t know, she killed her, she [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1769">And he was laughing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">Q: So at this point you’re peeling potatoes in Stutthof.</span> <span id="s1771">What -- what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">A: After that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">Q: -- what comes after that, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">A: After that, they put it to another place, us, the people who peel the -- in another room, who were from wood making such beds, one after the other, so everyone has his own place to sleep.</span> <span id="s1775">They gave us better to eat, and we have much better conditions.</span> <span id="s1776">And after that, after awhile, they start to evacuate the camp of Stutthof.</span> <span id="s1777">It was January.</span> <span id="s1778">We didn’t have any clothes, we didn’t have any shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">Q: You didn’t have shoes?</span> <span id="s1780">A: Yeah, they were rip, the -- you know, was so many years we wearing the same shoes.</span> <span id="s1781">And people were evacuated.</span> <span id="s1782">And other people want to go out, they want to be evacuated, too.</span> <span id="s1783">And I said to Luta, Luta, I am not going now.</span> <span id="s1784">The -- it’s very cold, the weather is terrible.</span> <span id="s1785">We can get frozen on the middle of the -- we were evacuate through the forest, it’s around, around forest.</span> <span id="s1786">And I said it’s very dangerous to go.</span> <span id="s1787">Let’s wait a little bit.</span> <span id="s1788">She said, no, better to go, I said no, I am not going in the end of January.</span> <span id="s1789">It’s very cold, and we’ll stay a little bit longer, and we stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">Q: Alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">A: No, other people.</span> <span id="s1792">They took a group, as much as they can take on a -- on a train, and no, not on train, by foot.</span> <span id="s1793">They evacuate there by foot, through the forest.</span> <span id="s1794">A little bit farther, because the -- the front.</span> <span id="s1795">They -- they’re losing the war, and it came nearer and nearer to the place we were.</span> <span id="s1796">But in the beginning of mar -- March, or in the ever end of the February, when the sun was a little bit shining, we decided to go.</span> <span id="s1797">And they evacuated us and brought us to a little camp.</span> <span id="s1798">And in the little camp, the manager from the camp, the German was the one who was the chief in Strassenhoffer, we were in Riga, the same person, and he recognized us.</span> <span id="s1799">We were there almost for a year, for 11 month.</span> <span id="s1800">And he start to shout, my Juden, my Juden.</span> <span id="s1801">Give them the plac -- the best place.</span> <span id="s1802">And they gave us a room where we were sitting.</span> <span id="s1803">They gave us from time to time what to eat.</span> <span id="s1804">We didn’t work, we only sit there.</span> <span id="s1805">And in that time my feet start to be sl -- swollen and Luta will start to cry because that we’ll have -- we have dysentery, and we -- you’ll have typhus, you have -- you -- you are dying, you [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1806">I said, don’t cry, I will not die, it will go away.</span> <span id="s1807">And we were there sitting for maybe a week, or what.</span> <span id="s1808">And then they said -- one evening they came and they with big balls with water, something inside.</span> <span id="s1809">And they said, you have to take off all your clothes.</span> <span id="s1810">Leave only very little thing to cover the self, and the blanket.</span> <span id="s1811">And you have to put in to make an [indecipherable] it means a disinfection to get rid of lice or something.</span> <span id="s1812">And there were robes over us, and then you’ll dry it on these rocks there.</span> <span id="s1813">The clothes.</span> <span id="s1814">I was in -- I didn’t have a choice, we did it, and we were covered with blankets, and everyone something on them, that’s all.</span> <span id="s1815">They were all women.</span> <span id="s1816">Then we dry it out and we put over us.</span> <span id="s1817">It was in the morning [indecipherable] in the morning.</span> <span id="s1818">About two o’clock at night they said you have to put on your clothes, and we are evacuating the camp.</span> <span id="s1819">But everything was wet.</span> <span id="s1820">But we didn’t have a choice.</span> <span id="s1821">We put on the wet o -- clothes, and we surround us with the blankets.</span> <span id="s1822">And it was a terrible night, it was snowing, it’s mar -- it was March, the ninth of March.</span> <span id="s1823">It was snowing, it was cold, and Luta says I can’t, I can’t go.</span> <span id="s1824">And I look, she was burning.</span> <span id="s1825">I said Luthishka, come, the end is soon, the end is -- we will not survive, we will not survive.</span> <span id="s1826">And we were going through the forest the whole night, frozen and exhausted and -- and it start to be a little bit light at six o’clock, five -- seven o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s1827">No, it was six, 6:30.</span> <span id="s1828">And there was a little lake, and we were very thirsty, we want to drink, and we went to the lake, they allowed us to go to the lake, and we were drinking right from the lake the water, and we were going again, again, until maybe seven, 6:30, and all of a sudden we stopped, and we saw a big barn in the front of us.</span> <span id="s1829">A stall.</span> <span id="s1830">You know what it is.</span> <span id="s1831">Where there is the food for the -- for the calfs.</span> <span id="s1832">A stall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">Q: A barn, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">A: A barn.</span> <span id="s1835">And we were in the end of the group, and the soldiers were [indecipherable] fast, go faster, faster, schnella, schnella, schnella.</span> <span id="s1836">But the people from before didn’t move, and we don’t know what to do, and we were exhausted, we were weak.</span> <span id="s1837">And they said farther, farther, farther.</span> <span id="s1838">And we couldn't understand, but finally we get in.</span> <span id="s1839">What happened, in this barn, this stall was full of people who went [indecipherable] before, and were living there, and lot of them were with frozen legs and backs, it was crowded, and they don’t want to move, they don’t have what to move, and the new people stepped on their stomachs, on their -- on their feet, on their -- and it took a lot of time until we settled on each other.</span> <span id="s1840">And we couldn’t fall asleep, maybe somehow we fall asleep we didn’t feel it, and in the morning, usually about nine, 10 o’clock, they used to bring us some food.</span> <span id="s1841">They, not we, we were new.</span> <span id="s1842">And they saw that nobody bought us anything.</span> <span id="s1843">Then they opened the yard -- they could burn us, I don’t know why they didn’t, cause nobody’s around.</span> <span id="s1844">No sign of kitchen, no sign of food, no sign of -- o-o-of their soup what they bring.</span> <span id="s1845">And there were some brave people and it’s -- was far away, the place was called fino.</span> <span id="s1846">I remember we went through the part and we saw in the little houses it was light, it was nice and we want to go in to see how it’s life.</span> <span id="s1847">And we were [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1848">And these brave three women went to see what’s doing.</span> <span id="s1849">And it’s was far away from the road.</span> <span id="s1850">They went, it was an hour they got back, maybe two, two and a half hour.</span> <span id="s1851">They came back surround with -- with -- with all kind of clothes, and you know?</span> <span id="s1852">And they said, we are free.</span> <span id="s1853">Nobody’s around.</span> <span id="s1854">I -- we went maybe for a mile, two, and nobody’s around.</span> <span id="s1855">All that we see, vacance, with food, with clothes left alone and nobody’s there.</span> <span id="s1856">Then the whole barn, who -- all that could, took their blankets that their clothes were still wet, without hair, and you can’t imagine what it was, and we went all together to the road we went, a mile, two miles.</span> <span id="s1857">And all of a sudden we saw the sound of tanks, the sound of -- o-of -- of cars, the sound -- and the people like they were going, they went right away to that -- to the tanks where the -- the -- they are going, and they didn’t look at anything, they went in the -- to the road, and they stopped the whole -- the whole procession of the -- of the military.</span> <span id="s1858">And I was stand up for awhile, and I said, my God, do I look like all the people?</span> <span id="s1859">And Luta said me -- is very bad.</span> <span id="s1860">I have a terrible headache.</span> <span id="s1861">And she was burning like she -- I don’t know how high up temperature went.</span> <span id="s1862">I am hungry, I want to lay down.</span> <span id="s1863">And I was stopped for awhile and I look to the crowd at the people.</span> <span id="s1864">I thought, yes, maybe we were liberated, but it’s too late.</span> <span id="s1865">We are all crazy.</span> <span id="s1866">We are not normal people.</span> <span id="s1867">Sorry.</span> <span id="s1868">Other people went to the wagon, they find food and start to eat, and they got diarrhea and they were dead right away, after the liberation.</span> <span id="s1869">And I didn’t look at th-this, any [indecipherable] anything of that because it aren’t interesting, I want a place for Luta to [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1870">And we went to -- to a soldier, an officer, and we ask him, can you put us into a house with my sister very sick?</span> <span id="s1871">And he said come with us, and another 10 people come with us.</span> <span id="s1872">I remember this, Luta remembered it a little bit different, but I see it like it was.</span> <span id="s1873">And we came to a little German house, and an old person, maybe for 90 was along -- around, and the officer, the Russian officer came, “Open your house and let the people in.</span> <span id="s1874">What did you do from people?</span> <span id="s1875">Look what you do -- did to people.”</span> <span id="s1876">He opened the house, and we went in to a little house, clean, nice, the table was served.</span> <span id="s1877">I think that the Germans served it for breakfast and they had to run right away.</span> <span id="s1878">With the beautiful beds, with the nice blankets.</span> <span id="s1879">Like the country, you know, home.</span> <span id="s1880">And first of all I put her to the bed, she was burning.</span> <span id="s1881">And then soldiers came in and a lot of people here and there and this was our liberation.</span> <span id="s1882">Like a little [indecipherable] first of all we went to have a shower.</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">End of Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">Beginning Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">Q: Di -- so you were aware that you were being liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1889">That what I told you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">A: I said that it’s too late, because the people how they looked, how they behaved, how we were thrown ourself to the tanks, and to the -- not thinking that there is a possibility they couldn’t stop right away.</span> <span id="s1892">But, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">Q: And how did the Russians treat you ap -- ther -- I’ve heard some stories that some of the Russian troops were always respectful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">A: I’ll tell -- I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s1895">They’re different people, and different Russians, like different people all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">Q: So did you stay at the -- at the house and take care of Luta?</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">A: No.</span> <span id="s1898">There were more people, she has a good bed, and -- and all of a sudden they came, that the ho -- the hospital that is the same town is a hospital and there are lots of sick soldiers, and refugees and there no people to take care of them.</span> <span id="s1899">And who only could, were go to work there.</span> <span id="s1900">After a week I went to work, to the hospital for a couple of hours, and I was taking care of Luta, and she was in bed, she was still feeling bad, she was still, but sh-she has a bed.</span> <span id="s1901">She was in bed, she was -- but she didn’t have any medicine, we didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s1902">And I hoped that she’ll be better and better and better.</span> <span id="s1903">She’ll get a little better and then [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1904">And after three weeks or a month, the soldiers came and they said that this earth where we are now, has to be given away to Poland or to German or to ru -- and who wants to return to his homeland, from where they came, they have to go to the trains, and they’ll go back to Lithuania, to Russia.</span> <span id="s1905">And as we decided with our family, that we’ll meet after the war in Wilna, we tried to go to Wilna.</span> <span id="s1906">Other people were older than we, they wer -- were more -- they thinking a better way.</span> <span id="s1907">They want to go to the other side, not to ru -- to return to Russia.</span> <span id="s1908">They know what -- knew what Russia was and I didn’t knew it.</span> <span id="s1909">I had a good time there in Russia being a kid.</span> <span id="s1910">So we decide to go to Wilna, maybe we’ll meet somebody from our friends.</span> <span id="s1911">And we went through Poland, but I heard that all my family perished during the resistant in Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s1912">And I was mistaken, only my brother-in-law perished.</span> <span id="s1913">My sister survive, but I didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s1914">So we went to the wagons to go to Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s1915">When we came to the border [indecipherable] soldiers came in and said, who doesn’t have any documents have to go out.</span> <span id="s1916">We were very tired, Luta was sick, and we were going together with the Russian soldiers, with Russian officers.</span> <span id="s1917">And they said, you know what girls?</span> <span id="s1918">There in the back are some bags with -- with -- with corn, with some ba -- go behind them.</span> <span id="s1919">Don’t go out.</span> <span id="s1920">Where we’ll go again to a center that -- for the people [indecipherable] you will come to Wilna, to your city, you’ll find some friends, and you’ll got your documents.</span> <span id="s1921">And we listened to
