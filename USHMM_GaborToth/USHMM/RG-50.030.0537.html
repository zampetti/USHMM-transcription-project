Leo Goldlust, and he was born October 7, 1924.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Do you recall early childhood with Leo, being able to roam freely in the streets, do things?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Early on, yes, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s64">Let’s say until – let’s say 30 – as I recall, ’36 - ’37, we – not freely.</span> <span id="s65">I mean, there was always the fear of – of Nazi.</span> <span id="s66">We’d play Juden and so forth and so on.</span> <span id="s67">But we went to school in [indecipherable] to public school, he went to public school and I went to public school and they – there were a few Jewish children.</span> <span id="s68">There was another Jewish child – girl in my class.</span> <span id="s69">Boys and girls went to separate schools, and the – it – it was so-so.</span> <span id="s70">I mean, the other children greeted the fuehrer and so forth and so on and we – we were sitting, I mean Jewish – Jew children – Jewish children, we were sitting in the seats, we didn’t get up.</span> <span id="s71">Whatever, whatever, the – but the – but otherwise we were mostly together with other Jewish children.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: When earlier on I asked you about your father leaving Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Do you recall why he left Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: It’s a hard question because –</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: I [indecipherable] I don’t know, he left – probably – he had an uncle there, in Germany, which – you know, so he – the reason why, I – I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Once he was in Germany, did he ever travel back to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: And did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: No, he lost Polish citizenship.</span> <span id="s82">I think he left across the border illegally, or came to Germany illegally, or left Poland, or whatever.</span> <span id="s83">I – I don’t know exactly, but we were stateless, we were not Polish citizens.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: When you – when we first were talking earlier with your son, he mentioned that Constance is literally on the Swiss border.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: It is.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: You can walk back and forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Right, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Before the war, do you remember being able to do this?</span> <span id="s89">Do you remember people being able to cross the border –</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s91">Yes, we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: And was there a thought that your parents might try fleeing over the border into Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Switzerland was closed.</span> <span id="s94">I mean, if they didn’t – if they wouldn’t – wouldn’t accept Jewish refugees, very, very few.</span> <span id="s95">But they immigrate – to immigrate into – to Switzerland was quite impossible, apparently.</span> <span id="s96">But we did cross the border, was a – was one – one Jewish community for – at a certain time, but they became – as things became worse in Germany, the – the Jewish community in – in Switzerland [indecipherable] remained – remained by themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: And they re – they remained intact, but in Constance the –</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: People started –</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: – people started to flee?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s101">People started immigrating to – to United States, to Argentina, to wherever.</span> <span id="s102">Where there was any – any opening to go to – to – at that time to Israel, which was Palestine at the time, if they were lucky enough to get there.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Tell me about your f – your recollections of Kristallnacht, the November pogroms of 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: November pogrom, 1938, a – a – that’s very early they were – they came into the nac – I don’t recall.</span> <span id="s105">It was quite, quite early and they – two Gestapo came in, and they took my father, they went through the apartment, didn’t do that – that much damage, but they were looking for a – was later on my father mentioned the things, they were looking for literature, for books, which not – which were forbidden to read.</span> <span id="s106">And the – and so forth and so on, but then – but then when I woke up they had – they had just left with my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: They took your father with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: They arrested him?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Do you know where they took him?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Gestapo headquarters, we – we assumed, and from there to Dachau.</span> <span id="s113">The – all – all the Jewish men were taken to – were arrested the same – that same night or morning, early mornings.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: How long was he in Dachau, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: He came back – I re – I recall he came back Hanukkah time, which must have been about four or six weeks later.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: So, just to clarify, he was arrested on Kristallnacht, which was November –</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Just November 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: – ninth, 10th.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Right</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Came back around Hanukkah, so perhaps he was detained for a month, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Sounds right.</span> <span id="s122">And then they started releasing peop – men and – slowly, with the provision that they would leave Germany within, I don’t remember was six weeks, or six months.</span> <span id="s123">I’m assuming it was six months because my father left in June of 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: How did they –</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: So they had to leave.</span> <span id="s126">They had to leave Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: How did he leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: He left – there was an opening – England had an opening for the a – as I recall, I – I think I’m correct about it, for men being released from – from the camps, there were other camps, Buchenwald was one of the camps, Sachsenhausen, there were other camps that they took the [indecipherable] men, the Jewish men there.</span> <span id="s129">And they – so England opened up for those men that were released, without their families, and the – they – there was a camp, called Kitchener camp in – in England, near London I presume it was, that housed – housed the men.</span> <span id="s130">And the – my father tried, of course, to – the separation was supposed to be brief, but to bring us there, but war broke out in le-less than six months later and that – that was the end of that for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Back up a little bit, and just explain to me.</span> <span id="s132">He left in June of 1939, and at that point, had he – had your family tried to get on the quota to go to a different country?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: Oh yes, my – actually we had a very eva – to the United States.</span> <span id="s134">There was a – which we fell under the Polish quota, where my – my father was born, and it was a very – very – and I believe my father [indecipherable] qui-quite early with the American consulate, which was in Stuttgart, I believe.</span> <span id="s135">And the – but – but it was very slow, slow moving.</span> <span id="s136">It was a quota, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: So he had applied for –</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: And we had – we had papers for the – my father’s cousin in New York who sent papers, but American consulate was slow in – in – in giving out papers – visas for families.</span> <span id="s139">Many of them – some of them made it, some of them don’t.</span> <span id="s140">Many, many did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: So you remained with your mother in and Leo after June of 1939 in Constance.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: And how was the situation in Constance for you?</span> <span id="s144">Were you still going to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: No. 1938 we – Jewish children couldn’t go to school any more.</span> <span id="s146">So also there were pe – many Jewish families had left already, and there were few Jewish children left, actually, and they – we didn’t go to school.</span> <span id="s147">There was a – the teacher and the – the cantor, he – they left for a – the U.S., and the – so, there was some [indecipherable] teaching there in the Hebrew school, but we were very – not too – not a great deal, put it this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: How did you feel day to day?</span> <span id="s149">What was feeling in your household, what was the feeling [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Well, we were very – a – it was rather a desperate situation.</span> <span id="s151">W-We couldn’t – we didn’t get any more mail from my – from my father, we were cut off.</span> <span id="s152">Did get some mail from – to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s153">Somebody smuggled it in, or from – from a neighbor that we wrote to, but we were pretty much cut off.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: His business gone, taken from him.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Business gone, right, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: So what were you living on?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: I don’t – I – I don’t know.</span> <span id="s158">There must have been a – there must have been a – some kind of a thing, because we – we did – I mean, we just existed, I mean, put it this way.</span> <span id="s159">My mother and Leo and myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: What did your mother do – do during this time period, just work on trying to get you out?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Just trying to get us out.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: And then – well, it was a – at an earlier time there were kindertransports, which I – I don’t know when they were, you know, the hope that we could leave as a family was always present, which you know, obviously has not come about.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: And when did it change for you again?</span> <span id="s165">What was the next thing that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: A – well, the situation was quite – was in – quite desperate, I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: It was –</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: And when the war broke out –</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: It was quite desperate?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s171">And the – after war broke out, and well, in 1940, all the Jews from that area ca – bordering France were deported to Camp de Gurs in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: This was October, 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: In October, that’s the – October 19 – 1940 – October 22nd, 1940 was the day that the –</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: How did you travel from there to – from Constance to Camp de Gurs?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: To Camp de Gurs it was, you know, a – I remember being places, but I don’t remember how – how I got there.</span> <span id="s176">This – some like a vague – vague memory of it.</span> <span id="s177">It was a train, I don’t remember if they have benches or anything.</span> <span id="s178">Did have benches, but a – along the side of the – of the wagons.</span> <span id="s179">But it was not – it was not the – you know, it was a regular train, actually.</span> <span id="s180">That kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Were you with other Jewish – German Jewish refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Yes, from the same town, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Were deported from the – I don’t remember how many people were fe – from – from our town.</span> <span id="s185">And they – from the whole area which is called Baden-Pfalz, which was like here – here you would call it a state, or a subdivision that they wanted to make – make that area Judenra – Judenfrei.</span> <span id="s186">So the – the first – that was the first deportation from Germany, actual –</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Can you translate what you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: To make it free of Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: When you were gathering things, because you were forced to leave, your mother and you and Leo, what did you do at the house, what –</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: We – oh, we lived already three families in one, Jews had to start living into one area, on one street.</span> <span id="s191">Anyhow, I suppose that was the – the plan to – to make it easier, I suppose.</span> <span id="s192">And we lived in – with another – with other three families in one large apartment, which I walked in, by the way, in May, when we were in Constance, which was pretty – quite traumatic, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: This past May?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: This past May, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: How did you feel, standing in the apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: A – difficult to describe.</span> <span id="s197">It’s – it’s – it’s still with me.</span> <span id="s198">So we were – Gestapo – again Gestapo came and the – un – unexpected, unexpected, I mean.</span> <span id="s199">But the to -- about 15 - 20 minutes, I remember one of them leaving, pushed Leo, says hurry up, hurry up, schnell, schnell.</span> <span id="s200">And we were taken out of the apartment with very small – whatever small baggage or luggage, whatever, whatever people took with.</span> <span id="s201">And we were assembled at, I think it was the [indecipherable] it was the train station.</span> <span id="s202">I don’t recall exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Did you know where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: No idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Did they tell you [indecipherable] France.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: No, people – people did not know where we were going.</span> <span id="s207">I remember Leo talking and he – talking to someone – he was quite bright.</span> <span id="s208">He knew which direction we were going, but we didn’t know we were going east or west.</span> <span id="s209">So people are going – were hoping we’re going west, at least.</span> <span id="s210">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: You arrived in Camp de Gurs in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: In France.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: In the internment camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Describe your experiences when you first arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: We were taken from the train, as I recall.</span> <span id="s217">We were taken from the trains onto camion – trucks.</span> <span id="s218">And the – we were pretty – from – from the same community, actually, we were together.</span> <span id="s219">And the – that was long way.</span> <span id="s220">I believe the Germans probably had an – had a – had – they don’t need the consent, but they – Vichy, France accepted, or had to accept the Jewish refugees from there.</span> <span id="s221">I don’t remember how many there were from the whole area [indecipherable] from larger cities.</span> <span id="s222">And there were quite a few – quite a few children actually there.</span> <span id="s223">In Constance there were not too many children, there was just Leo, myself and Hootie(ph) and another child was there actually, or teenager, in this – left in the city of Constance.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: So you – it took days to get to Camp de Gurs?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: We – I-I don’t remem – probably two or three days, something like that, because we stopped, I think.</span> <span id="s226">As I learned later on, there was – we didn’t – Vichy, France didn’t want to accept us, and they – the Germans, you know, tried to – I mean Vichy didn’t have much chance there.</span> <span id="s227">So in – we went to the – got to the internment camp of Gurs, and it rained and it was miserable, and we were taken by truck, and then they – first, old men out to – so – so [indecipherable] Simon [indecipherable] was a cousin to my father, he Hootie’s(ph) – Hootie’s(ph) father, and they – I remember my mom saying please, please take care of my child, this I remember.</span> <span id="s228">And … and Leo got off with the men, and we went on, and I was pretty desperate at that point.</span> <span id="s229">And then they had ilot in Gurs, separate ilots which were barbed wire with some of them double ba – between el – ilots, I think was double barbed wire, between the ilots.</span> <span id="s230">And with the French – first it was fr – I believe it was French army actually, then they changed to Vichy, to the Milice, which was the pr – Vichy – Vichy police, they were guarding us at the time.</span> <span id="s231">And the –</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: You – were you with your mother [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: I – first of all with was my mother, and then they separated the children up to the age of 14, separate –</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: How did you see your –</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: We were in the same ilot, so it – I – I could s – I could see my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: When you says ilot, is it –</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Ilot means the – each separate entity that was surrounded by – by barbed wire.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: So multiple barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: [indecipherable] an ilot was – I don’t know how many barracks was in each one.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: What did you – what were your impressions of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: The camp?</span> <span id="s242">There was – well, it was in October, the – the mud was – people – people get mired into – into mud, couldn’t they – it – it was incredible.</span> <span id="s243">It was in the Pyrenees, and it rained continuously, and there was no – no – yeah, and the latrines, and the – i-it – i – I mean, was pretty unbearable conditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: The conditions were poor?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Very.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: What did you – how did you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Food – huh?</span> <span id="s248">Food

<span id="s510">But, you know, it’s called vendanges, which means to – the – the – the grape harvest – harvesting – grape harvesting and something else, was potatoes or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s511">Potatoes didn’t exist in southern France altogether, didn’t see a potato.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: How did – I mean – so, at this point, you’re living, you’re doing – you’re leaving to do some harvesting, you’re coming – you went back to Rivesaltes.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Back to – we were taken back to Rivesaltes.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: And while you were out at the farm, did you interact at all with just French –</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Yeah, Leo spoke a little French, which he learned in s – in school [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s516">But they didn’t speak fr – they didn’t speak – it wasn’t French, it was Catalan, which is the – the language between Spain and the – Spain and France.</span> <span id="s517">So they spoke – they didn’t – don’t remember them speaking French, but like I say, it was Catalan, it’s a language that’s a mixture of a – so, we didn’t interact with them, just we – we harvested, we worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: So you didn’t feel like there was – you didn’t have any chance to even know [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: Flee, or to go, or it was – yeah, now in – in retrospect think maybe we were probably not far from the Spanish border, but we had – didn’t have a chance to get away.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: And in retrospect –</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: Or maybe could have, maybe – I – I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Also in retrospect, could these people have helped hide – hide the Jews, hide some of the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: They – this – you couldn’t underst – they couldn’t understand us – we couldn’t – first of all, we only spoke German, by the way.</span> <span id="s524">Didn’t speak French.</span> <span id="s525">Leo spoke a few high school – high school French, but that’s all [indecipherable] I – I think it was just a – a woman with a child or two children our age.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: And so – and when you’re 14, I believe, in 1940 – you were in Rivesaltes until when?</span> <span id="s527">When were you in Rivesaltes until?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: Til October ’41, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: October ’41?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: And then in October ’41, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: I – again, it must have been a – I suppose OSE, hm – either OSE or I don’t know who – who took us out, very frankly.</span> <span id="s533">I have no – no idea, I mean, somebody must have spoken to the parents, or my mother, and they –</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Do you remember how it happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: How it happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: No, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s538">I just know that I was leaving, I was leaving my mother, who –</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Do you remember saying goodbye to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Yeah, yeah, I remember her saying to – remember who you are, and the – to be good, and the hope to – to be reunited.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: Did your mother – did you feel that your mother had hope you would be reunited?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: I imagine so.</span> <span id="s543">Hope springs eternal, they say, but I – I re – I – I imagine so, that we should all be united – reunited with the – with my father hopefully, but the –</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Where were you taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: The – we – taken to a home in – OSE home, in cru – La Creuse(ph), which – which there’s about three homes there that they – they – many of the – many of the children or teenagers that were there were from the camp, and some of them were from – who were refugees or Kindertransport children from the – from Germany that were in the Paris area, and as the Germans came in they – they fled f-further.</span> <span id="s546">Many of the parents remember remaining in Germany didn’t know what happened to them, and they – so –</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: How long were you at this home?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: At the – hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: In the –</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: The home?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: The first – the first home that you were in?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: A – Marjolet?</span> <span id="s553">’41 til – til about ’43, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Did your – your mother was not able to see you?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: How about Leo?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: Leo was left – Leo was left there also in the – in the camp, and he, later on [indecipherable] I don’t know if s – I don’t know if I gave it to you, I may not have, where he writes that he has to leave Maman, and he’ll have to – that the Eclaireur Israeli de France, the French scouts had a home in Morsak(ph) which is in south [indecipherable] who had the home, also took out the teenagers, the older ones, that freedom or [indecipherable] and for a time, yeah, I was in – I was with him in Morsak(ph) for a few – oh, maybe a month or six weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Was this before you w-were in –</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: After my mother wa – after my mom was deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: So, in wa – in Marjolet, can you just describe what it was like for you?</span> <span id="s561">Did you feel a sense of relief being out of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: No, I – I probably cried for two weeks, being separated from my mother.</span> <span id="s563">And we were – how should I put it?</span> <span id="s564">Kids that came from the camp, they had to be deloused.</span> <span id="s565">And the – it – it – the first few weeks were – were very hard.</span> <span id="s566">But the children there were – you know, telling [indecipherable] and some of them – we didn’t speak French, most of us didn’t, you know, came from Germany and barely – and the – we learned really fast.</span> <span id="s567">The smaller they were, the faster they learned.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: And so –</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: So it was French mostly – huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Day to day, what was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: In the home?</span> <span id="s572">It – it was – it was good, you know, it was good.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: And [indecipherable] were –</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: It was interesting with the – with – with the other – with the other children.</span> <span id="s575">There was even a class, there was even a school classroom.</span> <span id="s576">And we were, you know, the kids from – from – yeah, from – from that – we were integrate in the whole – so – so to learn French wasn’t – I don’t even [indecipherable] I think it took weeks, the kids just – just started speaking it and knowing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Do you remember anyone during that time period, any figure or person that stood out in your mind as being really helpful to your survival, your day to day survival, your emotional survival?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: Yeah, there was a director of – the director of the – of the home was Monsieur, Madame Bloch, Bloch, b-l-o-c-h, who – who were the really kindest – kindest, best people that you – who consoled us, I mean, people that came there, I think they – we understood them, I think they spoke German, and the – until we became integrated into the – the French society over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: Which didn’t take long, by the way, anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: You were there for two years, a little –</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: [indecipherable] two years, a year and a half, two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: Yeah, close to two years –</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: – for only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: And then you were moved – where did you move?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: We were in the – they star – we were – they started looking for places to – to hide children, and they – so that was in the – near the Swiss border, and then i – so that was already after deportations from – that we knew already that – we didn’t know, I mean, that that would be final – the final solution there.</span> <span id="s589">And hope was always there.</span> <span id="s590">But they were hiding children either with fra – in France or in – in the – I was in Chambéry at the Salvation Army, by the way, with another few girls.</span> <span id="s591">There was a – not a convent, they – where they were hiding the boy – th-the boys in the religious – a – like a monastery, probably off in that area.</span> <span id="s592">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Hand up for a second to – you mentioned deportations.</span> <span id="s594">Had you – once you left Rivesaltes, how did you know what was going on with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: We – we were in – in contact at – for – for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: You were receiving letters?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Right.</span> <span id="s598">I – I remember her last letter I got from her, I mean, that she was taken to a different – we didn’t – we didn’t know at that time, we didn’t – we didn’t know what the – the fi –</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Can you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: – we didn’t know about the final solution, let me put it this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: You received the letter, and what did the letter say?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: That they – she will be going to a different camp, and she will probably hear from – we will hope – hopefully hear from her.</span> <span id="s603">Something like that, the last – the last letter which we had – first of all, when we were – left Marjolet to go to Haute-Savoie being hidden with a family, with a French family for a wh – for a few – for a while, we had to – we had to get rid of everything [indecipherable] in German everything al-already, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s604">I recall an incident I wrote to Leo, who was in Morsak(ph), which was the – with the French scouts Eclaireur Israeli du jour – de France.</span> <span id="s605">And I used to turn over envelopes and it was from Rivesaltes, and I turned them inside-out to send to him.</span> <span id="s606">And he – he wrote me back to – to – to be careful.</span> <span id="s607">So in – he [indecipherable] he wrote on one side of the corner of the letter was g-i-e-b on the – on the bottom, he wrote an eight, which means in German gieb - give, acht, mean, be careful.</span> <span id="s608">And I understood what he meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: So he wrote in code, and you –</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: He wrote in code, and I knew what he meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: When did you hear the – so, you received the last letter from your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: In other words, not to return – turn the envelope that anybody’s is in the – anybody’s in the camp, I mean, they – would would be in a camp, in Rivesaltes?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s614">So she was deported to a different camp, you didn’t know what camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: We didn’t – we didn’t know at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: And what about your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: We didn’t know at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Were you hearing anything at this point from your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: We didn’t – in Marjolet I – I believe I had letters from – or telegram or – there was some – there was some – you know, I don’t even recall.</span> <span id="s620">I believe there wa – there was some, a – not much.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: At this point, are you still keeping track of Leo, until you’re together in Morsak(ph) again?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Well, Leo was already – Leo was taken to – he – it was [indecipherable] French, and he was taken to – it was a Vichy youth camp in – in Annecy.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Do you remember when this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: When he left?</span> <span id="s625">No, I don’t know, because he – we – I was in one home, and he was in the – in the – but they started taking young a-as – Jews to – to deport them, or if they had French papers, even if they had French papers, they took them for forced labor.</span> <span id="s626">So they had to find a – I mean, the – the – the French – the French Jews did amazing job, they – they saved thousands of children, I would say OSE did, Eclaireur Israeli de France did.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: So, you moved to Haute-Savoie, you’re in sh – you are in – hidden in Chambéry and Annecy.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Chambéry and Annecy, I was there briefly with the French – the French family in Peseux [indecipherable] in to – to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s629">I was there for maybe a week, but that’s about it.</span> <span id="s630">And the

child or my – you know, holding my hand or –</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: She doesn’t remember exactly, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: And she remembers, it’s amazing.</span> <span id="s640">She remembers.</span> <span id="s641">And I – and I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Once you – once you –</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: – I don’t.</span> <span id="s644">I remember arriving in Geneva.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: You do?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: I do remember</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Can you describe them?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Oh God, huh?</span> <span id="s649">They were not very kind, the French – the French gendarmes over there.</span> <span id="s650">One of them said [speaks French] where do you come from, you little Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: You were in Geneva?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: In Geneva, at the police.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: What did you do once you arrived in Geneva?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: We were taken to camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Refugee camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Refugee camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Did

id="s661">I – I – I don’t recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: You still didn’t have a sense of –</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Well, you know, in the camps you’re still not free, but the a – I – we couldn’t – we couldn’t write.</span> <span id="s664">I couldn’t write to my father, that – you know, like [indecipherable] you know, you write to Papa, and you re – you know, that we’re

id="s666">So you couldn’t write there and the – that was really – so the same time that I c – my father probably died the same time when I ca – when I came into Switzerland, or before, or after that, I don’t know exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: You knew that after the war ended, right?</span> <span id="s668">That –</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: We found out – we found out after the

id="s706">And what happened by him, I do not know.</span> <span id="s707">As far as I know he joined the – after the Normandy, I believe he joined the – the Maquis, and from the Maquis he joined the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: And when did you learn about your mother, can you tell me what happened to your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: Yeah, well, after the war, we started

Leo that he wrote from the army that he didn’t hear from me, he wrote to OSE.</span> <span id="s730">I got the letter here – I don’t know if I brought it or not, but it’s – it’s in French anyway.</span> <span id="s731">So he – he – he didn’t hear from me, and he didn’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s732">He didn’t know what happened, if I – if I – if I ever wound up in Switzerland, or what happened, he didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: He didn’t know if you’d survived that.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: He didn’t know if I – if I made it across or not.</span> <span id="s735">So he – so after the war, he wrote to that small town in the – which was the sort of sister town in Germany, which was called Kreuzlingen.</span> <span id="s736">And he – I
