id="s99">And then, I had a grandmother, too, with us.</span> <span id="s100">That life will never come back.</span> <span id="s101">It’s right, the time is mine, too, but I never can forget.</span> <span id="s102">It’s hard to describe, even in that language that I know so good, it’s hard -- but I think it’s hard to bring out -- retelling the fear [of the more], the fear for the same thing.</span> <span id="s103">It is -- I just couldn’t describe, but I describe to you one thing about Friday night -- but it was for the Jewish people -- it’s [Labutte].</span> <span id="s104">Because it’s Labutte -- everybody got a little house for their self.</span> <span id="s105">And Friday night, no matter, you reach a middle place [poor people], that Holy [Bible] gave the people life to lead a whole week.</span> <span id="s106">Even the people who came to [ask], you know, help.</span> <span id="s107">You had plenty poor people, but when it came Friday night, the candles was light up in the windows.</span> <span id="s108">The cakes they were cooking were smelling all over.</span> <span id="s109">And no matter even -- you know, when the people didn’t have -- they used to [say, “being in the house,” Hallit].</span> <span id="s110">.</span> <span id="s111">You know what the [Hallit] is?</span> <span id="s112">That they should have for supper, [Hallit], because that was the main thing, you know.</span> <span id="s113">The life of -- the Jewish life, a little ________ -- no matter how many books you can write, it’s hard to describe how beautiful and how lovely it was.</span> <span id="s114">It’s so many things to describe about the life in Lithuania -- the holiness, the [Chabas].</span> <span id="s115">My daddy used to go to _____, come back from ________.</span> <span id="s116">Everything was prepared.</span> <span id="s117">It is unbelievable to describe to you the happiness that you used to see daddies coming in.</span> <span id="s118">The table was set, the _______ was made, and everybody was sitting around the table and eating and enjoy it, the [Chabas].</span> <span id="s119">The [CHabas] gave you so much for the whole week.</span> <span id="s120">To grow on.</span> <span id="s121">And you were brimming again about another Chabas.</span> <span id="s122">So that life, no matter what it is, and again, you [have to describe it], you don’t have, we don’t see.</span> <span id="s123">And we will never see it again.</span> <span id="s124">Never again.</span> <span id="s125">It’s just for my eye I could see . . . candles’ lights, this mirror, the way they were singing, the windows in the summertime was open.</span> <span id="s126">It is a life -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s127">I even, I think you need it.</span> <span id="s128">I cannot describe the beauty, what it means Friday night at [Chabas].</span> <span id="s129">Everybody used to go, dressed up, [Chabas after], you know, the _____, and they could walk and talking and ______ each other, and dressed up with the best clothes what they have.</span> <span id="s130">But with [Chabas], you used to have -- and it’s quite another feeling.</span> <span id="s131">It’s hard, but it was the beauty.</span> <span id="s132">The [Yeshivas], the schools -- you had _________ schools, and everything was gone.</span> <span id="s133">Nothing was left over.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Now, was most -- most of your activity was in the Slovodka (ph) side.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Did you go over to Kovno?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Well, in Slovodka (ph), then you see in Kovno.</span> <span id="s138">You see, in Kovno, I used to work there.</span> <span id="s139">Yet, everyday I used to work.</span> <span id="s140">And after, when I got married, I stopped working, and I had _________ my little boy, my Jay.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: I’m trying to get a sense of -- you’re being very good at explaining to me what it felt like and what it looked like.</span> <span id="s142">What else you did -- were there a lot of cultural activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: I used to help a whole lot, you know, some people (ph).</span> <span id="s144">I didn’t do too much culture, but you see, I used to help a whole lot the Jewish poor people.</span> <span id="s145">For instance, if a girl, a poor girl, had a boy, after awhile forgot about it.</span> <span id="s146">And the girl didn’t have no home, no nothing, and she find a boy and I want to marry them off (ph), see now, what I did, I took another lady with me and I went, took my friends and I told them about the cake (ph), and I said, “I need help.</span> <span id="s147">That girl didn’t have anything.”</span> <span id="s148">But you have to have a dowry, you have to have that and so on.</span> <span id="s149">And one thing I want to tell you -- that it happened to me -- two young girls.</span> <span id="s150">And that’s what I helped them to get married.</span> <span id="s151">And they got married and they were leading a sweet life until, you know, the war came.</span> <span id="s152">I used to help a whole lot people who need some money, you know, to borrow the money to help to get, to buy Singer’s (ph) machine.</span> <span id="s153">They didn’t have -- they have to have special.</span> <span id="s154">I used to help them.</span> <span id="s155">I used to give them.</span> <span id="s156">And then they used to pay me back.</span> <span id="s157">So each time, then, if they need some money, I was on the book.</span> <span id="s158">I used to help them with that.</span> <span id="s159">And then, I -- then what had happened, I couldn’t do anything in life, like culture or so on, because like I said, my husband was -- he finished law and then he started up with the motorcycles, and we have to make a living, too.</span> <span id="s160">So I was occupied with the children -- I had another child, too.</span> <span id="s161">[Pause] So, I was in the business with my husband.</span> <span id="s162">And it was really a life beautiful.</span> <span id="s163">Then when the war broke out, I lost a little dear (ph).</span> <span id="s164">I had a little dear (ph) and I lost him.</span> <span id="s165">Well, honey, it’s a whole lot just to think that, it’s a whole lot to talk.</span> <span id="s166">I don’t know, I’m jumping from one thing to the other, and I’m not going exactly the way it should be.</span> <span id="s167">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Let me ask you a question, okay?</span> <span id="s169">Before the war, was there much anti-semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Anti-semitism?</span> <span id="s171">It started up about three years before the war.</span> <span id="s172">But it wasn’t so big.</span> <span id="s173">It was, but it wasn’t the way the war start.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: So as a child, as a girl . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: You see, the problem, what it was in Lithuania, that the Russians came in.</span> <span id="s176">And when the Russians came in, you see, then it started up a whole lot worse.</span> <span id="s177">A whole lot worse because, you see, the Jewish people -- most of the Prolat (ph) people used to go, “Oh, oh.”</span> <span id="s178">The Russians, they go, “Bring us -- I don’t know -- the breath from the sky.”</span> <span id="s179">But it wasn’t like that, it wasn’t.</span> <span id="s180">I’ll give you an example.</span> <span id="s181">I have an uncle.</span> <span id="s182">He had a farm, a big farm.</span> <span id="s183">And he was _________, and among them was a whole lot farmers, __________ farmers.</span> <span id="s184">He always used to help them.</span> <span id="s185">When they need because they’re in trouble, or they just need a horse, or they need -- they used to have a cow, because the little farmers, they was very poor there.</span> <span id="s186">And he used to help them because he was very big, had a very big farm.</span> <span id="s187">And the farmers knew my mother very well.</span> <span id="s188">Of course, she was raised in that farm, and then when she got married, you know, she came to Slovodka (ph).</span> <span id="s189">And when the farmer’s people, somebody used to get sick, they used to come to us, and the mother used to help them, to take them to the hospital.</span> <span id="s190">She used to cook for them, you know, some food, and take over there.</span> <span id="s191">So, with the farmers, was very, very good.</span> <span id="s192">And, as I remember, and then later on, I will come, maybe to that point, the way we survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: We’ll get to that.</span> <span id="s194">Now, was there much of a change of lifestyle when the Russians came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Yeah, it changed a whole lot.</span> <span id="s196">It changed a whole lot.</span> <span id="s197">I tell you something -- my husband can tell you more than I can tell you -- it changed everything, the whole life.</span> <span id="s198">It took the rich people who had, you know, stores and they took him and send him to Siberia.</span> <span id="s199">And that was before the war started up.</span> <span id="s200">So the rich people, some of them, they were lucky.</span> <span id="s201">They went to America, they went to another place.</span> <span id="s202">But here, I could see everything the way it was.</span> <span id="s203">The middle-class, _______ didn’t bother, but who was in charge in a place like factory people, or you know, the other people, you know, what they had stores, bakeries and so on -- the people went on the first list.</span> <span id="s204">And they took him away and they send him to Siberia.</span> <span id="s205">I still couldn’t remember what had happened to the Lithuanian people.</span> <span id="s206">I still couldn’t think how people could change -- murders, chilling.</span> <span id="s207">When the war broke out, like I told you, the ________ got here and the jail got here.</span> <span id="s208">And what had happened within that time, my husband, he took me and my son and my little girl, and we were running.</span> <span id="s209">Everybody start running to the RUssians, ___________.</span> <span id="s210">We run and they couldn’t reach, they couldn’t see, because the German came here already (ph).</span> <span id="s211">So what we have to do?</span> <span id="s212">No food, no nothing.</span> <span id="s213">We turn back home.</span> <span id="s214">They come in home.</span> <span id="s215">Some Lithuanian people told us, “Don’t go this way, go this way.”</span> <span id="s216">It’s terrible.</span> <span id="s217">They took the Jewish people to the Ninth Fort (ph).</span> <span id="s218">They never came back.</span> <span id="s219">The children, parents, all the people.</span> <span id="s220">____________, they took the children.</span> <span id="s221">They killed them all up there.</span> <span id="s222">Fortunately, we were lucky.</span> <span id="s223">We took the left _______, not the right, and became a home.</span> <span id="s224">And when I saw my father -- he was dark complexion -- he was light, like that.</span> <span id="s225">In one night, they killed 200 people, over 200 people.</span> <span id="s226">It was _______________, then ________ Gatvia (ph).</span> <span id="s227">And we came back and they told us what had happened.</span> <span id="s228">They then took the neighbors.</span> <span id="s229">The blood on the walls -- some people wrote in Yiddish, “Please, name Nicole” -- I don’t know how to say it in English.</span> <span id="s230">He wrote with the blood of the singer (ph), with big letters.</span> <span id="s231">A little boy from the family, what they knew, he was under the bed.</span> <span id="s232">They didn’t see him.</span> <span id="s233">He had seen what goes on.</span> <span id="s234">So that little boy became a life that had to lay there.</span> <span id="s235">I just don’t know.</span> <span id="s236">It is so many things.</span> <span id="s237">So many things.</span> <span id="s238">It’s unbelievable.</span> <span id="s239">You wouldn’t believe it, and nobody could believe that people could be such murderers.</span> <span id="s240">But murderers -- I judge the same people, the same people who we knew, they used to come to my house and _____.</span> <span id="s241">They asked to help -- the same Lithuanian people, they slaughtered them.</span> <span id="s242">But from one _____, from one all the way to the end, they didn’t let _________.</span> <span id="s243">My papa was lucky.</span> <span id="s244">He locked windows, you know?</span> <span id="s245">And they got up on the _________, and it was very quiet.</span> <span id="s246">So fortunately, they didn’t murder them.</span> <span id="s247">They thought nobody’s home.</span> <span id="s248">Well, I want to think.</span> <span id="s249">Well, then it happened, and the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s250">And they took over, you know.</span> <span id="s251">Slovodkians (ph), they took, you know Kovno, all Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s252">They put us in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s253">Our house was on was on -- from the corner from our house, up _______ to the end.</span> <span id="s254">I ______ made the ghetto, already, that was in August the 15th, I think.</span> <span id="s255">Was locked up.</span> <span id="s256">You couldn’t take anything with you.</span> <span id="s257">They had to leave everything that you had, except, you know, the clothes and something else.</span> <span id="s258">And we moved into my parents, in their house.</span> <span id="s259">And then my husband’s family, and his sister -- they all were there in the house where we were living.</span> <span id="s260">It wasn’t enough home[s] for so many people, I don’t know, 50,000 it was.</span> <span id="s261">So we had two ghettos.</span> <span id="s262">One was a little ghetto, and one was the big ghetto.</span> <span id="s263">We were in the big ghetto.</span> <span id="s264">My husband’s sister, her name was Doris, she was married, had a little boy.</span> <span id="s265">And she was in the little ghetto.</span> <span id="s266">I’m going -- I forgot to tell you something.</span> <span id="s267">And getting back the way i told you we find out -- you know what they did?</span> <span id="s268">They took the rabbis.</span> <span id="s269">They got in there, they cut off his head and they parade with the rabbi’s head in the street.</span> <span id="s270">You see, when I am talking, that cannot concentrate.</span> <span id="s271">You see, I have to run from one to the other.</span> <span id="s272">That was terrible.</span> <span id="s273">That was murderous --Yet I never thought that the Lithuanian people would do like that.</span> <span id="s274">A dog, a cat, got more privacies that a Jew.</span> <span id="s275">Well, I’ll make short this. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: No, don’t make short.</span> <span id="s277">If you can remember more incidences of the first two months, what you were doing before you moved to the ghetto, I think that would be very helpful.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: What we were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: What you were doing.</span> <span id="s280">Did they start passing laws?</span> <span id="s281">Did you have to hide?</span> <span id="s282">Was there terror in the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Oh, that was in ghetto we have to hide ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Alright, but in the months, you know, between the Germans coming and the ghetto, there was maybe one month?</span> <span id="s285">or a month and a half?</span> <span id="s286">What . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: To getting in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Before you moved to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s289">What else happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Oh, they didn’t do nothing, just tried to get ahead a farmer who used to deliver us milk (ph).</span> <span id="s291">And I prepared him -- I knew already that we have to go, you know, in the ghetto -- that he should help me to bring some potatoes, flours, maybe, you know, oil, or something else.</span> <span id="s292">And that left us for a couple of months to go on with the food.</span> <span id="s293">It wasn’t easy because we didn’t have anything to eat.</span> <span id="s294">We couldn’t go out.</span> <span id="s295">In _______, you had to go to work, but even if you go to work, you cannot bring in anything.</span> <span id="s296">So I have to hide.</span> <span id="s297">I’ll tell you, when I went to work, I had to slice his bread like that, on my half a loaf.</span> <span id="s298">And I was looking which _______ is the best one to go in in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s299">So, I start looking around here and here.</span> <span id="s300">And then he came here to me, the police did, you know?</span> <span id="s301">The German guard.</span> <span id="s302">“What I have here?”</span> <span id="s303">I said, “Nothing.</span> <span id="s304">Perhaps it got here in your pocket.</span> <span id="s305">Oh” I said, “I got to just slice this bread.</span> <span id="s306">You know, you wouldn’t believe it, but please believe me.”</span> <span id="s307">He took away from me the bread because I have to help out (ph) Jay.</span> <span id="s308">He beat me up like an apple, an apple (ph).</span> <span id="s309">He beat me up, here in the back that for three weeks, I couldn’t sleep on my back.</span> <span id="s310">And the next day, I have to go to work.</span> <span id="s311">It wasn’t an easy life, but still, I was happy.</span> <span id="s312">And I had my family all together.</span> <span id="s313">No matter what he had, even then, they used to tell us, some days it’s a good day.</span> <span id="s314">You can take being in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s315">You know?</span> <span id="s316">They used to bring in the food, and then all of a sudden, they used to take away from you.</span> <span id="s317">And here, it’s no food, hunger.</span> <span id="s318">Then I used to go work.</span> <span id="s319">I used to take some -- I tell you -- I used to go to work, I always, my feeling, I’ll go find my little boy.</span> <span id="s320">By being in ghetto, they burned down the hospital, with the children, with the doctors, with the nurse, across from the place where we used to live, and there’s a site.</span> <span id="s321">They used to take the children from the windows, the little babies, and threw them on the ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: Did you see this?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Not mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: But you saw them -- did you see the hospital burn?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Oh yes, it was not -- it was across from my old place.</span> <span id="s326">I was there.</span> <span id="s327">Not in the hospital.</span> <span id="s328">And they burned up the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Did you hear screaming and . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: I tell you something, that’s what they said.</span> <span id="s331">It’s hard for me because I’m coming back.</span> <span id="s332">[Pause] I don’t know where I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Well, I think you were trying to tell me about life in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: What kind of -- you were working?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: I have to go to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: What kind of work?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: What kind of work.</span> <span id="s339">Digging trenches until I was up to here.</span> <span id="s340">If you didn’t finish, they would beat you up.</span> <span id="s341">They used to give you a special amount, so much and so much.</span> <span id="s342">You have to do it.</span> <span id="s343">That wasn’t _______.</span> <span id="s344">It was, I think, more people.</span> <span id="s345">You used to have good brigades, and you used to have bad ones.</span> <span id="s346">A good brigade means that you would go out and you would shop, you know, to get a package.</span> <span id="s347">The bad ones used to be, like, big, old.</span> <span id="s348">And one day, I went to work.</span> <span id="s349">And we were standing, we were shoveling, you know, sand and mud.</span> <span id="s350">They were building a bridge.</span> <span id="s351">And we were standing and we were talking.</span> <span id="s352">_______ said, “Oh, I wish I would have a _________ before _______.”</span> <span id="s353">I said, “Well, I wish we could have Chabas (ph) to feast.”</span> <span id="s354">You know, we were talking.</span> <span id="s355">We didn’t talk about anything else.</span> <span id="s356">But just to have something that we used to have before the war.</span> <span id="s357">And by talking like that, the German guard got in, and I was standing with the shovel and I didn’t work because we were talking.</span> <span id="s358">He hit me with his rifle over my head.</span> <span id="s359">I don’t know how many stitches I had.</span> <span id="s360">I came bleeded up.</span> <span id="s361">And then I went, and they took me right away back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s362">ANd I came to the _______ and the doctor gave me -- they put in some stitches -- they got out the hair and put me some stitches and bandaged up my head and the next day I had to go to work.</span> <span id="s363">I have to work every single day.</span> <span id="s364">Four o’clock in the morning, and then come back 5:00.</span> <span id="s365">Back home.</span> <span id="s366">My heart, about my little boy, because we used to say, “They get in and they get us and take away the children.”</span> <span id="s367">So, you know, I’m awful sad.</span> <span id="s368">I bet it was.</span> <span id="s369">But now, I have something to tell you.</span> <span id="s370">They got in in the ghetto -- that was August, I think, the 15th or the 20th, I couldn’t remember.</span> <span id="s371">In September, we had Rosh Hosanna.</span> <span id="s372">A day before that, they took out 20 -- 2,000 people to go to the ________, you know.</span> <span id="s373">And there was my father, my husband and my older brother.</span> <span id="s374">And between 4:30 and 5:00 -- do you know what it means?</span> <span id="s375">__________ -- “God’s all over the ghetto.”</span> <span id="s376">They got in and they said, “Get out.”</span> <span id="s377">I said, “Where?”</span> <span id="s378">He said, “Do you see all the people here?</span> <span id="s379">Go with the people together.</span> <span id="s380">Save us little.”</span> <span id="s381">It was a nice -- it wasn’t too cold, but you know, in Europe, the weather is a little different.</span> <span id="s382">And I said, “Wait a moment.</span> <span id="s383">Let me take for my boy his clothes, his little coat.”</span> <span id="s384">He said, “He doesn’t need.</span> <span id="s385">He will have there enough.”</span> <span id="s386">I had a feeling something is wrong.</span> <span id="s387">And I had my grandmother and my mother, my sister, Jay, myself, and we have to go for __________.</span> <span id="s388">And ______ was gone way, way -- hardly could see my --- and I knew, it is a selection.</span> <span id="s389">Because it was about 5,000 people in that area where we were -- was over 5,000 people.</span> <span id="s390">I was working.</span> <span id="s391">I couldn’t say anything that they said only one thing.</span> <span id="s392">“_______________,” God, please, we are poor.</span> <span id="s393">Let them help us (ph).”</span> <span id="s394">Then they came, big field for us (ph).</span> <span id="s395">And everybody has to go forth, in aline.</span> <span id="s396">And we get there, to that place -- our neighbors, I see the doctor, the nurse, there.</span> <span id="s397">_______.</span> <span id="s398">I knew them.</span> <span id="s399">They was ahead of me.</span> <span id="s400">ANd I’d seen that if somebody said, “He’s a doctor, he’s a nurse, he’s a bookkeeper, he’s from the higher educated people,” left.</span> <span id="s401">I said, “That’s terrible.”</span> <span id="s402">It’s come by-and-by, asked my name, what I got here.</span> <span id="s403">So, I told him about ___________.</span> <span id="s404">“My husband, my father and my brother went to the airport.</span> <span id="s405">They are automechanics.”</span> <span id="s406">And I said, “We left over.”</span> <span id="s407">And he said, ___________.</span> <span id="s408">So I told him, “I am a dressmaker.”</span> <span id="s409">But I was young, I was strong, I wasn’t in tear.</span> <span id="s410">He said, _________.</span> <span id="s411">So, to the right side.</span> <span id="s412">To the right side, I knew that we are alive.</span> <span id="s413">The next morning, my father, shall he rest in peace, and my husband and my brother said that they already knew of the airport, but it was going good.</span> <span id="s414">ANd he said, “IF they are not here,” he said my life is not anymore.</span> <span id="s415">That moment -- it ‘s hard to describe, it’s hard to describe -- There you see all the 50 people they took, I think, out of our 2,000, and killed them, all of them.</span> <span id="s416">At random, like dogs (ph).</span> <span id="s417">That was 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: How did you know what happened to these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: How?</span> <span id="s420">People used to come and tell us.</span> <span id="s421">People used to come and tell us this big, big -- how do you say it, ________.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: [Inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: There are people dying to know, there was a ________.</span> <span id="s424">Let’s see, it was a whole lot made out when they got to the people -- the people have to do their own.</span> <span id="s425">And then, they used to kill them.</span> <span id="s426">And add them for the _________, while they just said to him, “Over my dead body, you go get, you know, my coat.”</span> <span id="s427">So, she got trapped anyhow, no matter what it is.</span> <span id="s428">And people used to tell us, and people -- not everybody got killed, but some people were still alive and the earth was just _______, like that.</span> <span id="s429">And who told us?</span> <span id="s430">It was some from Lithuanian people, some neighbors, once in a while used to come in and to tell us that they’d taken so-and-so.</span> <span id="s431">And that’s called the Ninth Port, where all the Germans -- even from Germany -- came in -- the boat from German people there.</span> <span id="s432">And they was going there, too, and they killed them, all of them.</span> <span id="s433">Honey, it’s -- what can I tell you?</span> <span id="s434">It was horrible.</span> <span id="s435">It was . . . I don’t know.</span> <span id="s436">I don’t know reason why -- if that would happen right now, I really wasn’t able to make it.</span> <span id="s437">But I was young, strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: When you, or your husband, went to work, and you went to separate places every day, were you worried that you wouldn’t come back together?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: No, uh-uh.</span> <span id="s440">The men used to go separate and I used to go separate.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Did you think, when you left your -- when your husband would go to work, that maybe you wouldn’t see him again?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Yeah, well.</span> <span id="s443">That’s the way.</span> <span id="s444">And when I used to come back to the ghetto, I didn’t know, and I’d go see my little boy ______.</span> <span id="s445">And I’d go see the people.</span> <span id="s446">And you see, that was the first selection, but it was ______, that is what Rosh Hosanna.</span> <span id="s447">And my husband was working in the airport.</span> <span id="s448">He met there a farmer.</span> <span id="s449">All the farmers used to come and help to build the airport, you know, sand and stones and ______ everything.</span> <span id="s450">My husband start talking to him, and he asked him if he knew a man who got a brother, his name was Itsak Kolinitzki (ph).</span> <span id="s451">“Oh,” he said, “Yes, I do know him.</span> <span id="s452">He’s still alive.</span> <span id="s453">He didn’t go to the ghetto.”</span> <span id="s454">He said, “You are sure?”</span> <span id="s455">And he told him where, you know, he used to hide himself.</span> <span id="s456">And he came home and he told us.</span> <span id="s457">I just couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s458">And now, he would say, “Mrs ______ needs some medicine.”</span> <span id="s459">(ph) Finally, I got in touch with one farmer.</span> <span id="s460">And there used to come the farmer, because they used to have the coal, and they used to take us to the Coal Brigade, and the Coal Brigade, I want to go there because I want to get in contact with that man, with that farmer.</span> <span id="s461">I took all of the ______.</span> <span id="s462">I looked like a ___________, I didn’t look like Jewish.</span> <span id="s463">And I was going there to the people, and the people they were nice and -- like I said, some people, they were good.</span> <span id="s464">And I come to that farmer.</span> <span id="s465">And when I come to that farmer, that’s the way I got in contact with my uncle, with my uncle the farmer (ph), because his farm was ransacked, and of course, was the other -- Julius was his name.</span> <span id="s466">I then got the -- how did he survive?</span> <span id="s467">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s468">I lost contact to him.</span> <span id="s469">Then they had the big selection.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: In October, I think the 20 or the 28th.</span> <span id="s472">It was bitter cold.</span> <span id="s473">And things got -- we survived, you know.</span> <span id="s474">But they took out close to 10,000 people, and the people got killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Can you describe -- did you witness this selection?</span> <span id="s476">Were you at this selection?</span> <span id="s477">Were you there when they --</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Can you describe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: The way it was?</span> <span id="s481">Well, you see -- my family was with us, together.</span> <span id="s482">And my husband , who spoke fluently German, and he talk to him.</span> <span id="s483">And when he talk to him and explained to him, what is his _______, what is his occupation, so he told him that he’s a mechanic -- he was a mechanic like I am right now a mechanic.</span> <span id="s484">So, you see, the working people, like tailor, shoemakers, all different kind of people, you know, but they have an occupation, you know?</span> <span id="s485">So, once they find out that you are a mechanic, you are on the top, they wouldn’t bother you, they know that you are good.</span> <span id="s486">So that’s what had happened that we were lucky, the way my husband explained to him.</span> <span id="s487">And we survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Can you describe for me something.</span> <span id="s489">When all of these people were taken away, when people were going to the left or the right, what were the people doing?</span> <span id="s490">Were they quiet, were they screaming?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: You know?</span> <span id="s492">What I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s493">It is hard to describe.</span> <span id="s494">He became like a stone.</span> <span id="s495">It’s nothing he can do.</span> <span id="s496">You have to go in that heap.</span> <span id="s497">It is fear.</span> <span id="s498">Fear and pain.</span> <span id="s499">Because you don’t know.</span> <span id="s500">________, or that is your list, that is the list _______.</span> <span id="s501">But fortunately, we were lucky.</span> <span id="s502">When my husband told them that he’s a mechanic, and he’s working, [Pause] -- When he told him that he’s a mechanic, he told him to go right, so my parents survived, and we survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Now, a question.</span> <span id="s504">When you went out on these work brigades -- when you went out to work on the work brigades, how did you get chosen to go on one team or another.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: That wasn’t so easy, hon. If you didn’t go to work, they had the Jewish police.</span> <span id="s506">The Jewish police, when there was missing people, they would go on a hunt and see where the people are.</span> <span id="s507">I was arrested.</span> <span id="s508">I didn’t go to work, I don’t know what had happened.</span> <span id="s509">Jay didn’t feel good or something, and my sister-in-law, her name was Goldie, she didn’t go to work either.</span> <span id="s510">So what they did, they took us -- they took us in jail.</span> <span id="s511">And we fight with them.</span> <span id="s512">And people whom the police ______ knew saw we fight with them, so we stopped fighting, so they took us to the police.</span> <span id="s513">When ______were released, my husband came from work and so he start telling the head man, he then took all over (ph), and then they released us.</span> <span id="s514">It’s so many things to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Let’s take a break right now, okay?</span> <span id="s516">We need to take a break.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">End of Tape 1.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: I wanted to know how you got chosen for a different work group.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Oh, that.</span> <span id="s521">We used to get up in the morning, 4:00 in the morning.</span> <span id="s522">Had a cup of coffee.</span> <span id="s523">Had to make coffee, you know I -- You didn’t have anything, no wood, no nothing, so you used to take a big nail, a heavy one, put it into the electricity, and have a little -- something, you know, like a jar -- and you put it in in the jar, and the water was boiling and you didn’t have coffee, but _______, we used to call it.</span> <span id="s524">It is just like something -- and we used to have in the morning, before we went, to have that, and a tiny little slice bread, and go to work.</span> <span id="s525">Sometimes we didn’t have the bread.</span> <span id="s526">So, at least to have warm inside.</span> <span id="s527">And I used to go out, I used to see the Bad (ph) Brigade, but you can’t get because there was a whole lot people, but I knew them.</span> <span id="s528">But fortunately, I used to be lucky.</span> <span id="s529">Fortunately, they used to pull me out from the Good brigade, and take me to the Bad brigade.</span> <span id="s530">What means a Good brigade?</span> <span id="s531">A Good brigade means you can work hard, it’s no different.</span> <span id="s532">What it is, you are young, you are healthy, and then you take something to run in, around the people there because ______ used to be, and sell them something -- like a sleep, a place (ph), a something, whatever you had.</span> <span id="s533">And for that, you used to get some food.</span> <span id="s534">So at least -- or used to have some bread.</span> <span id="s535">Butter?</span> <span id="s536">We didn’t know what it means, butter.</span> <span id="s537">No butter, no milk, no nothing.</span> <span id="s538">But at least, when you had the bread, you see, the coffee, like I explained to you, it’s okay, you can make it.</span> <span id="s539">Who knew what it means, meat?</span> <span id="s540">Nothing.</span> <span id="s541">You didn’t have nothing.</span> <span id="s542">But potatoes was very good, you know.</span> <span id="s543">A potato you can mix up with something else or you have to have.</span> <span id="s544">And you make something, add meal from that (ph).</span> <span id="s545">I remember one time, that they said you can bring in food.</span> <span id="s546">Well, the Good brigade -- when you used to have -- I used to take off my Star of David.</span> <span id="s547">I looked like a _______.</span> <span id="s548">And I was gone from one place, from one door to the other.</span> <span id="s549">Until, you know, they used to give us something.</span> <span id="s550">Some people said, “We don’t have any,” but they just _______ potato peels.</span> <span id="s551">I said, “It’s okay, too.”</span> <span id="s552">I used to take potato peels.</span> <span id="s553">Whatever we could get to bring home.</span> <span id="s554">Potato peels, they wouldn’t bother you so much -- unless (ph) they used to think that you have something else.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Now, what would happen if you got caught bringing this food back?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Terrible, terrible.</span> <span id="s557">They used to send you in jail.</span> <span id="s558">That -- you were lucky.</span> <span id="s559">If they send you to jail.</span> <span id="s560">But some was good for me, you know, who was the brigade commanders (ph), you know, with the German guards.</span> <span id="s561">There was already good ones who let you go to do -- some of them was murderers.</span> <span id="s562">They didn’t.</span> <span id="s563">If they had caught you -- it didn’t hurt me so much the way they beat me up for the bread -- I didn’t kill the pain, but I killed the pain for the hunger, to be hungry.</span> <span id="s564">For not having, but for taking away the bread from me.</span> <span id="s565">You see what I mean?</span> <span id="s566">You didn’t kill no pain.</span> <span id="s567">But pain was hunger, no food to eat.</span> <span id="s568">Starving.</span> <span id="s569">So when we used to go the brigade, we used to have a Good brigade, so at least you used to get some clothes to change for food.</span> <span id="s570">So, when I used to come to the Christians there that knew me already, so they used to give me something to eat, a slice bread, it was okay, with some water.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Now, did these Christians -- did they think you were just a poor farmer girl or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Hmm-mm.</span> <span id="s573">The Christians?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s575">When you went to get something from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: Well, I used to come back -- they didn’t give you for free.</span> <span id="s577">But we were lucky that they gave us, for the clothes, what they had, because they figured, they said, that the ghetto -- the models (ph) from the clothes.</span> <span id="s578">Because why?</span> <span id="s579">Clothes you could have.</span> <span id="s580">They didn’t take away.</span> <span id="s581">They took away from you the books, the paintings, the grand things.</span> <span id="s582">But clothes, as much as you could, you could take it in.</span> <span id="s583">The furniture, everything, you have to give.</span> <span id="s584">So you see?</span> <span id="s585">So when you used to have something to change, why not?</span> <span id="s586">They used to give you, you know?</span> <span id="s587">So they used to have a _________, you see.</span> <span id="s588">It means that you used to have a good day with the food, but what you got, you are happy.</span> <span id="s589">I was running, smiling, I have something.</span> <span id="s590">But the worst thing was if you came to the ghetto, to the brigade, you know.</span> <span id="s591">So, if you had a good brigade, then you go through.</span> <span id="s592">If you have Bad brigade, you’re in trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: And how did you know which one you were in?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Well, that’s what happened to me.</span> <span id="s595">I was looking for a good brigade.</span> <span id="s596">I knew where the good brigade was.</span> <span id="s597">And I was moving from one place to the other, and that’s what I got caught, and that’s what I got beat up.</span> <span id="s598">But it didn’t, like I said, it didn’t bother me, it didn’t hurt me, you know, the way I was beated up, but it hurt me why I lost the bread.</span> <span id="s599">It’s rich people, known people, in Lithuania, they didn’t have nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s600">My husband -- he’ll tell you tomorrow about it -- the way we used to help them -- from the same, what we had, you split in half -- half for us and half for them.</span> <span id="s601">And . . . I was young, I was strong, it was in the family.</span> <span id="s602">She lost a husband, she was with a _____, with her father and mother and I remember a young girl, a lady.</span> <span id="s603">She was married and her husband got killed.</span> <span id="s604">I think by the 550 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Oh, tell me about that, will you?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: You forgot to tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s609">The 550 people.</span> <span id="s610">It was across from our house.</span> <span id="s611">And my husband wasn’t there, and I was running to look for him that he shouldn’t come home.</span> <span id="s612">And all -- a whole lot friends, educated people -- they asked just for the educated people because they had to find out and _________ -- I don’t know how to say in English, but that’s okay, you can find out.</span> <span id="s613">So, everybody, just for two days’ walk, or three days’ walk, so they was exactly across from our house.</span> <span id="s614">And there was about 550 young people.</span> <span id="s615">And they took all the people and killed them.</span> <span id="s616">Believe it.</span> <span id="s617">Five hundred and fifty career ______.</span> <span id="s618">Friends of friends, lawyers, doctors . . . it was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s619">People couldn’t believe that that could happen.</span> <span id="s620">And in two days, it was finished.</span> <span id="s621">Where they took him to the Ninth Fort.</span> <span id="s622">The Ninth Fort, my husband, the ______ asked him about it, “Please do it.”</span> <span id="s623">He could tell you everything the way it happened.</span> <span id="s624">They had been killed -- I don’t know how many German people from Germany killed.</span> <span id="s625">So when you go, ask him.</span> <span id="s626">He could tell you more about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: When did this action take place?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: That it happened when we got in and the ghetto, was August, the 20, I think.</span> <span id="s629">And that had happened before -- in a week, or two weeks later, when we got in in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s630">Then they took all the educated people, and they said they had to send them to the city order and to straighten out all the paperwork.</span> <span id="s631">“Please, and we need some help.”</span> <span id="s632">And that’s the way they took her husband.</span> <span id="s633">And they took them, and two days later, it was finished.</span> <span id="s634">We knew, somebody told us.</span> <span id="s635">Well. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: Let me ask you a question.</span> <span id="s637">Back to the work.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: Again?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: When you went to work, who watched over your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: My little girl -- I lost her before I got in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s641">My mother, she used to take care of my little boy.</span> <span id="s642">See, that’s why I could go to work, because I know he’s in good hands.</span> <span id="s643">But still, the fear -- because we used say in the other little cities, you know?</span> <span id="s644">-- they used to kill the children and take them away from the parents, and so on.</span> <span id="s645">So as long as I had my mother, my father, I was strong.</span> <span id="s646">But the fear inside I had . . . if I had come home, I hope I could find my little boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: What happened to your daughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: To my little girl?</span> <span id="s649">She died.</span> <span id="s650">She died before I got in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: She was sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s653">She was only four months old.</span> <span id="s654">And the way we were running and coming back, the way I told you before?</span> <span id="s655">And it was no help from doctors and so on and so she passed away.</span> <span id="s656">During in the ghetto, a lifetime, I used to run -- I used to get orders from the farmers, from the Christian people, what they need.</span> <span id="s657">“Can you bring me so-and-so?</span> <span id="s658">I’ll have for you a nice package.”</span> <span id="s659">I used to run in the ghetto, look at somebody had something, what they ask.</span> <span id="s660">And I used to ask him, how much does he want?</span> <span id="s661">And he used to tell me the price, how much they want to have.</span> <span id="s662">I used to go there to the people, the Christian people, who order, and I used to get, you know, a package or money, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s663">But the main thing it is that they want to have, you know -- food.</span> <span id="s664">So, it wasn’t too hard to run and to go and to sell it to the people and bring for the people who needs the food.</span> <span id="s665">And now we had enough food for a couple days, probably, enough bread and so on.</span> <span id="s666">I stopped talking about the family, you know.</span> <span id="s667">But she had her parents, and she went herself.</span> <span id="s668">Her name was Bergma, Celia (ph).</span> <span id="s669">No food, no clothes, no -- even no water.</span> <span id="s670">So one day, they said that you can take in some wood, in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s671">You know what I did?</span> <span id="s672">I brought her -- you know, the wood -- and I gave to her and I told her (ph), go ahead, you go have hot water, you can have something to cook on.</span> <span id="s673">It was a risk to go out.</span> <span id="s674">It was really a risk.</span> <span id="s675">You think that the -- the Christian people, they used to say, “Please try to be careful.</span> <span id="s676">Try to be careful because you never know what can happen to you.”</span> <span id="s677">But when hunger -- when you’re hungry, you don’t have nothing to heed.</span> <span id="s678">Nothing can stop you.</span> <span id="s679">I didn’t care.</span> <span id="s680">Let them shoot me.</span> <span id="s681">Let them kill me.</span> <span id="s682">As long I am alive, I’ll try to have something, the main thing was, you see, my Jay.</span> <span id="s683">It wasn’t easy.</span> <span id="s684">But the hardest thing in the world was for me when I lost my people.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: How did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: Well, nothing hard when I had my people -- my parents, my brothers, my sister.</span> <span id="s687">And in ten minutes, I lost them, in ten minutes.</span> <span id="s688">They had to have some people for ______, for Estonia.</span> <span id="s689">I don’t know how many people -- 500 or 600 people.</span> <span id="s690">I find out later, instead, they should go and get one person, they said, the singles (ph).</span> <span id="s691">It would take them a whole lot to get the people, so they took bigger families.</span> <span id="s692">So, what they did, they took my family.</span> <span id="s693">Five people in ten minutes.</span> <span id="s694">Right before I tear them out of my arms, they was already gone.</span> <span id="s695">[Crying] I couldn’t do nothing.</span> <span id="s696">I couldn’t do not a thing because the police and the German guards, and I didn’t thought that that could happen to them.</span> <span id="s697">It was about ten or eleven o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s698">Since then, I didn’t see them anymore.</span> <span id="s699">My last -- please forgive me, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s700">But do you know what it means to lose your family in ten minutes?</span> <span id="s701">I never could forget.</span> <span id="s702">And I shall never forget.</span> <span id="s703">At night, you cannot sleep, you’ve got the dreams.</span> <span id="s704">It’s awful.</span> <span id="s705">It’s awful, it’s painful.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Do you remember when this happened?</span> <span id="s709">When did this happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: In October of 1943.</span> <span id="s711">Between that time, there was a city with the name Shabut (ph), and there was a number of Jewish people.</span> <span id="s712">And the people of Shabut (ph), that was, at that time, from October until December.</span> <span id="s713">They took the children from the parents out there.</span> <span id="s714">And somebody came to tell us that the children from Shabut (ph) had been taken away from the parents.</span> <span id="s715">Children, little ones, until up to 12 years.</span> <span id="s716">Twelve years, they can still go on at the work ______.</span> <span id="s717">So I said to my husband, what he should do, before I find out about the farmer, that my uncle is still alive.</span> <span id="s718">I got in contact with the farmer, Martinez (ph), that was his name.</span> <span id="s719">ANd, like I told you, my uncle used to help them a whole lot.</span> <span id="s720">So, they want to pay back to him, to help him.</span> <span id="s721">He was out in 82 places doing things.</span> <span id="s722">Eighty-two places.</span> <span id="s723">The only thing that it was to get in contact is somebody had to contact them that we should survive if it was with Jay, or maybe to send Jay alone.</span> <span id="s724">I finally got in contact with that Julius Schmitt (ph), with him that was his neighbor.</span> <span id="s725">And I used to send him some medicine, too.</span> <span id="s726">And then I used to send for him, for the farmer, he wants a suit I used to bring him, a suit.</span> <span id="s727">I used to run away, like I told you.</span> <span id="s728">I used to make my work, my work is finished, then I used to take off my Star of David, and used to run.</span> <span id="s729">I used to go.</span> <span id="s730">There was a coal brigade.</span> <span id="s731">There was, not too far from the coal brigade, a neighbor.</span> <span id="s732">And that man used to come to that neighbor.</span> <span id="s733">They knew each other.</span> <span id="s734">So when I got in over there, I used to find him.</span> <span id="s735">When I found him, first I have to finish my work.</span> <span id="s736">Four women has to finish to shovel the coal from the -- what you call it?</span> <span id="s737">-- train.</span> <span id="s738">So they used to have -- oy, like a choo choo train.</span> <span id="s739">So when I finish my work, and everything already finished, they didn’t bother you, as long you finished at the coal brigade (ph).</span> <span id="s740">Then I went with him and I got in contact with him.</span> <span id="s741">And I told him about the baby.</span> <span id="s742">And I said, “Please, immediately, try to get my uncle and tell him about the teddy (ph).</span> <span id="s743">And please, he should help us to get out from the ghetto.”</span> <span id="s744">That’s the way I got in contact with my uncle.</span> <span id="s745">And I was in the brigade.</span> <span id="s746">And then, I had a nice, good package.</span> <span id="s747">He brought me some -- like, eggs, and he got a few pieces of butter, and bread, and flour.</span> <span id="s748">And when I got that, it was already late.</span> <span id="s749">The coal brigade was already gone.</span> <span id="s750">And I was left over by myself.</span> <span id="s751">Now, what should I do?</span> <span id="s752">Where should I ____?</span> <span id="s753">It’s no place.</span> <span id="s754">No place where to go and what to do.</span> <span id="s755">I was fortunately lucky.</span> <span id="s756">It was there go slow (ph), you know -- what you call it?</span> <span id="s757">It was a brigade, but they used to make -- go slow, all the ______, and they used to take up from the garden.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Cabbage?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Right.</span> <span id="s760">So that brigade was the latest.</span> <span id="s761">And fortunately, I was lucky that somebody told me you got one more brigade coming.</span> <span id="s762">And that brigade, when I said, “See me,” they grabbed me right away and they brought me in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s763">And I came to safety.</span> <span id="s764">It happened there at the coal brigade, was easy to make a Pekel (ph), they way they said, you know, a package.</span> <span id="s765">So it was a good day.</span> <span id="s766">Everybody from the women that finished.</span> <span id="s767">And some people used to know already that some people got clothes or something, you know.</span> <span id="s768">They made some packages -- good for us (ph).</span> <span id="s769">And all of a sudden, the guard from Gestapo came in to see what’s going on by the coal brigade.</span> <span id="s770">Had seen their packages.</span> <span id="s771">And he asked, “Whose package is this one?”</span> <span id="s772">One girl got up and she said, “It’s mine.”</span> <span id="s773">She said, “Take the package.”</span> <span id="s774">______.</span> <span id="s775">Who she did, nobody knows.</span> <span id="s776">I had seen what had happened to her, so I already run away.</span> <span id="s777">I didn’t look to him.</span> <span id="s778">And that arrogant Gestapo, what happened to her.</span> <span id="s779">I just don’t know.</span> <span id="s780">Because why?</span> <span id="s781">She had a package.</span> <span id="s782">That was wrong.</span> <span id="s783">That was wrong.</span> <span id="s784">The life in ghetto is worse than a dog in the street.</span> <span id="s785">Four o’clock in the morning, they used _______.</span> <span id="s786">They used to call up to get dressed and get out and take them in a special place, special field.</span> <span id="s787">Cold, bitter cold, to test what the people gonna do.</span> <span id="s788">Having my little boy, before you dressed him -- here you couldn’t see here in the clothes.</span> <span id="s789">I used to put up everything in his little bed that he used to be -- put up everything that in the morning, if it should rain, I should have right away for him, to dress him, and to be outside.</span> <span id="s790">How many people have there been -- in there room?</span> <span id="s791">No, less than that -- eight -- I think about eighteen or nineteen, maybe more.</span> <span id="s792">People there were sleeping on the floors.</span> <span id="s793">There was no beds, no sofas.</span> <span id="s794">But at least we had a pillow.</span> <span id="s795">And we had, you know, a _______, whatever.</span> <span id="s796">It’s -- who can describe the horrible things in the ghettos.</span> <span id="s797">No ink can write, no writer can write up what we had to do during the three years.</span> <span id="s798">But one thing that it was to me, as I told you, that was my people there.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: Let me ask you two questions, okay?</span> <span id="s800">You okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: When you were living in the ghetto, did you still have Chabas (ph)?</span> <span id="s803">Did you still celebrate the holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: The holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s806">Could you practice your religion while you were in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Yeah, we used to have the holidays.</span> <span id="s808">But each holiday, when it used to come, the Gestapo gave you right away a holiday -- taking people, sending them to the Ninth Fort, to kill the people there, to take off their bodies from the . . . from the caves.</span> <span id="s809">We never had a holiday that we should enjoy.</span> <span id="s810">Because each holiday, when it used to come, always used to be bitter because they used -- they always gave you such a rough time.</span> <span id="s811">Used to take our peoples, they used to kill the people, they used to hang the people.</span> <span id="s812">Honey, I cannot tell you, just in the three hours, what they did.</span> <span id="s813">Before they went to the airport, they took 2,000 people -- and it was Rosh Hosanna -- and some people didn’t want to go because it was the holidays.</span> <span id="s814">And what do you think they did?</span> <span id="s815">They killed them.</span> <span id="s816">They killed them to show them that you must go to work, it’s no holidays.</span> <span id="s817">So you asked me about holidays -- each holiday, no matter what, when used to come, always was bitter, full with tears, full of fear, full of pain.</span> <span id="s818">You cannot describe, even in Yiddish, which I know so good, I wouldn’t be able to describe it.</span> <span id="s819">But I went through, and so many people went through.</span> <span id="s820">But, I was fortunately lucky.</span> <span id="s821">I am alive.</span> <span id="s822">There have been other people -- no more.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: Let me ask you a little more about the ghetto life.</span> <span id="s824">Were there -- other than your working, were there other activities going on in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s825">Were there -- was that -- how did the children go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: I think the children -- activities there was, but for the children, they used to have school.</span> <span id="s827">That’s what they had, but they didn’t know.</span> <span id="s828">It was all secretly, you see?</span> <span id="s829">But they used to have for the children a school.</span> <span id="s830">And it was teachers, and that was, but they didn’t know.</span> <span id="s831">The Gestapo didn’t know.</span> <span id="s832">But we had activities -- I don’t remember, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s833">Because you see, I was a slave.</span> <span id="s834">I was a slave.</span> <span id="s835">I used to go out in the morning, come back, see everybody’s okay.</span> <span id="s836">Tired.</span> <span id="s837">Thinking what tomorrow will be.</span> <span id="s838">Will you have to get up early in the morning -- 4:00.</span> <span id="s839">So, I don’t know too much about the activities, I’m honest with you.</span> <span id="s840">But I know that they have a school for the children.</span> <span id="s841">And then, it wasn’t too many.</span> <span id="s842">It was already each time, each quarter of the year, like three months, six months.</span> <span id="s843">Each time something had happened and they had an excuse.</span> <span id="s844">Something had happened and they used to take out.</span> <span id="s845">That happened, that sort of thing happened.</span> <span id="s846">(ph)</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Were there workshops inside the ghetto where people were --</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: Yeah, inside the ghetto was the workshop, too.</span> <span id="s849">And some of them were going outside, and the -- but not everybody was lucky to get in there, you know?</span> <span id="s850">It wasn’t a whole lot people.</span> <span id="s851">I don’t know, I’ve never been there.</span> <span id="s852">Because like I said, I was beating with myself, running here and there.</span> <span id="s853">But it was -- they used to make for the shoulders, you know, like gloves and socks and all different things, you know, there.</span> <span id="s854">In Europe, used to be very cold.</span> <span id="s855">And more things, you know, for the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s856">They used to come and want this suit, or a uniform to make and so on.</span> <span id="s857">THey used to tell them to make it.</span> <span id="s858">And that way we survived, because the workmanship, the working people.</span> <span id="s859">And that the way I survived because I told them that I am not a saleslady, not that, but I am a dressmaker.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: Who was in charge of all of the workers?</span> <span id="s861">Was it the Gestapo?</span> <span id="s862">Was it the --</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: No, the Jewish people inside.</span> <span id="s864">The Gestapo was outside.</span> <span id="s865">The Gestapo had _____, like -- how do you say it -- the Gestapo didn’t come near to the ghetto, but they had their own building.</span> <span id="s866">And when it used to come to selection, the first thing was the Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: The Gestapo ran the selection.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: The Gestapo used to come in the ghetto, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s869">They used to come into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s870">I remember one thing that had happened with a man.</span> <span id="s871">I couldn’t remember too close, but my Jay will remember -- the way they hang some two people or more.</span> <span id="s872">And they took out all the people who was inside, that they should come and see the way it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: Now, tell me a little bit about the administration in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s874">There was a unirat (ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: The unirat (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s877">How was that chosen?</span> <span id="s878">Did you know them?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s880">I know.</span> <span id="s881">I know that _______.</span> <span id="s882">We all participated (ph).</span> <span id="s883">Tova [ph}?</span> <span id="s884">He studied with my husband, together.</span> <span id="s885">He was in the unirat (ph).</span> <span id="s886">And then was _______, Dr. Gerschon (ph).</span> <span id="s887">He was from Shabut (ph) and he came here because he got married, for a girl, you know, who’s from Kovno.</span> <span id="s888">And then more people -- they was very active.</span> <span id="s889">And they came in, you know, when it was the big selection, the 10,000 people, like I told you.</span> <span id="s890">They asked, Gestapo asked -- Dr. Elkis (ph) was a famous doctor in ____.</span> <span id="s891">They want to have so many, so many people.</span> <span id="s892">And Dr. Elkis (ph) said, “I will not give you, I will not select people.</span> <span id="s893">Go ahead and do by yourself.</span> <span id="s894">So when we got out, it was in October 28th, I think, in the big field.</span> <span id="s895">And then you have to have luck -- who’s alive and who’s dead.</span> <span id="s896">And then they took out close to 10,000 people and they killed them, all of them.</span> <span id="s897">I think -- I don’t know -- one survived, but I know that all of them got killed because they didn’t let nobody stay at home, and everybody has to go out.</span> <span id="s898">And Dr. Elkis (ph) didn’t want to have on his conscience that here, that is your life, and that is your dead.</span> <span id="s899">And then the unirat, you know, they used to have some trouble there.</span> <span id="s900">But they used to do something for them -- they gave them a year (ph), a present, or something, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s901">The people trouble as they was in Gestapo, you know, but you go into the Gestapo, it is good-bye.</span> <span id="s902">You are not coming back to the ghetto, you are not coming back alive.</span> <span id="s903">So we used to help them.</span> <span id="s904">There was ________ -- I forgot, I tell you.</span> <span id="s905">It’s already 50 years away.</span> <span id="s906">And you cannot remember.</span> <span id="s907">And my memory is not anymore what it used to be before.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: Were the people on the unirat (ph), were they good people?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: The members of the unirat, were they good people?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: They were Lithuanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: The people who served on the unirat (ph), the members of the unirat(ph) . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: In the unirat (ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s915">Were they good people?</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: Oh, well, you know.</span> <span id="s917">It was a hard job, but it -- I don’t want to say anything else.</span> <span id="s918">They were rough.</span> <span id="s919">The police was rough.</span> <span id="s920">The Jewish police was very rough.</span> <span id="s921">It was hard.</span> <span id="s922">I want to tell you one more thing -- the way I got with my uncle.</span> <span id="s923">The day we run away from the ghetto --</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: Okay, but let me just -- I want you to tell me about that, but I just want to sort of finish the ghetto part of my questions.</span> <span id="s925">There’s some things I’m really curious about.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: Well, listen, for somebody, they were good.</span> <span id="s927">For somebody they were bad.</span> <span id="s928">You have to have vitamin tea, you know what it means?</span> <span id="s929">For _______.</span> <span id="s930">If you didn’t have yellows, if you had yellow tea -- say, you have bad people and they are rough to . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: When you went to jail, was that the Jewish jail?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: When you said you had to go to the jail that time -- you were sent to the jail, remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q:Was that a Jewish police in the jail?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: I don’t follow.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: Okay, remember you told me that one time you were sent to the jail, to the prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: Oh, in prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Was that a Jewish police?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Ohh.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: Jewish police.</span> <span id="s943">I beat him up, too.</span> <span id="s944">And they took me in jail, my sister-in-law and myself.</span> <span id="s945">And I was working every single day.</span> <span id="s946">Every single day I was working.</span> <span id="s947">Get up early in the morning -- rain, cold, snow.</span> <span id="s948">No matter what it is, you have to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: Now, this unirat (ph) -- were they in charge of the working . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: The unirat was in charge for the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s951">You see, the unirat, they used to lead, like a government.</span> <span id="s952">And they used to get orders.</span> <span id="s953">They used to know when there came up a selection.</span> <span id="s954">They used to be the first ones to find out.</span> <span id="s955">And that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s956">And if something was wrong, they used to call the police.</span> <span id="s957">The police was rough, tough.</span> <span id="s958">Very rough.</span> <span id="s959">Some of them were . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Do you think that sometimes they helped the people?</span> <span id="s961">Did they warn you about the actions?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: No.</span> <span id="s963">They never did.</span> <span id="s964">But I know -- well, the last action, what it was, a selection, the last one.</span> <span id="s965">Nobody knew.</span> <span id="s966">Because they were so good that they said, “You can take in food, as much as you can.”</span> <span id="s967">They allowed you to bring in food.</span> <span id="s968">And by getting the food, I had a funny feeling, because each time, when they used to say, “You can bring food in the ghetto,” Not to be afraid, you know, but they come to help (ph).</span> <span id="s969">In the next two days or three days, a selection.</span> <span id="s970">And that’s what I remember -- that when I had food brought, heavier than I was -- a pekel (ph), the way we used to say it -- and I said to myself, I hope everything will be okay.</span> <span id="s971">And in the next two days, it was selection.</span> <span id="s972">So there was, you know, like a government in ghetto.</span> <span id="s973">ANd in charge was Dr. Elkis (ph), a ________.</span> <span id="s974">Like I told you, and the few of them, what I know.</span> <span id="s975">But nothing could help you.</span> <span id="s976">Just you have to find out for yourself what you can do.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: Do you think that the life was different for a woman in the ghetto than it was for a man?</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: I think it was mostly the same thing.</span> <span id="s979">The women _________.</span> <span id="s980">And for the men, they used to take him, you know, to hard labor, different things to do.</span> <span id="s981">But for the women, the same thing, no different.</span> <span id="s982">No difference.</span> <span id="s983">I used to do all the hard work, all the hard work.</span> <span id="s984">That was my --like I said -- my luck.</span> <span id="s985">When I used to have a good brigade, they used to push me out.</span> <span id="s986">You don’t know what it used to be in the morning, on a big field, and to have the brigades, one goes to here, and one goes there.</span> <span id="s987">And all of a sudden, you got in in the good brigade, they pulled you out.</span> <span id="s988">And how many times I was beated up from the police.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: The Jewish police.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: Was there -- for a woman, was it different because maybe in addition to doing the hard work, you also were more responsible for the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: They didn’t care for the children.</span> <span id="s993">You see, if they lost their husband, and she was by herself with a child, they didn’t bother her.</span> <span id="s994">But who’s with a family, you have to go to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: Were any women in the ghetto pregnant?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: Oh, yes, indeed.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: And they were allowed to have their children?</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: Many people got pregnant and they had to make abortion.</span> <span id="s999">And it had to be quiet.</span> <span id="s1000">Nobody should know.</span> <span id="s1001">Because if they go find something, you get killed.</span> <span id="s1002">Like, they took away in 19-- when they got into the ghetto, that was I think in September.</span> <span id="s1003">And all the frills, what you had -- all the gold and silver and diamonds -- should be turned in to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1004">If one -- if they go find out that one didn’t turn in, ten families from the family where you are will be killed.</span> <span id="s1005">And you know what my father did?</span> <span id="s1006">My mother, as they got, you know, some fears (ph), he took apart and he wound it up -- and they didn’t kill them.</span> <span id="s1007">I had my purse I gave away, too, to that to the -- like I told you, to good Christians.</span> <span id="s1008">But then they changed.</span> <span id="s1009">They changed.</span> <span id="s1010">They wasn’t the same anymore.</span> <span id="s1011">If you went there to get the clothes, you know what they did?</span> <span id="s1012">They killed you.</span> <span id="s1013">They killed you after the Liberation.</span> <span id="s1014">And they told me I shouldn’t go and ask for the clothes because you’ll get killed.</span> <span id="s1015">I said, “Well, Hitler didn’t kill me, to heck with them.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: Were you aware, in the ghetto, of any people who were sort of in an underground group of resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: Oh, there was underground people, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: Did you know them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: Some of them I already did, you know, like the partisan (ph).</span> <span id="s1020">And the last one, whom I knew, he’s already dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: But at the time, did you know about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: At the time, I tell you, I knew that they exist -- a partisan group.</span> <span id="s1023">But I wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s1024">I wasn’t involved.</span> <span id="s1025">My husband wasn’t involved.</span> <span id="s1026">Because at that time, I had my people, and I had my family.</span> <span id="s1027">You see, Jay, myself, and . . . but after Liberation, then was time to talk.</span> <span id="s1028">YOu could talk.</span> <span id="s1029">Because you were afraid of your own shadow, that somebody should know or not.</span> <span id="s1030">Darling, I tell you something.</span> <span id="s1031">It is so much, so much.</span> <span id="s1032">I didn’t finish.</span> <span id="s1033">I want to tell you another thing.</span> <span id="s1034">You finished with the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: I’ll go to my uncle.</span> <span id="s1037">We got Jay, my husband and myself.</span> <span id="s1038">We got already that man who came to pick us up and to take us in ________ -- it was about 60 or 70 kilometers -- 100 kilometers from that place where my uncle was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: How did you get out of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: That’s what I want to tell you.</span> <span id="s1041">So, and a month later, when I lost my people, they told us that they _______.</span> <span id="s1042">They took the children away from the mothers.</span> <span id="s1043">And we didn’t know when to save Jay’s life.</span> <span id="s1044">I didn’t care for myself.</span> <span id="s1045">And ______, he said, “Edna, what happen to Jay will happen to us.</span> <span id="s1046">If Jay’s gone, all of us will go.</span> <span id="s1047">Don’t look for some other places where to leave him.”</span> <span id="s1048">So then he give me a push to go see my uncle again.</span> <span id="s1049">And when they came already to that point, the way they were talking and everything was set up, we cut the wires -- ________ -- and Jay walked out first.</span> <span id="s1050">And he went across the street there, and we told Jay, “Here and here,” and it was gone.</span> <span id="s1051">Here and here in that place.</span> <span id="s1052">We’ll be there in another half hour, maybe.</span> <span id="s1053">Please don’t call, don’t scream, don’t say anything.</span> <span id="s1054">Jay was waiting there for us -- there was another man who will pick us up.</span> <span id="s1055">It took us about a half hour to go out on the wires.</span> <span id="s1056">And you have to watch the guard.</span> <span id="s1057">When the guard was away, and everything was quiet, we got through the wires, and we came to where Jay was.</span> <span id="s1058">And that man,his name was Martinez (ph).</span> <span id="s1059">And he took us there where my uncle was.</span> <span id="s1060">What I did, I took Martinez (ph) a jacket.</span> <span id="s1061">You know, he scout (ph).</span> <span id="s1062">I gave it to ______, to my husband, and his I gave to Martinez (ph) because he is a Prussian (ph).</span> <span id="s1063">And if he didn’t look like a Jewish person, and when we were driving, we took Jay in that wagon.</span> <span id="s1064">On top of that, we put up straw that you shouldn’t see that the child is there.</span> <span id="s1065">And I had -- from a Christian, I had somebody years ago, a little jacket, you know, a little coat, and put on a scarf, and both of us looked like Prussian (ph) people, like farmers.</span> <span id="s1066">And sure enough, we drove up.</span> <span id="s1067">It was about 30 miles from Kovno.</span> <span id="s1068">And they stopped us.</span> <span id="s1069">My heart was beating.</span> <span id="s1070">And I said, that is the end.</span> <span id="s1071">And what had happened, he said, “Have you got eggs for sale?</span> <span id="s1072">Have you got something else for sale?”</span> <span id="s1073">I said, “No.”</span> <span id="s1074">That man, Martinez (ph), himself, he said, “No, we don’t have anything for sale.”</span> <span id="s1075">“Oh, well, good-bye.”</span> <span id="s1076">But that was a lucky moment.</span> <span id="s1077">Finally, where should we go?</span> <span id="s1078">So that farmer was very nice and he took us in to his house -- raining, cold, you know.</span> <span id="s1079">We came in.</span> <span id="s1080">He didn’t took us right away to his house, but he took us to his brother-in-law’s house.</span> <span id="s1081">And Jay was there under the straw, and all of a sudden, he starts saying, “Mama, Daddy -- Mama, Daddy.”</span> <span id="s1082">And the farmer, his brother-in-law said, “What do I hear?</span> <span id="s1083">I hear a voice.”</span> <span id="s1084">“Oh,” he said, “Go away.</span> <span id="s1085">You don’t know what you’re talking about.”</span> <span id="s1086">Lucky number again.</span> <span id="s1087">And we brought there, then we came to his house.</span> <span id="s1088">We came to his house and was there for 39 days.</span> <span id="s1089">The time was up.</span> <span id="s1090">We find out that some people -- a lawyer from a ghetto -- it means my uncle’s nephew is here hiding.</span> <span id="s1091">He told us we have to go and not delay because we are in trouble.</span> <span id="s1092">Gestapo, you know, the police, you know from over there -- the German police -- they was looking for the people.</span> <span id="s1093">And there was, across from them, somebody left a little boy or a girl, to hide them.</span> <span id="s1094">They killed him.</span> <span id="s1095">It’s so many things, I tell you.</span> <span id="s1096">It happened so fast, where to start.</span> <span id="s1097">And then, we came to his house.</span> <span id="s1098">And by going back, to another farmer, he said, “Please, get in, all of us, in one place.”</span> <span id="s1099">Like this.</span> <span id="s1100">ANd we looked, a big storm.</span> <span id="s1101">And we heard not a fire from that place.</span> <span id="s1102">The Germans was running to look around.</span> <span id="s1103">And we were sitting there for an hour.</span> <span id="s1104">Cold, bitter cold, just like that.</span> <span id="s1105">That it shouldn’t look like we are Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1106">That, see, that we are hiding.</span> <span id="s1107">And they didn’t find us.</span> <span id="s1108">That was another lucky number.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: Let me stop here for a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: It’s finished.</span> <span id="s1111">It’s 4:00.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">End of Tape 2.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: So you were in hiding for a long time, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: For nine months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: Did you move around a lot or did you stay in one place the whole time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s1119">You have to move.</span> <span id="s1120">Right now, I’m coming -- can I say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: Please.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: So then, he told us, he said, “Get all together in one place, that it should look like a big rock.”</span> <span id="s1123">He himself, I shall never forget, got down on the ground, and lay down and he said, “They are coming.”</span> <span id="s1124">It means the German police -- I don’t know who it was.</span> <span id="s1125">After everything was over, he said to me, “You know, where should I take you?”</span> <span id="s1126">I told him, “You know?</span> <span id="s1127">Take me to Pashkovski (ph).”</span> <span id="s1128">He said, “Okay.</span> <span id="s1129">I’ll take you there.</span> <span id="s1130">But say anything to them that I brought you.”</span> <span id="s1131">I said, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s1132">He brought us there and he was waiting until we go inside.</span> <span id="s1133">We got in there and knocked on the door.</span> <span id="s1134">The dogs was barking and barking and barking and barking and I didn’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s1135">And I knocked on the door.</span> <span id="s1136">He got back.</span> <span id="s1137">He got scared when he’s up seeing me (ph).</span> <span id="s1138">I said, “Don’t get scared.</span> <span id="s1139">Do you know Heika (ph)?”</span> <span id="s1140">That’s the way they used to call her.</span> <span id="s1141">“Yes.”</span> <span id="s1142">I said, “I’m Heika’s (ph) daughter.”</span> <span id="s1143">“How did you come here?”</span> <span id="s1144">I said, “Don’t you know when I used to be a little girl, I used to come here and we got, you know, some fish, and we go fishing and so on?”</span> <span id="s1145">“Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s1146">So what you hear?</span> <span id="s1147">How did you come?</span> <span id="s1148">How did you know?”</span> <span id="s1149">I said, “I know the place very good.</span> <span id="s1150">I could come and I could go.”</span> <span id="s1151">“Who brought you here?</span> <span id="s1152">What you got here?”</span> <span id="s1153">I said, “Well, I have a person who took me here, not to your place.</span> <span id="s1154">But I knew exactly which way to go -- to the right, or to the left, or so on.”</span> <span id="s1155">And I said, “Please let me in.”</span> <span id="s1156">He looked at me and he said, “Okay, go in.</span> <span id="s1157">You are sure nobody brought you here?”</span> <span id="s1158">I said, “If somebody would’ve brought me here, I would have told you.”</span> <span id="s1159">BUt I told him to remind him, “You don’t remember me, but you remember my mother.</span> <span id="s1160">Do you remember when -- Mrs. Preskovski (ph) -- when she worked there, in hospital, you know, my mother, the way I told you, my mother used to cook and come to be with them and give them some food and so on.”</span> <span id="s1161">He said, “Yes, it’s true.”</span> <span id="s1162">And I said, “You used to come to our house with the horses and buggy.”</span> <span id="s1163">He said, “Yes.</span> <span id="s1164">Ah-ha.</span> <span id="s1165">So you are Heika’s (ph) daughter.”</span> <span id="s1166">I said, “Yes.</span> <span id="s1167">And that is my husband.</span> <span id="s1168">And that is my son.”</span> <span id="s1169">I said, “Please let me in for a couple days until I get in contact with my uncle.”</span> <span id="s1170">And my uncle told all the farmers where he is and where he is located -- not all of them, but a few of them., like that Martinez (ph).</span> <span id="s1171">He knew everything.</span> <span id="s1172">And he said, “Let me tell you something” -- All to the farmers . . . “If you want to get me out,” he said, “let me tell you one thing.</span> <span id="s1173">Not one of you will be left alive.”</span> <span id="s1174">Because it was not allowed to keep Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1175">So he was in 82 places.</span> <span id="s1176">Each time in another place, each time.</span> <span id="s1177">The way people running from one place to the other.</span> <span id="s1178">So, when it happened, that case.</span> <span id="s1179">And he let us stay until -- I think six days or seven.</span> <span id="s1180">And he starts looking around, why the dogs was barking.</span> <span id="s1181">Why the dogs was barking.</span> <span id="s1182">Something was wrong in their house.</span> <span id="s1183">He said, “I cannot keep you anymore.”</span> <span id="s1184">I said, “Put us in the potatoes bin,” you know, where the yeast is.</span> <span id="s1185">Nothing doing.</span> <span id="s1186">He got in contact with my uncle.</span> <span id="s1187">And my uncle took us to another place.</span> <span id="s1188">To _______.</span> <span id="s1189">And by working over there, we were working -- I don’t know, a good while -- until we came to that farm.</span> <span id="s1190">And poor farmer, very poor farmer, but very good people.</span> <span id="s1191">Very good people.</span> <span id="s1192">They share with us whatever they had.</span> <span id="s1193">And my uncle used to come every week and to bring us some bread, milk for my -- for Jay.</span> <span id="s1194">And so on, because they didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s1195">They didn’t have a cow.</span> <span id="s1196">They got only one pig, or two, and two sheeps.</span> <span id="s1197">When we came there, my uncle came.</span> <span id="s1198">And he said, “Here is that place.</span> <span id="s1199">Try to be as long as you can.”</span> <span id="s1200">And the farmers, already, was afraid, that in case somebody will give him out.</span> <span id="s1201">So all the farmers will get killed.</span> <span id="s1202">So they were watching already.</span> <span id="s1203">You see, they was watching -- they was watching him that nobody should give him out, in case or now they’re all in trouble.</span> <span id="s1204">He came over there.</span> <span id="s1205">And my uncle used to come there.</span> <span id="s1206">But we have to have a hiding place.</span> <span id="s1207">Because we heard that, you see, the

for me.</span> <span id="s1697">You see my coat?</span> <span id="s1698">What I was wearing is here with holes in my elbows.”</span> <span id="s1699">I said, “I have to do something.</span> <span id="s1700">This is not making anything.</span> <span id="s1701">I even don’t have any coal to heat up the apartment.”</span> <span id="s1702">I said, “Please understand.</span> <span id="s1703">Right now, I see the regulations, “ I said, “from the Russian government.</span> <span id="s1704">If you could teach me more, a little about that life, I promise you, I go follow exactly what you go say.”</span> <span id="s1705">And I was crying.</span> <span id="s1706">I was strong, but I start crying because I was afraid for Jay.</span> <span id="s1707">And now it’s easy to have respect, you know.</span> <span id="s1708">But that particular _____ Siberian (ph) -- where would be my little Jay?</span> <span id="s1709">And then I have more children who had lost their mothers.</span> <span

it.”</span> <span id="s1717">We made a little kitchen -- a stove, a little stove.</span> <span id="s1718">And the wood was so big, like that.</span> <span id="s1719">And in that little stove, I used to bake and make cookies.</span> <span id="s1720">Different things.</span> <span id="s1721">And then I used to take that to the lady that runs the restaurant.</span> <span id="s1722">And she used to

<span id="s1725">And I told him, I said, “I go follow all the instructions.</span> <span id="s1726">But you will tell (ph).”</span> <span id="s1727">And that is no monkey business with them.</span> <span id="s1728">They can send you away that you don’t know where you are.</span> <span id="s1729">And they can -- you don’t know what you are anymore.</span> <span id="s1730">And that was the life of them.</span> <span id="s1731">Siberia.</span> <span id="s1732">It came to a moment, that was enough.</span> <span id="s1733">It was no life.</span> <span id="s1734">It was -- no life.</span> <span id="s1735">I don’t know, it’s come back, maybe about 100 people, or 200 people.</span> <span id="s1736">Jay was -- at that time, he was going to school.</span> <span id="s1737">They had the school for

was already bitter.</span> <span id="s1749">That was already bad.</span> <span id="s1750">That was before, but I want to say something else.</span> <span id="s1751">I couldn’t handle any more.</span> <span id="s1752">I couldn’t produce any more.</span> <span id="s1753">The cookies was no life -- to stay and to cook all day, and then to sell it to make nothing.</span> <span id="s1754">Finally, I sold the house that we had.</span> <span id="s1755">And I ran back to the George (ph).</span> <span id="s1756">And I had the -- I knew some people who want to sell the house, and they need some money to go in a __________.</span> <span id="s1757">It’s a pity-case or something, you know.</span> <span id="s1758">And I help them.</span> <span id="s1759">But with the help, I shouldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1760">Because if they would caught me, they would send me to Siberia anyhow.</span> <span id="s1761">My husband knew that the George (ph).</span> <span id="s1762">And he introduced me to him.</span> <span id="s1763">When he introduced me to him, I became a lawyer.</span> <span id="s1764">I start doing the papers, you know, to sell the papers.</span> <span id="s1765">A thousand in one night.</span> <span id="s1766">That’s the way I want to tell you.</span> <span id="s1767">And I became -- I used to sell the house.</span> <span id="s1768">I didn’t have no trouble.</span> <span id="s1769">I had the secretary.</span> <span id="s1770">She knew me already.</span> <span id="s1771">I had the people who want to buy.</span> <span id="s1772">And a happy people who wants the money to get out from Kovno to go into free world.</span> <span id="s1773">So i made money.</span> <span id="s1774">The truth.</span> <span id="s1775">I made money, I didn’t have to work hard.</span> <span id="s1776">But, each time I used to have something else to wear.</span> <span id="s1777">I didn’t wear the same clothes.</span> <span id="s1778">[Crying] Everything that I was doing was fear.</span> <span id="s1779">Fear and painful.</span> <span id="s1780">We made some money.</span> <span id="s1781">I made it.</span> <span id="s1782">And it came the moment where we have to leave everything that again I had.</span> <span id="s1783">And on our way, 12:00 at night.</span> <span id="s1784">To make a long story short, I ran, not to the door, but I open up a window and jumped out of the window -- jumped out with Jay through the window.</span> <span id="s1785">In the back yard, was there a ________ truck, you know?</span> <span id="s1786">And he took us to vendors (ph).</span> <span id="s1787">Between three and four months, it took us to get in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1788">And from Berlin, we got in in the American zone (ph).</span> <span id="s1789">Four months, I forgot my name.</span> <span id="s1790">Jay said, “I don’t know what’s my name.”</span> <span id="s1791">That’s another thing -- cannot go on the same name each time.</span> <span id="s1792">Each time, wherever we went, it was no flowers.</span> <span id="s1793">They took out my husband from the train.</span> <span id="s1794">We didn’t _______ know about it.</span> <span id="s1795">But they took my husband because he was wearing boots.</span> <span id="s1796">And all of a sudden, they have seen that he got a watch.</span> <span id="s1797">I thought it’s the end.</span> <span id="s1798">But he said, “Let me go.</span> <span id="s1799">You want my boots?</span> <span id="s1800">Here are the boots.</span> <span id="s1801">In another place, you’ve got your watch.</span> <span id="s1802">Let us go out.”</span> <span id="s1803">We had been in Nobody’s Land for four or five days.</span> <span id="s1804">Snow, bitter cold.</span> <span id="s1805">Jay got sick.</span> <span id="s1806">It is just unbelievable, unbelievable what people can go through -- maybe because I was younger.</span> <span id="s1807">Well, to make a long story short, it was in Munich, and they had there, my husband had a job.</span> <span id="s1808">Then I want to come to America to see my sister and my aunt that was my mother’s sister.</span> <span id="s1809">I wrote them a letter that I want to come to America and I need your help.</span> <span id="s1810">Didn’t took no time.</span> <span id="s1811">And I told them I don’t want to be any more on the bloody earth.</span> <span id="s1812">And we got the papers.</span> <span id="s1813">I didn’t know what to do, which way to turn and which way to go.</span> <span id="s1814">In Israel, you couldn’t go because it’s no place with no certificate.</span> <span id="s1815">So, finally, when we came here, people were warm, people were nice.</span> <span id="s1816">But I didn’t have the language.</span> <span id="s1817">I didn’t know nothing.</span> <span id="s1818">And my husband has to start out life from the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">Q: I’m gonna stop the tape here because we have to put in another tape.</span></p> <p><span

had seen the people, what you thought they already did.</span> <span id="s1824">And all of us hadn’t yet seen them.</span> <span id="s1825">Survivors.</span> <span id="s1826">It’s moment that I think, there I am.</span> <span id="s1827">In seventh heaven?</span> <span id="s1828">Or in another world?</span> <span id="s1829">Or I’m dreaming.</span> <span id="s1830">You can’t tell reality.</span> <span id="s1831">It is to describe you moments like that -- the other people thought the same way.</span> <span id="s1832">Oy, you thought that you are dead.</span> <span id="s1833">You are alive.</span> <span id="s1834">I said, Yes, I am here.</span> <span id="s1835">It is things that you couldn’t believe.</span> <span id="s1836">You couldn’t believe and you see some friends -- _________, that they are still come out from the ghettos, from the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1837">You feel like one family.</span> <span id="s1838">That’s the way you felt when you have met the people from the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1839">We were looking at each other and saying, “Is that the truth?”</span> <span id="s1840">We are still alive.</span> <span id="s1841">We couldn’t believe our own self anymore.</span> <span id="s1842">And then we used to get together once in a while with some people, you know, whom we knew.</span> <span id="s1843">They

id="s2000">Well, I told my husband, I said, “I’m not a service operator.</span> <span id="s2001">I’m sorry.”</span> <span id="s2002">Oh, he said, “Don’t worry.”</span> <span id="s2003">I lost a customer.</span> <span id="s2004">I asked him, you know, with my language at that time, I didn’t know even how to say even “thank you.”</span> <span id="s2005">Used to say, “Sank ye, sank

alright.</span> <span id="s2022">Another episode I want to tell you.</span> <span id="s2023">A yellow cab was not too far from our station.</span> <span id="s2024">And two insurance people met each other and they observed me, the way I was working.</span> <span id="s2025">And one said to the other, “That woman doesn’t have no problems whatsoever.”</span> <span id="s2026">He said, “Why?</span> <span id="s2027">Take a look at her, always with a smile, smiles, smiles.</span> <span id="s2028">If she would have problems, she wouldn’t smile.”</span> <span id="s2029">The other insurance man said,

doesn’t have.”</span> <span id="s2031">So they came in and they asked me, “Listen, my dear lady.”</span> <span id="s2032">[He] said, “We’d like to ask you a question.”</span> <span id="s2033">I said, “If I be able to answer in English, I’ll be glad to answer.”</span> <span id="s2034">He said, “It’s not hard.”</span> <span id="s2035">I said, “What is it?”</span> <span id="s2036">“Do you have problems?”</span> <span id="s2037">[He] said, “I have talked to my friend and I told him that you don’t have no problems whatsoever because all day long, when I see you with the people just

id="s2039">The other man said, “Ten dollars.”</span> <span id="s2040">And that’s what I know that they got in.</span> <span id="s2041">It’s a wonderful country.</span> <span id="s2042">It’s beautiful.</span> <span id="s2043">People used to ask me, “How can you say that you are happy?”</span> <span id="s2044">I said, “I am happy.</span> <span id="s2045">Do you know what freedom means?”</span> <span id="s2046">I said, “You can do everything that it please you.</span> <span id="s2047">It’s a democracy country.</span> <span id="s2048">You can work, just work.</span> <span
