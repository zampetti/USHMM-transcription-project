…how many children do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">RB: Two…my daughter is a chiropractor (age 31) in San Francisco…my son (32) …lives in Florida…he works in physical education… WH Tell me about this Conference…</span></p> <p><span id="s14">RB: …In California there seemed to have a Holocaust need to get together.</span> <span id="s15">The people that went through a lot, they wanted to get together, and it started on a small scale in another country, in Canada…somehow there was a need to get together on a national level…so we got together in Lancaster, Pa…Judith Kestenbaum, she is the one who started it…and I was a child when it started…I was born in 1928.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">WH: Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">RB: In Poland, (inaudible city)…</span></p> <p><span id="s18">WH: After the war you went where?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">RB: To Italy…and when I was 16 I was with a stage group and we performed all over Italy and I was one of them…this group was eager to get together…because it seems there is a need, a national need, to get together…and everybody was so eager to come out and speak what happened to them and for some reason they put it on the side, on the background right after the war, and they-did anything they could, and forgot about this-somehow there is this ability in humans to forget anything that was bad, and move on.</span> <span id="s20">I know myself, I closed the door to the past, I closed it in such a way that I could never speak to my children about my experiences.</span> <span id="s21">And even my daughter at 15, came to me, she was going to a Jewish school at that time…and she comes to me, ‘Mommy, can’t you tell me anything about your mommy and daddy?’</span> <span id="s22">And I got so upset!</span> <span id="s23">I couldn’t get together-and I started to tell her, and all of a sudden, I started to tear, I was pregnant, I just couldn’t handle it, and I fought not to show my tears, even.</span> <span id="s24">And I don’t know why I didn’t, but I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s25">She was so sorry for me, my daughter…and I just choked, and I don’t know-and she got scared.</span> <span id="s26">And that finished with her.</span> <span id="s27">She is now 31, and she’s going for therapy.</span> <span id="s28">And she tells me now, that is how she has anxiety.</span> <span id="s29">She has dreams, Holocaust, all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s30">But it’s an anxiety that she has, she thinks of the Holocaust now.</span> <span id="s31">Probably she heard it from what is going on in television.</span> <span id="s32">But from me.</span> <span id="s33">She never heard, because I just couldn’t talk.</span> <span id="s34">And now when I want to talk, I can’t because she’s far away, and we express that.</span> <span id="s35">I’m so glad that she’s going for therapy because she can come out with all her (inaudible) and sometimes we speak of it on the phone, but how much can we- I would love to talk to my father and my mother.</span> <span id="s36">Now, I am better at that.</span> <span id="s37">(inaudible)…</span></p> <p><span id="s38">WH: How did it (inaudible)?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">RB: I think I have a need because in school now, as a teacher, very often teachers get together, and in the beginning I feel like I was like a Black Sheep in the crowd, I better not talk about it, because they would look at me like I would be coming from Mars, or like a stranger.</span> <span id="s40">And I would feel their reaction towards me.</span> <span id="s41">I said, ‘Forget it.’</span> <span id="s42">(inaudible) but lately, I say anything, and it doesn’t bother me.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">WH: How does it affect them?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">RB: They got to know me humanly first.</span> <span id="s45">You see, when I am an outsider, they don’t know me.</span> <span id="s46">But now, I stay with them 5 years now in the school, and I’m older and I handle whatever I have to handle.</span> <span id="s47">I have courage.</span> <span id="s48">And then when they know that I am from Holocaust, sometimes, it seems, truthfully, that they admire me.</span> <span id="s49">That I had this courage, because I’m beyond-I mean, I’ll tell you honestly, from the very first impulse, I see such horrible kids, coming into a Junior High School in Bedford Stuyvesant, trying to find out what the work is all about, and the kids picks up a chair and throws it, I said, ‘Is that what I’m going to face?’</span> <span id="s50">And I looking at other teachers, and I say, ‘How can they face that?’</span> <span id="s51">And truth was, it was scary.</span> <span id="s52">So I said, ‘No, High School is not for me,’ because I cannot handle the kids.</span> <span id="s53">Junior High School kids.’</span></p> <p><span id="s54">WH: Toughest age.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">RB: Then, when I went to High School, I tell you, I said to myself, ‘If they can handle it, why can’t I?’</span> <span id="s56">And there is always this fight in me, ‘Now look, Americans can do it.</span> <span id="s57">(inaudible) You went through horror and this and that, and nothing helped, and I can face it.’</span> <span id="s58">I’m talking to myself, and ‘face it and, just, so?</span> <span id="s59">That’s it.</span> <span id="s60">You can-anything can be done.</span> <span id="s61">Figure out that this is Auschwitz, and this is let’s say, ghetto, and this is the wild people.</span> <span id="s62">You face the worst, so what is the big deal?’</span> <span id="s63">And this is how I worked to myself, to fight the battles of teaching.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">WH: Like giving yourself therapy.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">RB: Yes, I said, ‘Look, if I can do that, why can’t I face-I always think it is a battlefield.</span> <span id="s66">But now I got over it.</span> <span id="s67">I mean, now I help them.</span> <span id="s68">I am easier with the kids.</span> <span id="s69">I can laugh with them.</span> <span id="s70">But it-at the beginning, it was just like a battlefield…it was Andrew Jackson High School…boys and girls is terrible.</span> <span id="s71">It is a drain.</span> <span id="s72">It’s a battlefield.</span> <span id="s73">Teachers are frightened to walk even…</span></p> <p><span id="s74">WH: Have you ever spoken to groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">RB: (inaudible) yes…and at 15, 16, I went (after the war) back to school because that’s all I know.</span> <span id="s76">13, 12 years old my mother left me at school, my father believed in school.</span> <span id="s77">In learning, and learning, and learning that’s the only thing you can have.</span> <span id="s78">You can lose money, but you can never lose knowledge.</span> <span id="s79">And this is the way my father believed in and he was an enlightened man.</span> <span id="s80">He wasn’t religious.</span> <span id="s81">He was an enlightened-.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">WH: Was he a Zionist?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">RB: Yes…and my mother was very traditional.</span> <span id="s84">And that conflict was in my house also, he went to the library to read, and my mother hoped that he’s going to shul.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">WH: …you were three brothers and yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">RB: Yes…I am a twin…</span></p> <p><span id="s87">WH: Who survived from your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">RB: Nobody.</span> <span id="s89">I am the only one…I was the youngest…</span></p> <p><span id="s90">WH: …where were you during the war…</span></p> <p><span id="s91">RB: …I was in hiding...with some people…and then in the ghetto they were building a tunnel, it was a secret, and at night they dug it.</span> <span id="s92">Two months later…they organized 20 people they brought them through the tunnel…and then let us go through the tunnel…and 40 survived, and 80 were caught…I knew I had to run away from the city and I…ran into the woods…I was 15, 16 years old…and I was taken to the partisans…Jewish groups of organized partisono…Zorins.</span> <span id="s93">He’s the Russian organization, and it was under the Russian supervision, the other one is Gersky who organized it, he is Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">WH: …and you spent the rest of the war with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">RB: Well, 7, 8 months-.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">WH: Then they were liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">RB: Yeh.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">WH: …where did you go then?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">RB: Well, as soon as I was liberated, I went to school.</span> <span id="s100">I didn’t know any better-Russian school.</span> <span id="s101">I stayed with a few people that were like me…a girl, Rose, (inaudible) her mother took care of me and her.</span> <span id="s102">She was 3 years older.</span> <span id="s103">And her mother cared for me, and I was taken care of then.</span> <span id="s104">And the mother was shot at (and killed) by the Germans, when they were flying back…and after a year, everybody left, and I lost my brothers, so I went with them (a group going to Italy), and as I came to Italy, I said, ‘what I’m going to do here?</span> <span id="s105">I might as well study.’</span> <span id="s106">And of course, it was like a renaissance.</span> <span id="s107">I came to Italy, and I was performing, and I was dancing, and this (inaudible) doesn’t make sense…this it’s all good times, but this is not my goal.</span> <span id="s108">I wanted to study.</span> <span id="s109">I wanted to do something worthwhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">WH: …how is it, that you were able to pick up the pieces and rebuild your life here.</span> <span id="s111">From where did you draw the strength?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">RB: Well, this is where we come to it.</span> <span id="s113">I think it has a lot to do with the dreams of your parents that wanted you to become somebody beyond them.</span> <span id="s114">As usual, parents want to be more than what they have achieved.</span> <span id="s115">And that the dream, you read it when you are a child, and if the external forces are cut off, this dream is even stronger.</span> <span id="s116">And I feel that I (inaudible) with my mother’s dream and hope, and my father’s, that someday we will become what they want us to become, and if this is cut off, yes, I-this strength is even more important, that I-this is what I want.</span> <span id="s117">I even wanted my children to be-I should be the example for them also.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">WH: Do you find that consciously, when you make a decision or do something important, that you’re thinking to yourself, how would my parents have wanted this to be done?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">RB: I thought when I was younger, now it’s like the reverse.</span> <span id="s120">Now, I want my children to see that their strength- it will give them strength when they will think, when they’ll come to our age, and see how we handle our life.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">WH: You felt that to the extent that you followed a life style, and had the values that your parents had, that in a sense they continue to live (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s122">RB: That gave me strength, yes.</span> <span id="s123">I always even repeat it to my children, sometimes, I said, ‘G-d, if only my parents would live, they would be so proud!’</span> <span id="s124">Or, yes, that kind, yes, this was always my strength.</span> <span id="s125">My strength.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">WH: Does it ever happen to you when you think back about the war that it is in a way, so realistic that-could it have happened, as we are sitting here, in Forest Hills, could the events that you described to me (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s127">RB: Is it a question?</span> <span id="s128">You are wondering if it is really real.</span> <span id="s129">I tell you, it is very real, but I always see, when I see the Holocaust group that gets together, I am still overwhelmed.</span> <span id="s130">And not only that, I’m alone then.</span> <span id="s131">And the others-peoples horrors, so immense, and so-I couldn’t believe.</span> <span id="s132">Tragedies are always coming and going.</span> <span id="s133">We have moments of good (inaudible) and moments of-and even today, I cannot (inaudible) what’s going on in Israel.</span> <span id="s134">The struggle…(interrupted by the building maintenance who wants to fix the pipes and she casually stops her conversation and gives him permission to fix it.)</span> <span id="s135">.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">WH: …and how do you feel, especially today?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">RB: I must tell you…and I bring this up even at a Holocaust-I’m now open to it because I’m just fresh from it.</span> <span id="s138">I must tell you yesterday I was very down, because I went through this Holocaust, and for some reason, everything soaked in, and I was emotionally devastated.</span> <span id="s139">Yesterday.</span> <span id="s140">Today, I am better off.</span> <span id="s141">I had my rest…when the Jews in ’73 had a war, I was so sick.</span> <span id="s142">It’s like my children are on the war, fighting again.</span> <span id="s143">I identified completely.</span> <span id="s144">When I was in Israel, I cried, because I felt that why (inaudible) my children, they seen horror in the street.</span> <span id="s145">You know, I see the positive side also, they could have been killed, my children, (inaudible) I feel always guilty.</span> <span id="s146">My place should be in Israel, not here.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">WH: Did you think about going to Israel after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">RB: Yes…but…my grandparents are here in America…my father’s parents are here.</span> <span id="s149">They came in 19-and the only one that didn’t come is my father, because he remained with property.</span> <span id="s150">And the dream was that one day we’ll come to America…so those are the forces that we grew up-</span></p> <p><span id="s151">WH: Do you live with your bags packed?</span> <span id="s152">…that a Jew can never be too comfortable, or secure?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">RB: I always feel that way…I don’t feel secure here also.</span> <span id="s154">My mind is really, one day, we were talking, I want to stay for at least a year in Israel.</span> <span id="s155">Maybe I’ll take, G-d forbid, my last years in Israel…the first thing that I did is send my daughter, when she finished high school, to Israel, and I hoped that she’ll take roots there, but she didn’t…the whole feeling is, yes, I’m on the road to go some place else.</span> <span id="s156">That is a good statement, except that I feel that at the end, I would like to be in Israel.</span> <span id="s157">I will feel very good there.’</span></p> <p><span id="s158">WH: Have you visited Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">RB: …yes…</span></p> <p><span id="s160">WH: When your kids grew up in this country, did you send then to camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">RB: That’s a good point.</span> <span id="s162">I didn’t have any contacts with the real- I didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s163">I think I had a weakness.</span> <span id="s164">I didn’t have, (inaudible) religious we weren’t-I wasn’t religious because that was the tendency in my home.</span> <span id="s165">I didn’t know what to do when it comes to-I was clinging to the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s166">Some reason, religion is not part-.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">End of Tape #1, Side #1 Tape #1, Side #2</span></p> <p><span id="s168">WH: You didn’t join ANY groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">RB: No, I didn’t know about them…(her husband is American born…from Brooklyn…he was a commercial artist for Davis publication…book jackets…magazines…).</span></p> <p><span id="s170">WB: ‘ When you met it was in-.’</span></p> <p><span id="s171">RB: I came in ’50 and we met in 1951.</span> <span id="s172">I left school in Italy so I went to the same school in art.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">WH: Was it a culture shock to meet someone coming from so totally a different background?’</span></p> <p><span id="s174">RB: (Her husband: Hummm It was interesting (laughs).</span> <span id="s175">She was full of fire and vinegar.</span> <span id="s176">Different.</span> <span id="s177">(inaudible) ).</span></p> <p><span id="s178">WH: …after everything you went through, some people would have been so devastated they wouldn’t have been able to crawl.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">RB: …(inaudible)…I had to study to accomplish something and to unite myself with my identity.</span> <span id="s180">I did not have that because of the conflict between mother and father, so I wasn’t about to get married or anything, but I’d like to find-what is it all about?</span> <span id="s181">Life, philosophers, great painters, after all-(RB’s husband: She had a terrible hunger for learning.)</span></p> <p><span id="s182">WH: You went back to school after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">RB: I went to Hunter College.</span> <span id="s184">I was in school in Italy and I continued.</span> <span id="s185">I said, ‘What am I to do here?’</span> <span id="s186">I said to myself ‘Go back to school.’</span></p> <p><span id="s187">WH: …why didn’t you go to Israel?’</span></p> <p><span id="s188">RB: Because I wanted to see my grandparents…I was in conflict, but I did want to see my grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">WH: They sent you the affidavit?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">RB: No, they helped me with money.</span> <span id="s191">And they gave me support, and I went to school over there in Italy and while I’m in Italy in school, I wanted to learn everything that I could (inaudible) it was a drive to understand to- philosophy.</span> <span id="s192">The philosophers drove me crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">WH: …how could you keep your mind on your work without thinking about everything that had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">RB: That is very good.</span> <span id="s195">You closed, you, this was it, and you have to want life.</span> <span id="s196">(inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s197">WH: Did you find that other people adopted the same attitude?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">RB: If they got married, raised a family, they were too busy.</span> <span id="s199">You know what, that’s a good question, but I see it in my daughter.</span> <span id="s200">She’s so busy, she has no time for (?</span> <span id="s201">us?)</span> <span id="s202">.</span> <span id="s203">But, you know, I’m just saying, I can’t help what is there.</span> <span id="s204">But I must do what I have to do.</span> <span id="s205">And that this, the hunger to discover the new things-I must learn and I must find out.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">WH: It must really help you because if you stop to think-.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">RB: If you want to know, even now I have this problem.</span> <span id="s208">You know, I was very involved in the humanities because I wanted to read (inaudible) people have problems, now I realize, that I’m not the only one.</span> <span id="s209">But it’s sort of like absorbing, pushing my energies into opening doors to the objective world, rather than subjective.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">WH: What do you mean that even now you have this problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">RB: Even now, when I’m not busy, I’m teaching, I’m busy, busy.</span> <span id="s212">When comes a weekend or a holiday, I get depressive.</span> <span id="s213">I can’t even-my children aren’t here.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">WH: …even Americans can get depressed…but you have terrible things to remember so you have more incentive to keep busy…</span></p> <p><span id="s215">RB: Yah.</span> <span id="s216">This is why I bring this up, that somehow I have to be-I have energy, emotional, I work that way.</span> <span id="s217">I plunge in (inaudible) all the way teacher.</span> <span id="s218">I mean, I’m getting into the world of the children, and I can be good to them, and they love me, so I have a positive attitude.</span> <span id="s219">Somehow there is a positive side of me-(inaudible) if I have nothing to do, I’m looking to my friends.</span> <span id="s220">Very intimate friends.</span> <span id="s221">And I help them to get out of their depression.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">WH: Did you ever talk to a social worker-therapy?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">RB: Yes.</span> <span id="s224">Therapists.</span> <span id="s225">Yes.</span> <span id="s226">I did go.</span> <span id="s227">(inaudible).</span> <span id="s228">We had conflicts (inaudible) and I wanted to become a teacher and do something, and we had tough times between husband and wife and children, and so, I did go, we went both.</span> <span id="s229">He went first and then I joined for a year or two.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">WH: But not related to the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">RB: No.</span> <span id="s232">In fact only that he…said that my sleeping, I was escaping from my problems…it subsided by having a family, but then I had a need to go back to do something.</span> <span id="s233">I found in ‘ (inaudible) Therapy’ by Franklyn, my solution to the problem.</span> <span id="s234">I needed to do something…somehow children wasn’t enough for me.</span> <span id="s235">My children.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">WH: …when people adapt successfully to life it has to do much more with their ability to cope with hardship than with the things that actually happened to them…it isn’t what happens to you in life that determines how you can manage it.</span> <span id="s237">It’s how you can respond to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">RB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">WH: …you came by boat…into New York Harbor…did your grandparents greet you?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">RB: Yes.’</span></p> <p><span id="s241">WH: What was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">RB: Very moving…and then my grandmother, my grandfather, were 85 years old, and my grandmother sitting like this, I sort of like recognized them.</span> <span id="s243">It was very moving, old people and I was 20.</span> <span id="s244">And here I am the only one who survived.</span> <span id="s245">They were very touched.</span> <span id="s246">But they were old…I came to them, but my uncle took me instead-their son, I had a lot of uncles and aunts.</span> <span id="s247">I could not relate to them too much, except that the first 6 months he was very nice about taking us in.</span> <span id="s248">He was the poorest, but was a nice soul…in Pelham Parkway…</span></p> <p><span id="s249">WH: What was it like living with him?’</span></p> <p><span id="s250">RB: Not easy.</span> <span id="s251">Because I felt, an outsider, I was uncomfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">WH: Did he have kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">RB: Yes, two little kids, and they were-and I couldn’t find myself.</span> <span id="s254">I found it very hard, adjusting in America.</span> <span id="s255">Very hard.</span> <span id="s256">Very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">WH: …what was the adjustment problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">RB: Well I wanted to go into school, I felt that I had training, of two years of college almost in terms of Hunter College, I did know a little English, they thought that, ‘What is
