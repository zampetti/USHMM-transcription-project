id="s71">Q: He was a captain.</span> <span id="s72">And was there an army base, a military base then, in Lvov?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Oh, but several.</span> <span id="s74">Italians, or several, how you call it, the – the bi – it’s a big – was a very big city, so it had a lot of different kinds of [indecipherable] my father was with the – how you call the – the unit, the marching people, the soldiers, foot soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Infantry?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Infantry.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: And there – there was a cavalry and there was the heavy armored –</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Artillery.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: – ra – artillery, light artillery, and also the air force.</span> <span id="s81">They had the small – there was an airport for – for the army, so – for the air officers in Lvov, called [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s82">And sometimes he was, as a matter of fact, toward the end of his career, he was in charge of security of being in adven – infantry, taking security of this Polish air for – at Lvov –</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: The airport.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: – air force – air – airport.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Wa – it sounds like it was very much then a military town.</span> <span id="s86">Were all Polish cities had so many bases from the military, or was Lvov exceptional in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: No, Lvov was a third size city in Poland.</span> <span id="s88">It was a very well known, years, years before, centuries before, as a commercial crossroad from the Baltic to Black Sea.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: And so there was a lot of influx of the Armenians, and the people from the east who were trading, going through.</span> <span id="s91">And then later on it developed quite a well-known cultural center.</span> <span id="s92">And it was – it had this specific atmosphere.</span> <span id="s93">Lvov was somehow unique in that sense that if you meet anywhere somebody from Lvov, you always have something to talk about and you ask each other, where did you live, what street?</span> <span id="s94">And was a very patriotic city, but toward the end of the first World War, after the Austrian empire fell through – lost the war, Galicia, that was part of the Austrian empire was again, somehow, having problems with the minorities, and there was a big minority of the Ukrainians, wanted to have Lvov as their city, and there were strong battle in – for several months in the – with the arm – Prussian army.</span> <span id="s95">At that time a – Russia entered already the war, already, after the revolutions, it was communist –</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: – army that wanted to take over.</span> <span id="s98">At that time also was the battle for – they entered also the eastern border of Poland and wanted supposedly, as Lenin said, they wanted to bring communism to Germany.</span> <span id="s99">And so, in that battle, most of the young people who were fighting for the independence were already at the front, being busy, so the students of Lvov, the students of universities – there were a couple of polytechnic and university very well recognized.</span> <span id="s100">And the young children, like Boy Scouts, and – and were helping out and it retained its independence from the Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s101">It became part afterwards –</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Of Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: – it became part of Polish, because [indecipherable] I can’t re-recall how many miles yet to the Russian border, because it, you know, was several hundreds of miles to the Russian border, so it was still well in – well in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: But it was close to the Ukrainian border.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Well, not – at that time, Ukrainian border, there were couple of hundred miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Oh, still a few hundred miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Right, because Russia –</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Was part – it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Ukraine was part of –</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: – it was part of of Russia, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: – Russia at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: At that time Ukraine was still – when the communists came, they made Ukraine –</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Communist.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: – park – part of Russia, communistic part of Soviet –</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: I just was – I had thought it was so close to the border.</span> <span id="s117">I didn’t realize there was still several hundred miles distance.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Mm-hm, right.</span> <span id="s119">I would say 200 - 300 miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s121">Tell me a little bit about your mother.</span> <span id="s122">Her name again was?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Maria.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Maria.</span> <span id="s125">And how – what was her role?</span> <span id="s126">Was she – does she also have a – a – an occupation, or was her occupation taking care of the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Before she got married, she was a teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Or also she worked in bank.</span> <span id="s130">And then when she got married, one of the things that life of the officer was very often on the move.</span> <span id="s131">You spend few years here, few years there, and then we were born, so she really took care of us for rest of her life.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Was – was your family from Lvov for generations, or had your parents moved there from other parts of Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: On my mother’s side and my husband – my father’s side, there were members of Lvov community.</span> <span id="s134">I don’t know exactly, looking past a hundred years – more than hundred years of my father’s families – progeny, and the relatives who were, but I know that they were quite well-known in the 19th century.</span> <span id="s135">And on my mother’s side, they were well-recognized as book editors and booksellers.</span> <span id="s136">That was on my mother’s side, and also when the oil started at the lower part of Poland, close to Ukrainian border, some of the – the members of my mother’s family were owners of the – of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Oil wells?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: – oil wells, or participated in some kind of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: In the oil business probably.</span> <span id="s140">How would you describe your chi – the home life inside your home?</span> <span id="s141">Were your parents very strict, were they lenient?</span> <span id="s142">What were some of their values?</span> <span id="s143">What are the things you remember them, I guess sh-sharing with you that were important to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: I think that I’m – I gained much from – from them, from the teaching, or wi – they were very moral people.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Were they religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: They were religious and they attended the church as we – although, when I started going to the – the primary school, it was a public school, but they were also – sometime the – the schools run by nuns, or the – for the girls, or for boys, the monks.</span> <span id="s147">But I was in public school, but we had also gone through a – learning religion in school, and attended all – part of our life was living also a religious life.</span> <span id="s148">And all our morals are based on that, and I think that – that added to the strength afterwards, that we, when difficulties started later in life, and the tragedy started, that the – the base was that we had loving parents, and my mother would – although I always felt that she preferred my brothers to me, she was very strict – stricter with me.</span> <span id="s149">It’s only when I was grown-up, much grown-up, she – she told me that she expected more from me, and was stricter with me because the women have harder life, and have much more to depend on the moral self-awareness than the boys.</span> <span id="s150">So there – therefore, difference that I felt as a negative thing, was in the form of trying to make me stronger.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Do you think it worked?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s154">Which – which parent were you closer to?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: I was close to my mother because she was always around.</span> <span id="s156">But I was also – I knew that I was in – in ma – in the eyes of my father a little princess.</span> <span id="s157">I would – wouldn’t do anything – even he expected also a lot of me.</span> <span id="s158">Fortunately I was a good student, so there was never this – any conflicts like that.</span> <span id="s159">But I remember once she wa – he was passing by my – our bedroom, and a rug that was near my bed was crooked.</span> <span id="s160">And I remember him telling me, you, with your artistic inclination, how can you stand a crooked rug?</span> <span id="s161">And tha – you know, that must have been so many years ago, but something like this happened.</span> <span id="s162">And I was very proud of my father, he had been – ha-had many friends, and was considered quite an – outstanding as a person.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Was he an outgoing person?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: I would say he was more like home person, whenever he was coming.</span> <span id="s165">He was not too much into going out so much, but usually when he would come home, I would remember him reading newspapers, and staying home, and – and also going visiting with the re – other relatives.</span> <span id="s166">But he was also very much feeling responsible for his subordinates.</span> <span id="s167">So he was always on the lookout, or checking out with them.</span> <span id="s168">So I understand they had a great admiration for him, which proved later on in life, when they were looking for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Would you describe your childhood?</span> <span id="s170">How would you describe your childhood?</span> <span id="s171">How would you, when you think back on those years before the war, what is the feeling that you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: I would say, on – like most other girls, I would say similar experiences in school.</span> <span id="s173">I was sometimes teacher’s pet, so I suffered a little bit sometimes, because being somehow shown as a – an example, makes you an enemy of some people.</span> <span id="s174">But anyway, mostly a good, pleasant type of fa-family, my mother and father, and also the distant family, aunts and uncles visiting, everybody will – even later on they, when as an adult, and some aunt, or some uncle from – from Poland, when we visited, they remembered me as a child.</span> <span id="s175">And I remembered how close they were to our family.</span> <span id="s176">So it was a, I would say, more – mostly [indecipherable] except that we were not rich, because the army people are not rich, so I knew that from time to time they might have had some problems, financial problems if something extra happened.</span> <span id="s177">But I, fortunately, I don’t remember any big sickness in my childhood or my brothers’, except for scarlet fever and diphtheria.</span> <span id="s178">But at that time there was a kind of – every – every child almost, had it, and you had to be in the hospital, because there was epidemic of scarlet fever, so that they would not allow children to stay home.</span> <span id="s179">So I spent some six weeks or something like that in the – in the hospital, but – my brothers, too, at different times.</span> <span id="s180">But nothing really tragic.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: How would you describe your parents’ relationships to one another?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: It was – from what I can say, and could feel, there was a great bond between them.</span> <span id="s183">It was great respect for my father, and my – my mother also had her husband’s respect.</span> <span id="s184">Th – I couldn’t remember angry voices, but if there were – and I am sure that it’s impossible to live through life without any – any little disagreements or something, but I was not aware of any problem of any serious consequences.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Did you have close friends at school?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: Yes, I had several friends and – and – and one, especially one whose parents were also friends of my parents.</span> <span id="s187">He was a famous painter in – in Poland, and her mother was not working, was also taking care.</span> <span id="s188">But Barah(ph) was the only child, so we were very often spending time, either at our house, or at her house.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: What was her last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Martuszuk(ph)</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Martuszuk(ph).</span> <span id="s192">How would – you mentioned a little bit that your parents or your family was not particularly well-to-do.</span> <span id="s193">Would you sa –</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: [indecipherable] the army –</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: – people, you know, kind of difficult, and because the army – Poland was then, you know, just rising from the ashes.</span> <span id="s197">And I think in Poland was starting to build the economy and industry.</span> <span id="s198">So it – a regular situation with the army, it’s – wasn’t that they were not very [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s199">Maybe there were people who had some special assignments, or something like that, would get extra money for trouble, or something, a presentation or something.</span> <span id="s200">It’s not that we’re poor.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: I didn’t feel the poverty.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: But no – from knowledge of how the situation was.</span> <span id="s205">As an adult I could recognize that we’re middle class, well educated, and middle class very much interested in the social and cultural life.</span> <span id="s206">But not probably extensively or too often outside of Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Did your family own a car?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: No, we did not own a car.</span> <span id="s209">The horses, the [indecipherable] or how you call the horses were usually belonged to – to the commander of the battalion, like my father was.</span> <span id="s210">And so, we sometimes went on some excursion we went, but we also went – the car also belonged to the unit there.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s212">So sometimes you had use of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: So sometimes we used it, the car.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Did you have a radio at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: But there that – that time, was the radio when you – you – with the crystal, when you put the small crystal to here, to connect –</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: I don’t even know what that ra – kind of radio looked like.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Not just a – a box with the microphone that you could hear –</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: – I mean, behind the screen.</span> <span id="s222">And there was the classic things with the – some screw that you tried to correct –</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: The sound?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: – the sound to get the connection, because that – you probably only would have the – only the radio from Lvov, all the – in Poland, but you would have to maneuver to get that thing working.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: The signal.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Signal.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s228">Tell me a little bit about Lvov as a city that you mentioned earlier, seemed to be multicultural.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Very much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Who wi – and how was it divided, if you would know?</span> <span id="s231">First of all, about how large a city was it in the 1930s?</span> <span id="s232">How many poppi – people?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: In – 350,000 before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: And it had about 65 percent Poles, I would say about 20 percent Ukrainians, or maybe less.</span> <span id="s236">I would say less, but they had quite a large Jewish section, Jewish – the – the Jews of Poland were the – the assimi – most of them were the assimilated Jews, or the Jews who called themselves Poles, and went with us to school.</span> <span id="s237">And there were also smal – small sections in Lvov – well, small, it’s relative, where there were Orthodox places.</span> <span id="s238">They had very busy market, very well developed, and they had several synagogues.</span> <span id="s239">And was kind of a very prou – Lvov was proud of is that they had Armenians, quite a lot of [indecipherable] maybe t – five or more thousand Armenians, who are actually, they came to Lvov in the 16th century, 17 century, so you couldn’t really differentiate that they were Armenians.</span> <span id="s240">They had different names, but they had – the cathedral was Armenian cathedral, or Catholic Armenian order, and there was also the Ukrainian cathedral, a very well recognized, very well-known [indecipherable] Saint George Cathedral, for the Ukrainians, but they were not ort – Russian orthodox, but they were Yoonyots(ph).</span> <span id="s241">That was the reun – in the – at the end of 16th century there was a reunion of the orthodox Ukrainians with the Roman –</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Catholic church.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: – Catholic church, and they recognized the Pope.</span> <span id="s244">And so you actually could go to – to the masses, except that they use the Ukrainian language and Ukrainian letters, which –</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Rather than Latin.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: Rather than Latin.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: But that was different, and especially since lat – in the Catholic church had Latin –</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: – so for most of the people who did not know Latin, it was also boring.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s252">Did you ha –</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: And then I also about several – quite a – a lot, I don’t know what percentage, German, especially Austrian German, because Galicia in the – when Poland was divided, Poland uke – Lithuanian Ukraine –</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: – and Poland, the commonwealth was divided between Russia, Prussia and Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: So if you know that situation, many of the Austrians came in and stayed, and very often became Poles, even better Poles patriotically than – than some peasants who – peasants or some workers who didn’t have schooling or something, that as the ch-change after the war happened, there were many – and during the 19th century there’s – you probably know from history, there were several uprising against Russia to free Poland –</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: – and Lithuania from Russian tsars at that time.</span> <span id="s260">And I know the incidents of people who – was one professor that I read somewhere that small story, one professor at the University of Lvov, they were talking about one of the uprising in – in Poland in the [indecipherable] what they said congress was a part of Russian – Russian part of Poland who stepped up the activities, and they said, where I – where are you sons, they asked the professor.</span> <span id="s261">He said, he – they are doing the patriotic duty.</span> <span id="s262">They went to defend Poland, to Russian part.</span> <span id="s263">Beca – and he was of Austrian – Austrian parentage –</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Origin, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: – originally, because many, many of them – as a matter of fact, my – the mother of my girlfriend in Poland, her parents lived in Vienna, and sometimes she went to visit her.</span> <span id="s266">So, there was some [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: Yeah, some influence.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: – many of these people became as Polish as –</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: As the next person, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: In school, did you intermingled, or did your family know any Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: I sat with a Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s275">I didn’t have much in common with some of the girls from – because where – in our neighborhood, I think, were many small shop owners.</span> <span id="s276">And they somehow kept much to themselves, Jewish people.</span> <span id="s277">But we also have some doctors [indecipherable] and some very, very good students, too, and it was like, I would say in the class of 35 or 40 children, there would be at least 15 Jewish children.</span> <span id="s278">And when the lessons in religion, everybody was obliged to take – participate, and we had the priest come for the Catholic girls, the rabbi come, take the to another room, or – or we went out to another room.</span> <span id="s279">And also Ukraine, or [indecipherable] which is the Ukrainians how they called themselves before the – all the nationalistic fights.</span> <span id="s280">But – and then they – and we had couple Protestants girls and there was a church, a Protestant church of Habsburg den-denomination.</span> <span id="s281">So it was an – a – I cannot remember how many – how many, but I know that I sat – there were two – two girls to each seat, and I was sitting with the – with the girl who was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Did your parents talk about politics at home?</span> <span id="s283">About what was going on in the country, what was going on in the world?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: I-I – I think we were well informed, but there were – I had sometimes discussion with my father, what I was like – about medicine, or about something.</span> <span id="s285">I that – when my father would come and have his late lunch, because at four o’clock it’s neither lunch nor supper.</span> <span id="s286">So I would sit and ask of – my mother was very upset.</span> <span id="s287">Will you stop talking about all the medical things, or – I don’t know why it was of some interest at one point for me.</span> <span id="s288">But we discussed probably because of school, and learning and it wasn’t somehow forced on us, any patriotic things, or you were ordered by school to march, or to – ordered by – you did some of the things, like celebrate anniversaries and – and ho – hope that Poland is honorable with everything, and somehow you knew that there was some bad things happened, you heard about some – somebody murdering somebody, some kind of a trial of someone, which later on, I understand years later proving that it was innocent person.</span> <span id="s289">But anyway, somehow the – it was in the news, so you couldn’t help even overhearing what they went to the – to shop, or where they went in – in the tramways, because the tramways were the way the communication was quite well-developed in – in Lvov, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: So – okay.</span> <span id="s291">Did you want to finish the thought?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Mm, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s294">Did you – were – were Hitler’s name or Stalin’s name, were they well known?</span> <span id="s295">Did people talk about them, or were they foreign countries, and they would have little effect?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: No, there was definitely a well-known situation, and I remember during one of my last – maybe not last – in 1938, in vacation, I was in Warsaw with my aunt and uncle, the brother of my father.</span> <span id="s297">And I also lived with – sometimes they had the house be – residence outside of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s298">And I remember in ’38, at the time of Czechoslovakia and anschluss, and the speeches of Hitler, and how we all felt, you know, all – really with the goose pimples.</span> <span id="s299">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: You fe – you felt?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: Goose pimples.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Goose pimples.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: When we heard the voice of Hitler talking about his enemies, and how – and then also sometimes on the radio too, you heard the [indecipherable] repeating his threats after Czechoslovakia and starting to repeat the threats against Poland, which some reporters translated it, of course.</span> <span id="s304">But also you heard the voices of Hitler, it still to my – I think to my dying day, the wor – hearing his voice raises the hair on my back of my head.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Frightening.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Frightening, and like if you hear evil, or f – almost subconsciously because at that time we didn’t realize what will happen.</span> <span id="s307">But the hatred that was coming through was so difficult to – even to understand, that – that amount of threats, or that amount of hatred, or that amount of – and also, on the other hand, my father had a very relaxed or – the way of talking about the army, and about that Poland is preparing for difficult times, and we are sure that we will survive, and also would – toward the end, when there were the alliances with England and France, that we’ll have some help and some support from the west, if Hitler will attack us.</span> <span id="s308">And that they will defend Poland to the last drop of blood.</span> <span id="s309">And somehow that right would be on our side.</span> <span id="s310">[phone ringing]</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Mm-hm, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: And so, in that sense, we looked with some hope to – [interruption][break]</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: So, there are very troubling things that are happening, but also signals that you’ll be safe, that things will be okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Feeling hope, and also based on the – our faith, religious faith, and feeling that we were not the people who could cause the war, but rather to defend our honor, but not to kind of being afraid that we are facing such a mighty enemy, and such a ruthless enemy.</span> <span id="s317">So unfortunately, this happened.</span> <span id="s318">But it still, from what I understand, the Germans, when talking about the September war, 1939 war, in their reports said that some of the bravery was enviable, about Poles before they died, or before they had to leave the post, or something.</span> <span id="s319">That’s all, there were still monument in some places where was almost like [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Where everybody would die without giving up the defense.</span> <span id="s322">So – and then, also the feeling that we will – the goodness should win in the long run, but we didn’t know how the things were.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s324">I’d like to get a sense of, as August 1939, or as summer 1939 is developing, what is it that you are hearing, what is it that is in the conversations and in the air?</span> <span id="s325">Are – are your parents talking more and more about things?</span> <span id="s326">And – and I’d like to know personally, for you, for your family, where were you, and how did you learn of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: Well, the instant of the war, I very well remember, the first of September.</span> <span id="s328">I – when I came back from my aunt, near Kraków, where I spend the vacation, she brought me around sixth or fifth of August.</span> <span id="s329">And I knew that the – at that time there were some unpleasant meetings between the German and Russian people, diplomatic, some conferences or whatever, we didn’t know yet at that time.</span> <span id="s330">And because that war seemed to be imminent, my aunt and uncle brought me home to Lvov.</span> <span id="s331">And by then my father was not sleeping at home, but staying on his post where he was assigned at part of Lvov, at Lychakiv, near where his whole unit was at.</span> <span id="s332">And my mother took me on the first of September to say hello to my father, because this was around – like around 10 o’clock or so in the morning, to greet Tadeusz after coming back from vacation, and to say hello, to see him, but then return without him, with my mother.</span> <span id="s333">And I was returning by tram number one.</span> <span id="s334">That I remember too, the tram number one was actually traveling from nearby where my father was staying, but he’s quite a lot across from where we lived, and by the time we were passing mid-after – sitting in the – in the train and train was going, and we started hearing something like bombs, or some shot – shooting, or something that sounded like thunder, or we didn’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s335">And close to our church, which is – which was not too far from the place where we lived, at that number one stopped, and the tramway – and people were trying to watch the planes flying over, and people were saying no, th-these are not Polish, these are not Polish planes.</span> <span id="s336">And then we hear some of the bombs breaking sound, and the – the conductor of the tramway said, you have to hurry home and try to get into the basement or somewhere to hide, because this is the – we are attacked from the air by Germany.</span> <span id="s337">I remember then walking back, I saw a woman – I don’t know how I remember that, but carrying a pillow with blood on it.</span> <span id="s338">And she said my daughter was hit by – whether by shrapnel, or whether by a brick or something, because of the falling house, that her – her head was on that pillow when her daughter was, and she was crying and carrying before we got to our house.</span> <span id="s339">And we – we got to the base – basement, but actually what – later on it was arranged there were some neighbor – neighborhood houses where had bigger basements, much more prep-prep-prepared to take some people in.</span> <span id="s340">And so the rest of [indecipherable] before the Russians came, before the 22nd of September, when the Russians came to Lvov, they entered Poland on the 19th of September –</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Hang on a second.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Ni – no – Poland, 17th of September they entered – they crossed the border.</span> <span id="s343">By the time they came to Lvov, Lvov was being surrounded by the German army.</span> <span id="s344">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Okay, let’s stop there for a second, though.</span> <span id="s346">You’re in – you’re in the basement originally, you know, the first one, which is not that well prepared.</span> <span id="s347">And if I can just repeat what I understood is, you went to say hello and greet your father on your way back from vacation in Kraków, and while you are traveling home on tram number one, the war starts.</span> <span id="s348">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: The – the bombardment, the –</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: The – the – the bombardment comes.</span> <span id="s351">So you didn’t know the war – war was starting, you just saw the bombs –</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: Saw the – the airplanes –</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Planes.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: – and the people talking th – oh no, these are Polish, oh no, no, these are not Polish airplanes.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: And then hearing the whistle –</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Of the bombs.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: – of the bombs.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Well, it meant that, I mean, Lvov being so far east –</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Well, it’s – but for the airplanes –</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Germ – yeah, it’s not long.</span> <span id="s362">It’s not long at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Not only that, you have to remember that Poland was surrounded from three sides.</span> <span id="s364">Only the Russian border was not use – being used as an army for Germany.</span> <span id="s365">Czechoslovakia was taken, and Slovakia was a Hitler friend.</span> <span id="s366">That’s the south of Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: And of course –</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Prussia.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: Prussia was the German place of Teutonic knights, which you know, as Lithuanian Teutonic knights –</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: – to that part of – of what was Poland at one point.</span> <span id="s373">So the north part, and all the –</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: West.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: – all the west.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: So the – the – Poland was like taken into squeeze.</span> <span id="s378">So I don’t know whether these planes came from – maybe from Czechoslovakia, which wasn’t too far.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: That’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: And – but the – the advance was swift.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Well tell me – tell me then, in those three weeks, if it started from the first –</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Three –</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: – until the – until the Russians enter on the 17th, they cross the border –</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Yes, but the war was still going on, the Poland did not surrender until the 29th of S-September, Warsaw fell.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Okay, what I’m interested in is what is happening with you and your family in this environment.</span> <span id="s386">So, in those three weeks, where were you, where were your younger brothers, where was your mother, and where was your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: My father was at his post, and from time to time was sending us, either through his adjutant or some telephone that everything is all right with him, and to take care, and hope for the better, that the German, as a matter of fact, stopped – were stopped around Lvov, they could not enter Lvov.</span> <span id="s388">And then there was a day of quiet, the 22nd.</span> <span id="s389">The – actually the evening of 21st, all the ar-artillery fire, because this was constantly, we had constant air raids, and constant, at one point wa – when the Germany was surrounding Lvov, constant battle.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: So did you stay at home?</span> <span id="s391">Did you stay in the cellar?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: We stayed at home on the first floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: And went to s – no, we didn’t go to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: The school were – was sto –</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Stopped?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: – closed.</span> <span id="s399">And – but I remember going to visit my friend and spending some time, when – but one of the things that – that my parents, probably every parent was trying to get some preparation, some food storage for something that will take longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: That’s right, that wouldn’t spoil.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: That is it not – right.</span> <span id="s402">That – so very often it was to go – this is still the Russians are not in.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: And then the – on the 22nd, they enter Lvov.</span> <span id="s405">There is no more bombardment, there is no more artillery fight.</span> <span id="s406">But the other things started to –</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s410">So I’m going to try and repeat what I – what I think I understand, is that in those first weeks, the Germans have surrounded Lvov, and there’s fighting.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Only the last few days before they – the Russians came.</span> <span id="s412">The –</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: Okay, so until then, in those first two weeks –</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: – let’s say 14 - 15 days, there was no fighting in Lvov?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Not inside Lvov.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: Not inside.</span> <span id="s418">And – and so was – was there food still, were the stores filled, were – did people go out in the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Yes, the –</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: – would be like – you probably have seen some of the films showing Britain.</span> <span id="s422">You know, there – there were bombardments, although they were not surrounded by the Germans, but at – at the time when bombardments, the s – the s-sirens were –</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: – [indecipherable] and then you run to the basement.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: And then the sirens would sound again, and you would go back to your apartment.</span> <span id="s427">But then, toward the end when Germany surrounded Lvov, which was, I think five days before, or maybe more, I can’t [indecipherable] or I would look at the book, and we would know.</span> <span id="s428">But a – a – around few days, there was a constant, about 10 day – now I remember, 10 days, because my mother saying 10 days that we were staying and sleeping in the basement.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: So you were under siege.</span> <span id="s430">At that point you were under siege.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: And could wa – could I – would it be accurate to understand that the Germans – the n – th-the German Wehrmacht more or less conquered the city for the Russians let them in?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Okay, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: They – they – from what I gather –</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: – from historic point of view, I am somehow amateur historian, and there was meeting with the Russians on the 21st of September.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Between the Germans and the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Between Germans and Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: At first when we n – we learned about Russians coming in, from the news, but wha-what kind of news could come while was in – in wartime is very difficult to say what is true and what not.</span> <span id="s444">But at that time, in a sense, we were puzz – Poles were puzzled: why the Russians come?</span> <span id="s445">There was an alliance between Poland and Russia in 1933 – 32 first, and completed in ’34 for non-aggression pact.</span> <span id="s446">So supposedly we were free on the east, but unfortunately, the Russians broke it.</span> <span id="s447">To this day they say there was no war.</span> <span id="s448">So, for example, the prisoners of war who had been killed, are not recognized the victims of the war to that kind of – some kind of the defense that Russian would, after finally admitting that it was Russians, at first they said th-the – the German forces came with the po – the Russian prisoners of war who are in Russia.</span> <span id="s449">But at that time there were no Germans in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: So, if there was a bombardment of – of Lvov, and all of a sudden it becomes quiet, how do you explain that?</span> <span id="s451">Did the Germans retreat and allow the Russians to come in?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: We didn’t see them retreat, wis – we heard stoppage of the artillery fire.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: And then the eerie kind of quiet.</span> <span id="s455">We didn’t know what to expect from left to right, whether the bombs coming, or whether the artillery will be taken.</span> <span id="s456">And we, at that time, most of the people didn’t think that the Russians came as friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: So what – when was the first time you saw a change?</span> <span id="s458">When was the first time you saw the Russian army come –</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: Immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: The – marching into it, and they – often the pre-war communist people put on the red band on – on the arms, and turned into militia, and immediately would have – the traffic would be stop because they would go into the stores that had food, and would get everything out, and I don’t know whether to take to Russia or to feed the germ – the soldiers.</span> <span id="s462">But immediately we felt there was some lack of food, started they all – they started to – how you would call it?</span> <span id="s463">Give a special cards to go and buy bread or some –</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Rationing.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Rationing of food.</span> <span id="s466">And also – and so the army, who, I think it was almost to pretend that they were poor army men, because they were not as dressed when you take the pictures of these people who came, they were very poorly dressed, the – the arms are like they car – the shoot –</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: The guns.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: The guns were sometimes tied with strings or something, you could see, and the people who were passing were – looked not so much unfriendly, but very much incommunicado.</span> <span id="s469">And also the chaos of some of the people, the lower elements of society, starting to, you know, to take advantage of whatever, to – whether they were stealing, or some, that I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Looting, that sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s473">So would you say there was a – for a little while there was a vacuum of authority, and it was just chaotic –</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: – even though the army was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: The Russian army came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: But our army was taken immediately, our prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s479">There were no Polish soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: So after you had said hello to your father when you came back from vacation, did you see him again?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Because he was always on the post.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s485">All right.</span> <span id="s486">And was he taken as a prisoner of war?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: He was taken from – we got a small piece of card – piece of paper, carried by some of the soldier who were let go, some of officers were immediately taken, but soldiers not always.</span> <span id="s488">And some of them got nearby, the camp outside of Lvov, where they kept the Polish officers, and – and the – you know, surrounded them, and took off their insignia, and told them that they are prisoners of war, and not to get into the ta – into touch with – with relatives.</span> <span id="s489">So this soldier brought a small piece of paper that I am healthy, I am all right.</span> <span id="s490">Please take care of the children and of yourself and God protect you and a couple of words like that.</span> <span id="s491">And then a couple of days later, somebody else went who was one of the students at the university, who was part of this young people preparing for defense –</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: – re – not in the army, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: You mentioned that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: So he told – and he – not me, my mother, that the saw – he went close to – Viniki, was a small town outside Lvov – well, actually resort town.</span> <span id="s498">And there they were kept under – within a wire – wired section.</span> <span id="s499">But he saw this taking of the insignia, and they could not come close and talk to them.</span> <span id="s500">But somehow, if I remember, he just might have spoken something.</span> <span id="s501">And then, afterwards, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: Nothing at all until we learned later on that they were being transported by foot to Tarnopol, which was like closer to the Russian border – Ukrainian, but actually it was Russian border, and – about 200 miles or so, and they were put on the trains there.</span> <span id="s504">And from what I know the story, later on that I learned, but only in December, or late November, we got a card from Starobilsk in Ukraine, near Kiev, that a – a – a – a letter – a small – a small card, that they were promised that they could write once a month on the card.</span> <span id="s505">No letters, but just a card.</span> <span id="s506">A-And he wrote to us that some of the friends of ours, friends who are with him, are the friends of the man who was living in – with the apartment above us.</span> <span id="s507">He was the judge of appellate court, and quite well recognized.</span> <span id="s508">And so my father wrote that the friends of Mr. Oyuk(ph) are with us also.</span> <span id="s509">So it’s not only soldiers that were taken prisoner, because reserve was taken, Polish reserve, going into the army, and among the reservists you had doctors and judges and – and all part of this society.</span> <span id="s510">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: And then?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Then there was another couple of let – short cards, that I am all right.</span> <span id="s513">We send some packages.</span> <span id="s514">You could – you could send, I don’t know ho-how many, if my mother send, probably did, because at the beginning of April –</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: 1940 – 19 –</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: – no cause – because they did not come every month –</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: – these cards, so we didn’t know much.</span> <span id="s519">But at beginning of April 1940, came a telegram from couple of officers, to him, and to his friends who were officers of other units, please don’t write to u – to us.</span> <span id="s520">Don’t send any packages or letters, we are being moved in an unknown destination.</span> <span id="s521">About new address, we will let you know.</span> <span id="s522">It was the last thing that we got from my father.</span> <span id="s523">And it was – just happens that it was close to the day, 13th of April, 1940, when the NKVD, that’s the police – Russian police, and some communist, local communist and translator came with – early in the morning and took us – came to us and said, you have half an hour to get up and to get down to the lorry that’s waiting outside to take you by train to Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: Oh my gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: Then I started crying, because I realized – which a – I think I mentioned that I ro – told the story to Allen Paul, who wrote the book about Katyn – at that time, I was 12 years old – at I – that time, I realized that just now, my father is being put into another place, and we are going to Siberia, and that we ge – will get lost, and we’ll never meet.</span> <span id="s526">And I couldn’t – I was really hysterical, almost.</span> <span id="s527">And the man who was interpreter, and also he was the driver of the truck, and he was upstairs, and he was trying to tell me don’t worry, don’t worry, you are going where your father is, so you will see your father there.</span> <span id="s528">And so that somehow made me stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: What was the behavior of those other soldiers who marched in, of the NKVD?</span> <span id="s530">How wa – what was their manner?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Well, first of all, we were undressed.</span> <span id="s532">My brothers were still asleep, because my mother woke me up with the – upstairs there was an – how you call?</span> <span id="s533">Search [indecipherable] house, that we li – the Russians were upstairs, because the – you could hear the –</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: The footsteps.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: – the footsteps, and somehow what we set – search – searching the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: And couple of – like an hour later, Mrs. Oyuk(ph), with her three children, was going down, and called my mother, on – rang the bell.</span> <span id="s538">My mother came to the door – this is like six o’clock in the morning – came to the door, and she said, please, go to church.</span> <span id="s539">Our church – my mother –</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: – Mrs. – Mrs. Oyuk’s mother is usually there.</span> <span id="s542">Please tell her that we are being taken to Siberia.</span> <span id="s543">And went down with the NKVD people.</span> <span id="s544">And about maybe half an hour later, or maybe less, we heard this bang on the door with pistols, or whatever hard things, they kicked the door.</span> <span id="s545">And so we – or, I was awake, because my mother woke me when Mrs. Oyuk(ph) came, and my brothers were still sleeping.</span> <span id="s546">And they came and said, half an hour, get dressed, and take some of the basic things, and get down to the truck.</span> <span id="s547">Unfortunately, my mother somehow panicked.</span> <span id="s548">She didn’t know what – what do you take to Siberia?</span> <span id="s549">What do you take what you have, especially since, you know, after this September month, lot of our food, what we had prepared was gone.</span> <span id="s550">And then also, at that time, we had an influx of communists from the eastern – from the western part of Poland, who came to Lvov.</span> <span id="s551">There were many refugees who came from the western part of Poland.</span> <span id="s552">And the communists, when the – when the Russians came in, organized the rooming places, ordering the people who own the apartment to take all to – not only ordering, sometimes during the night they opened the door and let some people, and said, these are communists, they are going to Russia, they are waiting for their visas, but they’re – you have to take care of them.</span> <span id="s553">They were the refugees, but most of these people were communists who were, as they expressed it, they were waiting to go to paradise, you know, Russian paradise.</span> <span id="s554">So, at that time, the – there was eight men and one woman, a wife of one of them.</span> <span id="s555">And she realized that my mother didn’t know – she wasn’t dressed.</span> <span id="s556">The soldier for bed – forbade my mother to close the bathroom door, that she could dress and no – get all together that we could dress.</span> <span id="s557">And he stood at the door, open door, and they wouldn’t give us any keys to the attic, where we had our luggage, that we could use it.</span> <span id="s558">They were afraid to leave us without the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s559">So the woman who was the wife of this communist from Lódz, I believe, she realized – she took the capes, or covers of a bed, spread out and put some pillows and some clothing.</span> <span id="s560">She opened the shelves of some of the chest – chest of drawers, she took some of the things and threw in, and tied it as a bundle.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: So in other words, your mother was in a state of shock.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s563">But in the sense, how do you know when you suddenly awakened and you are told you have to pack up – for the children, you know, my brothers were – one was 10, and one was seven.</span> <span id="s564">So the small children, you have to – what do you take?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: You think of clothing, or the – a good thing, as an example was that – was our truck, because we had such little things, so few things this woman put for us, although there were two big bundles, but – and we had the small dog, the Chihuahua, little Chihuahua with us, we take.</span> <span id="s567">The first time that I heard this dog to – moaning, when they came in, this dog, the small, you know, kind.</span> <span id="s568">But we were to wait for the – next door was a banker’s family; the wife of a banker and her son, who finished – was just finished high school, about.</span> <span id="s569">I – I don’t think we knew each other very well, we just recognized ourselves at the – were taken on the same truck.</span> <span id="s570">But we waited there two and a half hours, or maybe more.</span> <span id="s571">When – this young man had a good head on his shoulders.</span> <span id="s572">He put vodka in front of these Russian soldiers, on the table, and they started saying, take anything of value; like jewelry, like silver, or things that you can sell in – in – in Russia for – for –</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: Food.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: – food, for anything.</span> <span id="s575">And they really – they filled three-fourths of the [indecipherable] with their baggage for two people, and we had four, and we had just small things.</span> <span id="s576">So, somehow – and also the sa – depended on the people, NKVD people.</span> <span id="s577">There were people – some people realized that this is a mother with the children, and you know, somehow followed orders, or somehow had the human instinct dictate a little bit, the dic – the behavior.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Well, in what way was the human instinct shown?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Well, that this man allowed this young boy to somehow entertain themselves, talking to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: In the meantime, they were advising what she should take, what is possible for her to take.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: For your mother, or for his family?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: No, no, no, this –</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: His family.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: – this family.</span> <span id="s586">We stayed in the –</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: The truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: – on the truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: So we learned there were different – different people also, in helping.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: So – so right after you get this telegram that says we’ll tell you what our address is, you get the knock in the night, or the – now early morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Well, I – it was 13th – the beginning of April, was the telegram.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: The tele – telegram.</span> <span id="s594">And on the 15th –</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: And actually, from what later we learned –</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: – it was the first – fourth or fifth day of April that they started taking people out of the camp, Starobilsk, driving them to another place, where they didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: Where they were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: So do you think that by the time you were deported, your father had already been a –</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: It was when – he might have been in the first group, you know, in the – the – there were close to 4,000 prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: So they did not take all at once, so they were series.</span> <span id="s606">And I don’t know whether he was in first series or – can’t – can’t learn about it.</span> <span id="s607">But we only knew from that man that the chauffeur of – of the truck, he said, don’t cry, don’t cry, you are going where your father is.</span> <span id="s608">You will fe – see your father.</span> <span id="s609">So he – nobody knew, you know, only regular people did not know what the intentions of the Stalin and [indecipherable] were.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: I’d like to follow that thread about your father first, and then we’ll come back to you and the truck.</span> <span id="s611">When was it that you found out a – something about your father’s fate?</span> <span id="s612">At what point was this?</span> <span id="s613">Was this still during the war, or after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: We learned, as the news was spread in 1943 –</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: – when the Germans, going back from Russia, they – they went the one – they almost took Moscow, but then they started withdrawing.</span> <span id="s617">And when they came near Smolensk, which is that Belarus now –</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: Byelorussia, right?</span> <span id="s620">He – they were told by some local people that there was, at one point in 1940, in the spring of 1940, some shooting and – but they couldn’t really see it, because this was on the place where the NKVD had the private houses, they had some, you know, from what I understand, near – and – and the prisoners who were in ca – Katyn, were the prisoners from the [indecipherable] camp my father was in, which was near – in the Byelorussia, near Smolensk.</span> <span id="s621">And my father was taken to Ukraine, on the southern part.</span> <span id="s622">You know, th-they divided the group of people picking up the northern part of – northeastern part of Poles, and the nor – nor – southeastern part of Poles.</span> <span id="s623">And – and they started digging, or they were saying that some dog brought a human bone somewhere.</span> <span id="s624">And the people – but people did not want to say, or somehow kept it in such a way that the Germans started feeling awkward about this – the whole thing.</span> <span id="s625">And they came to a place which was like the to – you planted trees in a very orderly manner, and new grow – growth, and they started digging.</span> <span id="s626">And they opened Katyn.</span> <span id="s627">So the news started on the 13th – can you imagine the coincidence – 13th of April of 1943, when Germany was withdrawing from Russia, the Germans were talking about finding people and giving the names because they had the papers of these people, and they inquired – asked for the international Red Cross, from the people, where some American prisoners of war were being taken and shown it.</span> <span id="s628">There was a very famous person from Italy, who was some scientist, who was asked to be the witness as they were recovering this close to 4,000 bodies lying in there, but – and there was a question, when did it happen?</span> <span id="s629">And the Russians res – in response to that – we are already out of Russia, so we don’t know exactly Russian news, but the Russians are insisting that this is Goebbels’ and Hitler’s policy to break up the friendship between Russia and England, who are now allies.</span> <span id="s630">And they are reading openly on the radio in Kraków and in Warsaw, the names of the people whom they found.</span> <span id="s631">And the people from the international Red Cross – actually was the – more of a French Red Cross, because when Poles wanted international Red Cross, the Russians broke with the Polish émigré government that was staying in London, as the continuous Polish government, independent Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: Yeah, yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: So that started writing books and news spread out.</span> <span id="s634">But by the time ’43 – must have been toward – well, ’40, I was, by then already in Africa, in the camps, but out of Russia, and out of Persia, and in Africa.</span> <span id="s635">So it was – it took another year and a half when I saw a small – not leaflet, a small bic – bulletin, with the pictures of these – of what happened, and – but it was only of Katyn – Katyn, and the names did not bel – not – we did not get the list yet, it took years after.</span> <span id="s636">But from what I understand, this was the only camp that was discovered by the Germans, and that had the name of Katyn, but then afterwards, in 1990, when Perestroika started, Gorbachev brought the letters showing that there were the camps of Starobilsk, which was in Ukraine, and Ostashkov, which was little bit north of Smolensk, where more of a police – Polish police, the pre-war Polish police was there, there were about 6,000 people.</span> <span id="s637">He gave that – that – the Polish people knew what happened to these prisoners of war.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: So does that mean – was your father’s name amongst those in 1990 that you found?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: At that time, yes, there were books.</span> <span id="s640">Already they were printing the – the first – they started printing from what they knew from the Polish sources who was arrested by the Germans – by the Russians.</span> <span id="s641">And probably was only one man who started a book, I don’t remember exactly what, but it was much later that he published the names of the people who were –</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: – that are victims of – of murder, because –</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: I’m – I’m still – I’m sorry to interrupt, but I’m a little confused.</span> <span id="s645">In the mid-1940s, you learn of Katyn, but your father’s name isn’t amongst them.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: Because they did not yet dig up.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s648">Then, for 50 years you don’t know anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: And in 1990, Gorbachev provides additional information.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: Well, with the camps, what happened to the people from the camps, like my father’s camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: That he was taken to Kharkov.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: He was taken to Kharkov.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: And the – they murdered people in Kharkov, NKVD building, and took the bodies to the place, like Plakihatki(ph), which is a small surrounding, supposedly luxurious woods, and dachas, Russian dachas, and that was what later proved to be a big cemetery also for the Ukrainians from the previous persecutions.</span> <span id="s656">And – but at that time, we had the list, because they came with the list, also who was in the ca – in those camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s658">But they came with the lists only after Perestroika, in 1990?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: I suppose so.</span> <span id="s660">That was –</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Okay, so in other words –</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: – only the German – the – we d – didn’t get any documents about other camps.</span> <span id="s663">There were suggestions that near – that some children playing in some small town near Starobilsk found the Polish uniforms, buttons, you – officers’ buttons, and – and – so somehow there was, you know, gossipy kind of things, but sometimes this was built on the truth, but somehow you couldn’t believe it because it was half quiet, you could not repeat that very much.</span> <span id="s664">If you would repeat that, you would probably find yourself in some gulags.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: So the Russians were also – somehow did not touch the subject.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: So did you ever conclusively find out specifically where your father met his end?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: No, when he was on the list of Starobilsk victims who were taken to Kharkov.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: I see, so that’s what the – he was s – he was individually mentioned on that list.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: Right.</span> <span id="s671">As a matter of fact, there was a mistake, they put my father’s name twice, because once they put him as a retired captain, and my mother – this writer, who was putting the names from just the Polish sources, the names who might have been in these camps, he lived in London.</span> <span id="s672">My mother lived in lon – London at the time, in – at the Gorbachev, you know, the 1990.</span> <span id="s673">So, my mother wrote to him that there is a mistake, my – my father was in active duties.</span> <span id="s674">But the – when they crossed – they did not cross his name, so he is twice –</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: – in there; once in reservist, and once – in the retired, and once in the active duty.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: The same person, with the same father and the same mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s680">I want to be able to understand this because it’s still a little confusing.</span> <span id="s681">It’s only in 1990s, I don’t know whether it’s 1990, ’91 or ’92 when Gorbachev releases documents that it is established that your father was from the camp, and he went to Kharkov – he was taken to Kharkov and then he was executed, and he is giv – and it’s on a list that the Russians provide, by name.</span> <span id="s682">Somebody at that point, is writing a book.</span> <span id="s683">A Polish person who is writing a book and it originally has him down as retired, but your mother sees this, and corrects it.</span> <span id="s684">Is the book published?</span> <span id="s685">Is that – does she see –</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: The book was published by [indecipherable] the author was Mischinsky(ph).</span> <span id="s687">He lived – he wa – I think he was an army person too, and he was connected with the Polish government in exile, in London.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: Okay, but my question is: did you get this document from Gorbachev?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: That is, was that sent to the family members?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: No, this was – this was like a public knowledge.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: So you – you were able to see it from someplace and then – and then later you saw it in a book?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: No, not really see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: You never saw it?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: No, he – I had the book written by this man before Gorbachev.</span> <span id="s696">Mr. Mischinsky(ph) was making his assumption, or he had some inkling who was in the camps, from letters, from some –</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: – on – probably connecting with the widows, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: – women, or relatives, and they had the army, probably, in-intelligence.</span> <span id="s701">Army intelligence knew who were most of these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: So did you already have – did you already have an educated guess of where – what had happened to your father, and the document that Gorbachev provided, or the documents that he provided, or the archives that he opened, only confirmed it for sure?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Only confirmed –</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s705">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: – that – that he was in – that the people who died in Kharkov were the people from Starobilsk.</span> <span id="s707">And the people who died – were in Ostashkov, died in Mierdnoya(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: So it’s another place.</span> <span id="s710">So there were three main camps that Gorbachev – beside the first camp that the Germans discovered.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: Because Gorbachev then – and started with the denouncing of Stalin.</span> <span id="s713">At first it was only the – that Stalin did it, but then afterwards it was kind of –</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: – government sponsored murder.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Let’s go back to you’re taken – you’re on the trucks, you’re – you have a neighbor that has more bundles than you do, and what happens to you and your brothers and your mother after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: Well, we’re taken to the station at Lvov, but not the regular train, but the – how you call – trade –</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: Mm-hm, freight train.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: Right.</span> <span id="s720">Where they have cattle trains, or – or standing there long, I would say several trucks with empty car.</span> <span id="s721">But already by that time when we came, because this woman with the – took longer, so it is now probably around 10 o’clock or 11.</span> <span id="s722">As a matter of fact, this was – must have been around that time, because we had a nun who was thrown out by the so – Soviets, threw out the nuns from the nunneries, and monks from the – and they were homeless and without any way to live, and she had – she was a teacher of French, and my mother gave her a job of coming and teaching – teach us French – me, I don’t know whether my brothers participated.</span> <span id="s723">Maybe just halfway.</span> <span id="s724">And she came, and I remember seeing her face.</span> <span id="s725">She was an elderly woman, seeing us on the truck, and surrounded by the NKVD soldiers, and she is just to enter our – our apartment – apartment house, to go up –</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: To teach you.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: – to teach us.</span> <span id="s728">And early – wordless, without a word, watching with a terrible feeling in her face, pained.</span> <span id="s729">So I remember that too, so it must have been about 10 o’clock or 11 when she was coming for lesson, and then we had her eat lunch.</span> <span id="s730">And so, you know, su-supporting all these nuns who were thrown out of the places –</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: – of living, of monasteries.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: So, by the time –</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: And they take ma – the train –</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: – train station.</span> <span id="s737">Chao-Chaotic situation.</span> <span id="s738">Thousands and thousands of people crying, shrieking, calling names, getting lost because at the time it was – if I remember correctly, it was fairly rainy April couple of days.</span> <span id="s739">So the trucks were in between the mud, it was mounted.</span> <span id="s740">And then they – the soldiers, not necessarily NKVD, regular soldiers, probably the army soldiers, were pushing people into the cars.</span> <span id="s741">And it was little bit higher then, you know, not –</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: – you – you didn’t have steps, th-they were pushing, and people were disoriented.</span> <span id="s744">I remember seeing my aunt and her son in one place, but we just – I don’t know whether we waved, but my mother said we – that she waved to us.</span> <span id="s745">She was taken to another train, or another cart.</span> <span id="s746">But anyway, wi – it was so ca – difficult to express, like a tragic situation when you can imagine thousands of people being thrown out of their houses, whether with some luggage, or not luggage, but taken and thrown into this, without knowing what happened, why that happened, and where they are going.</span> <span id="s747">Because we were not given, really, an address or anything.</span> <span id="s748">And we stayed – the – the truck had bank – benches on two ends, three levels.</span> <span id="s749">In the middle was a hole that you could use as a bathroom.</span> <span id="s750">Hole in the wa – in the floor, and the – since it was still fairly cold, there was an – a small iron – how you would say –</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Stove?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: Stove.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: To hold for the heating up, except that we didn’t have – you had to heat it by wood, but we didn’t have enough of wood, and they didn’t bring us wood, but that – that’s beside the point, but we were all crowded.</span> <span id="s755">Some people brought with them a little bit of food, so the first – the first day, all – that was Friday the 13th.</span> <span id="s756">Saturday morning we – the train started, one after another, you could see the lines.</span> <span id="s757">And each one had about 20 tru – 20 –</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Wagons.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: – wagons going.</span> <span id="s760">And then the people started praying, and they started singing religious songs.</span> <span id="s761">And crying, you know, kind of – you know, you could expect the people of – in despair.</span> <span id="s762">So that started our three weeks of travel.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: What was with you and your mother and your brothers?</span> <span id="s764">Were you – did you get a bunk?</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: We got the bunk.</span> <span id="s766">I was on the upper bunk, and below was the – I don’t remember wa – Richard, that son of this woman, the banker’s son, where he was in, because I was on the upper, and was my mother, my brother slept on the third, I think.</span> <span id="s767">I – I really do not – it’s a blank.</span> <span id="s768">But very often I spend the time with Richard, looking through the grated window, small window in the – in the wagon, and, you know, talking and describing.</span> <span id="s769">We were – he was, you know, a young boy, I was 12 years old, but I somehow was interested in many things.</span> <span id="s770">We kept a kind of a friendship on – during that ride.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: Did you describe – do you remember what it is you saw through those slats?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Yeah, the – what we saw were – actually, from what I understand, they – the Russians widened the tracks because Poland had the tracks like western Europe –</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: And Russians had the wide tracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: So once they changed the tracks, we were going through some big cities.</span> <span id="s777">I remember Kiev.</span> <span id="s778">I remember some – some other – if I look at the map, Fufond(ph), and we coming to the Ural mountains and then Magnitogorsk, which is a center of Russian industry, steel industry, and – and then the Omsk and Tomsk.</span> <span id="s779">But this was actually si – at once, they wouldn’t let us – when we were still on the Polish territory, they wouldn’t let us out of that –</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: Wagon.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: – wagon.</span> <span id="s782">And it’s only after some days maybe, when we reached Ukrainian side, they would let us go and relieve ourselves sometimes, but if we were passing a place that there were like bushes around, or – or trees, or [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s783">But otherwise they were, you know, hurry, hurry, hurry, and they would bring – usually toward the end of the day, they would bring us in the pails, some kind of soup which was watery mixed vegetables, and very hard, Russian bread, you know, like –</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: – you don’t want to be hit by it.</span> <span id="s786">It’s a kind of – but still, when you hungry – sometimes you could get it, and sometimes they didn’t get it, and so we were given that, and not every day.</span> <span id="s787">So the people who had some food, brought – like this lady might – might have been advised by these people to take some – some food to take on the train.</span> <span id="s788">So some people were lucky, or had been clear-minded, that they had – I remember my mother said that she left the cooking of the tripes from the previous day, because it’s a two days’ meal that you have to prepare, and I didn’t like it, as a child.</span> <span id="s789">Oh, good thing my mother didn’t take it, because I wouldn’t eat it.</span> <span id="s790">But that was at the beginning.</span> <span id="s791">And then afterwards, one woman had the can of tripes, and she opened it, and she gave it to the children, one spoon each.</span> <span id="s792">And it was so good.</span> <span id="s793">Until I reached – really, I reached America, when some of the Polish people having their parties, and they had the tripes and I could finally feel – and we had also one woman who was quite elderly.</span> <span id="s794">She must have been in her 90s.</span> <span id="s795">She was alone, but she had a nurse taking care of her at – at home.</span> <span id="s796">She was a daughter of some man who lived in our apartment house, above – across from us, who was arrested by – because I – during these months, there were constant arrests, people taken to prisons, all that.</span> <span id="s797">As a matter of fact, on the – December eight, which is my birthday, we visited my uncle, who was retired general, and my aunt was crying.</span> <span id="s798">Why?</span> <span id="s799">Because day before they arrested him and took him to prison.</span> <span id="s800">And as a matter of fact, he was also one of the victims, but of another – in Vicovnya(ph), which recently was opened up on the Russian, near Kiev, that it was the prisoners, who were not prisoners of war, but prisoners who were taken to full prisons.</span> <span id="s801">When the – Germany attacked Russia, Russians were in panic, and were taking all trains and all the families, because they had moved the families back to Poland.</span> <span id="s802">And so they didn’t have enough room to take prisoners to Russia, and they would shoot the prisoners and throw them through the windows of the – of the prison, and from what I know from eyewitnesses, that they were one level, or two levels high, dead bodies, the Russians killed some of the things.</span> <span id="s803">And I know that was – Brigitki was the name of the prison.</span> <span id="s804">And my uncle was in Brigitki, but I – of course, we didn’t know these things, because by then when – when Germany attacked Russia, we were already in Russia, in Kazakhstan, so we were too far, so we didn’t know what was happening.</span> <span id="s805">But anyway –</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: There was an old woman on the train who had a nurse –</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: And her son was arrested, and many, many more people who were owners of land, who were rich shop owners, who were intelligence, or who were –</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Intelligentsia, you mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: Intelligentsia was, of course, who – the enemies of the Soviet society.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Were there any Jewish people on the trains?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: Yes, there were Jewish people too, it’s – because Polish society, in a sense, was very much [indecipherable] about 10 percent of pole – Poles – Poland were the Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s812">In the eastern part of Poland, they were most in small shtetls.</span> <span id="s813">They were mostly Orthodox Hasidic Jews who did not assimilate.</span> <span id="s814">But they were mostly in Lvov, in the cities.</span> <span id="s815">Many people had great many friends, which wasn’t – depended, of course, on the individuals, but they were also the enemies of the societies, some lawyers, some doctors were taken into the camp.</span> <span id="s816">I didn’t – this woman, the banker’s wife was Jewish and Richard was Jewish.</span> <span id="s817">But that was somehow an – just occurred to me later on that they must have been Jewish because of – for some reason, I don’t know what made me think about it, that – that I – somebody said that the father was Jewish, so I thought that the family was Jewish.</span> <span id="s818">But they were on the same – in the same truck, and there were some of them taken, although there was also a lot of these people like this, who were located in our apartment, who were waiting to go to Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: Some free on the – you know, getting to – to the paradise –</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: – of – of, you know humanity paradise, or whatever they call it.</span> <span id="s823">So some of the Jews, in great numbers, escaped to Russia and stayed throughout the war.</span> <span id="s824">Some of them returned to Poland after the war.</span> <span id="s825">But they were saying about hundreds of – hundreds of thousands of people who landed in Russia, but some of them landed as we did land –</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: That’s – they were deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: – as Polish citizens.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: As the Polish citizens.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: I want to go back to when you were talking about hunger on the train, and a woman who opens the tripe can and gives children a – you mentioned something about an old woman –</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: – and we didn’t finish about –</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: Oh yes, I’m sorry, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: That’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: And what I remember, she was already s-senile, and she kept on crying, water, water, water.</span> <span id="s836">She wanted a drink, and we didn’t have too much of that luxury.</span> <span id="s837">And with her the situation was different because this woman was not her relative.</span> <span id="s838">But when the NKVD came to take her, they wouldn’t take her as a nurse.</span> <span id="s839">She said, I am her cousin.</span> <span id="s840">Then they took her on – that she swore that she is her cousin, to take care of this woman.</span> <span id="s841">So she went willingly –</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: – to take care of this woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: And she survived this three weeks of train.</span> <span id="s846">Three weeks of – there were – we were aware, but not in our wagon, people who died.</span> <span id="s847">So the Russians threw them out while the trains were going.</span> <span id="s848">There were children who were born, and died, and – but not in our wagon.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: Wagon.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: And then we arrived on the first of May at Zhangiztobe.</span> <span id="s851">We went through the Ural mountains, Omsk and Tomsk, and then Novosibirsk, if you know a map, from Novosibirsk, which in my eyes was beautifully lighted and was considered a showplace of – the Soviets were showing off, and we were not allowed, of course, to walk on the station.</span> <span id="s852">And stayed there for several hours, and then we went down to Semipalatinsk, which is entering the Kazakhstan.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: And we came to Zhangiztobe, which is about 200 or maybe more miles after Semipalatinsk, but this is same part, Tinskaya(ph) Oblast(ph).</span> <span id="s855">And fro – we came there, and as the lorries from the previous transport, previous train came, and people were removed on the trucks, taken into the distance, and were on the trucks.</span> <span id="s856">But when it came to our transport, they did not have any trucks left.</span> <span id="s857">So they waited for the Cossacks with the – with the carts, to be driven by oxen, and take us into the distance.</span> <span id="s858">And we were on these trucks for – I – I think around 10 days, or eight days and eight nights.</span> <span id="s859">And as a matter of fact, this old lady, fell – the – that – the cart – when – one of the carts, when we were traveling, went through the river, there were no bridges, but the cart wheels broke on the river – within the river, and she fell into the river, with her things.</span> <span id="s860">People saved her, put her back on truck.</span> <span id="s861">She came later on to – to the place where they dropped us, and lived for another weeks, and died there.</span> <span id="s862">Not knowing – she was asking her nurse, did you – did you correspond with the hotel where we are going to stay?</span> <span id="s863">Because she didn’t know.</span> <span id="s864">She knew she was going somewhere.</span> <span id="s865">And did you know what is it, the name of the place where we are going?</span> <span id="s866">Because she – she – before the war, she traveled a lot, she was very – probably a fairly rich family, so she was thinking she is going for a ride.</span> <span id="s867">So imagine this woman, who took care of her, went with her.</span> <span id="s868">And when the woman died, she put in a small – a small cemetery, what they made at the time, in the Cossacks – mostly Cossack collective farms.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: But that’s the kolkhoz.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: Russian collective farms are sovkhoz.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: But collective farms kolkhoz belongs to the people who are – these were mostly Kazaks, Kazakhstan, and few elderly Russian families.</span> <span id="s875">And this woman, a younger woman, and – when the – like through the [indecipherable] so long ago I can’t – I wouldn’t recognize her, of course.</span> <span id="s876">She escaped from there, she almost got back to Poland, and she was caught, and she was bought bra – back.</span> <span id="s877">She was innocent, helping this woman, old woman.</span> <span id="s878">She escaped because she had actually –</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: She had done her job, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: – somehow sh – I – you know, she – she should have been too, she didn’t – she didn’t do anything against the Russians, or e – but she wasn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: Well, nobody did.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: Nobody did.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: But you know, but being intelligentsia, or being the family of army – of army – of – or family of – of police, or intelligent, or in the jury – so you had –</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: In the court system, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: Right, the system was completely, you know, you belong to somebody, to who – just –</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: And she was a nurse, and not elderly, I would say she must have been in her late 30s or 40s.</span> <span id="s889">And she escape by foot.</span> <span id="s890">Somehow she got – she paid somebody truck – somebody on the – on the people – Cossacks who took her to the station.</span> <span id="s891">We were about 200 miles from this Zhangiztobe station from which they drove us.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s893">So what happened then?</span> <span id="s894">Where did you land, what did you have to do?</span> <span id="s895">Did anybody by that point explain why you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: No.</span> <span id="s897">No, there was no explanation.</span> <span id="s898">You don’t have the – you – you deal with the – with the unseen situation who accuses you of what, you don’t know.</span> <span id="s899">We didn’t feel guilty about anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">End of File One</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Beginning File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: – they dropped us into the public place, like a cover – not covadai – like a meeting place of that kolkhoz, a-and we had na – some people had the blankets, and they separated each other, we had the floor to sleep on, and there were no beds, nothing.</span> <span id="s903">And for privacy, among about, I don’t know, 25 or 30 families were left there.</span> <span id="s904">Some other people were taken into another kolkhoz.</span> <span id="s905">So we sa –</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: So you were on this collective farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: Collect – some of kolkhoz –</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: – right.</span> <span id="s910">Second day, the minister – not the minister, president of kolkhoz, the Cossacks comes, you have to go to work, my mother.</span> <span id="s911">Didn’t say anything to me or my brothers, but you stay home, and your mother has to go to work.</span> <span id="s912">And they took women, whatever age they were, adult women, to work.</span> <span id="s913">It was making bricks by mixing the soil with – with some drippings from the cows, because this was a kolkhoz that was taking care of the cows.</span> <span id="s914">And the milk and butter was being sent to the – to the government, or to the whatever it was, but they had their portion to th – to give to the government.</span> <span id="s915">And if it was left anything, after the harvest, so a year of work, after the harvest you would get something if the harvest was –</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: – good.</span> <span id="s918">But we were free labor.</span> <span id="s919">I mean, we were slaves who came.</span> <span id="s920">We couldn’t get anything and we didn’t have any savings of food or anything by this three weeks of not – traveling on that train.</span> <span id="s921">So most of the things at – at first there was a ration and some Cossacki(ph) people who liked to trade in.</span> <span id="s922">For example, you could go and sell a blouse, or like my mother sold my nighty.</span> <span id="s923">I had pink nighty, and a white with some pink flowers.</span> <span id="s924">And for that we got a hen that was sitting on the eggs, 10 eggs, which was the best bargain we had because the eggs broke and we had small chicken.</span> <span id="s925">And so later on, my mother would take one of the chicken when it grew, to ask some Russian to kill that –</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: And then you’d have some food.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: – and we had some food.</span> <span id="s928">But otherwise, there was no shops to buy any food.</span> <span id="s929">They – not even for the communists who were there, they probably had something –</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: So where did you keep the chicken?</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: Well, outside is where the – we were, at first, living on the – in the small – they put us with the older Russian family, where she had – she had one room, and we had another room.</span> <span id="s932">There was an entrance, and on the other side of entrance was one cow, her old cow that wasn’t giving milk any more because it was old cow, and the yard.</span> <span id="s933">We lived in –</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: Oh, so you were moved from the central place where you slept on the floor –</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: – into this one room.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: Well, this is like a village.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: Yeah, got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: So in the village we were spread out among local people.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: Mostly the Russian.</span> <span id="s942">The Cossacks kept to themselves, and they spoke – we didn’t speak Cossacks, and – and –</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: They spoke the Mongolian.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: Did your mother speak Russian?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: No.</span> <span id="s947">Not enough.</span> <span id="s948">That – that was one of the difficulties.</span> <span id="s949">Some people who had spoken Russian, and were enough, so somehow either met some Russian who said you could come here, maybe be a teacher or something, but it – this was too small a village for a very differentiated society.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: So some people somehow, I don’t know how, met some Russian who would say well, why don’t you give like in case of our friends, with whom he still lives in Warsaw, I visit him.</span> <span id="s952">He was any – anyway, he – he was told to the woman, who spoke beautiful Russian because she was born in Saint Petersburg before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: And she was from quite a semi-aristocratic family, her language was beautiful.</span> <span id="s955">But then somehow this – by people who were passing the – the place, or somehow, he said, give your son, he will be helping me with my farm.</span> <span id="s956">Because they – some people had the smaller –</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: – or bigger farm.</span> <span id="s959">Small farms, which were also part of this, but a little bit outside.</span> <span id="s960">And so – and she herself was given a post in the county seat where she was working because she knew Russian.</span> <span id="s961">And think that were – saved him, and saved – so for few months, or I don’t know how long, they were in that co – in that village with us.</span> <span id="s962">But several people slowly were moving.</span> <span id="s963">They either let them go, or somebody –</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: So, with your mother, she was making the bricks – you know, she was having to make those bricks.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: And you were alone with your brothers back at the house, back at the little room?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: Back bu – in the room, in the outside.</span> <span id="s968">It’s like in the village, open –</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: Did you do anything?</span> <span id="s970">Did you – did they send you to school?</span> <span id="s971">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: Well, it’s – when I was – by then I was 13 and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: Well, it sounds to me if you were doing – if you were born in 1926, and you’re deported in 1940 –</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: Forty, so I was t –</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: – you must have been 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: – only 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: Yeah, 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: And I became th-th –</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: Fourteen?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: – 13 and coming to 14 still.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: Got it, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: And I was told that I can go and be a shepherdess for calves, because the policy of that village was that the cows were separated from the – the young ones, because they would not drink milk.</span> <span id="s983">Milk was necessary as a selling thing for the government.</span> <span id="s984">So the calves had to go somewhere else on the – to eat grass, to be sent out, to be shepherded.</span> <span id="s985">And we – when we arrived, as you might know, Kazakhstan in that place is steppe.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: Miles and miles and miles of steppe [indecipherable] special places.</span> <span id="s988">So we would take about a hundred cows.</span> <span id="s989">At first I was one, and there was another – another boy, bigger, and actually there was this boy who went to – to the other – was taken by this man from here.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: Right, right, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: Private work.</span> <span id="s992">And then was my brother, at one point.</span> <span id="s993">And we would take, at five o’clock in the morning, and push this – these animals, and somehow we managed.</span> <span id="s994">We – we slept sometimes in the [indecipherable] then – then around noontime, they would lie down and chew like, you know, the normal things after the eating, they –</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: – have to chew.</span> <span id="s997">And sometimes when it was hot, or it was terrible for us, incidents, there were.</span> <span id="s998">One of them, they said they – they got a – a bite of a special fly.</span> <span id="s999">And then, if it was an – like a leader of this group, of this hundred, there were several big – bigger cows, and several small cows.</span> <span id="s1000">He would raise his tail and start running.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: So if it got bit by this fly, then it runs, and then everything fol – everyone follows?</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: Anyone follows.</span> <span id="s1003">And we were told we were allo – allowed – permitted to let them go through the fields where they had some wheat, or where they had corn, because they would damage it.</span> <span id="s1004">So when they run, we run, and then we had to gather them again.</span> <span id="s1005">I remember that was – kind of things.</span> <span id="s1006">I remember when I was reading the book I got somewhere from package, because packages could come at that time, from Lvov.</span> <span id="s1007">I got some package, or somebody lent me a book, and I come back from this running, rounding them up, back to the place where we are supposed to stay, and got eating – started eating the book.</span> <span id="s1008">And then, I am trying to catch him, and I run and he keeps running.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: He wants to learn to read.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s1011">To swallow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: To swallow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: Anyway, these were first.</span> <span id="s1014">Then my mother had different job, doing keezhak(ph).</span> <span id="s1015">Did you heard of word keezhak(ph)?</span> <span id="s1016">Since it is the steppes, there are no woods.</span> <span id="s1017">You cannot buy any wood to burn, and the – and of course, there’s no coal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: The burning – the material for burning was the old drippings of the cows, that you mix with straw and water.</span> <span id="s1020">And they have big puddles, like this room, or even bigger, where the women were wal-walking around with their legs, mixing it up.</span> <span id="s1021">Keezhaks(ph).</span> <span id="s1022">For the people who were running the kolkhoz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: So that means it was the fuel to heat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: That’s what it became?</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: You could not – or, of course you could not participate in this local thing for the government, but what we did, we would go, and – and when we were walking with our calves, we saw where the cows went.</span> <span id="s1027">The cows were usually very much further.</span> <span id="s1028">By the times we would pass, it was dry so we were picking dry –</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: Dung.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: – drippings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: Yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: Dung.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: And bringing them.</span> <span id="s1035">And you could put it as – on this – in the, not oven, but in the – in the kitchen, in the fireplace.</span> <span id="s1036">And under – you know, they had –</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: And it could heat a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: Little heat from that, that was the only thing.</span> <span id="s1039">Because otherwise the – the bush, that was very prickly bush that la –</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: – grows in the steppe, is very difficult to really burn for long – it – it’s just like a – a eagle – the needle trees that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: – have needles.</span> <span id="s1044">They just jump –</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: – into fire, and quickly die.</span> <span id="s1047">So the other things what you had to find have, you know, piles of these, and that you fed that.</span> <span id="s1048">And my mother was doing –</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: Oh my gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: – with – with the other ladies, mum – one of the thing that was funny wa – from that, with my mother was funny, they were talking about the recipes for cakes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: As they’re pounding this dung.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: On the – how to take your mind off your job.</span> <span id="s1053">So this was one job.</span> <span id="s1054">There was another one where there was a big dug up well for the cows were – were close – some – some places where my mother was taken with some other women, to clean this well, because the – it was dug in the soil, it was not a real well, it was just a spot where they kept water.</span> <span id="s1055">But when the cows were walking down, they were pushing this soil in, so it had a lot of sediment.</span> <span id="s1056">So my mother was one of those who were standing up to the waist in the water, getting by pails the sediment, pushing to another woman who was taking the sediment, to have a clear water for cows to drink.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: Oh my gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: Then during the harvest, when the – that was a year later, and ow – the winter, the – the snow that was two meters high, that was constant, constant snow falling and cold weather, except that it was dry climate, so you didn’t feel that much of the cold, as much as there was a lot of snow.</span> <span id="s1059">The only thing, the Buran that came – Buran was the name of the wind, special winter wind that brought the snow.</span> <span id="s1060">You couldn’t see – almost you couldn’t see your hand, it was so thick.</span> <span id="s1061">But also, because if you walked out, you got lost.</span> <span id="s1062">So the people, to get – to go into real well, that was in the middle of the – you know, a group of houses, had to tie themselves by rope to go it – and to come back.</span> <span id="s1063">Otherwise they would not –</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: They’d get lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: – get back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: That was winter.</span> <span id="s1068">But then there was spring, and there was the harvest.</span> <span id="s1069">And in the harvest my mother was working with the big combine.</span> <span id="s1070">I don’t know whether that’s a word in English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: The big complicated things, with they sort the wheat from the chaff, and things, and my mother was working somehow.</span> <span id="s1073">She developed a cold – cough, constant cough.</span> <span id="s1074">From what I can guess, that at that time, she covered her face with the napkin, but the napkin was full of the small pieces of wheat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A: That probably got into her lungs there forever afterwards –</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: She coughed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: – probably, she was coughing.</span> <span id="s1079">But that – that wa-wa – was her work.</span> <span id="s1080">And it –</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: But her p – your poor mother, I mean, to imagine that she loses her husband, she has to take care of three children, she doesn’t know where her husband is.</span> <span id="s1082">She had never worked in such ways before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1084">The woman could not understand.</span> <span id="s1085">Like she had to paint – some of the houses you painted by making straw with some soil, with some dung also –</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: – and you painted with your hands.</span> <span id="s1088">All the floors were the dirt floors, there was no wooden floors.</span> <span id="s1089">And they would say, what kind of a housewife you were when you don’t know how to put the floor, the things?</span> <span id="s1090">Like, this was somehow ridiculous, but this is what you said, how sensitive you are.</span> <span id="s1091">When I – during – when I wrote the book – helped Allen Paul write the book, there was some presentation of the book, and he asked – and he – there is story of my family and other two or three families, more detailed.</span> <span id="s1092">And he, Allen Paul, asked us to speak.</span> <span id="s1093">We were in Washington, and several senators came, and Polish, you know, consulate – consul and officials listened for it, and so I was started saying how we were taken to Russia and that.</span> <span id="s1094">And then at one point, I said, I have to stop here, suddenly, and stopped this, what I’m talking about, and turn to real heroes of this thing.</span> <span id="s1095">Imag – now that I am a mother, because back then, it was in 1990 something, I already had five children.</span> <span id="s1096">Now that I am a mother, I can understand the tragedy of a mother who is – doesn’t know where her – food for her children comes, where she could exchange something for some food.</span> <span id="s1097">You could, for a blouse you could get three potatoes, or some – toward the end, the Russians themselves were hungry, so they would give us a first chaff of wheat.</span> <span id="s1098">So we burned the chaff on top of the stove that was iron, and put in the water, so the water had the taste, and that was our soup that we ate.</span> <span id="s1099">And these things happened, and I – I didn’t say exactly at that time, but I mean, this was a woman who, as you say, lost her husband, taken to unknown country, thrown into un – inhuman conditions, and sees her children crying of hunger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: And what to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: And what to do?</span> <span id="s1102">And not knowing what happened to her husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: So that the – this were us – really the heroes for all – children did not – fortunately did not realize how hard things were, how the world is not made of nice stories that you are used to, but situations are different.</span> <span id="s1105">So children somehow are more – somehow get accustomed to take the best of what situation is, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: That’s one of the things that helps kids survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: I want to pause just for a second.</span> <span id="s1109">[technical discussion] Okay, we’re rolling.</span> <span id="s1110">So the harvest ends –</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: The harvest ends.</span> <span id="s1112">The local people who belong to that kolkhoz get their parts, what they earned, according to some – their judgments.</span> <span id="s1113">But we, of course, don’t get anything, except that during the year they would give us milk, which was taken – cream, they would take off the milk the – how you call it, the plain –</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: – milk, because that you could not hold until harvest, so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Well, this is what I wanted to ask you, whether or not the milk that the cows gave you ever got any of it.</span> <span id="s1117">So, you were allowed to have some milk from the cows.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: When we came home –</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: – we would get some milk to take to our home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: That was the – I don’t know how much it was.</span> <span id="s1123">I remember that I tried once to get milk from that old cow, and nothing came.</span> <span id="s1124">Had – anyway, the winter started, and they said that the – because the harvest was not really poor, but they would somehow let the horsed – the horses who were waiting with the carts to take the wheat to the magazines in the big cities, or wherever they were taking, eat the wheat while waiting.</span> <span id="s1125">So what was left, they still had to put the taxed amount to the government, and what was left, so very – I think they brought it on themselves to a certain degree, that they didn’t have too much to share.</span> <span id="s1126">And then they told my mother they would not have work during the winter for women, and during the spring.</span> <span id="s1127">So they ordered my mother to go to the county hou – hun – county place, which was about 25 or maybe 30 miles away, into Kokpekti, which is like Hackensack here, or whatever, and – to find a job.</span> <span id="s1128">They allowed her to take my younger brother, but they kept my brother – older brother and myself as the kind of security that my mother will not run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: Well, this is something that I wanted to ask now.</span> <span id="s1130">When you were in this place, I don’t hear anything about guards, I don’t hear anything about jailers, or any kind of authorities, or any –</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: Is a – they called it free prison.</span> <span id="s1132">You could not leave that place.</span> <span id="s1133">For example, the post office was in the next village, bigger kolkhoz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: To go there, if we wou – at the beginning were getting some letters or packages from Lvov, because the rush – the – Germany did not start yet the war.</span> <span id="s1136">And we had something, they would let us know that there is a letter waiting.</span> <span id="s1137">And to go for it, my mother had to walk several miles, or get some – some kind Cossack would take him – her on the truck – on the truck, on the cart, and take her to that – or sometimes she was – she had to ask the permission, written.</span> <span id="s1138">And I even have here some –</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: Of her letter – of her permission list –</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: She wrote on the piece – on the – with the pencil –</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: – written you – I can still read it, there’s a kind of permission that my mother can go to the village to – to the post office, and come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: And one day my mother was so afraid because the predsedatel, that’s pres – political president of what was Russian, and ultra, ultra-communist ga – was away, and my mother couldn’t get the permit to go out.</span> <span id="s1145">And so she went without a permit, and she was coming back, carrying a package which was I don’t know how many, maybe 10 pounds or something.</span> <span id="s1146">Was very tired, but she was more afraid than – than tired, but – because if they catch her, and they would take her to prison, what will happen to us?</span> <span id="s1147">And she said, she had lived it, several miles that she had to walk, with such trepidation –</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">A: – that she might be caught, and that she somehow let us down, that she would be taken to prison.</span> <span id="s1150">But fortunately, something like that did not happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: But the fear was in her, the price was in her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: Yeah, you can imagine, because –</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: – she knew like – and y-you know, the – the places outside this town, the roads were probably cart driven roads, and not the regular highways or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: It was all empty steppes.</span> <span id="s1157">You could go by train, and s – hours and days, and it was all empty.</span> <span id="s1158">So somehow you didn’t – even if you tried to move somewhere, where would you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: So my mother was sent to that town, and she st – that was sometime toward the beginning of winter, so probably they took us from this place where this old woman gave us a piece of – to stay with – corner of the – of her up – house, and put us in an empty house that didn’t have window, had only paper on the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: – wall, and the – it was so cold, we didn’t have any burning things by then.</span> <span id="s1163">In the winter we couldn’t go behind the house –</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: – and get anything to heat.</span> <span id="s1166">So we slept in our coats.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: And in the morning, the water that we kept to wash down, was all solid ice.</span> <span id="s1169">But they – then my mother started – got the job as a janitor in some children’s home [indecipherable] hou-house, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: An orphanage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: Orphanage, or also the – sometimes they took the children probably from – from streets, or something.</span> <span id="s1172">Anyway, she got the job, she was writing to this, let me have my children.</span> <span id="s1173">And this predsedatel said no, we have too few horses, and they’re needed here to shove the snow, or whatever, work a little bit in farm, and I can – we’ll – well, no.</span> <span id="s1174">No, no, no, until late March.</span> <span id="s1175">And there was something else that happened, that somehow it was almost, you know, for the normal situation in life, difficult to understand or feel, or react to.</span> <span id="s1176">We had the [indecipherable] among these women who stayed first, who came, there were two women: one was with the small child, the other was with – alone, a fairly well-educated.</span> <span id="s1177">She was, I think, a nurse, or some advanced, super nurse.</span> <span id="s1178">And she had a lo – she was lucky to get a lot of jewelry.</span> <span id="s1179">And she was also getting the jewelry from this woman and the other one would hire the Cossacks with the cart, to take them to a distant cit – town.</span> <span id="s1180">Not city, a town, where they had so-called zwartaz(ph) kupka(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: What’s that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: Selling the gold that the government wanted.</span> <span id="s1183">So they would take the things, and then you could buy – they had cans of food.</span> <span id="s1184">So I know my mother gave her wedding ring, and some – bracelet, I think.</span> <span id="s1185">And that was all, she didn’t have much on her.</span> <span id="s1186">But anyway, these women, after several months, not working – not going like my mother was going to work at the farm – were accused by this predsedatel that they were parasite [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: That they were speculeg – speculating.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: Speculating, and they are not working.</span> <span id="s1189">In Russia, if you don’t work, you don’t eat.</span> <span id="s1190">That’s the Russian.</span> <span id="s1191">[speaks Russian]</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: [Speaks Russian]</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: Yeah, and so they were arrested, they were parasite, because they were living – oh, first they sold their things, and then they would buy from some –</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: – women who had something, like my mother gave her ring, and they would go and bring some food, or maybe – I don’t remember if we got an – what we got for that wedding ring, but anyway, these women were arrested while my – and were kept in the prison in that town where my mother was now, with my younger brother.</span> <span id="s1196">And the Polish people who lived around there learned that there is going to be a judgment on them, they were going to be sentenced for whatever.</span> <span id="s1197">And my mother tells me the story because they were watching this thing carefully.</span> <span id="s1198">The women were given seven years of hard labor in gulag, each.</span> <span id="s1199">And they came out of the courtroom, and there stood this predsedatel, so thinking, you know, here I am a hero, defending the Soviet society from these parasites.</span> <span id="s1200">Here you – you have proof that I was right.</span> <span id="s1201">And somebody asked in Russian, asked these women, what do you think about now, about the predsedatel, the situation and the predsedatel?</span> <span id="s1202">She said well, God is not speedy, but he is just.</span> <span id="s1203">And this man, you know, did – before, he was laughing at us when he saw a praying book, or some people praying or something, singing a religious song, he was laughing that there is no God, and all this kind of thing what the – he was taught.</span> <span id="s1204">And so he returned home.</span> <span id="s1205">Two weeks, or maybe three weeks, this is past hard winter, it’s already now into spring, but it’s still winter, it might be February, or so.</span> <span id="s1206">He – his child gets the measles.</span> <span id="s1207">His beloved older son, 10 years old or something, eight or 10 years old.</span> <span id="s1208">And the measles doesn’t come to forward, but open, you know, breaks out inside the system, and the child dies.</span> <span id="s1209">And this man turns himself into completely different man.</span> <span id="s1210">He remembers what this person said, that God is not really speedy in punishing, or whatever, but he is just.</span> <span id="s1211">And he looked at it as God’s warning, or something, and he started going to the Poles to ask about God, who is God, what do you believe, and something.</span> <span id="s1212">And then one day, in the evening, toward the end of March, he came to us, that’s room with already was little bit warmer, but still – we were still not quite [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: You were cold, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: – right.</span> <span id="s1215">He said, gather up whatever you have, and I’ll come at night and take my horse and take you to your mother.</span> <span id="s1216">And he drove me and my brother, with all the belongings that was with us, by night, to Kokpekti, to that city where my mother was working.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: And this was on – on – you – you – you could not explain.</span> <span id="s1219">In the normal circumstances you don’t have it.</span> <span id="s1220">But this was something like – like the, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: It’s almost like a –</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: – protection.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: It’s almost like a biblical tale.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: Y-Y-You cannot assume, but we had – my mother always prayed, we had, every evening before, we had always knelt down and said our prayers, and my mother was – she was not, I would say devote – devout, but she was religious enough, and she had the hope that God will not let us down.</span> <span id="s1227">Which I think now, talking about the hope, I think the hope is the most important thing.</span> <span id="s1228">Love is not only the thing that keeps you alive, hope is the thing that keeps you alive.</span> <span id="s1229">Because you hope tomorrow will be better, tomorrow will be better.</span> <span id="s1230">Can’t be any worse, tomorrow will be better.</span> <span id="s1231">Love sometimes could not save you, but hope could save you because you went through very difficult moments, you were hungry, and maybe tomorrow somebody will give you a piece bread.</span> <span id="s1232">I would go babysitting sometimes, to the Cossacks families.</span> <span id="s1233">The child was in a small – I don’t know how you call it, it was almost like a – like a basket near the roof.</span> <span id="s1234">The baby was there, and if the baby cried, you pulled the string, and he dropped a little bit [indecipherable] stop.</span> <span id="s1235">The parents were there having friends eating, and having their corner, laughing, or whatever, in Cossack’s la-language.</span> <span id="s1236">But then afterwards, when I was going home, I would get a piece of bread, or actually a – sometimes it was in the Russian families, the Russians had bread.</span> <span id="s1237">But the Cossacks had kind of like pita bread, because they had baked them.</span> <span id="s1238">And they would give me one, and I would come home, wouldn’t eat there, come, divide it into four pieces, and then like, the animals who are hungry – if you see the animals who are hungry, each one takes a piece of big things, and goes to a small corner and eats by himself.</span> <span id="s1239">And this is such an intuitive feeling, that we did the same thing.</span> <span id="s1240">To take a small, one quarter of this piece, and go, and by crumbs eating, prolonging it, and eating.</span> <span id="s1241">And it was somehow so neither – you know, the nature of – of –</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: Of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: How – how did things progress?</span> <span id="s1245">Somehow now, have you – in what you’re describing, has more than a year gone by –</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: – has it been a year and a half?</span> <span id="s1248">How long were you in this place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: In Kokpekti?</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">A: We were there – this is March would – we came.</span> <span id="s1252">The spring –</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">Q: March 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: March 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">A: And then there is – my mother worked at that place, and I think there was sometimes some Russian food that you could get, I think.</span> <span id="s1257">And still, the exchange of things, or services, like we were – my brother and myself considered ourselves professional shepherds.</span> <span id="s1258">So we – because this was a town, it was not the farm, but many of the women had the cows, one cow in some side of the houses or something.</span> <span id="s1259">And we went around and if they had the calf, we said, we will set a small herd of cows, and we will go into the steppes – because it doesn’t belong to anybody, we could do it, and take it – but somehow we did – it fell through, but anyway, my brother was taken by – he was then 12 years old, and he was taken by the – some Russian people who were building the train things to – to go and be – you know, go-getter, or some – how do you call it?</span> <span id="s1260">Help out with the small duties –</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: A gopher.</span> <span id="s1262">A gopher.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: A – a gopher for – for these people, so he would go for a week, or sometimes longer.</span> <span id="s1264">And wa – the – the younger brother stayed with us, and my mother – my mother was working.</span> <span id="s1265">I-I – it – it seemed also a lot of – there were other Polish, many more Polish families, so we sometimes would gather a-and, you know, had evenings like telling stories, or singing together, or sometimes gathering together.</span> <span id="s1266">But otherwise I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1267">I didn’t work there.</span> <span id="s1268">The only good thing was also very unusual thing, some stri – sort of difficult to pr – assume that it happens.</span> <span id="s1269">When we were going from door to door, about our ad – possibilities of being hired, and we s – entered some very elegant buildings by there – of – there were office buildings and elegant people were walking, then we were – in a sense, we could walk wherever we wanted.</span> <span id="s1270">We were not, you know, watched out, that you couldn’t go there, or couldn’t go there, just walk.</span> <span id="s1271">And we knocked, thinking that we would find somebody.</span> <span id="s1272">As it happened, a door opened, very elegant, intelligent man – what happened, engineer, who was working on these trains, or some other big jobs, and he’s one of the head persons.</span> <span id="s1273">And he couldn’t give us a calf to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: – but he started asking us – first of all, the Russians, of course, did not know about these people, you know, we were looked at no – you know how in – in Russia you don’t ask questions, first of all.</span> <span id="s1276">So if they drop a group of people, so the Cossacks don’t si – first of all, don’t speak Russian, and they don’t know much about the outside world.</span> <span id="s1277">They don’t know about the war, they don’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s1278">So he started asking how come you found yourself here?</span> <span id="s1279">You are Polish, and started asking us question.</span> <span id="s1280">He gave us some candy, and he said – he send us, later on, send us some bread or something, to my mother.</span> <span id="s1281">And for months afterward, from time to time – and for example, there were some passing engineers, through the town.</span> <span id="s1282">So he would send them to my mother so she could make a cof – tea, or set – tea was the only thing that we – brick tea.</span> <span id="s1283">You – I don’t know whether you would realize.</span> <span id="s1284">It was a pressed tea by bricks, and it was more –</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: Concentrated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: It’s a concentrated –</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: – leaves, pressed together like hard leave.</span> <span id="s1289">And they were very valued, especially by Cossacks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">A: They would take a small –</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q: Piece.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">A: – break an small, put in the water.</span> <span id="s1294">And take it – after they drink water, they put it in the next one because it was so tight.</span> <span id="s1295">Anyway, a – so when he would send us something, he – somebody who was passing by, to ask for tea, to ask my mother to make tea, also giving a chance that maybe we have something that can sell.</span> <span id="s1296">I remember my moth – my father’s attaché –</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: Case.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: – case, my mother sold to one of these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: Engineers, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: And I don’t know whether it was some money, but there were some shops, although they had the shops, once a months, the sugar would come.</span> <span id="s1301">Once a month, salt would come.</span> <span id="s1302">And the restaurant was always surrounded by the local people.</span> <span id="s1303">If they killed a camel, or, you know, th-they didn’t have really killing the cows, because that was not th-the – in that city, I don’t know what actually was trading, in that sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">A: But you couldn’t get, sometimes, to that restaurant, or – the woman who had – one of these two woman that had the gold, that was selling, she was sending her son to beg when Russians were eating.</span> <span id="s1306">So he would go around and beg for – for food.</span> <span id="s1307">We – I know that we didn’t – my brother and – and I did not feel like doing it, but that I remember, that that was the only way to get some food.</span> <span id="s1308">And so this man was helping us, from time to time sending some o – fish, or something like – like that.</span> <span id="s1309">And always asking us to come and tell him how we are.</span> <span id="s1310">My mother was, at one point very sick.</span> <span id="s1311">She had heart problem, and she had kidney problem, whatever.</span> <span id="s1312">And the doctor told us that she cannot drink too much water, because of the heart, to have not too much water for – so the lungs would not fill with water.</span> <span id="s1313">But then we would get this chaff of wheat from somebody for doing something for that woman, or selling something small.</span> <span id="s1314">I really – sometimes the packages yet – packages are still coming.</span> <span id="s1315">They would send us rice, they would send us fat, the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: Lard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: – lard.</span> <span id="s1318">Which was very much appreciated by Russians.</span> <span id="s1319">Cossacks –</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: Not so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: – they’re Mohammedans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: They would not look at it.</span> <span id="s1324">But you could sell these things that came.</span> <span id="s1325">And that, somehow, from day to day we, still hoping that it will be – then – and then – then it – one day, at the beginning of June, I remember the sun that was settling in the evening.</span> <span id="s1326">I stood outside with some women – Russians, around.</span> <span id="s1327">And they looked at sun, who was a red color, and she said, it’s bloody.</span> <span id="s1328">It was blood.</span> <span id="s1329">The war is coming.</span> <span id="s1330">The war – they had some feeling about some kind of –</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Q: Disaster, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">A: – saying that it is – when the sun is like blood – looks – there is a war coming.</span> <span id="s1333">This is beginning of 1941 –</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: June.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: – June.</span> <span id="s1336">The 22nd June, the Russians are attacked by Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: Did your lives change?</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: Not at the beginning.</span> <span id="s1339">We didn’t know what was going on.</span> <span id="s1340">We were, you know, behind all the clouds and everything, we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1341">We didn’t get any letters, and – letters stopped, the packages stopped.</span> <span id="s1342">But also, no – no radios, nothing.</span> <span id="s1343">But as – as things started to progress, we learned, toward the end of – of summer, I think it was sometimes late August or September, that there was a kind of a conference with Russians and – and Poles, and English people.</span> <span id="s1344">English offered to help Russia to fight Hitler, but on the condition that the Poles who were allies of England had to go free.</span> <span id="s1345">So they gave an amnesty.</span> <span id="s1346">Not all of them followed this.</span> <span id="s1347">The prison guards didn’t read, or didn’t – didn’t – or – many people stayed there for years afterward.</span> <span id="s1348">But some of them stayed, and there was an idea with Sikorski, who was the president –</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: – of – of Poland, prime minister of Poland, together with General Anders, who was then also in prison, but he was let out.</span> <span id="s1351">He was in prison in Lubyanka in Moscow.</span> <span id="s1352">He was first – he was hev – badly wounded, but he survived, and he became by – Sikorski ordered him to form the Polish army.</span> <span id="s1353">At first it was thought to go with the Red Army, and the Russians, with some diplomatic talks, started talking and there – by then, the war is really going bad for Russians, because Moscow – people – government, Russian government goes to Kuybyshev because Moscow is –</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1355">Is being und – attacked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">A: – is surrounded.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: And all the thing, and then Stalingrad starts.</span> <span id="s1359">So at that time, Hitler is a lit – not Hitler, Stalin is a little bit pressed to the wall, and he agrees to allow Poles to form the government.</span> <span id="s1360">There were couple of depos, where they put near Kuybyshev the [indecipherable] and Otwock or something like that, where the Poles started coming.</span> <span id="s1361">They allowed [indecipherable] somewhere bet – during the – into the prisons, into some towns where there was some more connection, in between, some people passed the information.</span> <span id="s1362">And we are still in Kokpekti in the – and we were allowed to go somewhere where it’s not so cold in the winter.</span> <span id="s1363">So we don’t have to ask any permission if we want to go, but it still took some time, that by about November that year, we’re – this man, this engineer said, I will lend you my truck, to take you to the station, and then you can go south, wherever that – you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: – settle somewhere.</span> <span id="s1366">Because we were not at age that – my brothers were too young to go, my mother wasn’t – would not be a soldier –</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">A: – whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">Q: But you were allowed to be free.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A: But we went to let – to go and maybe look for better living conditions, so – and this man lend us a car – the truck –</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: – to take us to [indecipherable] for nothing.</span> <span id="s1373">Didn’t charge us for anything.</span> <span id="s1374">And we waited for the trains.</span> <span id="s1375">In Russia the trains means the train – you know, the cattle train, open or like wagons, that we were coming in.</span> <span id="s1376">So when the trains like, would come, you would sit in the train, there is only one track going south, so it goes anywhere, track, and then my mother, being bourgeois brought – she went to buy tickets.</span> <span id="s1377">He had – he gave us some money to buy tickets, so my mother paid to Alma-Ata.</span> <span id="s1378">And as you know, Alma-Ata, when we came to Alma-Ata, they would not let us get off the station, because they said this is – this is a showplace of Kazakhstan.</span> <span id="s1379">Alma-Ata means apple – father of the apples –</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">A: – or something like that.</span> <span id="s1382">And it is a – a beautiful middle-terranean climate, like in Greece, or like in Italy.</span> <span id="s1383">And we thought, you know, we will still carry our life, whatever it is, but in that place they wouldn’t let us in.</span> <span id="s1384">So my mother said, how much wa – are the tickets, I have to buy tickets.</span> <span id="s1385">I – I cannot get on the train without the tickets.</span> <span id="s1386">So she had 80 rubles left, so how far this would allow, and that would take us to Jambul, which is a big city down –</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: South.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">A: – in – south.</span> <span id="s1389">It’s an industrial city, and it’s antique city, it was one on the road, silk road, and all that.</span> <span id="s1390">Anyway, we went – we got back on the train, went also on the train, took us.</span> <span id="s1391">In Jambul we stayed out, we were put out on then, and you couldn’t get into the city in a sense, to walk around, unless you had to prove that you have work in the city, and a place to live.</span> <span id="s1392">If you have to look for work, the first question is, do you live here?</span> <span id="s1393">If you don’t live, you couldn’t – you couldn’t get the hou – it’s a –</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">Q: It’s a – it’s a – it’s a closed circle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1396">So my mother was very upset.</span> <span id="s1397">At one point she got a – how you call it – how you call th – the Russian banya(ph), you know, a –</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Q: Mm-hm, oh, a bath.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: Bath.</span> <span id="s1400">She had the room – one – one couple said, why have banya(ph) and we don’t take with my wife, we don’t take the bath, it’s outside, you know.</span> <span id="s1401">So there is room – but there is room only for you and the two boys.</span> <span id="s1402">And I was living – there were already several Poles around, and they were somehow – some contacts were among the Poles, that they, I don’t know, by luck would get in somebody that we knew before, from the northern part.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: Can we interrupt just for a second?</span> <span id="s1404">I think you need – [technical break] Okay, so you’re in Jambul, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">A: We have – on the station in Jambul.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: And my mother finds that banya(ph), the ba-bathhouse, not –</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: So, a sauna?</span> <span id="s1409">A kind of like a sauna?</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">A: A sauna –</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A: – outside, with the pile of stones.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: How do you say it in Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A: Banya(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: Oh, banya(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: That’s local, because we don’t have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: You know, when the Russians came to Lvov, we didn’t have the lice-ing places, so we were not cultural enough, considered by – by the Russians.</span> <span id="s1419">Banya(ph) is typically Russian or Scandinavian, but actually more Russian, you have the small building like a garage, a stone, big stones, and in the middle it’s a heavy pot that you put water, and you fire the – under the stones, and the stones become so hot, and the water boils, and the steam –</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">Q: Steam, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">A: And you had sometimes they use the kind of sticks –</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: To beat you, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">A: – to beat you.</span> <span id="s1424">And anyway, I didn’t have the pla – place for me, and I was – for a couple of weeks.</span> <span id="s1425">So my mother had the chance to – had a chance to put a foot in Jambul.</span> <span id="s1426">But then after a few weeks, or – I think it was few weeks or two months or something, his family was coming in, and he said he will be using banya(ph), and so out you go.</span> <span id="s1427">And my mother was walking – it’s another story of unusual things.</span> <span id="s1428">My mother was walking on the street, and she seemed like some – some woman was passing her, a beautiful, fairly young wom – I think she must have been in her early 30s or something.</span> <span id="s1429">And she comes to my mother, said, what is the matter, you look so – like something very bad happened.</span> <span id="s1430">And said she now lost the place here, so she can’t go and look for job, and she doesn’t know where to go.</span> <span id="s1431">They would not let my mother stay – us to stay –</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: – in Jambul.</span> <span id="s1434">And my mother said she’s a – she will be looking for the apartment, and she’s – but I don’t know where to start.</span> <span id="s1435">So she said, come to me tomorrow here.</span> <span id="s1436">And she lived not too far from that place where banya(ph) was, on that street.</span> <span id="s1437">It’s a – it’s a big city, but it’s not quite paved yet, the dirt is on the street, and especially in the rainy days, you go up to half legs that sank in the mud.</span> <span id="s1438">But anyway, she showed where she lived, and who – and actually, she invited my mother to come and have cup of tea with her, and tell her the story.</span> <span id="s1439">She said, come to me tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1440">And my mother came – went to the station where we are sa – lying on our pieces of luggage, whatever it was, and she said, tomorrow I am going to – she said she will look for – among her friends, maybe somebody has something to offer.</span> <span id="s1441">And as it happened, she said yes, here, go to that place, and my mother knew a little bit of Russian, so she could converse.</span> <span id="s1442">And it appeared that this was some kind of aristocr – aristocratic Tartar woman, who herself was very anti-Soviet, because Tartars were –</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">A: – during the first World War, all this –</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: Displaced.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">A: – w-were not only displaced, the Tartar, the Cossacks lost their gover – their place, this was taken over by the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: And her husband committed suicide, or was killed, so she – because he were – he didn’t want to join the party, communist party.</span> <span id="s1449">So she had a thing to settle with the communists.</span> <span id="s1450">And so she told that story.</span> <span id="s1451">Anyway, next day my mother comes, and she said go tomorrow, go to this woman on that street, on that street, and she will – she has an apartment room, because this was all the question, in Russia you don’t see apartments, you see room.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">A: And so she says, go there, I settled with her that you would be coming on this time tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1454">And my mother went next day, but the woman said, I want three months’ rent, you know, for that room.</span> <span id="s1455">And my mother said, I don’t have any money.</span> <span id="s1456">So, she said, well, you cannot – I cannot rent it to you.</span> <span id="s1457">So my mother comes back to our Tartar friend, and she said, well, I will look for something else, come tomorrow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">Q: So another day again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">A: So another day.</span> <span id="s1460">My mother comes another day, and she said, go to this woman, maybe she ha – she [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1461">My mother goes there, and she said oh welcome, come on – come on in.</span> <span id="s1462">Your friend paid for the three months’ rent.</span> <span id="s1463">Can you imagine?</span> <span id="s1464">Another kind of a touch.</span> <span id="s1465">How not to believe in – in some kind of superior force.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">Q: Being – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A: – hanging over you.</span> <span id="s1468">Anyway, so we moved in to that place, we made friends with this woman, sometimes had – she had us for tea, sometimes she – she came over to our room.</span> <span id="s1469">We sometimes helped her with some other Poles who couldn’t find places, so we subletted a piece of the room.</span> <span id="s1470">And that is 1941 – or 40 – no –</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: Forty-two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: This is ’42.</span> <span id="s1473">This is November we left Kokpekti, we came in the winter, which in Jambul was a muddy –</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">A: – rainy winter.</span> <span id="s1476">And then my mother found a job in homework, making the quilts.</span> <span id="s1477">There are several woman who put the frames –</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">A: – and work on it.</span> <span id="s1480">And then they sell – not sell, give it to the factory that gives the material.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: You know, so my mother had the right to stay in Jambul, and had the place to stay in Jambul.</span> <span id="s1483">Then we learned that this army that was Polish army made of prisoners and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">A: – ex-prisoners and people who came close, because the Russians would not give them tents.</span> <span id="s1486">Only in the winter they were at the regular tents without any heating, and any clothing and the food, suppo – there were a hundred thousand people, practically – not – not hundred thousand, but at least – they gave the food only for 40,000 people, so the people were –</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">Q: Hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">A: – really starving there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">A: So the Russian suggested, you go south, and Sikorski, and – and ish – and Sikorski and the Russian – not the Russian, English forces, suggested that you go southern part of Russia, and then get out into the Middle East under the British jurisdiction.</span> <span id="s1491">So that happened, and these people went there.</span> <span id="s1492">We still did not have the right of it, and I did not know where is my father, because only the families of the military people who were going there, had the chance to go as families of the people or – in – in the army.</span> <span id="s1493">And every day then, from – I started working, I had to work, because I was then 15 in January, although my December date doesn’t count, I am 16 from the first of January, even though the whole month I’m not yet 16.</span> <span id="s1494">I had to work in the butink – you know what butinki are, the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">Q: The – these are –</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">A: – pressed –</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">A: – pressed shoes from wool – pressed wool –</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">A: – that you roll.</span> <span id="s1501">I was in factory of this, so cleaning the wool cut off the sheep, and then separated, they would take it in another room to wash it, and then they would take it on the combs, and sewing and all that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1502">That was not part of my job, my job was only this, except that it was full of this prickly –</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">Q: Yeah, hurts your fingers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">A: – things, right.</span> <span id="s1505">So my hands were always in pain, because it’s all dirty, prickly wool, straight from the lambs.</span> <span id="s1506">But anyway, I worked, and at one point th-the – it went bankrupt.</span> <span id="s1507">Can you imagine in Russia, it goes bankrupt?</span> <span id="s1508">How’d – it’s – the money in Russia goes from one pocket to another pocket.</span> <span id="s1509">It’s not that some owns it – somebody owns it –</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">A: – some – probably some – some people made some bad things, and they kicked him out, and so the factory –</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">Q: Closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">A: – folded.</span> <span id="s1514">But then, this is now coming to the summer, and the more and more we – people were passing by, and some of the trains, the cattle trains full of the prisoners are passing by, and because Jambul was quite a big station, and also the war is going on, so the trucks are needed for soldiers, so these trains are staying, sometimes for a few days, and I would go and look for my father among the thousands of people who are passing, and asking – and some people said, oh yes, I knew him.</span> <span id="s1515">So somehow I would give them something to eat I brought myself.</span> <span id="s1516">You know, these people were hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: Hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: And you know, they – whatever you call – their cloth was in pieces.</span> <span id="s1519">They sem – they themselves were, you know, like the remnants of human beings, after two and a half –</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">Q: And this was Anders’s army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q: These were prisoners, or Anders’s army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">A: This is the prisoners from gulags who were let out –</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">Q: To become.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">A: – to go, to join to the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">Q: Got it.</span> <span id="s1527">Got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">A: So they’re still prisoners actually, but free, going to join Yangiyo’l which is near Tashkent, near Samarkand, where the Polish forces were forming, before they were to go to Persia and Iraq.</span> <span id="s1529">Persia, it’s Iran.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">A: At that time, shah was still there.</span> <span id="s1532">And anyway, this is still – I cannot predict what will happen, but I’m looking for my father so he can go and join the army –</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">A: – and put us on the list as his relative, so we can come also, to get out of –</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">A: And I – I remember couple – couple of – there is toward the end of some on – or beginning of August.</span> <span id="s1537">And they are talking about end of August, army is going to go over the Caspian Sea, too.</span> <span id="s1538">And I – I’m very upset, not finding my father, and passing by – by the passengers train station on the – on one of the [indecipherable] of the sides, there stays a group of Polish uniformed officers.</span> <span id="s1539">And I pass by, not to ask them anything, but just – just to – maybe something, you know, I don’t know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">Q: You will hear something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">A: I will hear something.</span> <span id="s1542">And so, it just happened that one is introducing another one.</span> <span id="s1543">This is Capitan Organish(ph) Koppage(ph), this is true, Organish(ph) Koppage(ph), he is the officer in charge of the list of civilians who go – goes now to Yangiyo’l, and in few days the list will be closed, because toward the end of August, the people are starting to leave the – Russia.</span> <span id="s1544">All the army is going out.</span> <span id="s1545">When I – my heart sunk.</span> <span id="s1546">By now, I didn’t find my father.</span> <span id="s1547">I came home very sad looking, and my mother somehow gained my tale of what happened.</span> <span id="s1548">And she said Organish(ph) Koppage(ph)?</span> <span id="s1549">Did he look like that?</span> <span id="s1550">And she describes me this man, because I looked very closely at him.</span> <span id="s1551">Was round face, he had red blonde hair, cut very short.</span> <span id="s1552">And he had the eyeglasses, but the ones that hold by the nose.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q: Mm-hm, pince-nez, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">A: And reddish face, you know, kind of – they call it in – in Polish the piggy – like – like pig has the color of the hair, and almost like albino type of thing.</span> <span id="s1555">And my mother, yes this ca – this is Capitan Koppage(ph), who was a friend of your father, but you were very small when he was transferred to another town or city, or whatever, in his duties, so you can’t remember him.</span> <span id="s1556">But he liked you very much, he would hum and – and my mother sat down and wrote several letters to Yangiyo’l.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">A: And fortunately for the post office, it reached him a couple of hours before closing the list, and they put us as – my mother as his sister, and we got on the list.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q: Oh my God.</span> <span id="s1560">Oh my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">A: This is – this is one of those unusual things that, you know, my mother is on the list now.</span> <span id="s1562">But next transport is from Ugovoy(ph), which is about 180 kilometers before Jambul, so we have to go back on the train, or however we could get to jam –</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Q: This place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">A: – to – to that place with the trains that have the transport of these people to go out.</span> <span id="s1565">From that train, go to cor – Caspian Sea, to Krasnovodsk, and you get on this – with all the transport, th-the people are on the list, can get it.</span> <span id="s1566">The thing wa – which was also difficult for us to – to do, it – not only that we didn’t have money to pay for any kind of transport, but the city of Jambul was put – Poles in the city of Jambul were put under martial law – not martial law, arrested, so to speak.</span> <span id="s1567">We could not leave Jambul legally because there was some – some difficulties with the police delegatura.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">A: Delegatura was, you – you understand, the office of the Polish government, and the emb-embassy in – in Kuybyshev, in – and London representative.</span> <span id="s1570">They did something, they had black market, they were getting the transport of goods from rush – from America: people were sending clothing, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: – for this – for the – this big center.</span> <span id="s1573">Jambul was really an – almost a – a big center where they would bring some things.</span> <span id="s1574">And I understand that some of the people –</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: – la – different people, all nations have those people that they would somehow sold some of the things on the black market.</span> <span id="s1577">So the Poles were non –</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">Q: Persona non grata.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1580">So how we can get out?</span> <span id="s1581">My mother remembered that we had a painting of one of our Polish friend.</span> <span id="s1582">She was the wife of the judge in Poland, oh, he was a lawyer before the war, and high, high up.</span> <span id="s1583">And he was called to Kuybyshev to go to Russia quickly, almost like day to day, to go to be in the government on – on – on the [indecipherable] or something.</span> <span id="s1584">And she didn’t have a time to give a painting of the portrait – she was herself a painter – to the owner of a store.</span> <span id="s1585">And my mother said, I am sure she – that store has a truck.</span> <span id="s1586">Maybe I’ll give – she wakes up one day, and she – she wakes up, and she said, I have it in my – I remembered that I have this painting.</span> <span id="s1587">I will go there, and maybe she will allow us to take this truck, and somehow we will go back to Ugovoy(ph).</span> <span id="s1588">We are dressing up, and there is a knock on the door.</span> <span id="s1589">And there is a man who was the cobbler, or shoe – shoemaker, with a big Polish – a Polish man with a big family, and he said, I have a truck for your disposal – except that, you know, the – 500 rubles per person.</span> <span id="s1590">At this time already, my older brother, the younger than me, but older brother, went to cadet school already to Ugovoy(ph) and was already on the way down to the camps near ba – to get out of Russia – Kazakhs – [indecipherable] Kazakhstan actually too [indecipherable] I believe.</span> <span id="s1591">Anyway, so three of us.</span> <span id="s1592">And my mother said, I don’t have any money.</span> <span id="s1593">Five hundred rubles is quite a lot for me – even one ruble, whatever.</span> <span id="s1594">And he says – he said, what do I need rubles for?</span> <span id="s1595">You have been always kind to me, you send me some Polish friends that I could have worked, and I gained; you children played with my children; and you never showed me, you know, the – the difference that I am a cobbler, and you are a lady.</span> <span id="s1596">Or something like that, something of that sort.</span> <span id="s1597">You can even dispose whom else of your friend could go, we – I had couple, and we sat on that truck.</span> <span id="s1598">But how to get out of Jambul?</span> <span id="s1599">He, this cobbler, had a friend, a Polish Jewish friend, one of those who willingly went to – to Russia, who had some NKVD friend too.</span> <span id="s1600">And he said that he will put on his friend coat as NKVD man taking people to the collective farms, because this is harvest time.</span> <span id="s1601">So all people on the – in the city will very often volunteered, or not really, forced to go to the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: But they were – yeah, as volunteers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">A: And th – so, I’m taking people to the farms.</span> <span id="s1606">So he went around at night.</span> <span id="s1607">We were supposed to speak only Russian so in case we passed some places where they could recognize.</span> <span id="s1608">And we got there on time, two days before the train from Ogovoy(ph) was go-going south.</span> <span id="s1609">And this Organish(ph) Koppage(ph), that Captain Organish(ph) Koppage(ph) was there, and we were helpful in getting three people: the doctor from Kokpekti, what I told you my mother was sick, then he –</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: – he only told my mother, you sickness with the legs and kidneys wa – is only good to go back to Poland to – through Skaviets(ph), which is the kind of –</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: A resor – a sort of a sanitorium?</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">A: A resort for the – right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">A: But anyway, he – I think he was old bachelor, you know, old widower.</span> <span id="s1616">Anyway, he was alone.</span> <span id="s1617">He was Pole of Jewish faith.</span> <span id="s1618">The rule was set for Poles to take only the Polish Christians because according to Russian – I don’t know whether it’s Constitution or whatever, they – the Jews are not Polish citizen, they are now Russian citizens, and they cannot leave.</span> <span id="s1619">So we somehow hid him on transport, we knew Pole – Polish, and we – in that train.</span> <span id="s1620">And it was at this time, this was passenger train.</span> <span id="s1621">So we could sit on the steps of the entrance of the – into the wagon, and sometimes if, at the station, the NKVD was coming, or some soldiers were coming, we would tell very – this is another family, m-mother and father who my mother knew for man-many years previously, from Kraków.</span> <span id="s1622">They haven’t seen each other, but somehow found themselves at the station in Jambul –</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">Q: In Ugovoy(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">A: Right, uga – Ugovoy(ph).</span> <span id="s1625">And we also told her.</span> <span id="s1626">So with that girl, very nice, brown curly hair, beautif – beautiful girl, we were sitting at tho – and we’d say sometimes, my mother has the papers, my mother is there, or something like that.</span> <span id="s1627">So they knew, they would hide these people, and so we transported these people, smuggled them out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">Q: How many did you smuggle out?</span> <span id="s1629">The doctor –</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">A: The doctor and the – the father, mother and Aldonna(ph) was the name of the – Aldonna(ph) is a famous Lithuanian name.</span> <span id="s1631">So she was with us, we later on met in Teheran, but that’s much later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">Q: And were they all Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">Q: These were all Jewish people?</span> <span id="s1635">A: They were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1636">But they were assimilated Polish Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">Q: Right, right, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">A: You – you don’t – you didn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q: You didn’t distinguish, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">A: – ask even, something, you know, in –</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">A: But anyway, they were supposed to be on – forbidden to leave Soviet Union, and couldn’t get on the list.</span> <span id="s1643">So since Capitan Koppage(ph) was there, they had us wrote the list, he put them on.</span> <span id="s1644">And – but it was still not quite proper, so to make sure that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">A: – the Russians would not demand the – the papers or some – some kind of checking up.</span> <span id="s1647">But anyway, we are going from Ugovoy(ph) through Jambul, back going south.</span> <span id="s1648">Since there – you have to think about that Ugovoy(ph), the trains were sent few days before.</span> <span id="s1649">And some people had little children whom they left in –</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">Q: In Jambul?</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">A: – in Jambul, to come to the station of Jambul, and get on the train, because they will keep the tr – place for them on the train, going together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: Some had the old parents, who couldn’t make it 180 kilometers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">A: So, they also waited.</span> <span id="s1656">We are slowly arriving in Jambul.</span> <span id="s1657">Train stops, so slows down.</span> <span id="s1658">We come, and are faced with the closed gates, and closed bars, from the people who are trying to get on the – on the station.</span> <span id="s1659">And they closed our – all our doors, so nobody can get out from our train.</span> <span id="s1660">And they tell us, these people cannot go.</span> <span id="s1661">And you can imagine I k – I will never forget to my dying day, the hands, the – the crying, the screams of the people, through the iron post stretching the arms to the parents who are on the train going away.</span> <span id="s1662">Or the children of the people who are supposed to get on the train, and i-it’s a – it’s a horror story in that sense.</span> <span id="s1663">For two hours we stayed, they would not let open one – for one person, our door or the railings for the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">Q: There.</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">A: – people.</span> <span id="s1666">And I – and train starts, and you can hear one big cry of all these voices.</span> <span id="s1667">I still have my hair stand at the back of my neck, because you – I – I will never forget that scene.</span> <span id="s1668">The train goes and goes and the people cry and slowly train goes faster and faster and the crying is – continues on the train, but we already don’t hear that crying on this train.</span> <span id="s1669">And this was one of the most horrific scenes that I remember from all that kind of travel.</span> <span id="s1670">So after several days, because they’re quite a distance from Jambul to – from Ugovoy(ph) and Jambul to Krasnovodsk, we came to Krasnovodsk, they let us on the beaches, and we had to walk to the port, which was actually at – also trade ports, when they have the oil barrack -- barracks all – ship, on which we had to – they didn’t have hume – cells or rooms or anything, they had – we had to be on top.</span> <span id="s1671">We got – there were still some people who came, knowing that Krasnovodsk is the place from which Poles will be traveling.</span> <span id="s1672">Some people traveled by hook or by crook all the way to Krasnovodsk, but they still did not let some of these people –</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">Q: Join.</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">A: – because this were different people, this is a two, three days travel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">A: Tam – they s – the others stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">A: And they couldn’t find our name on the list, and somebody, some man picked up my – I had the small bundle, which contained a pot.</span> <span id="s1679">You had to have always pot, because the kipiatok is always given on the station, and that’s the only way you can make tea, or soup or whatever.</span> <span id="s1680">So this was – and my Krakowian(ph) kind of a dress, which I, when I wore it, when seven years old, but you couldn’t sell that to the Soviet or Cossacks.</span> <span id="s1681">So anyway, I still had it with me.</span> <span id="s1682">And I didn’t have much clothing, I think I had one dress, and in that was a – whether I had dress on, or I had the blouse, and a skirt, this was my own things, and probably toothpaste, or whatever, I don’t know whether there was even toothpaste.</span> <span id="s1683">These things I – kind of vanished from my memory.</span> <span id="s1684">And the – finally they found our name.</span> <span id="s1685">This man says, well, I’ll go up – because these people were very busy – and he took advantage of them being busy – took my small thing, and said, I’ll find a place for you, keep it for your mother and your brother.</span> <span id="s1686">And he really did that, after they found our places, and we come, and we see him sleeping on the row of big ropes that go for – on the – on the big boats, like they have ropes.</span> <span id="s1687">Unfortunately, we are not leaving for some time.</span> <span id="s1688">We were supposed to leave in the evening, and this is now night, and the NKVD is full, walking around the people, taking all the documents, and all the – trying to – most of – but it was, you know, people were so, like pressed like sardines.</span> <span id="s1689">Anyway, at one point, they come to this man who took my things.</span> <span id="s1690">It happened to be one of those free going to paradise persons, who were communist, who wanted – and after two years he learned what’s the paradise, and he wanted to get out of Russia.</span> <span id="s1691">But he didn’t exist on any lists of Polish officers or anything.</span> <span id="s1692">So they took him, they took 13 people who were trying to get out of Russia without document, proper documents.</span> <span id="s1693">[phone ringing] And anyway, we got on the train.</span> <span id="s1694">Took us two day, and th-the – over to Paklevy(ph).</span> <span id="s1695">[interruption]</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1697">Okay, so you just left Russia and then ta –</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">A: We were on that boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">A: And we reached Paklevy(ph), which is a port in – on the Iranian, or Persian side, and they set us in a camp on the beach, with the – you know, they gave us the blanket, and there were sticks, four sticks, and covered the blanket as a roof, and they put – they gave us some – another blanket or so, to lie down on it and wait until we have to g – to be de-liced, and disinfected to go to the next place.</span> <span id="s1701">They took all, or whatever clothing we had on, they burned that, or cleaned them.</span> <span id="s1702">It all depends – I – I don’t know how – how you – they looked, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1703">And then you go to another – that took a couple of weeks.</span> <span id="s1704">By then my mother was very sick with dysentery.</span> <span id="s1705">Because, what happened was that dieticians did not work on those – at the camps.</span> <span id="s1706">For the hungry people who have not seen any good food for two, three, four years, you don’t give the lamb soup, with the hot fat on top to the people who are completely devoid of any –</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">Q: Nutrients, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">A: – kind of nutrition, so they don’t have how to digest it.</span> <span id="s1709">So very often, many of them came down with dysentery, but on – my mother didn’t tell me that she always when – what relieved her, she would go to the sea, to the water, and she would sit there, because that relieved her pain.</span> <span id="s1710">But then they put us on the next – next camp.</span> <span id="s1711">Then, I don’t remember how many weeks it took yet to be there.</span> <span id="s1712">We met my brother, who was still in another camp, but he was then [indecipherable] or young cadet – what later on they called young cadets, because Anders was organizing the school for the young boys, to take as many as possible because there were many orphans coming.</span> <span id="s1713">So anyway, we met with him.</span> <span id="s1714">He was – he went to Teheran earlier.</span> <span id="s1715">We joined in Teheran, but not in the same camp, he was in the army, and we were in civilian camps in Teheran.</span> <span id="s1716">And that’s the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">Q: This is a –</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">A: – end – this is the beginning of September, 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">Q: No, it couldn’t be ’42, was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">A: Forty-two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">Q: Was it ’42?</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">A: Right, ‘41, the war started; ’41 earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">Q: That’s right, okay, and so then it takes a while, ’42, –</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">A: Forty-two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">Q: – so you’re still in the middle of the war, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">A: Middle of the war –</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">A: – we cannot go anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">Q: Right, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">A: And anyway, the – then there are camps, three camps.</span> <span id="s1731">My mother was taken from the truck, because she had very high temperature, and what had proven, she had typhoid, both – both typhoids; the skin typhoid and stomach typhoid and dysentery.</span> <span id="s1732">Then later developed – she was really –</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">Q: Sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">A: – si – very sick, they took her to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1735">And I had – that was quite a walk.</span> <span id="s1736">I waited on the bus that was taking some people to visit people in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1737">It was – had to go through almost the side of Teheran itself.</span> <span id="s1738">We were – the camps were outside of Teheran.</span> <span id="s1739">In the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">Q: Let’s – you know, since we have only 20 minutes of tape –</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">Q: – let’s go to the main events that happened after that.</span> <span id="s1743">In September ’42, you were in the civilian camps in Iran.</span> <span id="s1744">And how long were you in Iran in total?</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">A: In total until ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">Q: So you were there –</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">A: Spring ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">Q: You spent two years there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">A: Yes, much of it was in the hospital, because after my mother got better –</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">A: – I start – I got couple of the – couple of pneumonias, and with pleurisy and was very sick for a little while.</span> <span id="s1752">But somehow I survived, but it meant that I spent a lot of time in the hospital, but I started also they – they were organizing the schools, which was sitting on the bricks in some hangar with the ho – old airport, near Teheran was unused, so there were hangars, and we were sitting there, and the teacher was giving us lessons.</span> <span id="s1753">There were no books, of course, but we were writing.</span> <span id="s1754">There was some probably note papers, and we were learning.</span> <span id="s1755">Then, in the – in – we were moved to another camp.</span> <span id="s1756">We were – at first we were so-called second camp, but in the first camp they had much more modern buildings, or some kind of civilization type of thing, and the school started, there were classes, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">Q: And this was all under the British jurisdiction.</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1759">The Poles were running it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">A: It was the – the British organized it, but the – we were in that second camp, and one – once when I was in the hospital – out of the hospital – going out of the hospital, the doctors sent me to the third camp, which was in the mountains.</span> <span id="s1762">So, because of my pneumonia, I think that they did not realize what I – la – only in am – in America la – years later, that I had developed TB, but it was not quite progressive, or becoming more, so they didn’t recognize it.</span> <span id="s1763">Anyway, so many sick people ho – you know, small things like this did not really come to notice.</span> <span id="s1764">And so I was, for a few months le – summer months, when there was a scouting jubil – jamboree at that camp, with the beautiful trees, and somehow a lot of young people from all different camps, and – and afterwards I came back to – to the camp, and then we were taken to Akwaz(ph), which is going south.</span> <span id="s1765">Akwaz(ph) is the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">Q: Still in Iran?</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">A: Still in Iran.</span> <span id="s1768">The hottest place on earth, so they say.</span> <span id="s1769">Anyway, it’s in the desert, but the buildings are, you know, the regular buildings, cement, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1770">And they put us in big, like war – not warehouses, you couldn’t call it some – some maybe – old shops that they didn’t have anything to sell, but the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">A: – open places.</span> <span id="s1773">And there we were for about, oh, that would happen that we came, I think, to the end – end of ’43, into the spring –</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">Q: Of ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">A: In ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">A: In April, they started closing the camps.</span> <span id="s1778">The – because the Russians were afraid of so many Poles living clo – so close by to Russia, urged –</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">Q: The British.</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">A: – the British to take the Polish refugees out of there, and the pole – they organized the camps all over their commonwealth.</span> <span id="s1781">Some of them were in India, some of them were in Africa – many were in Africa.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">Q: What about you?</span> <span id="s1783">What happened with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">A: When – we were supposed to go to India.</span> <span id="s1785">My – my brother first came back to us, but shortly afterward decided to go to the high school, which would be cadet school in Palestine.</span> <span id="s1786">So he was supposed to go there, he still stayed in – in Teheran, but we were put on the boat in Basra, which is no name now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">A: And were to go to India.</span> <span id="s1789">Unfortunately, the Japanese submarines were looking out for the British navy, who was the whole group of boats were going, the navy b – navy ships were going, and we were among them, the only passenger and refugee, about thousand people or so.</span> <span id="s1790">And they were attacking in submarines, so we hid in Aden, just close to the Mapiss(ph), you know, the Arabian peninsula, and then on the other side is the port Adem – Aden, who is the – was a British kind of a center of defense or whatever.</span> <span id="s1791">So we stayed off the port, but in – away from these Japanese things.</span> <span id="s1792">And after a few days we let out, still intent to go to India, to Karachi, where they had camps, Karachi and – in in – India at that time –</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">Q: Was part of Pakista – Pakistan was part of India.</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">A: Later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">A: But still it was India.</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">A: And they had some – already some camps, people in the camps, but we still ha – met with the Japanese submarines, so they started – told – the order was to go down eastern side of Africa, to go to Mombasa.</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">A: And in Mombasa they said, now, all our camps are full.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">A: You have to go to another one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">A: They send the boat to Zanzibar, which is a lan – island near Mombasa.</span> <span id="s1805">Zanzibar didn’t have any facilities to keep refugees.</span> <span id="s1806">So they told us, you have to go to Beira.</span> <span id="s1807">Beira is a capital of Mozambique.</span> <span id="s1808">Mozambique was the colony, Portuguese colony.</span> <span id="s1809">And Mozambique is just across from Madagascar.</span> <span id="s1810">You had to get into that narrow passage to go to Beira.</span> <span id="s1811">Just before we got close, there was a huge storm that took our ship.</span> <span id="s1812">By then we were alone, the other ships went their way.</span> <span id="s1813">And our ship was thrown more into the middle of ocean, above other side of Madagascar.</span> <span id="s1814">By the time we turned, it was no use going back to Beira because going back, I don’t know, with the – they were not sure whether they would accept us.</span> <span id="s1815">We finally stopped at Durbin, which is South American port, sou –</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">Q: South African port.</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">A: – ra – African, sou – Republic of Africa.</span> <span id="s1818">They were neutral in the war.</span> <span id="s1819">Actually, there was a lot of pro-Hitler thoughts of wars, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">A: – if you know the history of wars in South African Republic.</span> <span id="s1822">But they let us off, put us on the train and took us to Rhodesia, southern Rhodesia, which is now zambas –</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">Q: Zimbabwe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">A: Zimbabwe.</span> <span id="s1825">Nearby – near ba – Salisbury was – was capital of southern Rhodesia, now is – what is now – I forgot, this moment.</span> <span id="s1826">The capital is differently named.</span> <span id="s1827">And from there there was – they formed – there was a school for girls, formed also by the government, from a private plantation, it had beautiful home, beautiful things for the girls; and that was a school for girls.</span> <span id="s1828">So th – from the camp, we went – I went first, then later on my mother – my mother was a teacher at the school, but then they asked my mother to come to the school to be guardian of the – mother guardian of some of the girl – of some classes, and then also to teach gymnastics.</span> <span id="s1829">So she came, and that is ’43.</span> <span id="s1830">Let’s see, four –</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">Q: I thought you lived from ’42 to for –</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">A: – end – end of April –</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">A: – the end of April, 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">Q: I thought you were for two years in Iran?</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">A: Yes, in four – ’42 –</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">Q: To ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">A: – to ’44.</span> <span id="s1839">Forty-four beginning.</span> <span id="s1840">By the time the boat was traveling for six weeks –</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">Q: Then your – April ’44, you are in Zimbabwe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">A: In – right, at the – in the May, or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">Q: Okay, okay, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">A: And then we come to Rhodesia, and we come to the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">Q: Five minutes, okay.</span> <span id="s1846">So we have five more minutes on the – on the tape, so we have to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">A: So the war is still going on –</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">Q: Going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">A: – in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">Q: Okay, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">A: Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">Q: No, we can still talk, if you are willing, we are still talk –</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">A: Well, it just –</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">A: – because just to close it in some spot –</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">A: – like you say.</span> <span id="s1860">The – the war made it impossible for us to think of any return yet, because the war was still going on.</span> <span id="s1861">And my brother, who went to this cadet school, he was in Palestine cadet school, and then, in 1947, actually at the beginning – at the end of ‘46, the Polish communist government, which you know by enou – enough of this, that that was imposed on by Soviets, wanted Poles to come back.</span> <span id="s1862">But because of history, not many people felt safe to go in back, unless they had some close relatives or children or parents they wanted to help out.</span> <span id="s1863">But otherwise, it wasn’t quite wise to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">Q: Hang on a second.</span> <span id="s1865">Let’s stop.</span> <span id="s1866">We are will – [break] End of File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">Beginning File Three</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">Q: So you were in Africa in total, for four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">A: We are – first we come to Marandella’s(ph), a camp for all refugees.</span> <span id="s1870">They take the girls who are of high school –</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">Q: Age.</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">A: – level, to come to that school in Giglifolt(ph), which was this plantation –</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">A: – left by the – some English people who lost the son to some viper’s bite, and so they left the plantation, went back to England, and they donated the plantation.</span> <span id="s1875">And it was given to the government, and they place the high school for the girls there.</span> <span id="s1876">We took care of gardens, we took care of –</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">A: – sleeping quarters.</span> <span id="s1879">Well, the main building was used in the school and administration, but then we were in some barracks, all around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">Q: And did you stay there for the entire four years that you were in Africa?</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">A: N-No, we were at – in Giglifolt(ph) I was for three years –</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">A: – not quite, no.</span> <span id="s1884">First I was for two years, then we met with my – not knowing that my uncle, my mother’s brother was in Lusaka in northern Rhodesia as one of administrators from the British thing, because he knew several languages, and he knew English, and he was also legal – some knowledge of law, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1885">And he was as a contact with the Poles – Polish forces.</span> <span id="s1886">Anyway, my mother asked to be transferred to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">Q: There.</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">A: – Lusaka.</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">A: We went to Lusaka.</span> <span id="s1891">I finished one school year in Lusaka with the first lyceum, and th – for the second lyceum I went back to Giglifolt(ph) in southern Rhodesia, but my mother and my brother –</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">Q: Stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">A: – younger, stayed in Lusaka.</span> <span id="s1894">And then, after I graduated with matura(ph), or [indecipherable], to you know, gained the document of – proof of my ending high school, then I went to Lusaka.</span> <span id="s1895">We stayed – that was in 1947, and we stayed til 1948, when they were closing Lusaka.</span> <span id="s1896">Some people were taken from the camp of Lusaka to another camps, and we chose to go to – to e – to England, because my brother was in England.</span> <span id="s1897">We thought w – we somehow got – by mistake, too, because his name was the same like our cousin’s name who is captain.</span> <span id="s1898">And he said, Tadeusz Pawulski, well, let him come.</span> <span id="s1899">But then afterwards they said, well, he is cadet, he cannot come, but we were already on the boat to England.</span> <span id="s1900">So we arrived in England in 1948, in – if I remember correctly, June or July, in – in the western Gloucestershire, where there was a big [indecipherable] divide Poles.</span> <span id="s1901">Most Poles came there, and from there they were sent to different camps.</span> <span id="s1902">And afterwards, I – we learned that some of our relatives who were in London, and invited us to come to London, my – I found my mother a job as – because she didn’t know English very well at that time anyway.</span> <span id="s1903">She was the – how you call it – the person who washes the [indecipherable] in – caretaker of the apartment houses where they have – she –</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1905">A housekeeper.</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">A: Not necessarily a housekeeper, the one who is the concierge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">Q: Ah, got it, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">A: Concierge.</span> <span id="s1909">And I was given a – a cou – work at one of my uncle’s packages to Poland office, to write some addresses on the things, on the – and to be able to live, because my mother, by her – [break]</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">Q: All right, so after – when di – where were you when the war ended?</span> <span id="s1911">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">A: We were in Africa.</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">Q: Were you in Rhodesia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">A: We were

knew, and we also knew that the soldiers who were, as you probably know the – there were so many Polish soldiers in the west, in – fighting with the – on the side of the allies, were coming to England after, choosing not to go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s1921">And so that – the end for them came, and most – many of them went to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">Q: How did your family – how did your mother res – react, how did your brother – how did your brothers react?</span> <span id="s1923">How did – when you found out the war is over, what were your first thoughts, if you can remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">A: I only – what I can say, the – we were always planning to go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s1925">Situation was that Lvov was under Ukraine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">A: There was no Lvov for us.</span> <span id="s1928">Eastern part of Poland, the big chunk of po – Poland, now was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">Q: Part of Ukraine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">A: – given to Stalin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">A: And also, my mother contacts – was happy and was lucky to get some contacts in Poland with the relatives.</span> <span id="s1933">And the brother of my father, who lived in Warsaw, what I told you, about that I visited, he wrote to my mother, watch out, because your sons have finished high school, and when – if you come back now to Poland, they take all the children of intelligentsia, so to speak, because by then –</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">A: – Poland’s intelligentsia was practically all gone – to the Russian – Russia, first to the schools for officers, for the army officers, and my mother said, I am not – we just got out of Russia, I am not –</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">Q: Letting my –</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">A: – willing to go and lose my sons once they go to Russia with the no – we know the situation –</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">A: – what will happen, what might happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1940">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">A: And so we went to England, decided that we will go to England.</span> <span id="s1942">And since many of our friends were in the army, many of our – some of our relatives were already – some of them did not go the same route that we went.</span> <span id="s1943">Some of them during the 1939, happened to be outside of Poland.</span> <span id="s1944">When Poland was attacked they went to France, or they went to England.</span> <span id="s1945">And they –</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">Q: And they could help you then, coming in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">A: – had – they were somehow suggesting that we go to – go to England and wait there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">Q: Did you have –</span></p> <p><span id="s1949">A: There was always the hope y – [indecipherable] was there, so there was always yet the – and based on any – anything special, it’s still – that it can’t be that Poland will be cut in half and given away, and that Lvov will never be Polish.</span> <span id="s1950">And so because of that, we stayed in England to be close enough to the continent, to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">Q: Did – by that point, did you have any hope that your father was still alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">A: No, we didn’t.</span> <span id="s1953">No, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1954">We knew that the prisoners of war were killed, but where they were buried, we didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">Q: And you knew by whom they were killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">A: We knew that wa – from the – we didn’t have any doubts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">A: Because the letters stopped in April –</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">A: – 1940.</span> <span id="s1961">There were still no Germans in – in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">A: So the Germans could not have killed them.</span> <span id="s1964">In anything there were so many witnesses, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">Q: When it all started, you were a 12 year old girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">Q: And when it ended, you were already in your upper teens?</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">Q: Almost a young woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">Q: So you could say that your – your teenage years –</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">A: Well, vanished.</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1974">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">A: And that is somehow unrecover –</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">Q: Unrecoverable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">A: Unrecoverable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">Q: Did you feel that loss?</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">Q: How?</span> <span id="s1981">In what ways?</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">A: In – not in the bad ways, in something – becoming more serious person.</span> <span id="s1983">The not having the common language with the average English girls of my age, and even some of the Polish girls who were younger, or older, the different – different ways they – trouble they found themselves in England.</span> <span id="s1984">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">Q: Were you lonely?</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">A: – but also strong.</span> <span id="s1987">Stronger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1989">You felt stronger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">A: Stronger as a human being, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">Q: And how?</span> <span id="s1992">Why did you feel stronger, because you had lived through so much, and you survived it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">A: Maybe in – in the fact of these thoughts, and I was, shall we say, more on the serious sides, and I wanted to study, I wanted to finish university courses, or something, by the – way I went to the London University dean of history, and he assured me I had the Polish papers translated, no-no – not – [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">Q: What kind of certi –</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">A: Notified.</span> <span id="s1996">Translated –</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">Q: Notarized certificate?</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">A: Notarized.</span> <span id="s1999">And on basis of that, I wa – I had a place, but I couldn’t get the scholarship, because even though it was given by the Polish government in London, had the money, but as the young woman who was giving me an interview, when I asked for the scholarship to go, what do you need university for?</span> <span id="s2000">The – the girls who go to universities go for – to find the husbands.</span> <span id="s2001">We can – we don’t have money to spend on such material.</span> <span id="s2002">I can give you only the scholarship for some business administration, two years’ course.</span> <span id="s2003">So I started college.</span> <span id="s2004">But the – the thinking was the women, without realizing that actually, the woman who is educated is really the mother of future people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">A: Fathers are outside, earning the life, but the mothers teach the children.</span> <span id="s2007">[coughs] Excuse me.</span> <span id="s2008">But that was about – so I started college.</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">Q: With a business administration –</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">A: For business administration, but I didn’t finish, because by – I got married in – during – after one year, I met my husband.</span> <span id="s2011">There were some Polish women who organized evenings for the young people, because there were many soldiers who returned from the army, and other places, went into college, and were a-alone sometimes.</span> <span id="s2012">And there were no really places that you would meet, as normal – in normal life, and so they organized, among their friends, to have socials.</span> <span id="s2013">And on – I was invited to one of the socials by a friend of my mother’s, and – and a friend of her mother’s.</span> <span id="s2014">And when the – and met my husband, although I remember him coming into the room full of people.</span> <span id="s2015">I remember his coming.</span> <span id="s2016">And the song from the “South Pacific,” one – the evening – we remember the – one enchanted evening, you will see a strangers across the – and I see – the same thing happened.</span> <span id="s2017">I saw my husband, and I saw his eyes, and somehow I – I saw him.</span> <span id="s2018">He didn’t see me, of course, because there’s a group of people, 30 people or 40 people around.</span> <span id="s2019">But then I had the mistake learned – mistaken idea that he came with a lady who brought her son to that party, as a young man to – for having, you know, a chance to meet.</span> <span id="s2020">And she came also with a young woman, who was telling to this young woman’s mother, and – mother, which I assumed that she must be daughter-in-law, because she turns mother-in-law, so he is married.</span> <span id="s2021">So, out.</span> <span id="s2022">No more intention of getting to know closer.</span> <span id="s2023">And I – somehow we had supper quite well done by all the ladies’ mothers and all that.</span> <span id="s2024">And after, there was some dance – dancing in the living room, and I used – my braids I put on – in the crown of the head.</span> <span id="s2025">And in one – he approached me – my husband approached me to ask for the dance.</span> <span id="s2026">And when there was some kind of the changing of guard, when I had to go under his arm, or something like that – you know, the steps sometimes, his –</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">Q: Cuff?</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">A: – button – cuff – o-on – on the cuff, caught my hair.</span> <span id="s2029">And there is a saying that you somehow get connected with – there is this – with your hair gets into some – your button gets into the hair of somebody, that there is something, that you become friends, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">Q: A connection is established.</span></p> <p><span id="s2031">A: Connection established.</span> <span id="s2032">So he looked at me and let me s – let me see the person that I am to – to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">A: But then I still rem – think he’s married.</span> <span id="s2035">So I discourage him.</span> <span id="s2036">He – I would sit here, and he would come and sit nearby, and I would make excuse and go to another place.</span> <span id="s2037">And then I was looking through my pocketbook, and there was some picture – tickets from the Albert Hall in London, that I went to the concert, and he would tell me, oh, he wished that he knew me by then, he would have accompany me.</span> <span id="s2038">And I said, well, it passed, and I would move to another place again.</span> <span id="s2039">And then it’s time to go home, and this lady with her daughter – by then I know that he is – he is a friend of the son of this woman, who doesn’t like to go to any dances, so he chose his friend to –</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">Q: Come with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">A: – replace him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">Q: Ah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">A: So he was not the married type, but he said he will help the – to go the –</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2045">A: – through the underground, to the next station, where the other people would go, the Mrs. Topalitska(ph) and her daughter, and her – the friend of her son.</span> <span id="s2046">But then he got – I got to change the underground trains, he went – changed with me.</span> <span id="s2047">He said, I’ll take you all the way.</span> <span id="s2048">And then took the bus who was number 28, all the way to Kilburn, northern part of London.</span> <span id="s2049">And I – he would go there and got the address where I am, because I didn’t want him –</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">Q: To know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2051">A: – to know where – the address of – so wrote down his street number and forced me to give the – I did not have telephone at that time.</span> <span id="s2052">The – the person downstairs who lived, he had the public telephone nearby, so he would pick up the telephone and call me sometimes.</span> <span id="s2053">So he didn’t know, I didn’t give him the telephone, I gave him the address, and he – and he – the thing was – another small coincidence; bus number 28 ends at Kilburn, at north, but ends at the quite the southern part of London when he lived – where he lived close by.</span> <span id="s2054">So he took the same, the last bus that took me there, coming back was going to last route, all the way to the place where –</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">Q: He lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s2056">A: So it – somehow it just.</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">Q: That – that button in the hair did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">Q: So, when did you get married, and when did you come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">A: We married about – I – I was still going to school, to the college, studying.</span> <span id="s2061">And then, in the spring, he was one of the soldiers – America gave 125, I believe, visas to the – at the end of the war, when the people went out of the army, and did not choose to go to Poland, or go to another country to settle, America offered the permanent visa, a permanent settlement in America.</span> <span id="s2062">And that was the spring – yes, not even – we got married in August, that’s six – eight months after we met.</span> <span id="s2063">We met in December – this was around Christmastime, the party was.</span> <span id="s2064">And the – in -- we got married, and then, I think it was some oct – October or November, when the letter from the American embassy came to my husband, that you are on the list of these people who are offered to settle.</span> <span id="s2065">Will you choose to take up – to pick up the – and go to live in America?</span> <span id="s2066">By that time, I – he was married, so he tried to get me on the – you know, on the list.</span> <span id="s2067">But then, Americans at that time were very strict about letting people come into America, so no sick person could go, n-no some political –</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">A: – things.</span> <span id="s2070">And they called me three times for the medical tests.</span> <span id="s2071">I di – I was very surprised – we were very surprised, not knowing why.</span> <span id="s2072">By the time – by this time, I think I was expecting a baby – not yet.</span> <span id="s2073">Well, anyway, we sa – finally got the ala – the permission for me to participate.</span> <span id="s2074">He and his mother, who was in the army too –</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">A: – who was in – in Russia with him, and he was in the cadet school, as I told you –</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">A: – in the Persia, and to Iraq, and to the Palestine.</span> <span id="s2079">But he – he and his mother went – were going – she was in the army too, so she went, as – entitled to it, and I was put on the list, and we went to the United States.</span> <span id="s2080">But because it was ending, the program, we were too late to be paid the – the – because they – they – they gave the tickets for nothing, to a certain degree, who wouldn’t – who said he’s going to.</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">A: We were too late for it, so my future mother-in-law – all then, not future, mother-in-law, had some friends who lend us her – some money, who paid the – some ticket transportation, and came in the boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">Q: Did you land here in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">A: In the – February, ’52.</span> <span id="s2085">1952.</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">Q: In February 1952.</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">A: Late February.</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">Q: Did you ever go back to Lvov?</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">A: I visited Lvov couple of times.</span> <span id="s2090">It was still – there was definitely – Poland was by then free, there were changes.</span> <span id="s2091">In 90 – 1996 was the year they had the – my elementary school, had the 180th anniversary, and they somehow invited some people who were at the school.</span> <span id="s2092">And my brother, who lives in eng – one of them lives in England, in England they were much more connected, they knew more of the things and he told us that there is a chance to go to – to Lvov, as part of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">A: – group –</span></p> <p><span id="s2095">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2096">A: – for that occasion.</span> <span id="s2097">So ’96 –</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">Q: Is when you went.</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">A: – was my – with my brothers, who were also started the school – lower grade –</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">A: – but started the school, and when one from then Texas, and my oth – the older brother lives in Texas now [indecipherable] but he went – came here, and we went together to – to –</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">Q: Lvov.</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">A: – Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2105">You have shared today a really – an amazing story.</span> <span id="s2106">As I said earlier, it would be very hard to believe that all of these things happened to one person, and that, you know, for – it starts with a 12 year old girl who has a normal life up until that point, and between age 12 and age 19, goes through so many different – I mean, hell and back.</span> <span id="s2107">What would you want – what would you want younger generations to understand about all of this?</span> <span id="s2108">About these experiences?</span> <span id="s2109">What do you think you’d want to pass on to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">A: That’s a very difficult question.</span> <span id="s2111">You have to stick to your ethics, to what you learned as a – whether it was only in school, or it was only in religion, or also only from watching your parents, watching the people – I – I consider myself lucky that even in Africa in the high school, we had extremely good people, honorable people, who were thinking along the lines that I was thinking, not carpe diem type of thing –</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">A: – not lightly look at – at life.</span> <span id="s2114">Be of some use to humanity.</span> <span id="s2115">Be a – a person who has lived, but gave something of herself to the – to return for good, that somehow I received from time to time, throughout these difficult times.</span> <span id="s2116">And also, I wo – maybe I always wanted something more serious, even if – I remember in small – in the small grades they – that I wasn’t a flighty, stupid, young girl, who just from one ice cream would go to a stupid movie although my parents would know where I could go, or where I shouldn’t go.</span> <span id="s2117">But anyway, I think that life is much more serious than just to catch up, or a false fame by something –</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">Q: When you were in London, right befo – before you met your husband, and you said you didn’t find any common language sometimes, and I wanted to ask you: did you feel lonely?</span> <span id="s2119">I mean, you had gone through such experi – [loud noise] [technical difficulties] [break] I guess I wanted to wrap up the interview with, what your final thoughts would be, and what you were able to maintain, and how you felt you had changed, if you had changed.</span> <span id="s2120">What final words would you want to leave with people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">A: As I mentioned, and you suggested that actually I didn’t have childhood; I was still standing mentally to a certain degree, or psychologically, a 12 year old girl who had to sometimes face more difficult things, working to – to get something to eat –</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">A: – or to help my mother to help us.</span> <span id="s2124">That made me much more aware of seriousness of life.</span> <span id="s2125">And when I came to England, to – so to speak to normal life, and went to London, and lived in London, met some other people, I still was not hungry for light – kind of young teenagers like nowadays you see –</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">A: – an – around, whether on television, or you met during that –</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">A: – stay in a – in England.</span> <span id="s2130">I wanted to study.</span> <span id="s2131">I was very close to my mother, and somehow they si – some of the girls that I worked at the cook’s office, that I said I worked after the second job in London, that I don’t know how you live like that; you are so close to your mother; whether you will be able to get married, because you won’t cut yourself off that closeness.</span> <span id="s2132">But I – I think that was maybe this – and maybe something of a un-conscience way of holding to something that holds me to pre-war times, that holds me to my father, in a sense, to the time when I was –</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">Q: Well you had –</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">A: – somehow –</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">A: – more serious looking at life, and also when – in the high school, I remember that I developed that feeling that the teachers and the chairman of our – director of our high school said, which was according to what I was thinking and what my father taught me, that by your behavior, you are ambassador of your country.</span> <span id="s2137">And I never stopped loving Poland, and always thinking that maybe some ter – something might happen, like the things that you did not plan happened, that you will go back.</span> <span id="s2138">And th – I will never got rid of my hope that – a-and longing for Lvov.</span> <span id="s2139">And I visited Lvov, then afterwards I visited twice or three times later.</span> <span id="s2140">Lvov was very neglected, and you could see the – kind of Ukrainians trying to cut all the traces to Polandism, and I could not find the names of the street that I knew, because first of all they were changed, but they were changed in the Ukrainian alphabet.</span> <span id="s2141">So I didn’t ever learn that Ukrainian, so – but I still had a feeling that I was walking on my traces – tracing my steps, when I was going to school.</span> <span id="s2142">I visited – my school was taken by – over by Ukrainian high school, but the – next to it was the – the boys’ school before the war, which now they united the girls’ school and boys’ school, Polish, one of two schools in Lvov, which is Polish, and Polish teachers, very high level of learning, and when Ukrainians are sending –</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">Q: Their children there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">A: – children there, because they have the chance then to go to Poland, to the universities.</span> <span id="s2145">More – it’s easier for them because Lvov University ha – is overflowing by the people from the villages, or from –</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2147">A: – other parts of Russia or Ukraine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">A: But this thing and – and the sense of value and sense of feeling responsible, that whatever you do, it somehow influences the lot of many people that –</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">Q: That you have an effect.</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">A: It has the effect, or somehow if people would talk to each other.</span> <span id="s2152">My – my son, the oldest son, when there was some boys who, as I told you, being of – having foreign name here in – in America too, that – that they – sometimes he was the victim of a bullying, and so to speak, and when they – they came to our house, and through – through the window, the bags – baggies full of
