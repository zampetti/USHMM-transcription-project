you tell me a little bit about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: When I was there, I knew very little about it.</span> <span id="s19">I visited there only for a short time.</span> <span id="s20">The reason we lived there is that close to Worms is a little village where my father grew up.</span> <span id="s21">You actually had to go to Worms by train in order to catch another means of transportation to this little town.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: What is the name of that little town?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Horschheim.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: Was your father’s family there for many generations?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: Yes, they had lived there for many generations.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Where was your mother from?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: My mother had been born in Frankfurt a/Main.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Had her family been there for a long time?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Her parents moved there after they got married.</span> <span id="s30">They moved there from another little town in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Did you have any brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: No, I am an only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: What sort of professions did your grandfathers have?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: My grandfather on my mother’s side, had a butcher shop.</span> <span id="s35">He owned a butcher shop.</span> <span id="s36">By the way, I never knew him, he died before I was born.</span> <span id="s37">My grandmother, on my mother’s side, grew up in the vineyard region near the Rhine River.</span> <span id="s38">She did not work outside the house, that was not common at that time.</span> <span id="s39">My father’s father lived always in this small town of Horschheim.</span> <span id="s40">He did some farming.</span> <span id="s41">My grandmother also never worked outside the home.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: What sort of education did your parents have?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Of course they graduated from high school.</span> <span id="s44">My mother had a few more years of education.</span> <span id="s45">I cannot recall the school she went to.</span> <span id="s46">She had been in Frankfurt, and in Frankfurt there was a better opportunity to further your education than there was in a village.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: What sort of religious education did they have?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: They attended synagogue services.</span> <span id="s49">For my father that meant and he always talked about it, two hours of hiking to Worms.</span> <span id="s50">By the way, in Worms was the oldest active synagogue in Europe.</span> <span id="s51">For my mother that was not a problem.</span> <span id="s52">In the city of Frankfurt there were several synagogues.</span> <span id="s53">Other than that, there was no religious instruction, as we know it now.</span> <span id="s54">They grew up and were taught by their parents and they knew the observances and Holy Days, etc.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Were they Orthodox?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: I believe you could call them Conservative.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: This means that they were a little liberal.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Yes, they were not strictly Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Would you say that they were fairly well assimilated?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: Oh, absolutely, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Did they have a lot of Gentile friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Yes, some very close friends.</span> <span id="s63">In Frankfurt, I recall when I grew up, a couple who had a child of my age.</span> <span id="s64">That was a non-Jewish couple.</span> <span id="s65">They were often together.</span> <span id="s66">They associated also with some of our relatives.</span> <span id="s67">There were several of these relatives living in Frankfurt with whom we got together.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: What kind of religious training did you have?</span> <span id="s69">Did you go to synagogue regularly?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: I attended a day school.</span> <span id="s71">There I, of course, learned Hebrew writing, reading and speaking.</span> <span id="s72">Unfortunately, I forgot a lot of it.</span> <span id="s73">My father and I, we walked every Friday evening to the synagogue and we attended, of course, together with my mother, the Holy Day services.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Did you have any relatives living in your home with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: My grandmother lived with us.</span> <span id="s76">I shared a room with my grandmother.</span> <span id="s77">That was the grandmother on my mother’s side who had been widowed.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Do you recall why you moved from Worms to Frankfurt a/Main?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Yes, it had to do with business establishment.</span> <span id="s80">Later, my father’s brother moved to Switzerland with his family.</span> <span id="s81">He urged my father to move likewise, because he saw great possibilities there, so we moved to Zurich, Switzerland.</span> <span id="s82">(47.30N, 8.30E) I attended school there.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: How old were you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Approximately six years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: During the years you lived in Frankfurt your grandmother moved with you and then stayed with you in Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Yes, she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: What kind of a home did you have in Switzerland?</span> <span id="s88">Was it in an apartment or a house?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: At that time, we lived in an apartment, actually in a very lovely large apartment.</span> <span id="s90">I do remember that well.</span> <span id="s91">When we moved back to Frankfurt, we lived in a house with a beautiful garden and I did a lot of gardening.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Did you go to school at all in Frankfurt, the first time you lived there?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: I went to a Catholic kindergarten.</span> <span id="s94">There was no other kindergarten available.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Do you remember if you were the only Jew in your class?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: I believe that, for a while, I was the only Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s97">That didn’t make any difference at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: You felt perfectly accepted?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: What kind of home did you have in Zurich?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: We had a very lovely apartment with a balcony.</span> <span id="s102">I even have pictures from that.</span> <span id="s103">I recall that we had a fairly formal living room.</span> <span id="s104">At that time, it was called a “salon”.</span> <span id="s105">It was a room with light furniture and a black piano in it.</span> <span id="s106">That impressed me quite a bit.</span> <span id="s107">In Switzerland, the school was quite different.</span> <span id="s108">Boys and girls went to school together.</span> <span id="s109">In wintertime the teachers asked us to bring our sleds to school and we went sleigh riding.</span> <span id="s110">Then Santa Claus came and each child had to recite something and we got some goodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Was this a public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Again, how many other Jewish children were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: I don’t believe that there were any.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: You also felt perfectly accepted?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Yes, very much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: You had some Christmas experiences then.</span> <span id="s118">What did you think of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: I guess that at that time already, I was very broadminded.</span> <span id="s120">My parents never objected to it, objected to my participation.</span> <span id="s121">I mean.</span> <span id="s122">I was never in any plays, or anything like that.</span> <span id="s123">When it came to gift accepting, I was also participating.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Did your parents celebrate Chanukah?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Oh yes, they did.</span> <span id="s126">They had the lighting of the candles and we gave little gifts on the first night.</span> <span id="s127">Later on, here in this country, I learned that it is customary to give a little gift every night.</span> <span id="s128">That was not done then.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Did you move back to Frankfurt for business reasons again?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Partly.</span> <span id="s131">My father had served in the German army, as a very young man, he was called back into the army (WWI) so he followed the crowd.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: I see, so he was drafted?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: Yes, he could have stayed in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s134">Then he would have been interned in Switzerland, but he felt that it was his duty to serve.</span> <span id="s135">So we moved back to Frankfurt and he served in WWI.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: So you and your mother and grandmother lived alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: How long was he gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: I believe for four years.</span> <span id="s140">He served in Belgium.</span> <span id="s141">He was attached to an anti-aircraft unit.</span> <span id="s142">I believe it was a division.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: What did your mother do during that time?</span> <span id="s144">Did she have any trouble with money?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: I do not recall these details.</span> <span id="s146">You know, as a child, you don’t question where the money comes from or where it went.</span> <span id="s147">I know that she did not work outside the house.</span> <span id="s148">She spent a lot of time with me.</span> <span id="s149">I would assume that there was some allotment of money coming in from the army.</span> <span id="s150">I believe that the soldiers were paid a little.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: So you went back to school again in Frankfurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Was that still public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: No, then I went to Day school, to Jewish Day School.</span> <span id="s155">This particular school was actually set up to prepare children to attend college later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: What did you learn there?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: We learned every subject and by the way, most of the teachers were professors.</span> <span id="s158">So we learned a great deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Did you have religious classes, as well as academic classes?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Yes, we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: What languages were spoken at the school you went to?</span> <span id="s162">Were you ever in a school where a language was spoken which you didn’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Well, do you mean foreign languages?</span> <span id="s164">They were not actually spoken, but they were taught.</span> <span id="s165">We first learned French for a few years, and then English.</span> <span id="s166">We were truly prepared to learn English, because it is a more difficult language.</span> <span id="s167">There also was some Latin inserted here and there, in the science courses which we took.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Your first language was German?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Was German also spoken in Zurich?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Yes, Zurich is in the German speaking part of Switzerland.</span> <span id="s172">Switzerland has different parts where they speak different languages.</span> <span id="s173">That is Italian and French, near these countries; and then they have a language all of their own called “Switzer -- deutch.”</span> <span id="s174">I, as a child, learned that very quickly.</span> <span id="s175">My mother didn’t understand me at all.</span> <span id="s176">English is a language which almost everybody speaks, at least as a second language.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Did you live in Frankfurt until you left Germany for good?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: After you completed your education, what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: I worked in one of the largest companies in Europe.</span> <span id="s181">An iron and metal company, in which line of business my husband is now.</span> <span id="s182">They had a tremendous organization.</span> <span id="s183">After I had to pass a test, I was hired.</span> <span id="s184">It is customary, or at least it was customary, that someone first had to work for three years as an apprentice and then go up the steps.</span> <span id="s185">You did not then, immediately, start at the highest rung of the ladder.</span> <span id="s186">I worked in an office, which was dealing with freight, since they shipped an enormous amount of material all over the world.</span> <span id="s187">We handled the correspondence and the insurance.</span> <span id="s188">That was quite involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: So what you did was sort of secretarial work?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Did you belong to any organization?</span> <span id="s192">Or did your parents belong to any organization?</span> <span id="s193">Something like professional organizations or social clubs?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: My parents belonged to some kind of music loving group.</span> <span id="s195">I can’t recall the name.</span> <span id="s196">My father was very musical.</span> <span id="s197">He played several instruments by ear.</span> <span id="s198">I had piano lessons for several years at the Conservatory in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s199">My mother had taken lessons in previous years.</span> <span id="s200">We often played a duet, while my father accompanied us on the violin.</span> <span id="s201">There was a lot of music in the home.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: What other cultural things did you enjoy doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: We had tickets to the Opera House and to the dramatic presentations.</span> <span id="s204">There was another little theater which presented operettas and plays.</span> <span id="s205">We used every opportunity to attend those.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Were your parents politically active at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: No.</span> <span id="s208">I belonged to a group where our slogan was “Pax--Freedom.’</span> <span id="s209">That was the only thing in which I participated.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: What organization was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: I do not recall the name.</span> <span id="s212">We were, as young people often are, very much for peace.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Did your parents vote?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: There wasn’t any voting going on.</span> <span id="s215">There was Rathenau (German Foreign Minister assassinated 6-24-1922) he was Jewish, and Hitler as Chancellor.</span> <span id="s216">(Actually there were several votes in Germany, mainly after the Weimar Republic was set up after WWI).</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: How did you feel about Zionism?</span> <span id="s218">Was there any contact with Zionist groups in your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Did you have any feeling about Palestine as a country, as a kind of homeland?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: We did not personally.</span> <span id="s222">My parents were never talking about going to Palestine.</span> <span id="s223">My father, who had a lot of foresight, he realized what was going on.</span> <span id="s224">He was the one who made the first steps to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s225">Things got so bad in Germany that we had to fear for our lives day by day.</span> <span id="s226">I cannot describe the fear we went through, it is impossible.</span> <span id="s227">It got steadily worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">My father contacted some cousins in New York whom he had never seen, but he knew their addresses and such.</span> <span id="s229">He wrote to them that not only did he feel that it was necessary to leave Germany, but to leave Europe.</span> <span id="s230">They apparently had heard about it, or read about it in the newspapers.</span> <span id="s231">They agreed with him and wrote him that they thought it was best to get started and they sent him the affidavit without asking him if he was married or had a family.</span> <span id="s232">The affidavit was for him alone.</span> <span id="s233">When he received this, he was almost heartbroken.</span> <span id="s234">He didn’t know what to do, since he didn’t want to leave without his family.</span> <span id="s235">We, of course, encouraged him by saying: “As soon as you are there, you can make the necessary arrangements for us to come, so that we can follow you!”</span> <span id="s236">My mother accompanied him to Hamburg to the boat which he took.</span> <span id="s237">From there on, I wrote letters every day telling him that things were getting worse, and that we had to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Did you experience anti-Semitism during your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Not until later.</span> <span id="s240">I went to a Jewish Day school where obviously there was no reason to have anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s241">A very close friend of mine who was not Jewish, her family accepted me practically as their own.</span> <span id="s242">So I did not experience any anti-Semitism until Hitler started.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: A lot of people have said that it seemed as if when Hitler came to power, someone had thrown a switch.</span> <span id="s244">Did you experience that also?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s246">He aroused the anger by pointing out things to the masses, like hypnotism.</span> <span id="s247">He convinced them that they needed more, what he called; Lebensraum i.e. space to live in.</span> <span id="s248">Germany is a relatively small country.</span> <span id="s249">He convinced them that it was all the fault of the Jews.</span> <span id="s250">There were enough people who believed that.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: I kind of wonder that such violent feelings could have arisen out of nowhere.</span> <span id="s252">There must have been some basis, you know, at least some mistrust of Jews.</span> <span id="s253">So that was something to build on.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: I think, from what I observed here, and you probably have heard about these cases also, when people are dissatisfied, anything you promised them which sounds better, they go for, even if it hurts their next door neighbor.</span> <span id="s255">They will be good friends with a person, but then they feel: “This is not my way; I can live much better, if this is changed.”</span> <span id="s256">And that is what he promised them.</span> <span id="s257">Of course, you know how easily young people are influenced.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: How would you describe your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: I grew up like any other child.</span> <span id="s260">My parents did everything possible for me, since I was the only child.</span> <span id="s261">My father worshipped the ground on which I walked.</span> <span id="s262">He only took me along when he sold interiors for beauty shops.</span> <span id="s263">That’s what he did for a living later on.</span> <span id="s264">He had been an architect and then went into this line of business.</span> <span id="s265">He designed interiors and then sold the ideas and the appliances.</span> <span id="s266">I admired his salesmanship and I learned a great deal from him.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: Did he have a lot of friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: I don’t believe that there were a lot of friends, actually I don’t believe that anyone has a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s269">If you have one or two good friends, you are lucky.</span> <span id="s270">I remember Jackie Gleason saying on the radio many years ago, when someone asked him whether he had a lot of friends, so he said: “A lot of people are interested to be close to me,” you know they wanted to have his influence, but if I have one friend I can consider myself lucky.”</span> <span id="s271">I think that that is the case for everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: I think that that is true.</span> <span id="s273">Are there any special events from your childhood which you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: No, nothing out of the ordinary.</span> <span id="s275">I mean from the early childhood.</span> <span id="s276">I recall that we always had nice dinners on the High Holy Days and things like that.</span> <span id="s277">On Jewish New Years (Rosh Hashanah0 we were taught in Day school, of course, to write a beautiful letter to our parents promising them that, from now on, we would do everything and obey and all.</span> <span id="s278">That letter was put under the plate before dinner time.</span> <span id="s279">Then the mother was very surprised to see this letter.</span> <span id="s280">We always were very proud of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: You tend to remember Holy Days particularly.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Yes, I remember these and also birthdays.</span> <span id="s283">We were always celebrating birthdays together with other family members.</span> <span id="s284">Since my mother is also an only child, she was close to some cousins who were about the same age.</span> <span id="s285">They got together, somehow they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: Did you travel much and go on vacation?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: I usually went to visit relatives in smaller towns.</span> <span id="s288">That was delightful, because it was a new way of life for me, whether we went to farm country or to where some of our relatives owned vineyards.</span> <span id="s289">Sometimes in the vineyards we helped to pick the grapes.</span> <span id="s290">These memories are associated with children in these little towns.</span> <span id="s291">I saw for the first time cows being milked.</span> <span id="s292">We don’t see that in the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Did you live with your parents until you got married?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s295">It was not customary at that time for a girl to move out.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: You said that you worked for a while before you met your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: So you didn’t really feel a sense of dependence since you had your own income?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: No.</span> <span id="s300">As a matter of fact, I felt an obligation toward my parents.</span> <span id="s301">I gave my parents a certain amount of my salary, actually most of it, from the large amount I earned, and they kept it for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: How did you meet your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Through his sister.</span> <span id="s304">She met me one afternoon and in the evening she, her brother, a date and I had planned to go to a dance.</span> <span id="s305">That is where I met him.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: How had you met her?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Through another girl friend.</span> <span id="s308">On a Saturday afternoon we went to a “Coffee”, I had nothing to do with alcohol, by the way.</span> <span id="s309">There was a band playing outside, in a lovely garden.</span> <span id="s310">I believe I had some ice cream and a piece of cake and we talked.</span> <span id="s311">That particular evening, they were going to a building with a ballroom.</span> <span id="s312">I had a date to go there also.</span> <span id="s313">I believe that it was in April.</span> <span id="s314">We met that evening.</span> <span id="s315">She came with her brother, and I came with my date.</span> <span id="s316">During the evening, his sister and I exchanged partners.</span> <span id="s317">This is how I met my husband.</span> <span id="s318">Later on, he told me that his sister came home, they lived in a suburb of Frankfurt, and said that she had met a girl and would like for him to meet her, and that is how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: So she knew right away that you were the right one.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: We encountered some opposition on the part of his parents because it was the tradition that the oldest son should wait until the daughter is married.</span> <span id="s321">They stuck to that tradition for five years.</span> <span id="s322">We were, what you call here, going steady, always being thought of as an ideal couple.</span> <span id="s323">My father said, at the time, “Now you either make up your mind to get married, or you break up.</span> <span id="s324">This has gone on long enough.”</span> <span id="s325">Then we decided to get married in 1933.</span> <span id="s326">I can’t think of the date, shortly thereafter when my husband was forced to make changes.</span> <span id="s327">First of all, he lost his job with the company.</span> <span id="s328">That was also a company which dealt in iron and metal.</span> <span id="s329">Of course, that was coincidental.</span> <span id="s330">Then he opened his own company.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: I think it was in early 1934.</span> <span id="s333">He was very successful.</span> <span id="s334">With one of his former co-workers as a partner, they opened this company.</span> <span id="s335">Even with the industry dying, (the depression was there) they bought the merchandise and sold it then to the middlemen, that is to wholesalers.</span> <span id="s336">Anyway, as things got worse, due to the Nazi’s, he sold the company to a non-Jewish man who knew the line of business, but didn’t know anything about bookkeeping.</span> <span id="s337">So he came to our house and said that if I would be the bookkeeper for him, he would bring the papers over in the evening.</span> <span id="s338">I said “ I am a Jewish person and I am not supposed to.”</span> <span id="s339">He said, “Nobody will see me.”</span> <span id="s340">So he came in the evening and I did the books for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Approximately at the same time, a young man, whom we actually knew by name, he was about twenty years old, came.</span> <span id="s342">The young man had lost his job working for a confectionary, also because they were Jewish owners they were forced to close.</span> <span id="s343">The young man said that he lives with his widowed mother in a small apartment and he needs to have some income.</span> <span id="s344">He wondered what he could do.</span> <span id="s345">I asked him whether he had the recipes for the confectionary products.</span> <span id="s346">He said that he had them.</span> <span id="s347">I told him to come back in two days and I would see what I could do in the meantime.</span> <span id="s348">When he came back, I believe that this must have been in 1935, and I told him that I had lined up five bank clerks who would like to learn this confectionary business.</span> <span id="s349">They wanted to do it because they had been told that they should know some other way to earn a living, other than by being a white collar worker.</span> <span id="s350">As a matter of fact, my father who was already in the U.S. wrote to us, “Learn something different, such as watch-making or whatever.”</span> <span id="s351">The young confectioner was delighted and said: “Sure I can teach these people, but where would I do it?”</span> <span id="s352">I said that they could use my kitchen.</span> <span id="s353">He said, “But I couldn’t pay you much.”</span> <span id="s354">He asked what he could charge and I suggested an amount.</span> <span id="s355">I can’t remember it.</span> <span id="s356">He said, “Your husband can be one of our students and I will not charge him!”</span> <span id="s357">This is the way it was done that he could use my kitchen and that my husband could learn that trade, making the most fantastic candies.</span> <span id="s358">Now the problem was to get the ingredients, because it was all rationed.</span> <span id="s359">The rationing included eggs, butter and other things.</span> <span id="s360">We had some connections with people in the countryside, and so we were able to obtain all these products which were needed.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">At that time, it must have been later, possibly 1937, because my father was already in the U.S. and he had advised us to learn something else to earn our living.</span> <span id="s362">We had also applied for our visas to leave Germany.</span> <span id="s363">That meant you had to be prepared that some of the Nazis would come any day and search the apartment, at any time.</span> <span id="s364">So when we heard the door bell, they immediately threw the aprons, which I had made for them, and the recipes into the kitchen cabinet and started sitting around the dining room table with English books in front of them, pretending to learn English.</span> <span id="s365">Fortunately, no one ever came, but when someone rang the bell, it certainly was a tense moment.</span> <span id="s366">At least no one of the people we anticipated and we were afraid of.</span> <span id="s367">We made beautiful assortments of candies and this man who bought my husband’s business came in the evening.</span> <span id="s368">We showed him what we had.</span> <span id="s369">He was our best customer.</span> <span id="s370">My story is not as dramatic than maybe others are, however, it shows you what went on.</span> <span id="s371">When we came to New York, my husband was full of ideas that he was going to make candies.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: I want to go back, before we get to your adventures in this country.</span> <span id="s373">Where were your mother and your in-laws during the time you were in Germany after your father had left?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: My mother lived with my grandmother in an apartment.</span> <span id="s375">We, of course, had our own apartment.</span> <span id="s376">My in-laws also lived in a different apartment.</span> <span id="s377">We were very eager to leave Germany.</span> <span id="s378">My mother could have come over anytime to the United States as the wife of a person who was a resident, however she wanted to wait for us.</span> <span id="s379">Since we had applied for the visas, we were asked to make a list of every item which we wanted to take with us.</span> <span id="s380">I am not certain whether you heard this story from others.</span> <span id="s381">To make that list, I had to go through the apartment for weeks to write such things as a picture representing a scene with a frame.</span> <span id="s382">Every item had to be written down.</span> <span id="s383">That takes a long time.</span> <span id="s384">This list is hard to be approved by some of these Nazi officials for us to take these items along.</span> <span id="s385">We also had to make a list of the items which we would take along on the trip.</span> <span id="s386">Now my mother and I both owned a muskrat coat.</span> <span id="s387">Some people had dared to sew money into the lining of such coats.</span> <span id="s388">We didn’t because we heard about what then happened to these poor people.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">When I came to the office where I presented this list, this official said to me, (it was November 1938), “You have here three cotton dresses, what do you want with cotton dresses in winter?”</span> <span id="s390">I told him, “These are house dresses, and I have to launder them.”</span> <span id="s391">Then he said, “ Our Fuhrer said that a toothbrush is enough!”</span> <span id="s392">I said, “ If that’s what he says, I am glad that we have a toothbrush.”</span> <span id="s393">You had to be very careful with what you were saying, and how you reacted.</span> <span id="s394">He let it go through, but we were searched on the train.</span> <span id="s395">You know they looked at the items and particularly looked in he linings.</span> <span id="s396">You did risk your life if you wanted to get money out in this way.</span> <span id="s397">People had sewn money into stuffed animals with which children played.</span> <span id="s398">You know that people had the strangest ideas.</span> <span id="s399">We were allowed $4,00 per person.</span> <span id="s400">That is all we could take with us.</span> <span id="s401">We were actually fleeing from our apartment, because we left on about the last day on which we could get out.</span> <span id="s402">On the 9th of November, 1938, we left Frankfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Our boat was not supposed to leave, I believe until November 20th.</span> <span id="s404">By the way, we never made it to Hamburg.</span> <span id="s405">We boarded the train in Frankfurt and when we got to the main Frankfurt train station, they lined us up and said: “Don’t hurry, your last train has left.”</span> <span id="s406">We didn’t listen and went to the platform anyway, and we boarded the train.</span> <span id="s407">In the compartment, one man who sat next to my husband, started a conversation.</span> <span id="s408">When we came to a stretch between Germany and Holland (between the two passport offices) which was called “No-Man’s land” he said, “Well, aren’t you glad to get out of this mess!”</span> <span id="s409">My husband said, “I don’t want to discuss anything.”</span> <span id="s410">We had the feeling that this was someone who would have reported us and held us back.</span> <span id="s411">You couldn’t even talk to anyone.</span> <span id="s412">We were very much afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">We arrived in Amsterdam and went to the house of some friends whom my husband had known, who actually grew up with him.</span> <span id="s414">They had settled in Holland.</span> <span id="s415">These people were very Orthodox.</span> <span id="s416">We arrived on a Friday night.</span> <span id="s417">They woke up their maid and prepared some lunch for us.</span> <span id="s418">We saw eggs again legally.</span> <span id="s419">That was very rare in Germany.</span> <span id="s420">I believe that we had been allowed one egg a week.</span> <span id="s421">Since we had a small child, we tried to keep it for her use, in case of need so usually by the time we got to it, it was no longer fresh enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: So, when you left, your party consisted of you and your husband, your mother and your daughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Yes, my daughter was born in Frankfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: And your grandmother?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: No, we had to leave my grandmother behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: She did not have a visa?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Why didn’t she have one?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Because the U.S. government made it very difficult for us to bring her.</span> <span id="s430">The requirements were not as they are today.</span> <span id="s431">Today they let people from Cuba in, they let all kinds of people in today.</span> <span id="s432">That wasn’t the case then.</span> <span id="s433">At that time, you had to have someone who vouched for you in what was called an affidavit.</span> <span id="s434">We were, I believe, at least four times in Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s435">That is where the American Consulate for our region was.</span> <span id="s436">We were rejected four times because they said that the affidavit we presented was not financially adequate for our family.</span> <span id="s437">Of course, things were not so rosy here at that time either.</span> <span id="s438">The depression still prevailed in 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">On the other side, as much as they wanted to eliminate the Jews, they wouldn’t let anyone out of the country who had any criminal record.</span> <span id="s440">So we had it both ways.</span> <span id="s441">The ones didn’t let us leave and the others they didn’t allow us to come here.</span> <span id="s442">In addition to the person who gave us the affidavit, we needed proof that we would be all right.</span> <span id="s443">I believe that the first affidavit was from a relative of my father’s.</span> <span id="s444">That was rejected, when a brother of this fellow’s also sent out an affidavit.</span> <span id="s445">Through someone who I had helped in Germany and, who had a very rich cousin in New York, who at the time had an income of $1,000 a month, we got another affidavit.</span> <span id="s446">That was someone who knew nothing about us, let alone ever seen us.</span> <span id="s447">So finally, after all, the papers were approved, and we had to go to Stuttgart every time they examined the papers.</span> <span id="s448">One time, I believe the last time, we were there, they also had a physical examination there, and also asked us what we were going to do in the U.S.</span> <span id="s449">We had been warned not to say that we had a job (it was illegal to hire foreigners).</span> <span id="s450">So we had to say that we didn’t know yet.</span> <span id="s451">They had warned us, particularly since they didn’t have enough jobs for their own people in this country.</span> <span id="s452">My grandmother had no papers for herself.</span> <span id="s453">In November 1938 when we left, and we had promised that we would send them for her, and we had promised to do the same for my husband’s family.</span> <span id="s454">Unfortunately, none of them made it to safety.</span> <span id="s455">They were taken to concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: You left then just about Kristallnacht (the night of 9th to 10th of November, 1938 when the synagogues and the stores owned by Jews were burned and looted?)</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: I believe that that night was when they rounded up the Jewish men.</span> <span id="s458">We just made it under the wire.</span> <span id="s459">In fact, when we came to Holland, the word spread that a Jewish family with a child had arrived.</span> <span id="s460">People whom we had never seen or heard from came and brought things for my daughter because they were so overcome.</span> <span id="s461">From Holland, we first crossed the channel to London, England, on a very stormy night, and we were terribly seasick.</span> <span id="s462">There we waited for the departure of our boat which then left from Southampton.</span> <span id="s463">We stayed in London with relatives, who were also very orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: How were you related to these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: They were first cousins of my husband.</span> <span id="s466">They lived in a very lovely house in a suburb of London.</span> <span id="s467">The heating was a big problem, at that time, in England.</span> <span id="s468">They had fireplaces in every room.</span> <span id="s469">That means that right at the fireplace it was warm and in other parts of the room, it was very cold.</span> <span id="s470">However, we were very happy to be there.</span> <span id="s471">We learned through sources, about which I cannot speak, that my husband’s brother was taken to a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: That happened soon after you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s474">I believe the next night.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Do you know which one?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s477">My father’s sister’s husband, that was my uncle, was also taken to a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s478">We were, of course, very much worried about both of them.</span> <span id="s479">My husband, I believe through a former business friend, who was living in London then, got a lead on someone who could help us.</span> <span id="s480">Somehow we got a cigarette lighter smuggled out of Germany as a lead to get my uncle out.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">I was directed to take some money and go to a man who was willing to get my husband’s brother out of the camp.</span> <span id="s482">I had to go to a shop on I believe Regent Street in London.</span> <span id="s483">I am not certain about that, but in any case, it was a very famous business street.</span> <span id="s484">I was directed to go to a tobacco store.</span> <span id="s485">In any case, with a little cigarette holder in my hand.</span> <span id="s486">I was to ask them if they knew who would manufacture these things.</span> <span id="s487">They directed me to a place in Hammersmith, a factory in Hammersmith, and they told me that I should ask for a Mr. Simon, who was the owner.</span> <span id="s488">I went there by bus, to that factory, asked for Mr. Simon and was led to his office.</span> <span id="s489">I stood in front of a man whom I had never seen before.</span> <span id="s490">I had to convince him that this was very urgent.</span> <span id="s491">I showed him this little cigarette holder.</span> <span id="s492">That was the only connection which I had.</span> <span id="s493">I told him that we have to rely on the kindness of some strangers to get this man, my uncle who had been arrested, out; that he was taken to a concentration camp because he was Jewish and for not other reason.</span> <span id="s494">He listened to me for a while and then he said “Yes.”</span> <span id="s495">So we got the necessary papers ready and my uncle finally came to London, but we had already left when they came.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: I was not aware of a couple of things.</span> <span id="s497">First, I am not certain when the concentration camps actually started, when the Germans started using them.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: They started using them in 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: I was not aware, also, that you could get people out.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: At that time, you could.</span> <span id="s501">Later on, you no longer could.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: That people had to put up money to get people released.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: Not any more later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">I translated some of the documents which are exhibited in the Building of the Jewish Center.</span> <span id="s505">I don’t know if you have seen them.</span> <span id="s506">Have you?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: I believe that I have, but I don’t understand them.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: I translated them into English, so they are in English.</span> <span id="s509">They are in glass cases.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: I must be thinking about something else.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: It is written there, black on white, what their plans were to eliminate every one, and how they were going to go about it.</span> <span id="s512">I accomplished at least to get my uncle out and that my husband got his brother out.</span> <span id="s513">Then we went to New York City by boat from Southampton.</span> <span id="s514">My father picked us up at the pier in New York City.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: What had your father been doing, during all this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: He had the great talent of being able to draw and to paint.</span> <span id="s517">Through someone he met in New York city, my father was advised to go into a store in New York on Fifth Avenue, or wherever.</span> <span id="s518">In that store they gave him postcards and asked him to paint them whichever way he wanted with whatever he wanted and to bring them back.</span> <span id="s519">He did that for several weeks.</span> <span id="s520">He told us at the time, such things as he did a hundred postcards this time or so many another.</span> <span id="s521">I knew by standing next to my father as a child that he did very fast work.</span> <span id="s522">So he did this for a while and, one day, he came to this place.</span> <span id="s523">The place was closed and he asked around.</span> <span id="s524">He was told that the people who were nearby the store did not know, that the people had disappeared.</span> <span id="s525">So naturally, he lost the last consignment.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Then he went to someone else, an artist.</span> <span id="s527">He was able to be hired by a studio which painted trays, silent butlers and hampers.</span> <span id="s528">I can show you some of them.</span> <span id="s529">he did beautiful work.</span> <span id="s530">He was working there, for a year or so after we arrived.</span> <span id="s531">He had rented a furnished apartment for us.</span> <span id="s532">In the taxi going to this apartment, he told us that ‘all that counts here is the mighty dollar.”</span> <span id="s533">He was right.</span> <span id="s534">We went into the apartment and on the first Sunday we went to this man who had actually helped us to come to the United States, and who had a large income and who had promised that he would take care of us.</span> <span id="s535">He lived on Fifth Avenue.</span> <span id="s536">We saw the doorman opening the door, that was something with which we were not familiar.</span> <span id="s537">We saw this man, whose name by the way is Rich.</span> <span id="s538">My husband had prepared a beautiful assortment of candies in a lovely box which he presented to Mrs. Rich.</span> <span id="s539">He said, “That is what I want to do now, I want to make candy.”</span> <span id="s540">Well, she tried one, then she tried another one.</span> <span id="s541">Then she said, “How much would you charge?”</span> <span id="s542">He answered “$1,20 a pound.”</span> <span id="s543">She discouraged him very much.</span> <span id="s544">She said, “Here you can buy the finest candy for $.50, and you have nothing here with marshmallows.”</span> <span id="s545">We knew nothing about marshmallows anymore than about the man in the moon.</span> <span id="s546">We didn’t even know what it was.</span> <span id="s547">Then she added, “You don’t have any here with peppermints, either.”</span> <span id="s548">To us at the time, chocolate and peppermints together was unheard of.</span> <span id="s549">We had used chocolate and almonds and coconuts.</span> <span id="s550">In other words, she was not very optimistic about the project.</span> <span id="s551">I told her that I would like to paint paper napkins, that means to make initials on the paper napkins.</span> <span id="s552">She said, “Oh, this is nice.</span> <span id="s553">How much would you charge?”</span> <span id="s554">I said, “One hundred for $1,00.”</span> <span id="s555">So she said, “oh.</span> <span id="s556">Many of my friends would like them.”</span> <span id="s557">She gave me some addresses.</span> <span id="s558">I did 100.</span> <span id="s559">I hung a cord in the room and hung them up to dry.</span> <span id="s560">Then I took the hundred by subway.</span> <span id="s561">I delivered them and got $1.00 for them.</span> <span id="s562">That is how we earned our living in the beginning Then my husband heard about Fuller Brushes.</span> <span id="s563">(People used to take items made by Fuller Brush Co. and sell them door to door to make a living.)</span> <span id="s564">He sold Fuller Brushes for a while.</span> <span id="s565">He said that he had a very good inside training in American business.</span> <span id="s566">He learned a great deal that way by selling Fuller Brushes,</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: I had just heard about that.</span> <span id="s568">What was your first impression of the United States.</span> <span id="s569">Most of the people I talked to came through New York City.</span> <span id="s570">Some said that because it is not as old as the cities they had come from, they were somewhat snobbish.</span> <span id="s571">I have heard mixed reviews.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: We were glad that our lives had been saved.</span> <span id="s573">Therefore, anything which would have been offered to us was wonderful.</span> <span id="s574">My father’s boss and his wife and her sister came to visit us, in this apartment.</span> <span id="s575">Their question was: “How do you like New York?”</span> <span id="s576">We answered, “Wonderful!”</span> <span id="s577">Then they asked, “ How do you like America?”</span> <span id="s578">Again we said.</span> <span id="s579">“Wonderful!”</span> <span id="s580">Then they told us that you are always supposed to say, “Thank you,’ (after remarks such as, “You have a nice coat”) , which we were not used to.</span> <span id="s581">I had learned English you know, in school.</span> <span id="s582">Later on we learned a great deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">After this experience with the paper napkins, I found all kinds of jobs.</span> <span id="s584">I am somewhat handy at doing things with my hands.</span> <span id="s585">I thought that I would make lamp shades, such as I had made for our own use in Germany.</span> <span id="s586">I would also sew leather gloves by hand.</span> <span id="s587">I had never done any of these things.</span> <span id="s588">I found some metal disks with holes in them on which we had to sew beads in a certain pattern.</span> <span id="s589">They were used as ornaments on women’s coats.</span> <span id="s590">They paid about $.35 a dozen.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Did you do this at night?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Yes, that was homework.</span> <span id="s593">Then I found another place where they cut horseshoes and riding boots.</span> <span id="s594">They used these metal disks also as ornaments.</span> <span id="s595">The stock here was leather.</span> <span id="s596">You had to stuff the boots with cotton and stitch them.</span> <span id="s597">Again, we got $.36.</span> <span id="s598">Then while you were talking to other women, you found different kinds of jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Then I went with a friend, as usually it was downtown New York, to a place where they showed us knitted vests, they were cardigans.</span> <span id="s600">They showed us that they had flowers embroidered in the front.</span> <span id="s601">We copied this design without a pattern on the cardigans.</span> <span id="s602">He gave us a dozen to take home and paid us $1,50 for a dozen, that is for the embroidery.</span> <span id="s603">The woman who came brought them back with only one side being embroidered, that is all they knew.</span> <span id="s604">They were just glad to have something.</span> <span id="s605">It was obvious that they didn’t know much about embroidery.</span> <span id="s606">Then one day, the fellow who gave us the cardigans said to me, “ Here is another pattern!”</span> <span id="s607">That was a whole scenery, a windmill and a Dutch girl and a Dutch boy and tulips and such.</span> <span id="s608">For $1.50 a dozen, can you imagine that it was much more difficult.</span> <span id="s609">He said, “ You are one of my best workers, why don’t you try it.”</span> <span id="s610">I tried it for $4.50 a dozen.</span> <span id="s611">We took our leather hat boxes, that is what we carried it in.</span> <span id="s612">Sometimes we went to a nearby park and sat there and stitched.</span> <span id="s613">At that time, sitting in a park was not dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: It seems like a lot of work which you did for that little money.</span> <span id="s615">I have embroidered things before and they are a lot of work.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Well it is.</span> <span id="s617">When I was sitting at home and doing this, I had the radio on.</span> <span id="s618">I listened to the radio about a story where the boy and girl met.</span> <span id="s619">That they went to the park and sat on a bench and talked about their future and Pillsbury is the best flour.</span> <span id="s620">Now this didn’t make any sense to me at all.</span> <span id="s621">I wondered, “What in the world does that mean?”</span> <span id="s622">That, of course, was the commercial.</span> <span id="s623">I had never heard of any such things.</span> <span id="s624">You know, naturally you come across something which, to you, is an everyday event.</span> <span id="s625">That happens and you never give it a second thought.</span> <span id="s626">However, I learned a lot of English by listening, that is English which you can use.</span> <span id="s627">We went to a butcher’s shop and I said, “Give me a piece of meat, not fat.”</span> <span id="s628">I didn’t know the word “lean.’</span> <span id="s629">You know, you don’t use all these words daily, while you are learning English.</span> <span id="s630">It’s a different story to the country and to speak the language.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: So you learned a lot of expressions and phrases.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s633">One day this friend of mine, who was a milliner in Germany, said, “I have a wonderful address here!</span> <span id="s634">.</span> <span id="s635">Finally I am getting into my field.</span> <span id="s636">You have to come with me.</span> <span id="s637">We have to go there in the evening.”</span> <span id="s638">We didn’t know why we had to go there in the evening.</span> <span id="s639">We were laughing about it.</span> <span id="s640">We said we had night jobs!</span> <span id="s641">We went to an apartment uptown in Manhattan.</span> <span id="s642">There were two sisters who were very nice to us.</span> <span id="s643">They showed us straw, braided straw.</span> <span id="s644">They said, “You start with 18 inches and make it 3 inches wide.”</span> <span id="s645">I didn’t know what they were talking about.</span> <span id="s646">I don’t think that my friend did either.</span> <span id="s647">So I said, “Would you mind showing us, at least the beginning, so that we don’t ruin your material?”</span> <span id="s648">it turned out that these were brims for hats.</span> <span id="s649">I believe that it was also $1.50 a dozen.</span> <span id="s650">It took more than three hours for the first few, I believe that is for each one I made.</span> <span id="s651">That is what happens until you get the knack of it.</span> <span id="s652">I had never worked with straw before.</span> <span id="s653">So we went there and we saw a lot of other women.</span> <span id="s654">However, we still couldn’t understand why we had to go there in the evening.</span> <span id="s655">One lady talked to the two of us and said, “You are my best workers.</span> <span id="s656">You come to my factory.”</span> <span id="s657">Then, suddenly a light went on.</span> <span id="s658">The factory was on 39th Street, downtown.</span> <span id="s659">She said then.</span> <span id="s660">“Don’t go inside.</span> <span id="s661">Just bring your work to the cashier.”</span> <span id="s662">Why not inside?</span> <span id="s663">Because it was a union shop.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: I see, she didn’t want to disturb union standards?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: This is the second interview with Carmen Appel.</span> <span id="s668">This is Julie Orenstein and it is August 3, 1984</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: When we talked last time you told me about making straw hats and about how you got involved in a union shop.</span> <span id="s670">I wanted to go back a little about this couple, the Riches, and how you went to them with your early ideas about making a living.</span> <span id="s671">How did you hear about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: We had, in Frankfurt, Germany, a business which was similar to what was here, iron and metal, which we bought from factories and sold to mills.</span> <span id="s673">When Hitler decided that a Jewish family should not have any non-Jewish employees, we had to replace our help and we hired a young man as a butler.</span> <span id="s674">It was his brother that we gave a job to in the business.</span> <span id="s675">He was, of course, very anxious to leave, like everybody else who was Jewish.</span> <span id="s676">I was helpful in getting him the papers.</span> <span id="s677">I went to different agencies with him, and to different places where he could get the necessary papers.</span> <span id="s678">He had a cousin in New York who gave him the necessary affidavit.</span> <span id="s679">This same cousin, after this young man came to the U.S., he said that he would do what he could to help us get out.</span> <span id="s680">This was Mr. Rich, who gave us an additional affidavit.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: He helped you find little odd jobs later?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: No.</span> <span id="s683">He did nothing like that.</span> <span id="s684">He also was not the only one who gave us an affidavit.</span> <span id="s685">I believe that I made it clear that the American Consulate refused us several times for the reason that the affidavits were “not enough” to back a family of four.</span> <span id="s686">My husband, daughter and me and my mother, who had waited with us so as to go with us across the ocean.</span> <span id="s687">The American Consulate was considering the circumstances here during the depression which was still going on.</span> <span id="s688">That is why they were anxious to have people with large incomes vouch for us so that we would not be welfare cases.</span> <span id="s689">(The affidavit of supports were to insure that the individual, or family who came to the U.S. would not become a burden on the welfare system.</span> <span id="s690">They did not have any legal force which would insure that.</span> <span id="s691">They were only moral obligations.</span> <span id="s692">They had, after several bad experiences, to be backed by at least “extracts” from the previous year’s income tax return, which then became a public document.)</span> <span id="s693">That was the reason why we needed more than the affidavit of one person.</span> <span id="s694">We got affidavits from my father’s cousin and several others.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: Could you tell me a little about the apartment in which you lived in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: I again mention my father who was the pioneer in our family.</span> <span id="s697">He had rented a furnished apartment in Manhattan.</span> <span id="s698">That was the first time I was confronted with things I had never seen before.</span> <span id="s699">There was a contraption above the sink which you had to pull on.</span> <span id="s700">It came down and people hung their laundry on it, when the weather was not good.</span> <span id="s701">When the weather was good, you hung your laundry outside the kitchen window via a pulley which was attached to the next house.</span> <span id="s702">Of course, since I had never seen this before and no one had told me about it, or how to operate it, the first few times I hung the laundry over the sink.</span> <span id="s703">I got everything dripping wet and I was told that this was not the way to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">We also had to learn that in the elevator the men took their hats off when there was a lady present.</span> <span id="s705">Of course, in New York City more people go up or down then walk on the even ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Then there was the shopping.</span> <span id="s707">We discovered Campbell soups.</span> <span id="s708">That was a big treat for us.</span> <span id="s709">We found the words for things we just didn’t know.</span> <span id="s710">The merchants on Broadway knew us and wanted to do us a favor so they started to speak to us in broken German.</span> <span id="s711">We definitely didn’t want that.</span> <span id="s712">I wanted to improve my English, however, we struggled along.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: Was it a good neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: It was middle class, at that time.</span> <span id="s715">Now I understand that this neighborhood, I have not been back there, has gotten to be mainly Puerto Rican and people from other countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: You mentioned several times people you met.</span> <span id="s717">Were they people you worked with on small jobs?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s719">By the way, the information I got for these little jobs was from Jewish agencies.</span> <span id="s720">They were generally located around Times Square.</span> <span id="s721">When I used the subway the first time, I came up the steps and looked around and saw all the beautifully lit up advertisement signs.</span> <span id="s722">I tried to remember one particular one so I would know the next time how to get off and how to get back to this place.</span> <span id="s723">When I told someone that I go by the “Red Roses” that are up on this building they laughed and said that it was whiskey.</span> <span id="s724">Of course, I hadn’t known that.</span> <span id="s725">This is where I got the addresses from.</span> <span id="s726">I went there like many of the other newcomers, mainly women.</span> <span id="s727">Then we went to the wholesalers and got the work.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: When you were not working, did you have time to socialize?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: No!</span> <span id="s730">No socializing and no cultural activities.</span> <span id="s731">We would go to the museums.</span> <span id="s732">Which were free of charge, of course.</span> <span id="s733">My father was already acquainted with these things.</span> <span id="s734">He took us to these places and we took advantage of them.</span> <span id="s735">As far as opera and concerts were concerned, they were beyond our financial means.</span> <span id="s736">But we were so busy day in, and day out worrying about income, that we just didn’t have time for that.</span> <span id="s737">My daughter was small and my mother took care of her while I went on these trips to pick up work and come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: Did you live with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: No, my mother came and took care of the child.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: So she also helped you working?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: Definitely yes, that was our agreement.</span> <span id="s742">We all did some work so that we would get some income.</span> <span id="s743">The income wasn’t much, but we wanted to be independent.</span> <span id="s744">We got a little from each job.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: You told me how you were with this friend of yours when you first discovered that you were involved with this unionized job, when the phone rang and we had to stop</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: What happened then when you had gotten to the cashier and that is as far as you were to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s749">I see what you want.</span> <span id="s750">These two young ladies who gave us the work, and we had no idea why we had to come to their apartment, and then later on we were told to talk to the cashier only.</span> <span id="s751">We learned a lot on that job and we made pretty good money until my husband found this position here in Dayton.</span> <span id="s752">He came here by himself first, and after four weeks he called us and told us that we should get things ready and come.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: How long were you in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: Altogether for 18 months.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: How old was your daughter when you came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: She was about five years old when we moved to Dayton.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q; Had she started school yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: How did you discover the job in Dayton?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: Through a relative of my father’s.</span> <span id="s761">This man was in a related line of business.</span> <span id="s762">My husband had found a job, also through someone he either met or knew from Europe.</span> <span id="s763">I don’t remember, in Bergen, New Jersey.</span> <span id="s764">This meant he had to get up at 5.00 AM.</span> <span id="s765">He had to take the subway, the streetcar, the ferry and other means of transportation to get to this place.</span> <span id="s766">He explained it to me that there was a large hall, where they stored metal.</span> <span id="s767">In that same hall, they also made this metal.</span> <span id="s768">He came home five times with metal poisoning.</span> <span id="s769">That was so bad that I said that this cannot go on, that he cannot continue in this job.</span> <span id="s770">When they raised the wages from maybe $0.35 to $0.45 an hour, then they shortened the hours so that it didn’t mean much.</span> <span id="s771">I am talking about the raise.</span> <span id="s772">He decided then that he couldn’t stay there, getting sick all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">So he talked to my father who introduced him to some man who knew Mr. Duberstein from Dayton.</span> <span id="s774">He knew he would come to the Waldorf Astoria for a convention.</span> <span id="s775">Mr. Duberstein was looking for a purchasing agent.</span> <span id="s776">So my husband was introduced to him, and was hired.</span> <span id="s777">My husband asked him, “Is this a permanent job and what are the conditions?”</span> <span id="s778">I believe Mr. Duberstein offered him $45.00 dollars a week, and that he would pay for the transportation of our furniture.</span> <span id="s779">This man said in answer, “If after three or four weeks you are not doing a satisfactory job, you are not worth more, otherwise you will get a raise.”</span> <span id="s780">The man kept his word.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: Did that have to do with metals?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s783">That was an iron and metal company.</span> <span id="s784">My husband stayed with them for quite a few years, until he went on his own.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: You were telling me last time, after the interview, that after you arrived in Dayton that you had some difficulties when you first arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: My husband had a furnished room on Grand Avenue and I believe the moving people were on Norman Avenue where he had rented an apartment.</span> <span id="s787">I asked my husband where the grocery store was where I could do my shopping.</span> <span id="s788">He didn’t know.</span> <span id="s789">He was not familiar with that neighborhood at all.</span> <span id="s790">So I asked one of the neighbors.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">I decided at that time, that the people who would come later than we did, I would be there to help them find shopping places and whatever else was necessary.</span> <span id="s792">I made this known to the Jewish Community Council, which was at that time located at Fourth and Main Streets.</span> <span id="s793">Whenever they received a telegram telling them that a family was arriving the next day at 8.00 A.M. by train, or whatever time, they asked me to come to the station to act as interpreter.</span> <span id="s794">I did that.</span> <span id="s795">I could write a book about these experiences alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: I would like to hear a few of your favorite stories.</span> <span id="s797">I know that you have told me some informally.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: I met some interesting people, most of them, by the way, were from Poland.</span> <span id="s799">They arrived through the agencies and they were asked in New York what their skills were and can you work as a tailor?</span> <span id="s800">Most of them said yes, because they knew that New York was not a good place where to stay.</span> <span id="s801">Some came who, I believe, never had had a needle in their hands, in spite of their claims.</span> <span id="s802">They were employed by Metropolitan and other stores.</span> <span id="s803">I walked the streets with them until we found employment for them.</span> <span id="s804">The agencies sometimes sent me with them (here the agency would be the Dayton Jewish Community Council) to buy clothing, if they didn’t have enough clothing with them.</span> <span id="s805">I don’t know if I told you this story about my daughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: This is an interesting story.</span> <span id="s808">It turned out to be something which doesn’t happen to everybody.</span> <span id="s809">There was a family by the name of Ackerman.</span> <span id="s810">He was a shoemaker, not a tailor.</span> <span id="s811">They lived on Wayne Avenue.</span> <span id="s812">One day Mrs. Ackerman called me.</span> <span id="s813">She also had a sister here who was also from Poland, by the name of Liebeskind.</span> <span id="s814">She said that a third sister was sent by the agencies from Europe to Florida and that, on the boat, she met a young man and they fell in love and they got engaged.</span> <span id="s815">They would like to get married in Dayton, Ohio, because the two sisters lived here.</span> <span id="s816">She said that when her sister comes here, could I get a wedding gown for her.</span> <span id="s817">Her sister had already told Mrs. Ackerman that she wanted to get married in white.</span> <span id="s818">I told her that I would try.</span> <span id="s819">I called several people who all gave me a legitimate excuse such as “my gown is packed away” or “my gown will be used by my daughter,” etc.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">So I decided that I better call a store.</span> <span id="s821">I called a store on Ludlow Street and talked to the owner.</span> <span id="s822">I told her a little about the circumstances.</span> <span id="s823">I told her that this young lady’s greatest wish is to have a wedding gown.</span> <span id="s824">The owner said, “Bring her in!”</span> <span id="s825">So I called Mrs. Ackerman back and asked if I could meet her sister who had arrived in Dayton in the meantime.</span> <span id="s826">So we met at Third and Main Streets.</span> <span id="s827">I had never seen this woman before.</span> <span id="s828">When I saw her, I figured that she is about six feet tall.</span> <span id="s829">We went to the store on Ludlow Street.</span> <span id="s830">The store no longer exists.</span> <span id="s831">I introduced the young lady to the owner, who I believe was Mrs. Goldfleece.</span> <span id="s832">The owner said, “All right, let us figure out a wedding gown.”</span> <span id="s833">The young lady picked one out, and the owner then asked, “Do you have a coat, a going away suit, a hat, a bag, gloves.”</span> <span id="s834">To every question the lady answered “no!”</span> <span id="s835">So she picked out different other items.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">At that point I called Mrs. Goldfleece to the side and I said, “Maybe you misunderstood me.</span> <span id="s837">This lady just arrived here.</span> <span id="s838">Her two sisters who live here, their income is not so great, so she cannot possibly pay for these things.</span> <span id="s839">Maybe we better tell her that it’s not possible.”</span> <span id="s840">Mrs. Goldfleece said, “I tell my salesgirls to mark it up and this is my present for her wedding.”</span> <span id="s841">I was so touched.</span> <span id="s842">I thought that that was just so wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Now comes the important part.</span> <span id="s844">When they got married they asked me to be “Matron of Honor.”</span> <span id="s845">I had never previously filled that role.</span> <span id="s846">It took place at Beth Jacob Synagogue which then was Kumler Avenue.</span> <span id="s847">I asked if I could bring my husband and my daughter.</span> <span id="s848">They said, “Oh yes!”</span> <span id="s849">“We will be glad to have a few people.”</span> <span id="s850">They didn’t know anyone.</span> <span id="s851">I had previously met some Polish people, but not many.</span> <span id="s852">So I did my job as Matron of Honor and then went to the social hall where a meal had been prepared.</span> <span id="s853">That was the day when my daughter met her future husband.</span> <span id="s854">He came with another Polish family who had brought him over to Dayton.</span> <span id="s855">So, out of that wedding is where she met Charles Frydman.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: That is interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: Yes, I think so.</span> <span id="s858">In the meantime, the Ackermans moved away.</span> <span id="s859">The couple at whose wedding I was Matron of Honor moved to Florida where they like it and we are no longer in touch.</span> <span id="s860">However, the story is in my mind because that is where my daughter met her husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: I would like to ask you some questions about your impressions of Dayton when you first came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: I was in love with Dayton, the day I arrived.</span> <span id="s863">As I mentioned, my husband had a furnished room on Grand Avenue.</span> <span id="s864">My daughter and I went for a walk in the vicinity of that room.</span> <span id="s865">It then was the beginning of May, 1940.</span> <span id="s866">We found violets blooming and other flowers.</span> <span id="s867">We are great nature lovers.</span> <span id="s868">I was so impressed.</span> <span id="s869">It was so different from New York.</span> <span id="s870">Then one of my husband’s bosses drove him around Dayton to show him where he could rent and where he better not rent.</span> <span id="s871">This is how he found this apartment on Norman Avenue.</span> <span id="s872">We lived in that apartment for eight years, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: This is where you lived for your daughter’s grade school?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: Yes, she went to kindergarten in Fairview Elementary School, and of course I registered her for the first grade.</span> <span id="s875">Then one of my kind neighbors, not in the same building, but ½ block away heard about it and made it her business to tell the teacher or principal there that we lived on the other side of Rustic Road.</span> <span id="s876">Rustic Road at that time divided the school zone, and that my daughter really belonged in Brown School.</span> <span id="s877">So I was told that my daughter has to go to Brown School.</span> <span id="s878">Later on I found out who the person the busybody was who had talked, but my daughter was a student at Brown School.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: Was it easier for you to get her there?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: It was about the same.</span> <span id="s881">The distance was about the same.</span> <span id="s882">I sold Avon products in the beginning.</span> <span id="s883">At that time it was still possible to go to people’s houses, of course, only in certain areas.</span> <span id="s884">The girls who worked were the best customers, so I went to see them in the evenings.</span> <span id="s885">That, of course, you could not do anymore either.</span> <span id="s886">I met people and enjoyed it and it was profitable in the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: Then you were also getting involved with the community?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: That is when I started to pick people up at the train and then they called me for the most unusual things.</span> <span id="s889">“There is a stray dog in our yard, what should we do with it?”</span> <span id="s890">Or what is the term for the cream you put on cakes and which I was rationed in Europe.</span> <span id="s891">Of course, I told them.</span> <span id="s892">(They meant whipping cream.)</span> <span id="s893">Then one day a woman called me whom I had also met at the station.</span> <span id="s894">She said her husband would like a child, an additional child.</span> <span id="s895">They had two grown daughters.</span> <span id="s896">She wanted that I go with her to the gynecologist.</span> <span id="s897">I made an appointment.</span> <span id="s898">This gynecologist, who was my own doctor, also said; “You have to go with us to the examining room, since she would not understand me and I would not understand her.”</span> <span id="s899">So I was present at the examination.</span> <span id="s900">You see I got into some circumstances which were really strange.</span> <span id="s901">I had some interesting experiences with the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">I guess the word spread.</span> <span id="s903">I know that one day I got a letter from a Mr. Luviat.</span> <span id="s904">He worked at Wright Patterson Air Force Base.</span> <span id="s905">He wrote to me that he, his wife and son lived in a furnished apartment where they had to share the telephone in most undesirable circumstances.</span> <span id="s906">(Private telephones in Dayton were not readily available at the time.)</span> <span id="s907">He would love to move, but he didn’t know how to go about it.</span> <span id="s908">At that time it was very difficult to find apartments, not like today.</span> <span id="s909">So I called him on the telephone number he had given me and I told him I am willing to put an ad in the paper with my telephone number.</span> <span id="s910">I realized that at the field he could not accept several personal phone calls.</span> <span id="s911">He did not want to accept that.</span> <span id="s912">So I said, “why don’t you pay me for the ad.”</span> <span id="s913">That was going to be about all the cos (?)</span> <span id="s914">connected to it.</span> <span id="s915">So believe it or not, I got a call from someone who owned a house on Richard Street.</span> <span id="s916">That is in the East End.</span> <span id="s917">This fellow wanted to keep one room for himself.</span> <span id="s918">I told him that it is a wonderful family, a very nice young boy -- I had never seen him, so the fellow on the phone said, “All right, let this man come tomorrow evening.”</span> <span id="s919">My husband went with him.</span> <span id="s920">I had told him to bring some money for deposit.</span> <span id="s921">So he rented the place on Richard Street.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">I think that I am mixing something up here.</span> <span id="s923">Actually I secured some other place for them.</span> <span id="s924">The place on Richard Street was for another family.</span> <span id="s925">It went to a man whom my husband had met in one of the Shell stations.</span> <span id="s926">The owner or manager of the Shell station introduced him as Mr. Moyer from Germany.</span> <span id="s927">My husband called me to ask whether this man whom he met and who is here for a short time could come home for dinner.</span> <span id="s928">I said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s929">So this Mr. Moyer was in our house for dinner several times.</span> <span id="s930">Then he told us that his wife and two boys are still in Massachusetts and that, of course, he would like them to come to Dayton.</span> <span id="s931">Mr. Moyer finally rented that Richard Street house.</span> <span id="s932">He called his wife to say that he now had a place in which they could live.</span> <span id="s933">They were very excited and they said that they were coming the next day, by train.</span> <span id="s934">They arrived and one evening they came to our apartment and said they had walked all day from one place to the other.</span> <span id="s935">From hotel to hotel and rooming house to rooming house, but they couldn’t find a place where they could stay until their furniture would arrive.</span> <span id="s936">So I said, “You can stay with us.”</span> <span id="s937">The man would stay in his furnished room and I told them that we would make some arrangements for his wife and two boys.</span> <span id="s938">So my daughter gave up her bedroom for the two boys and the woman slept on the couch.</span> <span id="s939">When finally their furniture arrived, I didn’t mind that at all I helped them get settled a little.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">I believe that was the year when I was pregnant.</span> <span id="s941">I had again a caesarean section and I needed a blood transfusion.</span> <span id="s942">Mr. Moyer gave blood for me.</span> <span id="s943">You see how these things work out in life?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: Yes, life is strange.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: They moved to Columbus.</span> <span id="s946">My daughter even took the two young boys to school, after she had asked permission.</span> <span id="s947">I believe that this went on for a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: What year was your son born?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: In 1949.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: How old was your daughter then?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: At that time she was close to 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: Was she excited about the addition to the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: I would say so, that she was excited.</span> <span id="s954">However, I was told that siblings have a rivalry.</span> <span id="s955">She, being the older one and the only one for so many years, it was a little difficult at first, but I believe that it worked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: I guess girls get attracted to babies.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: Yes, I guess so.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: So you said that you lived on Norman avenue for eight years?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Then, where did you move to?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: To Mayfair Road.</span> <span id="s962">That was a house which was just being built.</span> <span id="s963">My husband saw it coming on the way home and he was always telling me how much he liked it and we bought it from the builders.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: He was still working for the iron and metal firm?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: At what time did he start his own business?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: When this other company folded up.</span> <span id="s968">As a matter of fact, he quit before that, since he was well acquainted with all parts of that other business and knew what was coming.</span> <span id="s969">Then my daughter got married and her husband had done some similar work, not exactly the same, but similar.</span> <span id="s970">So the two of them got together and opened their own company.</span> <span id="s971">Now my daughter’s two grown sons are in the business.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: Now your son-in-law comes from Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: What were the circumstances of his leaving Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: There were very unfortunate circumstances.</span> <span id="s976">He has a very sad story to tell.</span> <span id="s977">His two sisters and his parents were shot.</span> <span id="s978">He lived underground.</span> <span id="s979">He was driven from a train in which they wanted to deport him and got shot in his leg.</span> <span id="s980">Considering his background, I am always amazed what he made of himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: He must have been very young?</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: Yes, I believe that he was nine years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: How did he survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: By living underground and I believe that the older people took more or less care of him.</span> <span id="s985">You know, he learned the tricks of the trade, so to speak.</span> <span id="s986">He learned how to go to the farmers and get a chicken, or whatever.</span> <span id="s987">I don’t know the details and I hate to ask him, since it is bound to bring back these bad memories.</span> <span id="s988">We have never questioned him too much about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: How did he finally make his way to America?</span> <span id="s990">You said that your son-in-law had relatives here.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s992">I assume that he got in touch with his relatives.</span> <span id="s993">I don’t really know how.</span> <span id="s994">They had him come to Dayton and he lived with them for a while .</span> <span id="s995">he probably came to the U.S. through one of the agencies.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: What sort of agencies were these who made it possible for individuals to leave Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: Something similar to the HIAS (Hebrew Immigration Aid Society.)</span> <span id="s998">Unfortunately I had no dealings with them.</span> <span id="s999">We came on our own.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: You said HIAS?</span> <span id="s1001">What was that exactly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: I can’t think of it right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: Were they just independent organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: There were also some people who had relatives who wanted them.</span> <span id="s1005">They were also helpful in getting people who had no relatives to whichever country would take them in, in South America or wherever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">By the way, when we left it was the day of the Pogrom (November 10, 1938) when they lined up the men on the street, the Jewish men, and they took the prayer books and burned them.</span> <span id="s1007">When we came to the railroad station and the Nazis were standing around telling us that the last train had left, which wasn’t true.</span> <span id="s1008">However we left in such a hurry, even if we had been prepared to leave in the near future, that my husband had no time to say goodbye to his parents.</span> <span id="s1009">That was also very sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">The older people, many of them, did not believe that this could happen.</span> <span id="s1011">They thought that they could live out their lives where they were born.</span> <span id="s1012">They didn’t even make any attempt to get the necessary papers.</span> <span id="s1013">At one time, you had to have a number to make the quota.</span> <span id="s1014">All this involved going after these papers.</span> <span id="s1015">The older people were not used to doing anything like that.</span> <span id="s1016">This was the reason why they were not prepared.</span> <span id="s1017">Once we came here, we tried to get their papers and whatever was required.</span> <span id="s1018">This was dragged out, because the Jewish agency there was not informed concerning what was happening.</span> <span id="s1019">The places which had the most information were in New York.</span> <span id="s1020">It sometimes took entirely too long until they got the necessary information here.</span> <span id="s1021">They were even slow in writing to the places.</span> <span id="s1022">They just didn’t realize the seriousness of it.</span> <span id="s1023">My husband’s parents were then waiting for some papers in addition to what we mailed them.</span> <span id="s1024">We had made out the same kind of affidavit which had been made out for us, but our income was by far not what was requested.</span> <span id="s1025">My husband’s brother lived in New York and we often wrote to him.</span> <span id="s1026">He had to worry about his daily income and didn’t act as he should have.</span> <span id="s1027">My husband’s sister lived in Chicago and that was about the same story.</span> <span id="s1028">So it was mostly left to us.</span> <span id="s1029">By the time we had gotten an affidavit ready for Cuba where they may have been able to enter, just maybe, due to some very sad circumstances, the papers were not notarized here.</span> <span id="s1030">That error should never have happened.</span> <span id="s1031">So they had to send it back and more time elapsed and it was too late.</span> <span id="s1032">We didn’t get them out.</span> <span id="s1033">They were deported, like my grandmother to Theresienstadt and they were never heard from again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: Did you ever find out what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: We tried.</span> <span id="s1036">We even asked Si Burick to try to find out when he went to Europe right after the war.</span> <span id="s1037">But he told us that he couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1038">So we guess that they were deported like so many others and they perished.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: Listening to another interview.</span> <span id="s1040">A man who was in Theresienstadt so close to the end that really shortly after he arrived, the Germans ran away from the Russians, he was able to leave.</span> <span id="s1041">He didn’t complain too much about bad conditions there.</span> <span id="s1042">Did you hear anything about conditions in Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: We were aware that if they took people to these places they would not come out alive any more.</span> <span id="s1044">We knew that and we knew that being here, we couldn’t do anything about it.</span> <span id="s1045">Even those who were closer, couldn’t do anything about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: You were telling me that when you still lived in Frankfurt, about the air raids during WWI.</span> <span id="s1047">(This must have happened off tape.)</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: You couldn’t pinpoint what airplanes came over.</span> <span id="s1049">They may have been French, but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1050">As soon as the sirens sounded, if we were in school, we were herded into hallways, as school children, then we were told what to do.</span> <span id="s1051">When we were at home and it happened at night, which happened frequently and it was a frightening experience for a child to see the fear in one’s mother’s face.</span> <span id="s1052">I could see the fear in my grandmother’s face also, we went to the cellar and sat there for hours.</span> <span id="s1053">There were bombs falling and the sirens going off and the airplanes were very close.</span> <span id="s1054">One time they hit the Opera House.</span> <span id="s1055">They also hit houses very close to where we lived.</span> <span id="s1056">It was just frightening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: So you experienced that fear.</span> <span id="s1058">What else did you feel during Hitler’s time.</span> <span id="s1059">Were you aware of the camps?</span> <span id="s1060">Did you have fear of being arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s1062">I had a tan colored suede jacket which I wore when Hitler came into power that gave the impression that it was matching their uniforms, (the uniform of the brown shirted SA or Storm Abteilong, the storm troopers.)</span> <span id="s1063">People were afraid to look around on the street, even to congregate on the street.</span> <span id="s1064">When two or three people were standing together, they were looking around to see who is behind them.</span> <span id="s1065">You always had to be afraid that you were being watched, and that your conversation was being monitored.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">B: I think that I mentioned to you that when we got married in 1933, that was the year Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s1067">We were married in the B’nai B’rith building and we had police protection outside.</span> <span id="s1068">At that time they were still providing that protection.</span> <span id="s1069">Later on that was out of the question.</span> <span id="s1070">When we made the list of items which we wanted to take with us to the U.S. for anything that had been purchased recently, we had to pay the purchase price to the government, in order to be allowed to export it, or else we would have been fined.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: What were you afraid of?</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: Of the Nazi’s coming up and disturbing people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: Nazi party members?</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: Yes, Nazi party members.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: Then there was the wearing of the yellow star.</span> <span id="s1076">Did that come about in 1936 or 1937?</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s1078">Jews were ordered to wear the yellow stars on their sleeves.</span> <span id="s1079">The names in the passports were changed.</span> <span id="s1080">All Jewish women were named Sarah and the Jewish men were named Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: This is somewhat difficult to ask, but how did you feel when you had to wear the star.</span> <span id="s1082">(Actually, this is not timely since the edict to wear the star on the outer garment in Germany was only promulgated on September 6, 1941, to be effective September 19, 1941.)</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: Terrible.</span> <span id="s1084">Before that you felt as if you were a citizen like all the others.</span> <span id="s1085">Then you no longer knew who your friends were and who were your enemies.</span> <span id="s1086">You no longer trusted anyone.</span> <span id="s1087">Many of the stores had signs: “Jews not wanted!”</span> <span id="s1088">in their windows or on their doors.</span> <span id="s1089">Everything was rationed.</span> <span id="s1090">The rationing was for everyone not only for Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1091">This is when Hitler decided that he needed more, what he called “Lebensraum,” i.e. place in which to live.</span> <span id="s1092">Of course, Germany is not large and the population was great.</span> <span id="s1093">The people were hungry and the situation was truly very bad.</span> <span id="s1094">This is why he got so many people to follow him.</span> <span id="s1095">He promised them all that they were going to get better living conditions; you will have all the things which you are missing now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: I don’t know if I have already asked you.</span> <span id="s1097">After you arrived in the U.S., did you experience any anti-Semitism in New York City?</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: I don’t believe so.</span> <span id="s1099">We felt pretty well.</span> <span id="s1100">You know people were kind and I cannot complain about any such incidents.</span> <span id="s1101">However, we still had the frame of mind where we did not provoke anything or make statements in public.</span> <span id="s1102">We are not that kind of people anyway.</span> <span id="s1103">If you get up on a soapbox and make speeches, people might resent that.</span> <span id="s1104">Actually we avoided crowds, we still had that fear of crowds in us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: I also wanted to ask, you lived with a great deal of fear?</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: In Frankfurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: After you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: No, I think that as soon as we arrived in Holland we felt safe, but we still had the urge to leave Europe, as fast as possible.</span> <span id="s1109">We had booked on the liner SS Washington, but because we were fleeing, we could not go to Hamburg and board this ship.</span> <span id="s1110">So we went to Holland first and then to England and waited in Southampton for the date when this boat would arrive.</span> <span id="s1111">While we were safe in London, we still wanted to get away to the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">In the U.S. we lived in a furnished apartment until our own furniture came.</span> <span id="s1113">We had shipped our furniture in a huge wooden box lined with parchment paper.</span> <span id="s1114">At that time you could still take your furniture or rather have it shipped on a freighter.</span> <span id="s1115">All our furniture was well wrapped.</span> <span id="s1116">We were notified by, I believe, the port authorities, that it had arrived in New York.</span> <span id="s1117">We had rented an apartment on the fifth floor of our apartment house without an elevator.</span> <span id="s1118">It was delivered on a huge truck and unpacked on the street, while the customs officer was standing by.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">One of the items which came out of the huge wooden box was a safety box.</span> <span id="s1120">The customs officer was holding it and it made a noise.</span> <span id="s1121">He said, “I have to know what is in there.”</span> <span id="s1122">I had no idea, I couldn’t remember anymore.</span> <span id="s1123">You see, six months had elapsed since we had packed.</span> <span id="s1124">I just couldn’t remember.</span> <span id="s1125">So I called my husband.</span> <span id="s1126">I had no keys for that safety box anyway.</span> <span id="s1127">My husband came home with the key and opened it.</span> <span id="s1128">It was a (this word cannot be understood by the transcriber, but it must have been a trivial item, judging by the laughter.)</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">B: Then came some empty boxes.</span> <span id="s1130">The customs officer asked me, “Why did you bring the empty boxes over?”</span> <span id="s1131">I answered, “they were not empty when we left.”</span> <span id="s1132">The Nazi’s confiscated our silverware.</span> <span id="s1133">They left us a spoon and a fork and a knife for each person in the family.</span> <span id="s1134">Later on, strange as it may sound, they made it known that we can claim what they had confiscated.</span> <span id="s1135">They gave us receipts.</span> <span id="s1136">That is almost unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1137">Later on we filed the claim and they reimbursed us, of course, by no means the real value of the silverware.</span> <span id="s1138">We never bought silver to add to what we had.</span> <span id="s1139">I can still show you sample pieces.</span> <span id="s1140">That was our experience with the customs officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">B: The apartment we had was facing the back side of other apartment houses.</span> <span id="s1142">There was a swimming pool nearby.</span> <span id="s1143">My daughter, of course, watched the people who went swimming.</span> <span id="s1144">There were some who were dressed up as clowns and who jumped off a diving board.</span> <span id="s1145">She had herself a good time.</span> <span id="s1146">That was an everyday occurrence in Manhattan.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: So you had your son when your daughter was already in High School?</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1149">My son was born here in Dayton.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q: So you had the experience of raising a second child?</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1152">It was different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: So your son-in-law is in business with your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: Yes, with my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: Two of their sons are also in the business?</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: How many children does your daughter have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: Four.</span> <span id="s1159">That is two sons and two daughters and they are all married now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: Do they live in Dayton?</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: Three of them do.</span> <span id="s1162">The youngest son, who got married just a month ago, lives in Indianapolis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: You told me that the older of the two granddaughters is an advertising person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: For a radio station.</span> <span id="s1165">Yes.</span> <span id="s1166">She writes commercials.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: Do any of them have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: No, not yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: Your son lives in Dayton?</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: Yes, he is not

wants to come over here and study.</span> <span id="s1174">I guess it is more quiet here.</span> <span id="s1175">They are going into their finals next week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: So most of your family lives right around here, except for the one, in Indianapolis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: Yes, that is very fortunate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: Is your husband retired?</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: No.</span> <span id="s1180">His work is his life.</span> <span id="s1181">He is eager to go to work and he enjoys it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: You do a great deal of volunteer work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1184">I call myself a professional volunteer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: What do you do specifically.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: After I was in touch with many newcomers, I gained a great deal from the meetings.</span> <span id="s1187">I feel that I truly met people of different backgrounds.</span> <span id="s1188">I joined various organizations.</span> <span id="s1189">The first one I joined was the YWCA because I took additional English lessons here.</span> <span id="s1190">Lessons in English conversation.</span> <span id="s1191">They even afterwards, arranged for speaking engagements for me, at churches an elsewhere, so I could tell some of my experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">B: Then I joined some Jewish organizations.</span> <span id="s1193">I was President of B’nai B’rith Women’s group.</span> <span id="s1194">I am now President of the Women’s Guild of Covenant House, the Jewish Home for the Aged.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: What is B’nai B’rith doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: Their major project is fighting anti-Semitism, through the Anti Defamation league.</span> <span id="s1197">They support a home for rehabilitation in Cleveland, and a children’s home in Israel.</span> <span id="s1198">They also give scholarships for young people who, otherwise could not afford to go to college.</span> <span id="s1199">They do other things of that type.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: I am curious also about speeches which you gave in churches.</span> <span id="s1201">There is a big difference in the attitudes that religions such as Catholicism and Protestantism or Presbyterians and Methodists have.</span> <span id="s1202">They seem to have a better attitude towards Jews than do some of the fundamentalist groups such as the Nazarine.</span> <span id="s1203">Did you speak in any Nazarine or Baptist or other Fundamentalist churches?</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: I don’t recall that I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: I was just curious if you had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: Well, I didn’t make a point of advertising speaking.</span> <span id="s1207">If people asked me, I was glad to do it, however, I had no special training for it.</span> <span id="s1208">I found that people in their churches were very kind to me.</span> <span id="s1209">Sometimes it ended up being a question and answer session.</span> <span id="s1210">That was all right with me.</span> <span id="s1211">But I don’t do that much anymore.</span> <span id="s1212">I also have a 97 year old mother for whom I have to do a lot.</span> <span id="s1213">That uses up some of my time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">I am also corresponding Secretary for another organization.</span> <span id="s1215">True Sisters.</span> <span id="s1216">We had a very nice boat ride with the organization this week.</span> <span id="s1217">They do a lot for cancer research.</span> <span id="s1218">They support the Dayton Children’s Hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: That is B’nai B’rith?</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: No.</span> <span id="s1221">That is True Sisters.</span> <span id="s1222">Actually the official name is United Order of True Sisters.</span> <span id="s1223">A few years ago, one lady was membership chairman.</span> <span id="s1224">She had, what I thought was an outstanding idea.</span> <span id="s1225">She also had a very cooperative husband.</span> <span id="s1226">The husband dressed up as a chauffeur complete with a chauffeur’s cap.</span> <span id="s1227">They drove to houses where they expected the women to eventually join this organization.</span> <span id="s1228">They presented an invitation to attend a meeting on a silver tray.</span> <span id="s1229">She obtained 28 new members this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">I was voted in as membership chairman the following year.</span> <span id="s1231">I thought that I can not top this.</span> <span id="s1232">She did the impossible.</span> <span id="s1233">I have no husband who would dress up like that.</span> <span id="s1234">My husband is not that organization minded, as a matter of fact, he says I am doing too much.</span> <span id="s1235">I do enjoy the organizations.</span> <span id="s1236">So I sat down and composed a short letter and then mailed the letters, about 100 of them.</span> <span id="s1237">All were handwritten.</span> <span id="s1238">My ending sentence was, “True Sisters needs you, we hope that you never need us!”</span> <span id="s1239">I was obviously talking about the cancer work which we do.</span> <span id="s1240">I received 64 new members that way.</span> <span id="s1241">We had never experienced anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: That is very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: I can sell what I believe in.</span> <span id="s1244">I still remember that from my father.</span> <span id="s1245">I have to give him credit for this.</span> <span id="s1246">I am also active in the Sisterhood of our Synagogue.</span> <span id="s1247">I am a life member of most of these organizations, including Hadassah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: What does Hadassah do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: It is mostly for Israel.</span> <span id="s1250">The hospital in Israel which is so well known is the Hadassah hospital.</span> <span id="s1251">It is supported by Hadassah.</span> <span id="s1252">This is their main project.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">B: I would like to end this by saying that we are very grateful for being in the United States.</span> <span id="s1254">Of course we still think of our backgrounds and we don’t forget the countries we came from, but we, every day, appreciate to be here and to have met wonderful people.</span> <span id="s1255">That is it, in a “nutshell.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">RF/GLK</span></p></body></html>
