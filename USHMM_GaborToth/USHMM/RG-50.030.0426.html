(ph), sincerely yours, Mil-ka (ph).</span> <span id="s499">I am in good place.</span> <span id="s500">But when I will sign "I am your Milshka (ph), it is a bad place.</span> <span id="s501">Such, we were thinking, but she never wrote me and she never came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: But you all thought that you would get through this?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: Yes, I don't know why I didn't get a paper that I have to go to ____________.</span> <span id="s504">I think that it was this, that everybody, every girl, nearly everybody that was born 1930 was sending to ___________, but when we arrived to Terezin my mother wrote me, wrote into the paper and said that I was born in 1931.</span> <span id="s505">In this time, I was very angry because I was in the, I was a girl, I wanted to be older, no, I'm not younger, but maybe it saved my life.</span> <span id="s506">I don't know, it may be.</span> <span id="s507">We stayed only four, from our room, to the end of the Terezin-schatz (ph).</span> <span id="s508">Everybody from us went to ____________.</span> <span id="s509">And we were, maybe, with these changes, we were maybe about 150 or more, only four we stayed in Terezin until the end.</span> <span id="s510">But now, after 40 years, we found each other and we are living ten, alive, in America, in Vienna, in Israel, in Czech Republic and in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: After your sister left, did a lot of people leave at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s513">It was nearly every two or three days they were transported . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s514">End of Tape 1.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Question: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Answer: Yes, nearly, I remember that nearly every two or three days in one time there were transports to _____________ and also my sister went.</span> <span id="s518">I told you, and many, many of my friends.</span> <span id="s519">They wrote me five letters and I have them and I copied it for museum in the ____________ and I will copy it also in the Holocaust Museum in Washington because they are, you can have the feeling, you can read what we felt in this time.</span> <span id="s520">That we were very sad and that we liked each other and we were not sure that we will see each other again.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: How did you know they were, where they were going to?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Oh, we didn't know.</span> <span id="s523">It was not sure, but somebody told us that it was _______________, somebody told us after, they would say they were gassed rooms and they were killed.</span> <span id="s524">Somebody came after, at the end of the war, a little earlier, they had told it to us, but we were not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: As time went on, did the security, the guards and everything, did that become more strict or less strict?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: I think that it was, in one time it was more strict.</span> <span id="s527">But when it was nearly end of war I went to the place where people in very bad health came to Terezin.</span> <span id="s528">I was waiting my friends, I was waiting my sister, I was waiting my brother, and I was staying there hours and hours.</span> <span id="s529">And I never forget this unhappy people who had not strength to walk or had not strength to live and we were helping there and giving them something, what we have, and we found, also, some friends from us, or we talked to neighbors, "oh, your relative is here, please go and treat him".</span> <span id="s530">But my sister didn't come.</span> <span id="s531">We got only a letter that she's alive, that she's very ill, that she's in Bergen-Belsen and after she went to _______________ and some English soldiers liberated her and an English doctor saved her life because she was very, very ill.</span> <span id="s532">And for many, many years, for about 40 years, I didn't like to think about it because after war, when I came home, I wanted to live normal.</span> <span id="s533">I didn't want to speak with many people about what happened to us.</span> <span id="s534">Also, some people told us, "oh, why came you back, why didn't you stay there", and it was very painful.</span> <span id="s535">I didn't like for 40 years to think very deeply about it because every time, when I started to think and to talk about what happened to us and to my friends and to my relatives, I was really ill about it.</span> <span id="s536">I was so, trembling and I wanted to live normal and to study normal and to work good, but something stayed.</span> <span id="s537">For example, I was so happy to be able to study, that they allowed me to study, that when I had students which didn't work, I was nearly furious.</span> <span id="s538">I told them, "How you can dare not to work?</span> <span id="s539">You don't know that people, children or young people, couldn't learn anything, that they were in concentration camps", and so on.</span> <span id="s540">And this was a very strong feeling for me because I was, everyday telling, thank you that I can live a normal life.</span> <span id="s541">And because I was every time so excited that, in that way about it, when I was speaking with somebody, I wanted to, didn't want to speak too much about it and I didn't visit Terezin 40 years after the war.</span> <span id="s542">And after the 40 years I found the strength and I went there with my son and it was very good that I went because I saw a nearly normal village.</span> <span id="s543">In the home where we were living, nobody wrote that we, that they were sometimes almost starving children and that this happened and this happened.</span> <span id="s544">And after, I told to me, oh, you cannot thinking in this way, you have to be quiet and only you can work for the future.</span> <span id="s545">That never will the same thing will happen to children and to people.</span> <span id="s546">And for this reason I am working in Terezin, in it's archive, in Prague, and I'm working also in my town, Berno (ph), in the staff of Jewish society.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: I want to go back a little.</span> <span id="s548">You were saying that sometime late in 1944 there were many, many transports?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: When your sister left?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s552">Also my brother left.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: And you knew that your brother left, at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: And when there were only a very few children left in that home, did you stay in that home?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: No, no, no, we had to go out.</span> <span id="s557">And we had this ___________ and we were four and we didn't, we couldn't decide who will have it and we divided it for, into four pieces, and only my piece is alive.</span> <span id="s558">And it is now here by my friend and we will do, have a construction, we will write a book about our friends who didn't return, and write about them, and about our life, something, and also the diary of Helga Kinski (ph) where she's written about life in our children's home.</span> <span id="s559">And we would like that everybody can read these things, maybe it will, we will have good conditions to bring to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: So after you went out, where did you go?</span> <span id="s561">When you left the children's home?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: After I went with my parents into this military ___________, and I am not sure if it was Bergem-Bach (ph) or Magdeburg, but I think that it was Magdeburg and we had a very small piece and we were living there.</span> <span id="s563">It was a room divided and we had maybe, I don't know how many meters, three meters, and we were living there.</span> <span id="s564">And once it happened that I was alone at home and that I was cleaning the window, I was staying in the window, and one man came.</span> <span id="s565">I thought it was an SS man, it was Mr. Mumelstein (ph) and he came and he kick to the door and he was shouting a little bit on me and looking not in very good way of me and I was, I had some minutes of, I was very afraid that he will throw me from the window, from the second floor down.</span> <span id="s566">But, in one moment, he turned and he went and it was not very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: So your parents were working in the day and you stayed home?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s569">It was by chance that I was at home because I was also working.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Were there other episodes that were very frightening to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: No, besides with this counting in this Bolshevik (ph) ________ when we stayed there a whole day, it was very bad.</span> <span id="s572">And every transport was a very, very bad experience for us because we have to say farewell to people which were, who were for us very, very dear and we didn't know if we will see them and this was very hard.</span> <span id="s573">And we were afraid that everyday we will, we were on the row and we will go.</span> <span id="s574">And we felt that it was not a good place where the SS go.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Did you ever see people being punished or beaten?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: I heard about it.</span> <span id="s577">I heard that somebody, when somebody wanted to fly, that they were hanging there and they were shooting, yes.</span> <span id="s578">But I didn't see it.</span> <span id="s579">I saw only when somebody was shouting and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Toward the end were there a lot of sick people around?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s582">Also, when it was finishing we had also a big epidemic of typhus.</span> <span id="s583">And they took us children to one sanatorium outside of Terezin.</span> <span id="s584">We were one month outside and they were treating us and giving us meal and treating us from the medical side.</span> <span id="s585">And my mother and father had to stay in Terezin and after we went back and after we went home.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: This was after liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: After liberation, yes.</span> <span id="s588">We went home in June, not in May.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: But the sanitarium was after liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: After liberation, but nobody could go out from Terezin because it was an epidemic.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s592">Do you remember the Red Cross visit?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: Yes, I remember.</span> <span id="s594">Because we had the SS, ________________, and he gave us to eat and we had to tell him, "________ __________, _________________", "again we have sardines", and so it was like for ___________, religious.</span> <span id="s595">And they built shops and café houses and in these shops we got also tickets that we can shop all money, we had also money, that we can buy there, but nothing was there, only I remember ___________ and some things like this, but we didn't, we couldn't buy because nothing was there.</span> <span id="s596">It was only like for this ______________, this villages.</span> <span id="s597">And when the Red Cross came, then we had to clean everything and they chose also children, they looked well, they didn't, they were not too slim, and it was like a theater, like a spectacle.</span> <span id="s598">And we got a piece of bread and we were eating and like this.</span> <span id="s599">In film you can also see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: This must have seemed strange to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Yes, but we were happy to have a piece of bread!</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: So you acted for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: Yes, but we had to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: What else do you remember about Terezin?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: I remember only that I was happy that we could leave.</span> <span id="s606">I was happy that my brother came to Terezin in the uniform of U.S. Army because when he flew from this, when they moved from the Malyy-Trostenetz concentration camp and when the war was ended, and he got, I don't know how, to the U.S. Army because he was speaking very well English, he was helping, and he came to, with the U.S. Army to Czech country and then it was only possible, he came to look if we are alive.</span> <span id="s607">And I was the first, I saw him.</span> <span id="s608">And I was so happy!</span> <span id="s609">And after we got a letter from my sister, and it was also nice, and after we were looking forward to the time when we can leave.</span> <span id="s610">But the people who went, who came back from other concentration camps were in such bad health that I never forget these people.</span> <span id="s611">How they came, because they were exhausted and I think after some days they wouldn't want to be alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: I read that the people who lived in Terezin-stat were able to get food packages from around the world.</span> <span id="s613">Is that true?</span> <span id="s614">Did you have enough food?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: One time it was possible, but we didn't have anybody to send us something.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Maybe Jewish organizations, or?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: Nobody.</span> <span id="s618">I think it was so many people that it was not possible.</span> <span id="s619">And these Jewish organizations, they are also dying.</span> <span id="s620">Only when somebody was from, maybe a Christian woman and a Jewish father and children, maybe she, they were both in Prague or another town, and she could send something.</span> <span id="s621">It was something, possible, but also we got a letter from my sister, we got a letter to Terezin.</span> <span id="s622">But it was only a card, that she's alive.</span> <span id="s623">But nothing more.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Did you have radios?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: No, we had to give everything.</span> <span id="s626">And in this time, I think the small radios were not yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Did you have any knowledge about what was going on with the war and the camps and all that?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s629">We had to because people were speaking about it.</span> <span id="s630">I don't know how they could have it, but I can tell you that when we were liberated, we were inside when the guns were working, when we were liberated I, every time I was dreaming, how I was happy.</span> <span id="s631">How I will be jumping when the liberation will be.</span> <span id="s632">I can tell you that I was so exhausted that I couldn't feel the real happiness.</span> <span id="s633">After a long time, I could feel it.</span> <span id="s634">And my brother wrote a poem about it and it express also my feelings, also when we were in another place.</span> <span id="s635">Because I cannot translate it to you.</span> <span id="s636">I am liberated with, it was asking, yes?</span> <span id="s637">Can I live as before?</span> <span id="s638">It was too much.</span> <span id="s639">I went through so many hard and difficult situations that it will take me a long time if I can be, I can feel that I am liberated, I am a human being, I can live normal.</span> <span id="s640">It is inside me and it is like a stone, yes?</span> <span id="s641">And I could feel, I was a child, I was not yet 15, I was 14-years-old and I can tell you that I couldn't be so happy.</span> <span id="s642">I was so exhausted from this waiting and waiting and seeing what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: At the time of liberation, and you were liberated by what army?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: By Russian army and English.</span> <span id="s645">The English were a little less, but English soldiers were there.</span> <span id="s646">I can remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: They came.</span> <span id="s649">First we were hidden.</span> <span id="s650">After, when it was, a little quiet we came out and they were singing.</span> <span id="s651">We were thanking them and after we were looking what to do.</span> <span id="s652">What to have to eat.</span> <span id="s653">What to, because after this we had to take care about ourselves alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: So they didn't stay very long?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Oh, they stayed.</span> <span id="s656">They stood, I think, the whole time.</span> <span id="s657">Because after I went towards the sanatorium, I cannot tell you everything because I was one months out from Terezin.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: So you left very soon after the liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s660">It was, I cannot tell, it was some days, it was maybe 14 days after this liberation because it was this very dangerous typhus and it was not good, the children stay there, and after they had passed, and after, although my father organized his life after liberation, he took care about food and about helping people and also medical care started.</span> <span id="s661">Because it was necessary.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: When you left for the sanitarium, were you at all scared about leaving your parents at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: A little bit, but we went with other children and it was first time we can get out!</span> <span id="s664">To a new life, to a nice nature, it was something like paradise!</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: How long did you stay, after you came back from the sanitarium, how long did you stay at Terezin before you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: Not too long, I think about in June, maybe also 14 days or so.</span> <span id="s667">I know that in June we got, we came back to our town, to Berno (ph), and we had to start a new life.</span> <span id="s668">It was not so easy because we didn't have money.</span> <span id="s669">Our fate was not free, and we got only 500 crowns and from U.S. Army, ___________________ said, oh, we could go somewhere to eat something, but we couldn't eat because our stomachs were not use to eat too much and we had some difficulties.</span> <span id="s670">Now I started to look, what shall I study?</span> <span id="s671">And I forgot nearly everything from my knowing to play piano and I wanted to go to conservatory and I was looking for it to work very hard to again do exam.</span> <span id="s672">It lasted one year.</span> <span id="s673">I had to do exams from the normal school because I didn't have schools, yes?</span> <span id="s674">And I can tell you that in Terezin, we had so good professors.</span> <span id="s675">I had good marks, only I studied only mathematics, math.</span> <span id="s676">And I got through.</span> <span id="s677">The life was hard, but I was so drinking the life that I was attending, for example, cinema.</span> <span id="s678">At four o'clock, six o'clock and eight o'clock!</span> <span id="s679">But I didn't know what it was because there were three films, but I had to live.</span> <span id="s680">I wanted to live and funny things I did, such un-normal things.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Did your family have any question about going back to the Czech Republic?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: My family had to go because my parents were a little bit older and not healthy.</span> <span id="s683">My father was without his right hand and we tried to start this normal life.</span> <span id="s684">But my brother left for America, he couldn't study more, he had ___________ before war, before concentration camp and he couldn't leave and he went for America when it was possible.</span> <span id="s685">And my sister, second sister was living in Israel and my second sister, this dancer, she was so ill after the war, she had tuberculosis, she was in sanatorium.</span> <span id="s686">We couldn't leave it.</span> <span id="s687">I wanted to go to Israel but I couldn't do it because my parents were alone and they are not so strong and my sister was so ill.</span> <span id="s688">I started to study _____________ and stayed here.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Now when you went back to Bruno (ph), you said somebody else was in your flat?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: Did you try to get it back?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: We tried, but we found one floor near, lower.</span> <span id="s693">We found a flat, it was empty because they were Germans.</span> <span id="s694">And we could go there.</span> <span id="s695">We could find our piano after many months.</span> <span id="s696">And we could live in this flat, but we had to pay, furniture, not too much, but it was so hard for us.</span> <span id="s697">My father had to borrow money from bank and had to start to a new life and he started to work and to build his shop again.</span> <span id="s698">But, when he gave back this money, it was three years, it lasted three years.</span> <span id="s699">And when he gave back, after we started to live a little bit normal, Communists came to us and he had to close his shop.</span> <span id="s700">And it was very hard for him.</span> <span id="s701">But we had to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: What about your former neighbors?</span> <span id="s703">How did they treat you when you came back?</span> <span id="s704">Were they happy to see you?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Somebody was happy, somebody was not happy.</span> <span id="s706">I told you that some also, one mother of my school mate, she told me, "why did you return?</span> <span id="s707">Why didn't you stay there?"</span> <span id="s708">And, "this was not normal girl", and "everybody was laughing about her", and before war, I was the one, I was every time telling, "why you are laughing?</span> <span id="s709">She cannot, she is a poor girl", and as to things we had hidden by our neighbors, nearly everybody told us that they had bombs and they have nothing more.</span> <span id="s710">And we got only one small thing, one small statue from the house from my mother, it was remembering her house, and she was happy.</span> <span id="s711">But we didn't care about what we have because it was not the important thing.</span> <span id="s712">The important thing was that we were free, that we could live, we could work, and I could study.</span> <span id="s713">And we could take a little care about, to improve our health.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: How important was religion to you, during Terezin and afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: I can tell you that I lost my religion in Terezin because I was praying for my friends and nothing happened.</span> <span id="s716">And I was quarreling with the God.</span> <span id="s717">And asking Him, "why he is so cruel and he let these things to work?"</span> <span id="s718">No, He didn't answer me.</span> <span id="s719">For this reason, I only was feeling that I am a member of a group of people that had the same destiny, and I was proud of this big tradition, this old tradition.</span> <span id="s720">I was proud that I was a Jewish and I told everybody that I am Jewish, but I didn't practice the religion.</span> <span id="s721">After, when my father died, I came a little bit back.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Did you ever resent being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: What is this, resent?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: Resent would be, were you ever angry that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: No, no, never.</span> <span id="s726">I only was doing things to telling people that never it can come again, and to __________.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: What kept you strong?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: I think it was a school of life, what got us through.</span> <span id="s729">And when we could live like this, we had to be strong.</span> <span id="s730">And we learned to live in bad conditions and try to be happy with small things.</span> <span id="s731">We, I think that it was a, so good school that, also, after the war, the life was not every time so easy.</span> <span id="s732">That we could go through a little bit lighter than other people.</span> <span id="s733">Because we had harder times.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">[end of side one of Tape 2.]</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: You were saying that, for those of you who survived camps, life afterwards, you handled it differently than other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s737">We had a strong will.</span> <span id="s738">We wanted to leave and we were working very hard and we wanted to, what we couldn't do in the concentration camp, we wanted to do everything better and we were very, very, very hard working.</span> <span id="s739">Because it was not so easy for us who didn't have schools, although when

speaking about good things, what we did, about the life there, about helping each other, about friendship, about these girls who didn't come back and what we can do that they are not so forgotten.</span> <span id="s780">We will do that, we will bring the book, we will write about it.</span> <span id="s781">I think many books are now here.</span> <span id="s782">The museum is full of new books.</span> <span id="s783">I was there.</span> <span id="s784">But, I think that somebody who will read it, it is our duty to write it.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Is there one image that
