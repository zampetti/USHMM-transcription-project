-- but anyway, one day I said -- you know, we were in a train on the way home, and I said, "I'm not going to go home with you now, because I haven't seen my parents for quite a while, and I have to tell them a few things."</span> <span id="s615">And I keep up to date with each other, with my parents.</span> <span id="s616">So I got out of the train, and I went to my parents' house and -- well,

id="s870">UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER: These refugees had to be put up somewhere.</span> <span id="s871">They couldn't go to families.</span> <span id="s872">They stayed there, and then they went over to England or to the United States.</span> <span id="s873">But at that time, America refused a ship of Jews, and then they came back to Holland and then went to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: Yeah, you are right.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: Even before the war, then, before you were

have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s885">Did you through your work there know more about what was going on in Germany because there were so many refugees coming out of Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: We heard about it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: How did you get involved to work in a place like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: Because my father got me the job.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s890">And this was all in The Hague?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: That's all in The Hague.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: So this camp was -- do you remember the name of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER: I'm trying to remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: The transit camp.</span> <span id="s895">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s898">Who -- after you saw from the roof of your house the German paratroopers land in the city, how did your life change because of this occupation?</span> <span id="s899">In what way did your life change from what it had been?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: I don't think it changed.</span> <span id="s901">I just had the same job.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s903">Were people allowed to leave the

you're at a job where you are registering people out to leave the country and they are not allowed to leave, you don't have a whole lot to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER: They send you to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER: Not the women, but the men.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: I'm

liked it or not, you were sent to work in Germany or in France.</span> <span id="s914">Slave labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: But who?</span> <span id="s916">Who would be sent there?</span> <span id="s917">Okay.</span> <span id="s918">I'm confused now.</span> <span id="s919">If you're working at a municipal or a federal office that registers people to leave the country, and now you have have a German occupation, a Nazi occupation, and it's war time and people are no longer allowed to leave the country, what happens to that office?</span> <span id="s920">Does it close because there is nobody left that you can register out?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER: I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: So -- and my basic question was, How does your life change?</span> <span id="s923">And if it didn't change, then that meant you could continue doing the work you were doing.</span> <span id="s924">And if it did change, how did it change?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: You know, I don't really remember how long I worked there.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER: I wouldn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: No, you wouldn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE SPEAKER: Were you working there when the Nazis -- did they come in and ask you to turn over any information?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: I really don't.</span> <span id="s930">I really don't.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: Great question.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: What did you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: When the Nazis came in, were you still working in this office of registration?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: And did they -- did any Nazi or Gestapo or

for the first year or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE SPEAKER: But you still worked there when they asked you for people's records?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: No.</span> <span id="s941">In the beginning, I was -- in the beginning not.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s943">You continued working there, though, in that same place?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: You know, I don't remember how long I worked there.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER: Did your supervisor change, or did any of the boss' -- your supervisor's boss change?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: I really don't remember.</span> <span id="s947">I would have to think about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: But I really don't.</span> <span id="s950">I really do not remember how long I worked there.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s952">Did daily life change?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: Did what?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: Did daily life for you change in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: Did daily --</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: Daily life, your everyday life.</span> <span id="s957">You know, if you went to the cinema or if you went to buy food, or did things change in your environment after that occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: Well, that was -- that went so slowly.</span> <span id="s959">The changes were not just, bang, like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s961">So they happened gradually?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: Gradually, very gradually, very slowly.</span> <span id="s963">And I did -- I -- that office that I was talking about that did all of that stuff, that was -- that didn't exist anymore after a while because there was no -- there was no use for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: That office for -- what do you call that in Dutch?</span> <span id="s966">Benlatzizager (ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER: Internal

wasn't necessary anymore.</span> <span id="s971">There was no -- there were no people going in and out.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s973">And did that happen, also, gradually?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s976">By this -- but were you -- who brought you into the resistance?</span> <span id="s977">How did you end up joining the resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: Just because I knew -- somebody had asked me if I could do something.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: Who was it that you knew?</span> <span id="s980">Who asked you?</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: Friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: Do you remember the things they asked you to do?</span></p> <p><span
