my basic question was, How does your life change?</span> <span id="s923">And if it didn't change, then that meant you could continue doing the work you were doing.</span> <span id="s924">And if it did change, how did it change?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: You know, I don't really remember how long I worked there.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER: I wouldn't

change in your environment after that occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: Well, that was -- that went so slowly.</span> <span id="s959">The changes were not just, bang, like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s961">So they happened gradually?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: Gradually, very gradually, very slowly.</span> <span id="s963">And I did -- I -- that office that I was talking about that did all of that stuff, that was -- that didn't exist anymore after a while because there was no -- there was no use for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q:
