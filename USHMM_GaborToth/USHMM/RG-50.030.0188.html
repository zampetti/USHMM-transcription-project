<p><span id="s13">Q: Please tell us your full name.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: My name is Eve Rich.</span> <span id="s15">My maiden name was Wagszul.</span> <span id="s16">I was born in Kowel, spelled K - O - W - E - L on the Russian border, very close to the Russian border.</span> <span id="s17">My childhood as I remember was very nice.</span> <span id="s18">My father was a very, very religious man, came from a poor family but they were all educated.</span> <span id="s19">They were rabbis, schokhets (ritual slaughterers) and scholars.</span> <span id="s20">My mother was not an educated woman.</span> <span id="s21">She came from a family from a village not too far from Kowel.</span> <span id="s22">Her father, my grandfather, was a very clever man.</span> <span id="s23">As a Jew he could never own any land, but because he was a very good businessman, he leased forests and then they would cut them up for lumber.</span> <span id="s24">And he was quite successful, so my mom's family was comfortable.</span> <span id="s25">I wouldn't say rich because it would mean a lot, but they were very comfortable, so they insisted that the children, us, that we all went to private schools.</span> <span id="s26">They made sure that we didn't have any accents, that we didn't speak Jewish at home, because if you had an accent you couldn't get into a good school.</span> <span id="s27">This sometimes did not go over too well with my dad because he was religious, but he could see with anti-Semitism in Poland that it might be to our benefits.</span> <span id="s28">I was the youngest of two sisters and a brother.</span> <span id="s29">My brother left for Israel right after his bar mitzvah and I barely remembered it.</span> <span id="s30">I was very little.</span> <span id="s31">I think I was like five years old.</span> <span id="s32">And pretty soon after enjoying a good childhood with even help in the house...you know, we always had a maid, a woman.</span> <span id="s33">Her name was Katja.</span> <span id="s34">I can still remember.</span> <span id="s35">and my dad I must say was a lawyer but because he could, as a Jew he couldn't pass the Polish bar</span></p> <p><span id="s36">01:03: he became an advocate for the Polish lawyers.</span> <span id="s37">It means he would hang around the Polish court, give them advice, but he could never enter, could never be in front of the judge.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">But he had plenty of business within the Jewish community...fourteen thousand Jews.</span> <span id="s39">And we were pretty comfortable.</span> <span id="s40">We had everything.</span> <span id="s41">We had a nice house.</span> <span id="s42">my grandfather bought us a piano.</span> <span id="s43">One of my sisters...my mom played the piano.</span> <span id="s44">One of my sisters played the piano.</span> <span id="s45">You know, I was never much...I played but I wasn't as talented as my sister, and then the Russians came into town and of course things changed and I don't remember much because things didn't change for us economically, you know.</span> <span id="s46">My father was very smart.</span> <span id="s47">He was afraid that the Russians knowingly would send us probably to Siberia because everybody in town knew that we were Zionists, especially my father.</span> <span id="s48">But little did we knew that the Russians started to move back because the Germans came in, and this is when my tragedy started.</span> <span id="s49">We were put in a ghetto where life was pretty pretty horrible and soon after they divided like the old town and the new town and for some reason we ended up in the old town because my father wanted to be with his mother, with my grandmother and when the first order was to get the Jews out of town, they didn't tell us they were going to kill them.</span> <span id="s50">They told us they were going to take the men to labor camps and the women were going to go to a different town.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: What was the life like in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: It was bad.</span> <span id="s53">There wasn't enough food but I remember because of my grandfather's connection, because he lived in a village, you know, and a lot of people worked for him, he would constantly send a non-Jewish peasant over with food, but there came a time where they wouldn't let him through the ghetto and we were practically starved and there were no facilities to wash, you know.</span> <span id="s54">Sometimes they would cut off the water.</span> <span id="s55">Things were pretty bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">01:06: A lot of people, the older people started to die because there was no doctors around.</span> <span id="s57">The doctors were taken to the camps earlier and we knew that sooner or later they're going to either kill us or take us to labor camps, the younger people, and that one night that I remember so well, we were told to leave the house.</span> <span id="s58">For some reason my father wouldn't leave the house.</span> <span id="s59">I don't remember why I was in the house, because my mother and my sisters were not and they came in.</span> <span id="s60">They broke down the door.</span> <span id="s61">The doors were locked.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">They came in.</span> <span id="s63">My father had a talis (prayershawl) on.</span> <span id="s64">He prayed.</span> <span id="s65">And they killed him in front of my eyes.</span> <span id="s66">I really don't remember what went what went through my mind.</span> <span id="s67">I didn't cry.</span> <span id="s68">I didn't scream.</span> <span id="s69">I just ran around the kitchen and I got outside.</span> <span id="s70">Outside there were people running and there were several of us young girls and some of the German soldiers that surrounded the ghettos let us go through and I remember one of them gave us a battery, light.</span> <span id="s71">I don't know...maybe he meant for us just to run.</span> <span id="s72">It was dark and to try to save ourselves and this was like the first time that I realized</span></p> <p><span id="s73">01:08: that maybe not all of them are bad, because he he could have killed us.</span> <span id="s74">I think there were three or four of us.</span> <span id="s75">When I think of that moment I can't understand that I didn't take time to make sure that my father is indeed dead.</span> <span id="s76">They could have shot him and he could have been alive and suffering.</span> <span id="s77">I just cannot explain that and I have a lot of guilt about it and to this day I think about it and the only explanation that I could give you and I have given maybe to myself is that the will of surviving was so strong that I couldn't think of him.</span> <span id="s78">I wanted to live for a better world or to tell the story.</span> <span id="s79">I was always afraid that all the suffering would be forgotten and there's nobody going to be there to tell the story, and I started to run.</span> <span id="s80">I ran through villages.</span> <span id="s81">The forest was our home at night.</span> <span id="s82">Some people, peasants, would would give us bread.</span> <span id="s83">I don't realize that they knew we were Jews, you know.</span> <span id="s84">Some of them had a hard life.</span> <span id="s85">They worked in the fields and there were people wandering around.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">01:10: Well some of them probably didn't even know about the political situation.</span> <span id="s87">I remember going to homes where they wouldn't give us any bread or any water and they would say, you're probably Jews and you're wandering around.</span> <span id="s88">And we tried to stay away from better looking homes, worrying that those people were better educated and they might recognize us.</span> <span id="s89">I lost track of time.</span> <span id="s90">I didn't know where I was at times, you know...what's going to happen to us and there were times that I really didn't want to live because we didn't know what tomorrow's going to be.</span> <span id="s91">You know, some people seem kind.</span> <span id="s92">Some people would point out to you and say, if you don't get out of town we're going to tell the Germans and they're going to come and get you.</span> <span id="s93">And it didn't take long before we were arrested, and we were taken to some...the difference between a labor camp and a concentration camp wasn't much really, because the labor camps kind of kept you a couple of days and they weren't as well organized as a concentration camp, so it was very easy to walk out and to escape.</span> <span id="s94">And I remember walking away from the labor camp with some...at that time I called him older man because I was like fourteen or fourteen and a half years old, and they told us that not too far there's some religious installation.</span> <span id="s95">It's a convent and they are helping a lot of people and I walked in to this...it didn't...to me it looked like a cemetery because in in the front of this big building...it wasn't actually a big building but there was a like a gate and cemetery, a big cemetery plot and then we noticed nuns dressed in habits</span></p> <p><span id="s96">01:12: and we waited until not too many people were around.</span> <span id="s97">There were like four of us I believe, and we walked in and we told them that we needed help, that we have no place to go and they asked us if we were Jews and we told them.</span> <span id="s98">I mean at that point there was no place of hiding and I had a feeling that if nuns are not going to help us, you know, then there's no sense going on, and they told us they were crowded, that they had a lot of infants.</span> <span id="s99">They had a lot of sick people and they indeed did, but this Mother Superior that I called it...Theresa was her name, Mother Theresa.</span> <span id="s100">By the way, they were Carmelites, and there were a lot of Volksdeutsche.</span> <span id="s101">You know what a Volksdeutsche is?</span> <span id="s102">The mother can be Polish and the father can be German.</span> <span id="s103">A lot of them were mixed, and they took us in and they told us that we had to be very quiet and it was a basement where they put us and sometimes we did chores for them and they gave us some food and they really didn't know how long we could stay because they were constantly being watched by neighbors, you know, and sometimes they could tell them stories so they could explain what was going on but most of the time they didn't see any of the police, any of the German police and we stayed there for several months and slowly they tried to explain to us that things are getting very bad and they are threatened they would kill them if they would find out how many Jews they had.</span> <span id="s104">They had quite a few later on we found out.</span> <span id="s105">We heard the babies cry at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">01:14: We saw corpses being taken out of very old people and finally they told us that we have</span></p> <p><span id="s107">to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Did they give you anything while you were there, any...?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Well, they gave us cross and a prayer book.</span> <span id="s110">They tried very much to convert us and some of them did.</span> <span id="s111">I was kind of scared, you know.</span> <span id="s112">I told them that I believe in my God, that I'm Jewish and I was scared that my Jewish...you know, I was a child, you know.</span> <span id="s113">I told them in my own words that if I accept your religion my God's going to punish me and I was scared to do it and I said I respect your religion.</span> <span id="s114">I would always respect it and if it can save my life I'll wear your cross and I'll treasure that prayer book that I still have and I want the Museum to have.</span> <span id="s115">I memorized all the prayers and when we parted they gave me a peasant blouse to wear so I wouldn't look suspicious.</span> <span id="s116">I would look like a peasant.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">And this was a very sad time to part with them because you had like a little security and I remember feeling good.</span> <span id="s118">They would take us into the chapel to pray, you know, and they would make us kneel and it just felt good after the prayer.</span> <span id="s119">You know, I kept saying to myself, God, there's nobody Jewish to pray with me, therefore I have to pray with them and when we parted it was very sad and it was like dying</span></p> <p><span id="s120">01:16: and I even told...there was one nun that took a special liking to me and every time she looked at me she would cry and she wanted me so much to stay there because she kept saying that I looked less Jewish than the others and there's really no such thing as looking Jewish, but because I was a red-head and the Germans believed that every Jew has dark hair and a big nose and dark complexion...it wasn't, it wasn't so at all.</span> <span id="s121">My mom had very fair complexion and I was always very fair, and it was very hard for this nun to part with me.</span> <span id="s122">She wanted me to stay but they were afraid and they let us go and this is how I ended up in Majdanek.</span> <span id="s123">Pretty soon they rounded us up.</span> <span id="s124">Majdanek was in the beginning to me...I can't say salvation but it was like a relief.</span> <span id="s125">Like I didn't have to run anymore.</span> <span id="s126">I knew it's a concentration camp and I saw a pile of dead people outside and I saw conditions and I heard screams but in the beginning I was kind of happy because I knew that tonight I can stay here, that I don't have to run through the woods because there's no one that extended a hand anymore like the nuns did.</span> <span id="s127">By the way, I'll go back to the nuns.</span> <span id="s128">They were very, very good to me, to us and I want you all to know that they risked their own lives.</span> <span id="s129">They didn't have much food and they shared it with us.</span> <span id="s130">My...</span></p> <p><span id="s131">01:18</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: How did you get from the convent to Majdanek?</span> <span id="s133">A: We were just wandering around...</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: In the forest?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: In the forest and the villages.</span> <span id="s136">I really didn't know where I was.</span> <span id="s137">If you asked me where Majdanek was, near what city, I didn't know.</span> <span id="s138">It didn't matter.</span> <span id="s139">If you saw a crowd of people you kind of turned around because you were afraid.</span> <span id="s140">Everyone looked suspicious.</span> <span id="s141">After leaving the convent we weren't dirty because we always had some water facilities you know to wash but when they they rounded us up on the street where they took people from the labor camp and there was no place to run.</span> <span id="s142">They took us on the trucks and they took to Majdanek.</span> <span id="s143">Majdanek was, turned out to be later on a pretty horrible place to be, especially for a young girl.</span> <span id="s144">I..</span> <span id="s145">.</span> <span id="s146">at one point I didn't know that they had younger children than me but later on I found out that they had a lot of infants and nobody could approach that place in Majdanek because apparently they would kill the infants and make lamp shades out of baby skins or soap from baby fat.</span> <span id="s147">We could smell it.</span> <span id="s148">We heard sometimes screams but we never saw it.</span> <span id="s149">Then there was another part of Majdanek that where the windows were always covered with chalk and sometimes we would come back from hard work...we would dig ditches or whatever they would</span></p> <p><span id="s150">01:20: ask us to do.</span> <span id="s151">By the way, this camp had a lot of Russian prisoners and they had high officers that lived separated from everybody else.</span> <span id="s152">They were treated much better.</span> <span id="s153">They would interrogate them, maybe get some secrets from them, because I noticed that they were bringing them food and a couple of times they sent us to clean their barracks and they had given us food.</span> <span id="s154">This is when I realized that they had some important Russian officers there.</span> <span id="s155">Then one day, and this is a a very difficult thing for me to talk, but it's history.</span> <span id="s156">We were asking a lot of questions.</span> <span id="s157">What is in this building?</span> <span id="s158">What is in this building?</span> <span id="s159">And that building with the chalk kind of interested me because sometimes I would hear screams and I would see German soldiers taking women there, women that were maybe at that time maybe in their twenties or maybe older.</span> <span id="s160">They were developed a lot better.</span> <span id="s161">They were pretty women and apparently they made some medical experiments, because through one window we peeked and we saw some men naked in big tubs.</span> <span id="s162">They were metal tubs, with ice and they would freeze them to a certain temperature and they would let the women undress and I guess they wanted to see the sexual reaction and this was horrible to watch and pretty soon it was the turn for us.</span> <span id="s163">(Pause) (Crying) This is when you .</span> <span id="s164">(Pause) And if you didn't do what they wanted you to do, you'll be beaten up something terrible, or you were put under cold showers.</span> <span id="s165">(Crying) Now I remember the Red Cross at</span></p> <p><span id="s166">01:23: one time came and we were moved to a different location.</span> <span id="s167">And then we heard rumors.</span> <span id="s168">A lot of the...there were a lot of Poles, there weren't only Jews...there were some Poles, political prisoners.</span> <span id="s169">There were even some Germans that were political opponents and we heard rumors that they were going to take us to Auschwitz and we had ovens.</span> <span id="s170">There were ovens in Majdanek but I never got to see them, and we heard screams but we never got to see them, but apparently the ovens weren't big enough...</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: Before we move on, let me...can we go back a little bit to what your experiences that you were talking about at Majdanek, what they did?</span> <span id="s172">Could you be a little...tell us a little more detail?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: I think it was...I think they just wanted to see the men suffer and us suffer but you know, when we saw the women that, you know, when a fourteen or fifteen year old girl that doesn't have to eat, it's rather ugly.</span> <span id="s174">Her head shaven looks...some of the women were rather, you know, developed.</span> <span id="s175">You know, they were older.</span> <span id="s176">I don't even remember having any breasts, you know, and when you saw what they did...they threw them, you know, on top of the men and they wanted to see the reaction and they actually tried to force the man to have sex with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: What was your experience?</span> <span id="s178">Tell what they asked you to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: They asked us to do the similar thing, but most of the time the men were like dead and it was just a horrible thing</span></p> <p><span id="s180">01:25: doing that, and the screams and and I remember I asked to be killed.</span> <span id="s181">(Crying) (Pause) I just couldn't go through it.</span> <span id="s182">They they stopped it and this was apparently...later on we found out that it was a group of doctors were conducting this experiment for their own selfish maybe... I really can't explain it.</span> <span id="s183">I read a book about it, that they were abnormal people, that they just got a kick seeing people suffer like that.</span> <span id="s184">Pretty soon when we heard rumors that we're going to Auschwitz, we decided that no matter what, we're not going to go to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s185">We're going to jump the train or we're going to do something.</span> <span id="s186">We're going to kill ourselves.</span> <span id="s187">We didn't have any weapons and we thought maybe we'll get some poison, you know, and you couldn't really talk, you know.</span> <span id="s188">You would gather doing work and you would...somebody would say something, but then one night indeed they took us on a train and this train supposedly was taking us to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s189">And at one point they told us when we tell you to jump the train, you must do it.</span> <span id="s190">If not, you're going to go to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s191">You don't want to go.</span> <span id="s192">And we jumped the train.</span> <span id="s193">I was shot.</span> <span id="s194">You can still see a hole, but I..</span> <span id="s195">.</span> <span id="s196">they picked me up.</span> <span id="s197">It wasn't too bad, and they put us on a transport...there was so much confusion.</span> <span id="s198">There were a lot of people...there were hundreds of people, and they put us on a transport of forced labor that was going into Germany.</span> <span id="s199">I don't know if you're familiar with it.</span> <span id="s200">They would take a lot of young people...very seldom Jews because Jews were already rounded up and and they were in camps, but there were a lot of Russian, Ukrainians and Polish young people and they forced them to go to Germany so they could work on their fields, because the German soldiers were not home.</span> <span id="s201">They were fighting the war, so that's how I got into Germany, with a transport of maybe three hundred people.</span> <span id="s202">On that transport only one person knew that I was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">01:28: A Ukrainian girl.</span> <span id="s204">To this day she lives in Canada, and we actually didn't know where the transport is going to take us but she whispered to me, as long as I can I'm going to help you and I'll never tell anyone that you are Jewish.</span> <span id="s205">And she did.</span> <span id="s206">We got to Bavaria and we ended up on a farm near Stranding (ph).</span> <span id="s207">It's in Bavaria.</span> <span id="s208">This was pretty close to the war end.</span> <span id="s209">We already heard rumors that, you know, the Americans are getting closer and closer.</span> <span id="s210">Life on the farm wasn't very pleasant.</span> <span id="s211">There wasn't enough food and the farmers were not very nice to us and they were very suspicious of me because most of them were indeed farmers.</span> <span id="s212">I wasn't so as a result they would look at my hands and they would say, oh, you must be some Italian, noble girl or something because your hands don't look like our hands.</span> <span id="s213">I couldn't milk a cow.</span> <span id="s214">I couldn't do a lot of things that they did, but it was still better than being in a concentration camp, but I was very scared.</span> <span id="s215">I knew that the war would come to an end and I didn't know how I was going to get out of this group of Poles, you know.</span> <span id="s216">How would I join with the liberation forces?</span> <span id="s217">This was my biggest concern, and this friend of mine, Natshtca (ph)...the only one that knew I was Jewish...she said, don't worry.</span> <span id="s218">It's going to work out.</span> <span id="s219">And I remember when we heard over the radio that they liberated a camp not too far from Regensburg.</span> <span id="s220">Stranding was maybe like a hundred miles from Regensburg and the farmer got very scared, you know, because he mistreated us.</span> <span id="s221">You know, he would beat us once in a while, and he wanted to know if we want to go, and we didn't know where to go so we asked him if he would give us a ride to the nearest town.</span> <span id="s222">He give us a ride to Borgenberg (ph), which was a tiny little town and we went to the police, this German police, and we asked him where the Americans are.</span> <span id="s223">And they didn't tell us.</span> <span id="s224">They didn't know.</span> <span id="s225">They were still about</span></p> <p><span id="s226">01:31: fifty miles, and pretty soon this Colonel McMann...the one that I showed you the obituary...he liberated a camp and he made an announcement on the radio, so if you have...if you know where Jewish people are, if they're hiding, please come forward.</span> <span id="s227">And they sent out American cars and jeeps to get us and they put us in hostels.</span> <span id="s228">And this is when they started to interview us, and you know, we were so scared that I was afraid even to speak to Americans.</span> <span id="s229">I remember the first interview was a colonel from Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s230">He was asking me questions and I didn't trust him, but it took a while for me to gain confidence in them, and we told them about my family and the first concern was do I have somebody living, and I knew...I pretty much gave up on my parents.</span> <span id="s231">I knew that if they would be alive, I would have...they would have found me or something, but I knew that my brother's in Israel, that he probably is either in Israel or hiding somewhere else and the American Red Cross found out that he was fighting with the Jewish Brigade in Belgium and it took him a while to find me because he couldn't get away.</span> <span id="s232">In the meantime they were questioning me about my relatives in America and I knew names but I didn't...couldn't tell them where they lived or how they lived and there was one</span></p> <p><span id="s233">01:33: American doctor that took a special interest and showed me a movie.</span> <span id="s234">They gave us some medication to kind of relax us.</span> <span id="s235">There was a group of us.</span> <span id="s236">Must have been a couple of hundred Jewish kids, and they showed us a movie of these sights and they asked us, they said if there is a name...you know, they showed us stores with names...if there's a name that makes any sense to you, and I saw a name Friedman, and I said I think I had a cousin by the name of Friedman and they asked me what he did and I really didn't remember.</span> <span id="s237">I told them that I think he came from Poland and he became a watchmaker and he put it all with my name and what I told him.</span> <span id="s238">He put an ad in the American Jewish Journal or whatever...it's a paper in New York...and a cousin of my grandfather read it and they sent a telegram to America because the other cousin's son, the man that married me, was with the American forces near Munich and within a couple of weeks he came to see me and by then, you know, I had gained weight and they had given me some clothes and this is the picture...</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Where were you living then?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: I was living in Stranding, in a German home.</span> <span id="s241">This was not a very pleasant story in the beginning because when the Burgermeister brought me there with the Jewish survivors, it became like the head of the Jewish kids to help us out, came to the door and told them the story that she's liberated now.</span> <span id="s242">She has no place to go.</span> <span id="s243">She says I can't accept her.</span> <span id="s244">She's Jewish.</span> <span id="s245">And she said my husband is a Nazi and that's why he's in jail, so I did not want to live with them.</span> <span id="s246">I was scared.</span> <span id="s247">And then we found out that the doctor, Doctor Edlbacher, I remember his name well he was not a Nazi.</span> <span id="s248">He joined the Nazi party because he was a hunter and he couldn't get a license.</span> <span id="s249">And that night he was freed, and indeed they gave me a place in their home.</span> <span id="s250">They tried to be very nice and they came with flowers, and I knew it was temporary because my relatives in America did everything to try to bring me over.</span> <span id="s251">In the meantime my brother came, but things were so bad in Israel</span></p> <p><span id="s252">01:36: that he knew that I would have to wait a long time to get into Israel because there were just too many people and the British were not willing to do it, so pretty soon I got a visa to come to the States and I came on a military small boat, Marina Fletcher and I have the telegram that was sent to me and I hope the Museum can have them, or wants them.</span> <span id="s253">So my story, my very sad story had a good ending.</span> <span id="s254">I came to the States.</span> <span id="s255">I felt sad that I came alone, that I was pretty much sure that they were dead because I went through a lot of camps looking for for them.</span> <span id="s256">I thought maybe I'll find a sister.</span> <span id="s257">Maybe I find my mother.</span> <span id="s258">I knew about my father, but indeed to this day nobody's alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Where did you go when you first came to...arrived in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: I went to New York, to my grandmother's sister.</span> <span id="s261">They were very good people.</span> <span id="s262">She was so overwhelmed with all this, you know.</span> <span id="s263">She didn't know what to do for me.</span> <span id="s264">She lived at the Bronx.</span> <span id="s265">She had three educated children, you know.</span> <span id="s266">Her daughter was married to a doctor and two sons were fairly successful businessmen and they really wanted me to live with them, but she wouldn't let me go and it was difficult for me to stay with her because I went to school, went to high school in the Bronx and when I came home I had to speak Yiddish with her because that was the only language she knew and I felt like I really wanted to learn the language and all this time I corresponded with my husband-to-be.</span> <span id="s267">He was still in Germany, you know, and he wrote to me and he wanted very much for me to wait for him.</span> <span id="s268">And he still remained there for almost a year.</span> <span id="s269">And finally he came home in November '46 and we were married pretty soon after.</span> <span id="s270">Had a beautiful family.</span> <span id="s271">I have three beautiful children but</span></p> <p><span id="s272">01:39: tragedy struck and my husband died of a sudden heart attack at the age of forty-seven.</span> <span id="s273">He did a lot for us all.</span> <span id="s274">He helped with the survivors.</span> <span id="s275">He helped me an awful lot.</span> <span id="s276">He's the one that made all the connections with relatives to sponsor me because the Polish quota was impossible.</span> <span id="s277">It...I don't know how they managed to send me on the first military boat.</span> <span id="s278">(Pause)</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Now you're in America.</span> <span id="s280">What were your feelings about...about living in America, adapting to American ways?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: I loved this country.</span> <span id="s282">I'm very grateful for accepting us.</span> <span id="s283">I still have a lot of guilt as to my past.</span> <span id="s284">Sometimes I question why did I survive and they didn't.</span> <span id="s285">This somehow never leaves it.</span> <span id="s286">You try to be involved with a lot of good causes.</span> <span id="s287">I try to tell my stories because I feel that you cannot really condemn a nation.</span> <span id="s288">I feel that if it wouldn't be for some good Germans that let us through the lines of the ghetto, I wouldn't be here.</span> <span id="s289">I feel that if it wouldn't be for the nuns that risked their lives to help us, we wouldn't be here.</span> <span id="s290">And I feel that every survivor has a story.</span> <span id="s291">Some people are very bitter in that they don't want to remember good things.</span> <span id="s292">You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s293">I had spoken to a lot of friends that resent me even telling the story about the nuns because they feel why weren't there more nuns, but I, I believe that we have to appreciate even if there was a little good in them we should appreciate it, and I'll remember all those things that were done for me.</span> <span id="s294">I'll remember to the rest of my life.</span> <span id="s295">There were a lot of righteous people in this world and I hope that God blesses them and that they get rewarded.</span> <span id="s296">I know a lot of them did.</span> <span id="s297">My girlfriend, the one that's in Canada, she is not young and she's ill and we try very much to help her.</span> <span id="s298">To this day I'm in touch with her.</span> <span id="s299">It would have been very easy for her to point me out as a Jew.</span> <span id="s300">She probably would have gotten paid, but she didn't.</span> <span id="s301">And stories like that go on.</span> <span id="s302">This is why I feel that there's still a lot of good in mankind, and maybe...I'm thinking now about the Germanies being united and I have mixed feelings, but this is a new generation and let's hope that there's going to be a better world.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">01:43:</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Are there any other things that you would like to add about your experiences that you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: (Sigh) Probably.</span> <span id="s306">You know, sometimes my mind goes blank because I'm trying so hard to move away from my past.</span> <span id="s307">But if if there is something that you want me that I started and I wandered off, I would be glad to tell you....you mean experiences in the camps or...</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Experiences in the camps that you can relate.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Well, there were inhuman conditions.</span> <span id="s310">There were even inhuman behavior among Jews, sometimes because you were angry, because you were hungry and because you really couldn't explain it.</span> <span id="s311">I remember in Majdanek, sharing a bunk with a French girl that talked very little.</span> <span id="s312">She didn't want to talk to me.</span> <span id="s313">She didn't want to talk to anyone.</span> <span id="s314">She was quite sickly, and she just talked about her family.</span> <span id="s315">She always cried about her family, and I remember something that I did that to this day I find very hard to explain why I did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">She wouldn't eat, and you know we had so little to eat, and somehow there was a piece of bread next to her and she didn't eat, and I ate that piece of bread and the next day she died.</span> <span id="s317">She didn't live through the night, and I feel like maybe because I ate her bread, she died.</span> <span id="s318">And this just brought on more guilt and sometimes you wonder why, why did I have to live in circumstances to see such horrible things.</span> <span id="s319">(Sigh) This girl I recognized in a photograph that was given to me close to liberation by a German soldier.</span> <span id="s320">I don't know if they took the pictures.</span> <span id="s321">I really don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: What kind of work did you do in Majdanek?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Oh they would make us dig ditches, clean.</span> <span id="s324">Sometimes take stones and move them near the gate.</span> <span id="s325">Sometimes we cleaned barracks where...they had a lot of Russian prisoners and most of the barracks that we cleaned were officers', as I told you, and they would sometimes give us food.</span> <span id="s326">And most of the time we witnessed some horrible experience that I described to you, and some of the things they wouldn't let us see like the babies, you know, were ...they made skin out of</span></p> <p><span id="s327">01:47: baby skin or lamp shades out of baby skin or so.</span> <span id="s328">We were never...I could never...even if I could see it I don't think I could look at it, but this was done in the same camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: What were the conditions in the barracks like?</span> <span id="s330">Were the barracks ?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: Well, you know, as I told you when I got into the camp it was like to me it was better than living in the street.</span> <span id="s332">You know, there was a place to go.</span> <span id="s333">I remember seeing a table, and I hadn't seen a table for a long time and the table looked so good to me and so clean.</span> <span id="s334">Actually it wasn't clean.</span> <span id="s335">The food was pretty bad but you ate it.</span> <span id="s336">You know, sometimes dish water tasted like good soup because you were hungry.</span> <span id="s337">You were young and sometimes you saw prisoners hungry eating dead prisoners' flesh and it's terrible to go back and and remember it and sometimes I can't believe the things that I saw and I think it's either I read a story or it's imagination.</span> <span id="s338">And it's took me a long time to overcome dreams or horrible thoughts.</span> <span id="s339">I was in therapy when I first came over just to be able to function, you know.</span> <span id="s340">It was hard for me to smile.</span> <span id="s341">It was hard for me to listen to music sometimes, especially music that had a marching...you know, I would just get frantic or sometimes even faint.</span> <span id="s342">I used to have horrible dreams.</span> <span id="s343">You know, the vision of my father with the talis (ph)...vision of a lot of dead people piled up in camp and I had to work very hard to overcome it (crying).</span> <span id="s344">It took me years to be able to talk.</span> <span id="s345">When there was a documentary on television I would round up the kids and put them to bed and my late husband would get angry at me.</span> <span id="s346">He felt that they should see it.</span> <span id="s347">For some reason I didn't want them to see it.</span> <span id="s348">I couldn't really explain why.</span> <span id="s349">I wanted the world to know what Hitler did, but</span></p> <p><span id="s350">01:50: I wasn't sure how it was going to affect young children and I always was afraid that they might see movies of my experience in Majdanek.</span> <span id="s351">I feel this to this day.</span> <span id="s352">It was a..</span> <span id="s353">.</span> <span id="s354">I couldn't quite understand what they were doing and it was a frightening thing.</span> <span id="s355">You know, it was something that I really couldn't even explain to the doctor.</span> <span id="s356">(Pause) A lot of people suggest that...my doctor suggested that I should write a book.</span> <span id="s357">I don't know.</span> <span id="s358">There's many books written on the Holocaust and what I experienced.</span> <span id="s359">I don't know if I'm strong enough to do it.</span> <span id="s360">The years that I have remaining I want to see...my kids are pretty grown.</span> <span id="s361">I have my youngest is in law school and I hope he succeeds, and I am just so afraid of getting weaker, of losing my mind and you know, this this is my fear because some of those things are pretty horrible.</span> <span id="s362">I never thought that a human being could live through it.</span> <span id="s363">There was a time where I was wondering if there was really a God, and I questioned a lot of it.</span> <span id="s364">I didn't want my kids to know about it, so I did make sure that my kids had a religious education.</span> <span id="s365">They were all bar mitzvahed.</span> <span id="s366">But I always questioned and when I lost my husband I had a lot of conversations with God, but you never get an answer.</span> <span id="s367">But I still feel that there is something good that's going to come.</span> <span id="s368">It has to because we've been through so much horror.</span> <span id="s369">Now with this situation in the Middle East, God protect us.</span> <span id="s370">We don't know what's going to happen, but I refuse to believe that if there is really a God, that he's going to let it happen because there was so much suffering.</span> <span id="s371">People suffer from illness in this world.</span> <span id="s372">There's a lot of suffering in this country.</span> <span id="s373">There's so much good that still can be accomplished, and I hope that we all live to see it.</span> <span id="s374">I want to thank you for the opportunity to talk maybe more than I ever did before.</span> <span id="s375">You forgive me for my emotions.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Thank you very much for doing the interview.</span> <span id="s377">01:54</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
