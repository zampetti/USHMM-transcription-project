I did not go to Poland back because thinking that this is a home, I care less . . .(inaudible) I been back 4 times.</span> <span id="s40">The reason I did go back, and I’m still going to go one time more, is, I think that there’s several families (inaudible) they saved my life – not that they were Jew lovers, don’t get me wrong.</span> <span id="s41">And, you see, I escaped several times from the Nazi’s and I didn’t have a place where to go . . . and those people took me in . . . and they gave me a roof over my head.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">WH: Why did they do it?</span> <span id="s43">You said that they weren’t Jew lovers.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">WP: I don’t know . . .I found out that the lady of the house . . . she loved Jews, she liked Jewish people.</span> <span id="s45">As a matter of fact, that poor tailor, that poor shoemaker . . .I found out that they did help those people.</span> <span id="s46">So, evidently, she must have gotten a sore spot in her heart . . . a lot of people suffered on account of me.</span> <span id="s47">A lot of Christians there . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s48">WH: When you came here . . . did anything particular happen on the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">WP: . . . there was group of Pollacks which one from the Polish guys – came on the ship with a Polish uniform, and he was a big shot, and . . . he had a star on his – so he was in charge of certain things around . . . so he used to take Jews and put them to the worse things, you know, and I confronted him.</span> <span id="s50">First of all, I had a wife and a little boy . . . they were separate from us, and they were very sick, they were sea-sick.</span> <span id="s51">He did not – because it was him, it wasn’t the ship’s captain or anybody else, he would not – let any man or Jew to go down to see how his child or his wife is . . . so I says to the guys, ‘What in the hell can he do with us?</span> <span id="s52">Send us back?</span> <span id="s53">He wouldn’t send us back.</span> <span id="s54">What more can he do?’</span> <span id="s55">So I did go down . . . he came out from a cabin, he was married, he had his wife, probably, or whoever, and he insulted me, he called me a ‘goddamn Jew.’</span> <span id="s56">So I beat the shit out of him.</span> <span id="s57">And I organized that none of the Jews on the boat go to work.</span> <span id="s58">But, they wanted to go to work, they didn’t have anything to do with themselves, they went crazy.</span> <span id="s59">They were sea-sick.</span> <span id="s60">They wanted to do something there.</span> <span id="s61">As a matter of fact, when the ship landed in New York I was looking, I was after him, I was looking for him, I wanted to teach him a lesson that he’ll never forget me.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">WH: But you didn’t find him?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">WP: No, I did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">WH: What was your first impression when you came to New

the letters here, and mine is ‘Peltz’ – ‘P’ and the luggage and the packages, and the schmattes that we had, and all that stuff and you know, the impression was very bad.</span> <span id="s66">We went for a ride, somebody took us for a ride from the IRO.</span> <span id="s67">Took us for a ride to show us New York . . . in a car . . . and I had a lady, I did write her a letter that we are coming, so she waited for us there too . . . she lived with me in Germany, in the same town.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">WH: And she had already come.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">WP: And I used to write to her.</span> <span id="s70">She used to write to me.</span> <span id="s71">And I told her that we are coming to the United States and this and this date we going to be in N.Y. so she waited for us . . . we went for a ride, it didn’t impress me.</span> <span id="s72">I turned around and I says, to my late wife, I says, ‘I don’t think this is America.’</span> <span id="s73">Driving though the streets of the Bronx with the filth and all that stuff and I didn’t – it was terrible.</span> <span id="s74">It was a terrible impression.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">HW: . . . you occupation at that time

going to make a living and this is one thing I didn’t think about, and I was sure of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">WH: How long did you stay in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">WP: New

<p><span id="s84">WH: Who decided that you should go to Milwaukee?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">WP: . . .this was my own decision . . .a very good friend of mine, a German Jew . . . we were very close, and he left Germany before I did . . . and he settle in Milwaukee that’s why I followed him to Milwaukee.</span> <span id="s86">So I went to Frankfurt, and I told them (HIAS) that I would like to go to Milwaukee, and that’s how it was done.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">WH: . . . did he come to the train station to greet you?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">WP: No . . . at the station, there were not too many, was only me and my late wife and some Christians . . . and this lady came up to me and with a broken Yiddish, says to me, ‘I’m Miss Goldberg and I’m here waiting for you.’</span> <span id="s89">And . . . she told me that she would like me to go into the car and she’d like to show us Milwaukee first and she did.</span> <span id="s90">Milwaukee was in comparison what I seen in New York was day and night.</span> <span id="s91">Then they took us to a place, and I had a room waiting for us.</span> <span id="s92">A very nice room.</span> <span id="s93">And a refrigerator full of fruit and food, and what have you not, and on the table was brand new bed sheets and linen, blankets, and everything . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s94">WH: . . . what was the name of the

I feel different, because when I came here and I met the families, the Newcomer’s which we start to see each other every day.</span> <span id="s162">You know, the children were small, and I was three weeks here and I had a brand new car.</span> <span id="s163">Ever heard of it?</span> <span id="s164">I didn’t have a nickel, but I had a brand new car.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">WH: How did that

<p><span id="s186">WH: Do you think that there’s a loosing of the ties as the years go by?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">WP: Well, not only that, I think that they are – that something else developed, there’s a – and I think that this is the main reason, is that some were successful, some not.</span> <span id="s188">And they wanted – they did get successful, start to mingle with some different people.</span> <span id="s189">And there’s a jealously involved.</span> <span id="s190">Which I think it’s normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">WH: Not everybody winds up in the same place.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">WP: Correct . . .anyway, I am as close to anybody, and everybody like I used to be 20, 30 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">WH: When you got together in the

id="s203">When I think about my family, I think I see them in front of me the way they looked 40, 50 years ago.</span> <span id="s204">Not 50 – not today.</span> <span id="s205">See, I still remember my little sister was 9 years old.</span> <span id="s206">So, we got to talk about a lot.</span> <span id="s207">We always talk about that . . .there are a few people here in Milwaukee that they are

‘How come I don’t know you?’</span> <span id="s219">So he says to me, ‘I just came from Birmingham, Alabama, I’ve got a wife and two children and it’s terrible there I can’t find a job,’ and so on . . . so I says to him, ‘What are you doing for a living?’</span> <span id="s220">He says, ‘I’m a tailor.’</span> <span id="s221">I says, ‘Come with me, I’ll give you a job.’</span> <span id="s222">He

read the proclamation, that they tried to escape, and they were sentenced to death.</span> <span id="s843">They killed them inch by inch, sitting on the chairs, and we had to stay that time, 24 hours and watch them.</span> <span id="s844">And then, they did lay on the chair – sit on the chairs tied down for three days.</span> <span id="s845">It was impossible to escape.</span> <span id="s846">I was encouraged by an S.S. man, and S.S. man by the name of Alfred Mintz, he was in charge.</span> <span id="s847">I worked there.</span> <span id="s848">He was in charge of those soldiers, the S.S. men that did bring in Jews to the camp and they stayed over night, or two nights, but they gave them a place, there were – had special small barracks where they could sleep there, so they needed bed sheets and blankets and whatever . . .this man used to encourage me.</span> <span id="s849">He wanted to help me to escape.</span> <span id="s850">I didn’t trust him.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">WH: You felt he might help you escape and turn you in?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">WP: I don’t know. . . it came to the point that when he used to get packages from home, I used to sit at the table and eat with him.</span> <span id="s853">And he told me that he is willing to help me to escape.</span> <span id="s854">But where?</span> <span id="s855">Okay, I’ll get out from the camp, where in the

no, no.</span> <span id="s862">I never had any hope . . . not me, some others too, we did, try to figure out when the day is going to come for us.</span> <span id="s863">You know, with the percentage of people getting killed, the percentage of people getting sick, and diseases and so on and so forth . . . at one time we had in the camp a typhoid.</span> <span id="s864">My gosh, there was no help, there was no medication, no doctors, and you could see that people are dying just like flies.</span> <span id="s865">So we tried to figure out when you gonna be next.</span> <span id="s866">I gotta tell you a little story.</span> <span id="s867">You heard that we had in Auschwitz and Birkenau, we had an orchestra, the men had an orchestra, and the women, you know, that’s why they had on t.v. that they had one time they place, ‘Playing for Time,’ (inaudible name) they should have burned it, they should have never had shown that thing on it – I think that was the biggest proproganda.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">WH: Look who played the part, remember, Vanessa Redgrave.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">WP: I know, I know.</span> <span id="s870">The biggest proproganda.</span> <span id="s871">The kapomeister, the guy who was the leader from the orchestra, the conductor, was a well-know conductor in Russia, he was a Jewish man, and the musicians, they did wear all those dark blue jackets, whatever, but anyways, one day this man, this Russian conductor, vanished.</span> <span id="s872">They did away with him.</span> <span id="s873">There was a French Jew, he was the violinist, a very nice, special person, he was not a youngster any more.</span> <span id="s874">And he used to sleep – where I used to sleep, on the bunk . . .so they made him for the leader of this orchestra, this man.</span> <span id="s875">Very seldom did we talk about getting free.</span> <span id="s876">Maybe America was going to get us free.</span> <span id="s877">But this time we did talk about-somebody did talk about it.</span> <span id="s878">You know what this man said?</span> <span id="s879">And this is something that whenever we talk about it, it always comes to my mind, it never leaves my mind, and he used to say, he says, ‘You know, you know your children?’</span> <span id="s880">I says, ‘I doubt it.</span> <span id="s881">It might be a miracle if some of us is going to survive.’</span> <span id="s882">‘Maybe,’ he says, but he says, ‘if it’s gonna be that miracle, if some of us is going to survive, we will wish that we should have been dead.’</span> <span id="s883">I want you to know that it made sense to me now.</span> <span id="s884">Then, it didn’t make any sense, but it made sense to me after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">WH: Because
