CONVERSATION 01:15:03</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s14">Would you -- sorry about that.</span> <span id="s15">Would you tell me your name, full name, again, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: My full name is Simone Marguerite Lipman.</span> <span id="s17">My maiden name was Weil -- W-E-I-L.</span> <span id="s18">Simone Weil.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Where and when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: I was actually born in a very little village in Alsace, near Strasbourg.</span> <span id="s21">I was born on April 22nd, 1920.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: And what was the name of the village?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: The name of the village was Ringendorf.</span> <span id="s24">In spite of the fact that it was so small that it didn't even fit on the -- doesn't appear on most maps, it had a Jewish community.</span> <span id="s25">It had a synagogue which, of course, was destroyed during the war.</span> <span id="s26">And I -- the house in which I was born is in shambles, but it's still there.</span> <span id="s27">My family moved to Strasbourg in -- when I was three years old.</span> <span id="s28">My father was a sheep raiser, a very unusual kind of a profession for -- occupation for a Jew.</span> <span id="s29">His father, whom I never knew, was a butcher.</span> <span id="s30">They're all family of Jewish butchers, but he broke out of there, ‘though he had barely, probably, a sixth grade education, and he became one of the most prominent sheep-breeders in the east.</span> <span id="s31">So I grew up in Strasbourg, which was a vibrant, vibrant and dynamic, Jewish community.</span> <span id="s32">I have a brother -- I should say, I had a brother, because he died some 14 years ago after loosing his son in the Yom Kippur War in Israel.</span> <span id="s33">My brother was just a year younger than myself, and both of us were very active in, in the Jewish youth movement, which were the Jewish scouting movement, Les Éclaireurs Israélites de France.Les "ÉIF," as we called them.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">01:02:20 And I'm going to refer to them many times in this hour to come.</span> <span id="s35">I also got a very solid Jewish education there -- very unusual for girls my age.</span> <span id="s36">I went to Talmud Torah all through my high school, and was very active in things Jewish.</span> <span id="s37">And particularly, as I said, in the Jewish youth movement, the scouts, where I was a leader and had leadership training.</span> <span id="s38">I went into the lycée,like all kids my age.</span> <span id="s39">I got a good classical education, I suppose.</span> <span id="s40">In those days, it was the typical classical education: studying Latin and Greek and philosophy, whatever.</span> <span id="s41">But when I finished high school and got my baccalaureate in 1938, I wanted to become a physicist.</span> <span id="s42">But somehow I was talked out of it, because the writing was on the wall, and somehow was told that was not a thing to do for a Jewish girl, and that it would be better in -- to go into something more practical.</span> <span id="s43">And so I went into early childhood education, and I'm stuck.</span> <span id="s44">I mean, I never moved away from that.</span> <span id="s45">So I got one year of training, and that's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">1 The Israeli Scouts of France (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s47">2 French grammar or high school, funded by the State (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s48">But already in 1938, while the Munich Agreements and the debates were going on, my parents sent me to safety with my grandmother -- then very close to 80.</span> <span id="s49">And I went somewhere in the south of France with her for just a short period.</span> <span id="s50">Then things calmed down again and I went back to Strasbourg.</span> <span id="s51">And we stayed in Strasbourg.</span> <span id="s52">By 19 -- by the end of the summer 1939, of course, we knew war was coming.</span> <span id="s53">And again, I was shipped to the center of France with my grandmother.</span> <span id="s54">I was eighteen years old.</span> <span id="s55">But the safety of my grandmother was utmost.</span> <span id="s56">That was my ma -- paternal grandmother, lived with us.</span> <span id="s57">And I was sent down south to take care of her.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">01:06:04 In the meanwhile, Strasbourg, which was the most -- considered the most exposed city of France in spite of the Maginot Line -- was completely evacuated.</span> <span id="s59">All the population of Strasbourg was evacuated and sent down to the to the Périgeaux, to the Department of the Dordogne.</span> <span id="s60">But somehow, because my parents had their own private means, they did not join the flow of refugees going down south and they went near Nancy, where they rented a house.</span> <span id="s61">Now, here I am south with my grandmother and -- when things settled down.</span> <span id="s62">But because you had relatives, somehow it was they were able to get in touch with me.</span> <span id="s63">And so I returned to Blâmont, where my parents were living, with my grandmother.</span> <span id="s64">And there we were waiting for the war to finish.</span> <span id="s65">We had just with us whatever we needed.</span> <span id="s66">And when the winter came, we needed some more clothes.</span> <span id="s67">And I remember to this day, going with a "safe- conduct" -- that what you call it?</span> <span id="s68">A "sauf-conduit.</span> <span id="s69">"And we went into Strasbourg, my brother and I.</span> <span id="s70">It was a ghost town with just cats and dogs in there, and we got some winter clothes and went back to Blâmont.</span> <span id="s71">In the meanwhile, I took a job in Paris, in, in a private school, to -- because I had had some training in early childhood education.</span> <span id="s72">And I worked there, while the bombs, the bombings were starting, and taught in the shelters, and so forth and so on.</span> <span id="s73">But that lasted a very short period, because my mother took sick, and I returned to Blâmont in the spring of 1940, just in time for the invasion.</span> <span id="s74">And so we were in -- I think the invasion is four -- the fifth or sixth of May 1940.</span> <span id="s75">My very religious family had prepared everything for Shabbat, and the first time in their life, they had to take to the road on the Shabbat.</span> <span id="s76">And here we were, loading as much as we could in a car and taking off direction unknown, because the Germans were -- had crossed over.</span> <span id="s77">Coming through Belgium, Holland, and crossing over.</span> <span id="s78">And we were very close to the border, so we left.</span> <span id="s79">As a matter of fact, a neighbor of ours had a car.</span> <span id="s80">Was a crippled lady and her daughter.</span> <span id="s81">And nobody to drive the car.</span> <span id="s82">And I had had two lessons in driving, so I took the wheel, and followed my brother with... And we drove for five days and five nights.</span> <span id="s83">We drove with the bombings going on.</span> <span id="s84">These were convoys of people just carrying with them whatever they could.</span> <span id="s85">We were fortunate we always find a room for my grandmother.</span> <span id="s86">But anyway, we ended up in the somewhere near Vichy, of all places, and we heard that France had surrendered.</span> <span id="s87">This was June 6th, 1940.</span> <span id="s88">And here we were.</span> <span id="s89">Couldn't go any back.</span> <span id="s90">Couldn't go any forward.</span> <span id="s91">So we stopped.</span> <span id="s92">And we waited to see what would happen.</span> <span id="s93">What would happen was that all the Jews from Alsace were expelled because France was divided into two zones: the northern</span></p> <p><span id="s94">3 Safe-conduct (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s95">part and the southern part, with a demarcation line in between.</span> <span id="s96">But Alsace and Lorraine were annexed, and became Germany -- became German right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">01:08:38 Like they had done so many times before -- before the World War II, before World War I, and...and so on.</span> <span id="s98">And so all the Jews from Alsace were expelled.</span> <span id="s99">And relatives were ma -- were coming down over the demarcation line.</span> <span id="s100">And my father and my brother managed to find a farm, that is where -- the house of a guard, in a big chateau in the southwest of France in Périgeaux, in the free zone.</span> <span id="s101">And that's where my family settled for the rest of the war.</span> <span id="s102">there were, there was -- there were my parents, my grandmother, my brother, myself; and then two uncles, two aunts, two cousins and two German men who had come -- had escaped from the -- from Germany.</span> <span id="s103">And we took them on...on the farm.</span> <span id="s104">One of my great guilts about that period is that I wasn't -- I didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s105">We were -- we felt safe in this farm, where we were going to wait.</span> <span id="s106">We were going to have food.</span> <span id="s107">And I really didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s108">And my family was not very new, were not -- wasn't oriented to this kind of thing.</span> <span id="s109">And I was -- we were surviving there.</span> <span id="s110">I was milking the cows, literally.</span> <span id="s111">One morning the gendarmecame -- the French police, the French gendarme -- and asked for our two German men.</span> <span id="s112">They were rounding them up.</span> <span id="s113">And I was so unaware of what was going on that I went to call them.</span> <span id="s114">But one was smart enough, aware enough, to jump out of the back in the woods and disappear.</span> <span id="s115">And the other one, of course, they took along.</span> <span id="s116">To this day I don't know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s117">The Jews had to register in the south of -- we never had to wear the, the star in the south of France, but as Jews we all had to register with the Commisariat aux Affaires Juives-- the, the special office for Jews.</span> <span id="s118">And my parents registered.</span> <span id="s119">I suppose I did, too, although I don't remember that particularly.</span> <span id="s120">But somehow during this first year there, I got a call -- I got a, I got a letter.</span> <span id="s121">I think it was a letter.</span> <span id="s122">I don't think we had a phone.</span> <span id="s123">Certainly we had no transportation.</span> <span id="s124">We had no phone.</span> <span id="s125">And I got a call from one of my former leaders in the Jewish scouting movement.</span> <span id="s126">And I'm going to mention her name, because she's so well known: Andrée Salomon is known by everybody for her incredible work that she has done in rescuing Jewish children during the war.</span> <span id="s127">And had already started doing so in Strasbourg, when all -- when German Jewish parents started to send children across the border for us to... And they were placed in families throughout Alsace.</span> <span id="s128">And Andrée was already the person to take care of them, and to, to see to their safety.</span> <span id="s129">How she got in touch with me, I will never know because unfortunately she died a few years ago, before I ever really cleared this up.</span> <span id="s130">But she said they -- I was needed in one of the camps, and explained the situation.</span> <span id="s131">And this is the first time I knew about camps.</span> <span id="s132">And to this day, it's a great guilt that I carry, that I didn't know about these camps.</span> <span id="s133">But I packed and I left.</span> <span id="s134">Not very much support from my family.</span> <span id="s135">I was very distressed because my mother was not terribly well, had taken very hardly all these changes in leaving Strasbourg.</span> <span id="s136">But I left.</span> <span id="s137">Of 4 Soldiers of the Police Militia (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s138">5 The correct name of this bureau is: Commisariat Général aux Questions Juives [Commission for Jewish Affairs] (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s139">course, there were plenty of people on the farm.</span> <span id="s140">And I, and I just packed my things, and I went to Rivesaltes.</span> <span id="s141">Now, I don't know if you want me to go into any explanation as to what Rivesaltes was.</span> <span id="s142">I'm sure you know about Rivesaltes, but I didn't know.</span> <span id="s143">And I went there, and became a resident -- a worker for OSE.At that time, OSE had -- of course, Madame Salomon sent them over to there -- another worker, Vivette, and a doctor, Doctor Malkin.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">And then there were other organizations that, like the OSE, had resident workers there.</span> <span id="s145">There was the Unitarians, the Quakers, the CIMADE,and a number of other rescue agencies – Secours Suisse,particularly.</span> <span id="s146">The Swiss Relief Agen…</span></p> <p><span id="s147">01:13:48 I'm not sure exactly what it was called.</span> <span id="s148">And the primary job of these agencies was to help improve the conditions of the people there, because the camps hygienic and physical conditions were beyond descriptions.</span> <span id="s149">The camp was situated in an area where what I remember mostly is the wind blowing -- this hot wind called "La Tramontane,"which, the people being so weak from malnutrition, they just rolled along with the wind.</span> <span id="s150">They couldn't, they couldn't walk in the wind.</span> <span id="s151">Now, in the camp there was still some Spanish refugees from the Franco wars, and in the camps were all the Jews that had been deported from Rhineland, from areas along the Rhine, on the -- in Germany.</span> <span id="s152">Some of them had already been in Gurs, another very infamous camp in the southwest of France, and transferred to Rivesaltes.</span> <span id="s153">After a year of internment, they were in very weakened condition already.</span> <span id="s154">Because, although as I understand it the food that was provided was according to the Geneva Convention, but much of it disappeared on the black market.</span> <span id="s155">In addition to which, there wasn't much food, period, in France.</span> <span id="s156">And one of the jobs of OSE, which was originally actually a medical social agency, was to provide extra rations for the people.</span> <span id="s157">So that became one of the important tasks of OSE, to distribute whatever it could.</span> <span id="s158">Some day it was milk from the Secours Suisse.</span> <span id="s159">Sometimes it was dates.</span> <span id="s160">Sometimes it was a handful of olives.</span> <span id="s161">And always a little bread that we had to divide.</span> <span id="s162">I shall never forget entering into the barracks and dividing the breads in eight pieces.</span> <span id="s163">And how can you make them exactly equal?</span> <span id="s164">So we put numbers of them, so that it was like a, a lottery for people to get the piece of bread.</span> <span id="s165">So that no one would be slighted, because fights would erupt around the size of a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s166">I remember handing a man in the barrack a piece of bread and his just falling back.</span> <span id="s167">And he was dead.</span> <span id="s168">That was the condition of the adults.</span> <span id="s169">And, of course, the men lived in their own barracks, and the women in their own.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">01:16:06 6 Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants [Organization for Children’s Rescue] (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s171">7 Comité d’Inter-Mouvement auprès des Evacués [Committee of Inside-Movement related to Evacuants] (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s172">8 Swiss Rescue (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s173">9 North wind; Tramontana (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s174">And the children, we tried to keep them in special ilôtwhere we kept the children, and tried to provide as much as we could for them in terms of extras.</span> <span id="s175">A lot of little activities, and so on.</span> <span id="s176">My -- but the particular purpose for my going to Rivesaltes was to take care of the children.</span> <span id="s177">Not so much the administrative work to which I'm going to come a little bit later.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Oh, I did food rationing, this food ration distribution; but I took care of the children.</span> <span id="s179">I remember the first Saturday afternoon, Shabbat afternoon, we gathered.</span> <span id="s180">I had two hundred and eighty kids for one Oneg Shabbat.And I've been trying to do something in one, one big barrack.</span> <span id="s181">But there were wonderful people among the internees.</span> <span id="s182">There were some people who -- whose moral fiber was just such that they wanted to do something for the others.</span> <span id="s183">So there were teachers, there were rabbis, there were people who, who lent a hand.</span> <span id="s184">And we tried to provide whatever we could and -- with nothing.</span> <span id="s185">Singing, dancing --whatever we could.</span> <span id="s186">I also created some groups of girl scouts.</span> <span id="s187">I mean, girl scouts in a camp!</span> <span id="s188">It sounds ridiculous when I think of it today, but that's all I knew in, in, in activities.</span> <span id="s189">So I created girl scouts.</span> <span id="s190">But when I have the pictures to show you later, I had -- we organized activities.</span> <span id="s191">In the meanwhile, OSE proceeded to get the liberation from the camp of the children under 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">And some over 16 as well, because you could just work around that a little bit.</span> <span id="s193">The procedure is well-known today.</span> <span id="s194">I think that the way it was done it was that you could get the permissions through some very cooperating officials in the Department de Hérault, where Perpignan was -- no -- in Hérault.</span> <span id="s195">Not in Perpignan, in a neighboring Department.</span> <span id="s196">To get the children into residence there.</span> <span id="s197">And once they were there we could of course disperse them into the very number of children's home that existed, that OSE had set up in the south of France after having transferred the children from the children's homes around Paris.</span> <span id="s198">Because -- all right, I have to back-track a little bit there.</span> <span id="s199">OSE had already set children's home up around Paris in the late '30s for children who had come from Germany.</span> <span id="s200">In fact, I had been offered a job in one of these homes and instead went to work in Paris.</span> <span id="s201">So we had all these children's home existing there, and it was a an administrative procedure in trying to get these children out.</span> <span id="s202">But it was not only that.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">01:19:10 It was it was persuading the parents to let the children go.</span> <span id="s204">Mind you, at that time we had not -- deportations had not started yet there.</span> <span id="s205">They were still -- we are still in the early part of 1942 now.</span> <span id="s206">Yeah, we're still in the early part of 1942, and the deportations haven't started.</span> <span id="s207">But there were rumors of shipping the people off to labor camps or resettlement camps.</span> <span id="s208">Far from us was any kind of idea of what -- where they were really sent.</span> <span id="s209">But OSE had had the foresight, through some people like Andrée Salomon and a doctor, Joseph Weill, to think of saving the children and getting them out.</span> <span id="s210">And at numerous occasion, I had opportunity to convoy children out or to take children out.</span> <span id="s211">I remember one particular group that sticks in my mind of all of it.</span> <span id="s212">We had a small group -- but sizeable enough -- of Down's Syndrome children in the camp.</span> <span id="s213">Very young, small Down's Sy -- and there was a place for them in Bergerac, in the Dordogne, and here we are on the Rivesaltes.</span> <span id="s214">I mean, had to cross all the 10 Small islands, figuratively (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s215">11 Sabbath entertainment, rejoicing, and reception (Hebrew).</span></p> <p><span id="s216">south of France.</span> <span id="s217">And I took these children by train to Bergerac.</span> <span id="s218">There must have been five, six of them.</span> <span id="s219">These children had actually learned to walk in the camp, had never known how to take steps.</span> <span id="s220">And we get to the station, and they didn't know how to go down or up stairs because they had just never experienced this.</span> <span id="s221">In addition to which, they were -- had Down's Syndrome.</span> <span id="s222">But that's the one convoy I remember, of all of them.</span> <span id="s223">I'm not sure exactly why, but I remember this one more than anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: What was that trip like?</span> <span id="s225">01:21:10</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: I only remember that, that -- the steps.</span> <span id="s227">What it was on the train, I really don't remember.</span> <span id="s228">I know I got them to safety in Bergerac.</span> <span id="s229">What happened to them afterwards, I don't know, but we got them out.</span> <span id="s230">What I do remember very vividly is the deportations starting.</span> <span id="s231">And that was in August, I think, of August of '42.</span> <span id="s232">It was again a matter of sending people in work camps -- to work camps, or to resettlement camps.</span> <span id="s233">I think we should have known that that wasn't quite it, because they were rounding up.</span> <span id="s234">I can see this elderly woman on crutches, and I can see the young people and I can see the sick -- all being called out on this enormous empty space in the camp of Rivesaltes and crossing the line over as their name was called.</span> <span id="s235">I also remember this very dignified young Rabbi, who would not hurry this woman on crutches, and walking over that empty space.</span> <span id="s236">Now, I was very young.</span> <span id="s237">And I had learned a lot about humanity while I was in this camp.</span> <span id="s238">I learned a lot.</span> <span id="s239">I remember one woman, and to this day I remember her name.</span> <span id="s240">Do you want her name?</span> <span id="s241">She was Madame Grynszpan.</span> <span id="s242">In fact, she was an aunt of the young Grynszpan who, who started things in Kristallnacht because he killed the attaché in Paris.</span> <span id="s243">And she was always -- in spite of the horrible conditions there, she managed to have a neat scarf on her head and lipstick on.</span> <span id="s244">And she says, "The day you are going to see me without my makeup, you know, that's the end for me."</span> <span id="s245">I know she escaped, because I -- one day I saw her on the train station in Rivesaltes.</span> <span id="s246">And, of course, I made no effort to acknowledge that I recognized her, because she had escaped, and so I know she escaped.</span> <span id="s247">So I -- one thing is that I had -- I learned so much from the, the, the dignity and some of the attitude of the people who were living under these horrible conditions.</span> <span id="s248">I was, I was very young, and, and it made a tremendous impression on me.</span> <span id="s249">I remember these first convoys.</span> <span id="s250">The train came to Rivesaltes, to the tracks there, and people were boarded.</span> <span id="s251">Now, I do not remember cattle trains.</span> <span id="s252">These were regular trains.</span> <span id="s253">But what I remember mostly, too, was during that period there were categories of people that could be deported and some who couldn't.</span> <span id="s254">There were still categories, because -- gosh, how naïve we were -- and thought that it was going to continue.</span> <span id="s255">If you had been fighting in World War II on the Allied or some -- or in World War I, I should say that.</span> <span id="s256">If you had been born one, one parent, there were categories who were non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s257">Or if you had resided for that long in Paris.</span> <span id="s258">So we scrambled for certificate from concierge to demonstrate that he had -- so and so had lived in Paris for that period of time.</span> <span id="s259">We scrambled for all kinds of documents, sometimes falsifying them somewhat.</span> <span id="s260">And I remember, three of us -- I don't remember who the third one was.</span> <span id="s261">But I know was Jacqueline Levy, with whom I've discussed this very recently.</span> <span id="s262">We had all of a sudden, people were all in the trains.</span> <span id="s263">And we hadn't -- we had these papers to get twenty people out of, of the train.</span> <span id="s264">And we went through the train and got these 20 or 21 or 22 people out of the camp, because we had these wonderful papers.</span> <span id="s265">What we didn't know is that there was a quota for that train.</span> <span id="s266">And while we scrambled to get twenty people out, twenty other people were rounded up without -- regardless of their status, and were just added to the train.</span> <span id="s267">When I discuss -- I remember discussing this in Paris a few years back with Jacqueline, and she said she shared exactly what I felt.</span> <span id="s268">She said when she found that out it was a nightmare to realize that the defensive people actually were replacing these people in, you know, in, in the train that we so miraculously saved.</span> <span id="s269">Nobody was saved, finally.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">01:26:10</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: How did you choose the people to save?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Be--because we had the papers.</span> <span id="s273">We, we didn't choose anybody.</span> <span id="s274">We managed to, to put together a, a record for these people, enough papers to fit the categories.</span> <span id="s275">We didn't choose anybody.</span> <span id="s276">I mean, the papers came through.</span> <span id="s277">This certificate and that certificate, and this document.</span> <span id="s278">And we had sufficient documents for these select twenty people.</span> <span id="s279">So we didn't choose them.</span> <span id="s280">We -- oh, gosh, no.</span> <span id="s281">Nobody played God.</span> <span id="s282">But that's what -- that's how we got them out of the train, only we were not realizing that actually twenty-odd people would be added to the quota.</span> <span id="s283">Can I stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: I need to take something for my headache.</span> <span id="s286">It's just getting so bad.</span> <span id="s287">I have to take another pill.</span> <span id="s288">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: That's the point I want, I would like you to make then -- that you were doing all of this under your own name.</span> <span id="s290">Ok, we're back again.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: Well, during this -- starting in -- as I said, starting in, I think, in August, through September and through the end of the year, deportations continued because round-ups of Jews.</span> <span id="s292">First it was the foreign-born Jews.</span> <span id="s293">Then it was different -- other categories of Jews.</span> <span id="s294">And then it was Jews, period, that were rounded-up.</span> <span id="s295">And Rivesaltes became the center from which they were sent off to destination unknown.</span> <span id="s296">But in the meanwhile, we continued to try to get out as many children as possible through the legal means.</span> <span id="s297">And when the legal means didn't work.</span> <span id="s298">Because we felt a sense of urgency, sometimes we stood watch at the gates when the trucks came loaded with Jews into the camp, to try to separate the children from the families right then and there so that we could get them in the special barracks for the children and work on their liberation right away.</span> <span id="s299">I mean, in retrospect, to ask the parents who were so bewildered coming into the camp and to separate from their children.</span> <span id="s300">And we had them in, in, in the special barracks, where the children worried about their parents, where they saved food for their parents, where they matured so quickly.</span> <span id="s301">They, they -- sort of there was a, a reversal, as they worrying about their parents just like a parent would worry about a child.</span> <span id="s302">And we became also very aware that in the meanwhile -- for a very hypocritical reason of family reunion -- the French police were -- was going back to the to the homes, the children's homes, to get the children back into the camps for family reunion purposes.</span> <span id="s303">So we had to try to avoid that as well.</span> <span id="s304">Both in the homes, which was impossible when they rounded up the kids, but when they came back into the camps.</span> <span id="s305">And some, of course, were deported with their parents.</span> <span id="s306">Some under 16, and definitely the over 16 as well.</span> <span id="s307">By the end -- I forget exactly the date -- when the invasion of North Africa came about by the Allies -- all of France was occupied.</span> <span id="s308">And I remember the Germans coming down south.</span> <span id="s309">In fact, coming there had been no Germans in Rivesaltes.</span> <span id="s310">This was strictly Vichy government.</span> <span id="s311">But when the south of France was occupied, the Germans came in as well, and then the round-ups started harder and harder.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">01:30:00 And I remember one particular one on Simchat Torah.And on Simchat Torah, the very religious Jews, about to be put into the trucks and from the trucks into the into the trains, were dancing to rejoice with the Torah -- which they didn't have.</span> <span id="s313">But this was still a holiday that we're celebrating.</span> <span id="s314">And truckloads of Jews were coming in from Belgium and from Holland, and from all over.</span> <span id="s315">And rounded up all over.</span> <span id="s316">And among them, some French-born Jews.</span> <span id="s317">It was just absolutely, at this point, a very -- I imagine they were French Jews; I'm not quite sure.</span> <span id="s318">But anyway, they were rounded-up, coming into the camp.</span> <span id="s319">In the meanwhile, we continued to get the children out.</span> <span id="s320">And one of the one of the girls from my group of teenagers, who was liberated from the camp and then placed very briefly with the scouts, was eventually placed into my family to help my parents at the farm.</span> <span id="s321">She is still living today in Israel, and is my sister-in-law.</span> <span id="s322">She married my brother.</span> <span id="s323">This is a girl who was born in France of Polish parents, and the parents never bothered to acquire the French nationality.</span> <span id="s324">So when the war came, they were all put into Rivesaltes: her two parents, her two brothers.</span> <span id="s325">The father was deported right away into forced labor, which means he was sent to his death.</span> <span id="s326">The older brother joined the Maquis-- the French underground -- and was killed under such horrible condition that I have never found out the details.</span> <span id="s327">The younger brother was placed by OSE, by one of our network workers; and is living still in Israel.</span> <span id="s328">And Rachel living with my family.</span> <span id="s329">And her mother survived -- also helped by OSE.</span> <span id="s330">She just died a year ago in Israel.</span> <span id="s331">So by the end of 1942, there remained but about five hundred people in Rivesaltes.</span> <span id="s332">And all the kids had been -- whatever kids we could liberate, we had sent into various camps to the various children's homes, I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s333">And, of course, also into the youth facilities of the Jewish scouts, because they had facilities for over-16s.</span> <span id="s334">And, of course, we had to lie about the ages; and, of course, we had to get them out.</span> <span id="s335">See, by then we still had not directly worked in an underground or in illegal kind of way; except that when the pressure came, we tried to help kids escape as much as quickly as we can.</span> <span id="s336">I remember always wearing a cape.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Girl scouts had capes in those days, khaki capes.</span> <span id="s338">And you could get a baby under your arms, you know.</span> <span id="s339">And you could walk out of the camp with children.</span> <span id="s340">The Secours Suisse smuggled 12 Rejoicing of the Torah (Hebrew).</span></p> <p><span id="s341">13 Anti-Nazi military partisans, associated with other groups in the French Resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">a truck into the camp, and we smuggled children out of the camp under milk cans.</span> <span id="s343">And we there are many different stories to tell as how kids came out, and the one I remember mostly is the one having children on the -- actually, literally, in my arms under my cape.</span> <span id="s344">But I don't remember what happened afterwards.</span> <span id="s345">We handed them over to another network.</span> <span id="s346">Each one of us did only one piece of the work.</span> <span id="s347">The camp was closed in November or December 1942, and whoever was left was sent to Gurs.</span> <span id="s348">By that time, I had contracted a horrible jaundice because of the living conditions there at the camp because we social workers didn't have any more better hygienic conditions than the internees, ‘though I had an individual room.</span> <span id="s349">We had one barrack where all the workers had an individual room.</span> <span id="s350">But we had no toilet facilities.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">And we had one bucket that each one of us took turns having in our own room.</span> <span id="s352">We also had bed bugs infesting everything.</span> <span id="s353">And though my parents occasionally sent me some food, it was run over with worms by the time I got it.</span> <span id="s354">But we scraped it off and we ate it anyway, because it was food.</span> <span id="s355">And if I ever want to look again in a, in a -- what are they called?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Rutabagas, Rutabagas.</span> <span id="s357">Never in my life again ever, anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">01:34:48</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: What -- before, before you go on from here, what was it like for Simone Weil?</span> <span id="s360">In this camp, you're a young woman.</span> <span id="s361">What did it feel like to you?</span> <span id="s362">Did you miss your parents?</span> <span id="s363">Were you feeling that you took any risk in doing this, even though it was legal?</span> <span id="s364">What was it like for you doing all these things?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: At this time it was not illegal yet.</span> <span id="s366">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Because I was an accepted French citizen, although Jewish, in the camp.</span> <span id="s368">You know, people have asked me, "Did it ?"</span> <span id="s369">The same kind of question.</span> <span id="s370">First of all, you're young.</span> <span id="s371">And when you're young, you feel sort of invulnerable and you really don't think beyond what you have to do.</span> <span id="s372">And I think my the other workers were my age.</span> <span id="s373">It was it was sort of a natural thing to do.</span> <span id="s374">There was a job to be done.</span> <span id="s375">It was a natural thing.</span> <span id="s376">I don't know.</span> <span id="s377">It just I don't think I really thought much of the risk.</span> <span id="s378">It was very interesting; you ask me about risk.</span> <span id="s379">The camp command the commandant of the camp was a police commissar of the neighborhood in which I had lived in Strasbourg.</span> <span id="s380">And he knew my father.</span> <span id="s381">I'll talk about him again later.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">There is a connection there.</span> <span id="s383">These people took on jobs which, if, if they had refused to take on these jobs, if more people had refused to do these kinds of things, maybe, maybe just maybe, things would not have worked out the way they did.</span> <span id="s384">For us, I don't know.</span> <span id="s385">I guess for me the risk I took -- occasional trips to the farm, occasionally.</span> <span id="s386">Taking a train to go back to the farm was no excursion.</span> <span id="s387">On the trains There were so few trains.</span> <span id="s388">I usually traveled with a knapsack.</span> <span id="s389">And you tried to get your knapsack through a window; and you climbed through a window, and you stood up all night in the hall.</span> <span id="s390">Or I remember standing up all night in the toilets.</span> <span id="s391">You know, we were -- there were so few trains, and so little means of transportation.</span> <span id="s392">So I did occasionally go back and see my family.</span> <span id="s393">I don't not often, but I, I did.</span> <span id="s394">What I did, actually, when the camp was closed, I had to go back to my family because I was sick.</span> <span id="s395">I was -- and actually, I went to Gurs.</span> <span id="s396">And but I -- by Gurs, by that time, they would not let any new workers come into Gurs.</span> <span id="s397">And I remember meeting Dr. Joseph Weill in a train, and he says, "You better take care of your -- " I was yellow from here, from the top of my head to the bottom.</span> <span id="s398">And I really had to take a rest.</span> <span id="s399">So I did go back to the farm just to recover from that.</span> <span id="s400">From that jaundice or hepatitis, or whatever you'd call it.</span> <span id="s401">And when, when I was healthy enough again, then I went to work in one of the children's homes.</span> <span id="s402">Because I couldn't get into Gurs, and here were all these children's homes.</span> <span id="s403">And I had the background in education early childhood education.</span> <span id="s404">So I took a job as the chief educator, for OSE again, near Limoges.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">And my family wasn't far.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">01:38:22 The farm wasn't far from Limoges, in Poulouzat.</span> <span id="s407">The Director was Monsieur Job, who later became one of the administrator of OSE, who's still alive in Paris, whom I still correspond with, whom I still see when I'm in Paris.</span> <span id="s408">And here we were, taking care of the children whom we had gotten out of the camp.</span> <span id="s409">This was a home that catered to maybe 50 children of all ages.</span> <span id="s410">And we tried to make the children as live as normal a life as possible -- "normal" in quotation marks.</span> <span id="s411">Again, the food situation was terrible.</span> <span id="s412">I remember sorting out rice in which mice had gotten.</span> <span id="s413">And taking out the, the rice doo.</span> <span id="s414">Is that what you call it?</span> <span id="s415">If it's dog doo, it's rice mice doo.</span> <span id="s416">We ate it, because that's all we had.</span> <span id="s417">And making do.</span> <span id="s418">And, and yet, and, and cutting out things of the papers to decorate the rooms.</span> <span id="s419">And, and I worked at creating as Jewish an atmosphere as we possibly could, leading Shabbat services.</span> <span id="s420">Because of my background, this was no problem.</span> <span id="s421">I could do these things very easily.</span> <span id="s422">And I tutored some of the kids who had missed schoolings, some who were prepare preparing their baccalaureate.</span> <span id="s423">They went to school.</span> <span id="s424">They went to public school, but still under their real names.</span> <span id="s425">And this is 1943.</span> <span id="s426">I also remember that the drama coach who came on weekends or whatever to teach to, to take care of the kids, was Marcel Marceau, of all people.</span> <span id="s427">Whose real name is not Marcel Marceau, but whose real name is Marcel Mangel (ph), and who was a kid from my neighborhood in Strasbourg.</span> <span id="s428">And so we had the best.</span> <span id="s429">He was a student at that time, doing artwork in Limoges.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">01:40:30 But these were these were my peers.</span> <span id="s431">You know, he's a little bit younger than I am.</span> <span id="s432">But by that time the OSE Direction had seen the writing on the wall.</span> <span id="s433">Some children's homes had been rounded up.</span> <span id="s434">The police was coming to pick up the over-16.</span> <span id="s435">The police -- the French police I'm talking about -- was finding these very easy targets, because here was a group of Jewish children.</span> <span id="s436">So at that time, the OSE Direction had decided that the children had to get out of the homes in two steps.</span> <span id="s437">There was one step: they was under their real names, into non- Jewish kind of settings, but mostly, to form a clandestine network and place the children under assumed names.</span> <span id="s438">And workers were recruited for that, and I was one of them.</span> <span id="s439">what 14 In France, this is the equivalent of a high school diploma.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">were the qualifications?</span> <span id="s441">None, really.</span> <span id="s442">Wanting to do it, but also not being not looking "Jewish."</span> <span id="s443">Quote, unquote.</span> <span id="s444">I mean, there are some people who just simply couldn't do it because they were "typés,"as we called it.</span> <span id="s445">And so I qualified.</span> <span id="s446">And Georges Garel, who is organized this clandestine network for OSE, recruited me in Poulouzat in children's home where I worked because all the children's homes were going to be closed.</span> <span id="s447">In the meanwhile, there had been arrêtes -- arrests -- in the Direction of OSE and the various offices.</span> <span id="s448">There had been really -- it was danger with knowing where the children were, and so on.</span> <span id="s449">So I got recruited for this.</span> <span id="s450">And this was towards the end of '43.</span> <span id="s451">I therefore left the children's home, and took up residence in Châteauroux.</span> <span id="s452">Châteauroux is about what -- 60, 75 miles north of Limoges.</span> <span id="s453">Well, I had to change identity.</span> <span id="s454">And my name was Simone Weil, and I decided on "Werlin (ph)," because it was sort of easy to change the "I" to an "R" and to add something at the end of it.</span> <span id="s455">And I had to work on getting, number one, a nationality -- a Fiche de Nationalité.I'm not quite sure how I got it, but I have it.</span> <span id="s456">And from that on -- oh, and I made myself being born in Toul, because we -- I knew that in Toul, the, the city hall had been bombed and all the documents had disappeared.</span> <span id="s457">And by then, there was really a whole network of people working in forging false papers.</span> <span id="s458">So we had access to identification cards, blank ones and so forth.</span> <span id="s459">But I did it, really, the legal way.</span> <span id="s460">After I had a Fiche de Nationalité by which I think I got by just making a statement -- then I had that, claiming that papers had disappeared.</span> <span id="s461">I couldn't produce a birth certificate.</span> <span id="s462">I got an identification card and gave a Limoges address, and immediately then moved to Châteauroux.</span> <span id="s463">And had myself registered in Châteauroux.</span> <span id="s464">So it was perfectly legal.</span> <span id="s465">I mean, it was perfectly ok.</span> <span id="s466">The most wonderful thing -- my nose.</span> <span id="s467">The most wonderful thing that helped me in the forging my identity was the help I got from the Director of the school of social work and the director of the school of early childhood education.</span> <span id="s468">One lived in Clermont-Ferrand.</span> <span id="s469">One lived in Paris.</span> <span id="s470">I took the trip, and I just simply told them that I needed their help.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">01:44:56 And I have in my documents still a certificate stating that I that Simone Werlin was their student in 1938.</span> <span id="s472">I got a certifi-- I got a diploma established in on that name, under my false name.</span> <span id="s473">And I got some others you know, other statements to that effect.</span> <span id="s474">And to this day, I am convinced that at the time I was arrested, to which I'm going to come later, that these papers helped me.</span> <span id="s475">And these people, without, without any question, just established these papers for me.</span> <span id="s476">In fact, I went to Paris.</span> <span id="s477">I remember very well, because this is the first time I saw people wearing the yellow star because we did not wear it in the south of France.</span> <span id="s478">I also needed a cover.</span> <span id="s479">And the Department of Public Health put me on their fictitious payroll, I suppose.</span> <span id="s480">But I had a statement saying that Simone Werlin is employed by the Department of Public Health.</span> <span id="s481">And just to make sure that I knew what I was, what the Department of Public Health was, I went at least there once.</span> <span id="s482">And now comes a funny story.</span> <span id="s483">You know what department was assigned to?</span> <span id="s484">The department that checked the health of the prostitutes of the city of Châteauroux.</span> <span id="s485">And they were coming regularly to that clinic to be examined, and that was my 15 Typed or stereotyped (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s486">16 Nationality card (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s487">assignment.</span> <span id="s488">But at least I knew what my assignment was so that later on I had to describe it, I could describe it.</span> <span id="s489">But it has a little funny aspect to it.</span> <span id="s490">I got a room, stayed with two elderly ladies.</span> <span id="s491">And we had a team working together in Châteauroux.</span> <span id="s492">I remember at least two of them.</span> <span id="s493">One was a cousin of mine.</span> <span id="s494">And we all had assumed names.</span> <span id="s495">And children would come to us, brought from various children's home by a worker.</span> <span id="s496">Brought to us, for us to change the identity of the kids, and then place them in various foster homes, institutions, families, convents, what have you.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">01:47:25 This was our job.</span> <span id="s498">And transportation was mostly bicycles, train, horse and buggy, whatever.</span> <span id="s499">Or walking.</span> <span id="s500">Whatever we could round up.</span> <span id="s501">And it ended up by, by having around Châteauroux, in that whole area, we had some three hundred and fifty kids placed.</span> <span id="s502">The Direction of the region was in Limoges, but Châteauroux, in that region, we had between three and 350 kids.</span> <span id="s503">It was a matter of finding the places and trying to finding following up with the kids.</span> <span id="s504">What I remember most dramatically – and, and also sometimes through Châteauroux came groups of children that had to be escorted towards other workers, who would help them get into Switzerland.</span> <span id="s505">And I remember one group of children that came one night, and we had to find a place for them overnight.</span> <span id="s506">And I in some school or some institution.</span> <span id="s507">And we worked feverishly all night to get them false papers.</span> <span id="s508">For the kids.</span> <span id="s509">And take out the labels out of their clothes that the mothers had lovingly sewed into their clothes and take those labels out.</span> <span id="s510">And look through their luggage.</span> <span id="s511">Take away whatever they had because they had to have be safe.</span> <span id="s512">And just coach them in what their new identity was.</span> <span id="s513">I have often said that if I had known then what I have since learned, being a clinical social worker, I think I would have been completely immobilized by the, the traumatization that these children went through.</span> <span id="s514">I could have just not functioned.</span> <span id="s515">And it was just a matter of saving lives, and that was it.</span> <span id="s516">And I remember taking these -- I don't know how many children -- and spreading them through a train, and coaching them.</span> <span id="s517">Some who spoke French was all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Some who spoke with an accent, they were supposed to be from Alsace.</span> <span id="s519">And telling them what their name was, and knowing how to answer.</span> <span id="s520">And getting spreading them through the train, and getting them across France into Lyons.</span> <span id="s521">And there, getting them to another team of workers.</span> <span id="s522">That was the end of my mission.</span> <span id="s523">And they would then be handed over to somebody else, and gotten into Switzerland.</span> <span id="s524">And kids came day and night, and we changed their identity.</span> <span id="s525">I remember most I remember two incidents that I want to relate.</span> <span id="s526">One of the source of help was the Catholic Church.</span> <span id="s527">And the area the area close to the Château was Bourges, which has an arch archbishop-- archbishopric.</span> <span id="s528">Is that the word?</span> <span id="s529">And I went to see the Archbishop of Bourges, to ask him for making -- it easy mak-- making the entry into convents and to all Catholic orphanages easy for us.</span> <span id="s530">But he knew what was the object of my mission, but it was never discussed.</span> <span id="s531">I had never encountered an archbishop in my life.</span> <span id="s532">And I went to the Archbishop in Bourges, and he gave me a letter of introduction to the various Catholic institutions.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">01:50:56 He also handed my hand with his ring, and I hadn't the slightest idea what I was supposed to do with it.</span> <span id="s534">But that was a minor detail.</span> <span id="s535">I also worked with Protestant agency that ran summer camps for kids who had to flee Paris.</span> <span id="s536">And she also -- this was a partisan social worker in Bourges, who was very unhappy being in this very Catholic kind of area.</span> <span id="s537">And she had no idea what the real object of my work was.</span> <span id="s538">All I wanted is place children in her summer camps.</span> <span id="s539">And I hit it off with her.</span> <span id="s540">And because she was so unhappy as a Protestant in this Catholic environment, taking me for a Catholic we had some discussion which made her say that she had never met such a liberal Catholic as I. I haven't the slightest idea what I said.</span> <span id="s541">But when the dis-- when the questions became too difficult, I managed to escape by pretending that I wasn't feeling well and going to the bath.</span> <span id="s542">But anyway, we had the openings to these camps, summer camps, for our children, and that's where we placed them.</span> <span id="s543">I worked at that time with another worker, who was actually not Jewish, Ann-Marie, and with two other workers who were not Jewish, among in our team, as well.</span> <span id="s544">At one time and at one time and, of course, the as the war was drawing closer and closer to an end, the round-ups just continued.</span> <span id="s545">Both my parents were arrested at the farm.</span> <span id="s546">And ‘though I had -- by that time, the uncles and aunts had left; and there was just my both my parents, my grandmother, my brother and, and the girl we had placed, you know, who placed from, from Rivesaltes.</span> <span id="s547">The uncles and aunts had gone elsewhere, found their own place.</span> <span id="s548">And I had provided my parents with false papers.</span> <span id="s549">But, when in the spring of 1944, the gendarmes came up and said to my father, "Êtes-vous Juif, Monsieur?</span> <span id="s550">"He said, "Oui, Monsieur.</span> <span id="s551">"And they took both my mother and my father, leaving -- and my brother pretended that he was the farm hand, and my sist-- my future sister-in-law, too.</span> <span id="s552">She was the maid, she pretended.</span> <span id="s553">And both my parents were interned in a camp near the farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">01:53:26 But the French police actually went over and beyond the expectations of the German authority, and had taken my mother to a camp that was only for men.</span> <span id="s555">So after 24 hours, they sent her back to the farm.</span> <span id="s556">And she survived.</span> <span id="s557">And I had heard had word of my father being in that camp.</span> <span id="s558">So I -- oh, I always traveled in something that looked like a Red Cross uniform.</span> <span id="s559">Something navy-bluish, and some Red Cross sign.</span> <span id="s560">I mean, it was really nothing real, but it looked like a uniform, so I had access to the camp there.</span> <span id="s561">And through some cigarettes or tobacco or something, I got a message to my father.</span> <span id="s562">Who, by the way, survived.</span> <span id="s563">Because on D-Day 1944, the camp was attacked by the Maquis and the internees were able to escape -- among which my father who returned to the farm.</span> <span id="s564">But in the meanwhile, there was great concern for my grandmother.</span> <span id="s565">And I managed to come back, round-up a truck from the Maquis -- from the underground -- and load my grandmother into the truck and get her to Périgueux, the city near the, the city prefecture where we lived, and get her into an old age home.</span> <span id="s566">And a very nice gentile woman would visit her regularly there.</span> <span id="s567">But aside from the other work that I did, it was one of the most dramatic things that I did because she was nearly blind.</span> <span id="s568">And she said, "Don't leave me here!"</span> <span id="s569">And the bed was on the wrong side and she 17 “Are you French, Sir?”</span> <span id="s570">(French).</span></p> <p><span id="s571">18 “Yes, Sir.”</span> <span id="s572">(French).</span></p> <p><span id="s573">couldn't find her things, but I had no choice.</span> <span id="s574">I left her, but she survived.</span> <span id="s575">Not very long.</span> <span id="s576">She never came back to Alsace, but she did survive the, the this period of the old age home.</span> <span id="s577">Also when I was in Châteauroux, you know, Georges Garel, the head of our network, would appear from time to time.</span> <span id="s578">And he appeared one morning, having come from God knows where.</span> <span id="s579">And coming to that room which I rented and say, "You know, we have to move very fast.</span> <span id="s580">The members of the Jewish Committee in Périgueux have all been shot as in reprisal for God knows what had happened to some German.</span> <span id="s581">The Director one of the Directors, Monsieur Lederman, has been shot.</span> <span id="s582">He has -- his wife has had died the year before of cancer.</span> <span id="s583">And he has two daughters in a private boarding school, and we have to get them out of there."</span> <span id="s584">What he didn't know…that Monsieur Lederman was my uncle.</span> <span id="s585">And these were my cousins.</span> <span id="s586">And they were two young teenagers, and I called them.</span> <span id="s587">I had the number.</span> <span id="s588">How we got calls through is a puzzle to me today; but the phone must have functioned.</span> <span id="s589">And I called them in the school in which they were.</span> <span id="s590">And I told them, "You pack up, and you go.</span> <span id="s591">And you come to Châteauroux, and I'll be at the station."</span> <span id="s592">And I was there.</span> <span id="s593">And they came.</span> <span id="s594">And there was a curfew.</span> <span id="s595">I don't know how I made it through the curfew.</span> <span id="s596">And we got them into a safe home we had at Châteauroux.; there was gentile lady who loaned us the apartment where we could do our papers.</span> <span id="s597">So I remember changing their name to Ledormier.</span> <span id="s598">And while we were there, I do remember the Milicecoming.</span> <span id="s599">But the Milice didn't come to -- they didn't know.</span> <span id="s600">They were just looking at apartments.</span> <span id="s601">But they came, and I jumped out the back window with my two cousins.</span> <span id="s602">And also Ann-Marie tells me it was the paper of her husband who had been deported to Auschwitz and who -- whose papers she had.</span> <span id="s603">And I don't remember that, but as we put our selected memories together, we reconstructed.</span> <span id="s604">And I reconstructed the events.</span> <span id="s605">As a matter of fact, while I was in France I found that hou-- that house again.</span> <span id="s606">And I knew it was it because I saw the windows from which we jumped.</span> <span id="s607">But anyway, the girls were placed into a Catholic convent, and they survived.</span> <span id="s608">Last year --</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: Ok, excuse me.</span> <span id="s610">At this point, we have to stop and change tapes.</span> <span id="s611">A: Ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s613">19 Militia (French)</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s615">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION 02:00:15</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: We're on.</span> <span id="s617">Ok, take us back.</span> <span id="s618">Let us continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: So we continue with the story of my cousins, where I left it off.</span> <span id="s620">Just a year ago, one of my cousins came to see me in Chapel Hill.</span> <span id="s621">And she got off the plane.</span> <span id="s622">And I waited for her.</span> <span id="s623">She says, "This is the second time that you're waiting for me someplace."</span> <span id="s624">And she remembered the time I was waiting for her at the station.</span> <span id="s625">But then she said, "When you called us in the school where we were to tell us to pack and come, we didn't know whether it was really you."</span> <span id="s626">Distortion of the telephone.</span> <span id="s627">"And we had really didn't know whether it was a trap for us.</span> <span id="s628">And whether it was a safe thing to do, to come to Châteauroux, until we saw you at the station."</span> <span id="s629">And that devastated me.</span> <span id="s630">And actually, they did not know their father had been shot.</span> <span id="s631">And they're telling me that I had to tell them that their father had been killed.</span> <span id="s632">They thought he had been deported.</span> <span id="s633">I do not remember this, nor do I remember so many of the details.</span> <span id="s634">I have recently encountered a woman who lives in Richmond, who was a child in Rivesaltes who I got out of Rivesaltes and who I placed in a convent later on and went back to work with me in a children's home that I had later.</span> <span id="s635">She survived this way.</span> <span id="s636">Her family was deported.</span> <span id="s637">And she went to the United States soon after that.</span> <span id="s638">And she gives me all these details.</span> <span id="s639">And I believe her because it fits into what I remember, but I don't remember her, and I don't remember the details of it.</span> <span id="s640">I do not remember individuals as such.</span> <span id="s641">I remember my cousins.</span> <span id="s642">That's somewhat in some way different -- it's very close to me.</span> <span id="s643">I see myself going into farms.</span> <span id="s644">I see myself talking to children, talking to families.</span> <span id="s645">I remember the incident of the, the Archbishop in Bourges.</span> <span id="s646">I remember being arrested -- and I'm going to come into that in a minute.</span> <span id="s647">But the individual kids, I do not remember.</span> <span id="s648">Exc-- I remember the groups, and not one in particular.</span> <span id="s649">I do remember the one day that I went to Limoges on my bicycle.</span> <span id="s650">75 miles.</span> <span id="s651">In my memory, it was a straight route to Limoges.</span> <span id="s652">Six or seven years ago, we went back there.</span> <span id="s653">I told my husband, "Don't worry, it's…</span></p> <p><span id="s654">02:03:22</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s656">We're going to have to stop the tape.</span> <span id="s657">[TECHNICAL CONVERSATION] You started to tell me about the trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: On regular intervals, I guess, I had to go to Limoges, which was really the headquarters of this area.</span> <span id="s659">And I remember some of the workers there having to do with papers, or having to do with whatever instructions we had about our network, our children.</span> <span id="s660">And I remember walking with this other worker in Limoges, in the city.</span> <span id="s661">And treating ourselves to some of these coupon-free pastries.</span> <span id="s662">We had to -- we could go into a pastry shop, and they had made some pastry out of some God knows what ersatz stuff.</span> <span id="s663">And coming out of it, and a young man coming to us, and saying, "Follow me."</span> <span id="s664">And opening the big book he had under his arm, which was not a book but something that hid a box with a revolver in it.</span> <span id="s665">The -- it was clear that they were not after me as well as after Charlotte.</span> <span id="s666">Charlotte was living in -- she looked very Jewish, by the way.</span> <span id="s667">She was very "typée."</span> <span id="s668">And they suspected her to be part of the Resistance.</span> <span id="s669">And he marched us with this gun under his arm to her apartment.</span> <span id="s670">And there, ransacked her apartment, looking for I'm not sure what.</span> <span id="s671">But I had sewn in the lining of my pocket some seals, to make false papers.</span> <span id="s672">You know, of city halls and town halls, and dates and stuff.</span> <span id="s673">I also had, on cigarette paper, the coded list of my children, because -- I didn't mention this earlier.</span> <span id="s674">OSE had a list of the children with their real names and their false names, with copies in Geneva.</span> <span id="s675">Not one identity was ever lost.</span> <span id="s676">Some children were lost, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s677">But no identity ever got lost.</span> <span id="s678">And we had codes in which way we were keeping lists.</span> <span id="s679">I mean, these identities available.</span> <span id="s680">And I had that with me.</span> <span id="s681">And here I was, watching calmly as they were ransacking Charlotte's apartment, and trying finding a way of getting at least rid of this incrim-- incriminating documents I had on me.</span> <span id="s682">So I asked to go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s683">And what I know how to do was to act as a very innocent little girl.</span> <span id="s684">I think I can still do it.</span> <span id="s685">And they let me go.</span> <span id="s686">And that simple little slip, on their part, saved me.</span> <span id="s687">I went to the bathroom, got everything out of the lining of my pocket, got the papers out, flushed whatever I could down the toilets, threw everything that I could out of the windows, and came back into the room clear of all this incriminating stuff.</span> <span id="s688">I knew that, you know, we'd get some other seals and we'd get the lists.</span> <span id="s689">They were saved somewhere else.</span> <span id="s690">Legend has it already that I swallowed the cigarette papers.</span> <span id="s691">But I'm sure I didn't.</span> <span id="s692">I'm sure I threw them out.</span> <span id="s693">I get back and they went through my papers.</span> <span id="s694">And this is where I want to come back to the wonderful paper I had.</span> <span id="s695">I always carried with me all these document that these very helpful people had made out for me -- my diplomas, my cert-- I had everything with me.</span> <span id="s696">Library cards which had false from pre-war library cards, under my false name.</span> <span id="s697">I had university student cards, and etc.</span> <span id="s698">I had all this with me.</span> <span id="s699">They slipped on one thing, which have which would have been my undoing.</span> <span id="s700">I had given an address in Limoges as my original.</span> <span id="s701">I had my identification card.</span> <span id="s702">I didn't even know where the street was.</span> <span id="s703">I didn't even know whether it existed.</span> <span id="s704">If they had asked me to take them there, I couldn't have done it.</span> <span id="s705">But they didn't.</span> <span id="s706">So I left this place.</span> <span id="s707">they imprisoned Charlotte, but we managed to liberate her to help her escape.</span> <span id="s708">And she's still living.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">02:08:00</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: How did you help her?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: I don't -- we didn't.</span> <span id="s712">I wasn't part of that.</span> <span id="s713">The resident workers in Limoges managed.</span> <span id="s714">I don't know how they did it.</span> <span id="s715">I haven't the slightest idea.</span> <span id="s716">I was very anxious to retrieve my knapsack, which had a lot of incriminating papers in it.</span> <span id="s717">And so I got in touch with another worker, who first went to where my knapsack was parked -- I don't remember where -- and got out all the stuff that was in there that would have been incriminating.</span> <span id="s718">And then I got my knapsack back, and then I went back on bicycle 75 miles to Châteauroux.</span> <span id="s719">Now, just a few years ago in Paris, I met a woman who, when we're introduced to each other, says, "Oh, I know who you are.</span> <span id="s720">You spent the night.</span> <span id="s721">You were arrested in my room."</span> <span id="s722">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s723">I have absolutely no memory of it.</span> <span id="s724">She remembered the incident.</span> <span id="s725">She remembers Charlotte, and how she and Paulette and another young woman rescued Charlotte.</span> <span id="s726">I don't know how.</span> <span id="s727">I don't know how.</span> <span id="s728">But for me, I was anxious to get out of Limoges with my cleansed knapsack.</span> <span id="s729">I remember this as a straight route to Limoges.</span> <span id="s730">And I took it a few years back, and it was the rollercoast-- the worst rollercoaster road.</span> <span id="s731">And my husband said to me, "This is a straight road?"</span> <span id="s732">In my memory, this was a straight road.</span> <span id="s733">So I came back to Châteauroux.</span> <span id="s734">And no sooner did I get to my room that my landlady says, "Your friends from Limoges came to see you, and you were not home."</span> <span id="s735">Needless to say that I spent no time in Châteauroux, and took my bicycle and went on to Bourges, where I had somebody else.</span> <span id="s736">But you see, it wasn't always bicycle.</span> <span id="s737">Whenever we could, we took a train and put the bicycle in the luggage compartment.</span> <span id="s738">And we went as far as we could on the train, on where the Maquis had blown up the tracks, we had to get out.</span> <span id="s739">We were always rejoicing when the tracks were blown up.</span> <span id="s740">So we took the bike, and we went a little bit further.</span> <span id="s741">So that way, we, we traveled.</span> <span id="s742">So I went to Bourges.</span> <span id="s743">And I even remember getting a horse and buggy part of the way, putting the bicycle in the back, and getting there until things calmed down until my friends from Limoges were, were sure that I was somewhat safe.</span> <span id="s744">There's another crazy incident that I do remember, is that I had mentioned earlier that the head of the camp of Rivesaltes was the Commissar de Police from Strasbourg.</span> <span id="s745">He ended up being the Commissar de Police of Châteauroux, where I was doing underground work.</span> <span id="s746">And I did something which today seems absolutely crazy to me.</span> <span id="s747">I went to him.</span> <span id="s748">And I told him, "I know you know who I am."</span> <span id="s749">But I told him that I was working under a false name, and what I was doing.</span> <span id="s750">And I was expecting him to leave me alone.</span> <span id="s751">In retrospect, it sounds absolutely totally crazy.</span> <span id="s752">But he never bothered me.</span> <span id="s753">It so happened that after the war as soon as the war was over, and when you know, when they sought out the collaborators, he came to me begging for some kind of, you know, "See what I did for you?!"</span> <span id="s754">But at that time I went to my superiors at OSE, who says, "He doesn't deserve any, any kind of consideration because if he hadn't been the, the commandant of the camp of Rivesaltes and he hadn't accepted that job, it would have been, you know, more to his credit."</span></p> <p><span id="s755">01:12:00 So, but this is the -- so but this is the -- so you asked me earlier, “How did it feel?”</span> <span id="s756">I got a sense of invulnerability.</span> <span id="s757">Of -- I had to do a job; and you do it with some kind of daring.</span> <span id="s758">And you, you feel I could wear these uniforms of Red Cross, or doing and, and just pretend and do anything.</span> <span id="s759">And I didn't feel it was anything terribly unusual, because I saw all my peers doing it.</span> <span id="s760">All my peers from the youth movement did the same kind of work, whether it was in the in the escape, the routes to Spain or to, to Switzerland -- or whether it was in the in the Maquis.</span> <span id="s761">Whatever.</span> <span id="s762">We did it because that was the thing to do.</span> <span id="s763">That brings us pretty much to almost the end of the war -- no.</span> <span id="s764">I remember D-Day -- June 6th, 1944.</span> <span id="s765">I thought it was all over.</span> <span id="s766">It wasn't over by far.</span> <span id="s767">And I put my the gold little flag on my bicycle, but very quickly put it back in.</span> <span id="s768">You see, I had lived as really with these two ladies, who took me for a very good Catholic girl.</span> <span id="s769">In fact, I had a rosary, and I had went to church every Sunday morning in the back of the church.</span> <span id="s770">But anyway, it was too early to really tell them.</span> <span id="s771">I was I was just exploding with telling the truth, but we couldn't because as the in, you know, as the Allies had landed, that didn't mean at all that France was liberated.</span> <span id="s772">And then the fierce battling went on -- the bombings.</span> <span id="s773">I was part of the Red Cross emergency teams, where we went when there were bombings, picking people out from under the rubble.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">02:14:05 This was just a civil service of a some job that I didn't do as part of my underground work or anything.</span> <span id="s775">It was just a community work.</span> <span id="s776">And that went on.</span> <span id="s777">And as reprisals, very nearby was this horrible incident of Oradour-sur-Glane, where the Germans locked up the whole population in a church and put fire to the church.</span> <span id="s778">This was non-Jews as well as Jews.</span> <span id="s779">I mean, it had nothing to do -- they had just to do with the psychology of an army that was losing the war and went and arresting more Jews and more kids that came our way.</span> <span id="s780">But don't ask me the details of how it happened.</span> <span id="s781">I know it happened.</span> <span id="s782">I know we did it.</span> <span id="s783">I know I did it, but I don't remember the details.</span> <span id="s784">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s785">More kids coming, and I know we placed more kids.</span> <span id="s786">It was just a frenzy of, of, of needs at that time, until finally the war was over.</span> <span id="s787">I, I know this was a, a very hectic period.</span> <span id="s788">I remember -- one more thing is this team of, of Jewish girls celebrating Passover that spring, in the basement.</span> <span id="s789">And one of us watching, standing guard at the door, just like Marrano-type kind of celebration.</span> <span id="s790">These, some of these little details come up once in a while.</span> <span id="s791">But I have mulled over and over and with great guilt, really, as to why I don't remember individual children and individual stories.</span> <span id="s792">With very few exceptions, I don't.</span> <span id="s793">My sister-in-law, those of my cousins.</span> <span id="s794">And the only explanation I can come up with is that the fear of getting attached or the inability to get attached to individuals, for fear of loss, for fear of getting too close.</span> <span id="s795">And so that I do not remember individual stories, with the few exceptions that I gave you.</span> <span id="s796">Also is I left the United -- I left France in 1946, after filling a couple of years very briefly.</span> <span id="s797">And I had one urge and that is to put everything I cut even loose from the people I worked with during the war.</span> <span id="s798">I never spoke French to my children, never talked about any of that story.</span> <span id="s799">It was all something to put behind me.</span> <span id="s800">And it's not until about 10, 12 years ago or so that I became part of, of those of us who feel a responsibility of, of telling our individual stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">02:16:56 When the war was over in our in my area, Limoges and Châteauroux, in the fall of 19-- oh, just before the High Holy Days in 1944, when I remember getting my cousins out of that convent, and I remember getting anyway, I just went there and got them and put them on God knows what trucks.</span> <span id="s802">And from one stage to the other, and got them back to the farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Because that my, my parents and uncles and aunts were the only living relatives they had, having lost both parents, and leaving them with my family but with very little time to, to spend there.</span> <span id="s804">Because OSE immediately asked me to reopen one of their homes, and I reopened the first home in Montintin, in the center of France.</span> <span id="s805">It was a big old chateau which had been a children's home before, but it was closed during all this clandestine period.</span> <span id="s806">And it was populated by rats and by filth.</span> <span id="s807">And we cleaned the rats.</span> <span id="s808">To today, I stand on a chair if I see a mouse.</span> <span id="s809">In those days, we put traps in, and we caught one rat after another, and we cleansed it.</span> <span id="s810">And it was the most exhilarating kind of experience.</span> <span id="s811">And we got as quickly as we could the children out of the religious institutions, of the Catholic institutions.</span> <span id="s812">And we had no idea yet as to what had happened to their parents, of course, because it wouldn't be until the spring of the following year when the Allies would reach the death camps that we really had the reality of what had happened.</span> <span id="s813">So we did the best we could to create as quickly as we could a real happy Jewish atmosphere for those children.</span> <span id="s814">With nothing.</span> <span id="s815">With whatever we could.</span> <span id="s816">We had staff survive -- survivors.</span> <span id="s817">I remember particularly one couple from Holland who had survived.</span> <span id="s818">And I had really a desire to do something in my field, and that is, create a home for pre-school children.</span> <span id="s819">Because pre-school is, was and has always been -- and continues to be -- my area of interest.</span> <span id="s820">And OSE then replaced, replaced me at Montintin.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">And I went to Paris; and with another girl, actually, who had worked in Rivesaltes -- but not for OSE, but for the Unitarians.</span> <span id="s822">Jacqueline and I -- who had the same training under the auspices of OSE -- we set up a wonderful model home for pre-school age children.</span> <span id="s823">Later on, when I read Anna Freud on war and children and infants without family, I realized we really copied -- we copies…no, we didn't copy it.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">02:20:00 We initiated the same model.</span> <span id="s825">And these children had survived in hiding -- but not only children who had survived in hiding.</span> <span id="s826">Children who were entrusted to us by parents who couldn't handle them.</span> <span id="s827">They had survived themselves, but they were alone.</span> <span id="s828">And for a period of time, we had these children.</span> <span id="s829">But it was also a training school for early childhood educators.</span> <span id="s830">Actually, my diploma was in Montessori education.</span> <span id="s831">So we set up a Montessori program in, in the -- in a chateau near Paris, which, by coincidence, happens to be the one where I had taught in a private school before the war.</span> <span id="s832">It was a beautiful place, surrounded by ground.</span> <span id="s833">And there I stayed until -- this was '45 -- and all the do-gooders from the United States came over.</span> <span id="s834">Oh, the most wonderful thing I got is a pair of army shoes.</span> <span id="s835">A WAAC gave me some shoes.</span> <span id="s836">That was wonderful!</span> <span id="s837">And they brought us candy, and they brought us all kinds of stuff.</span> <span id="s838">But the important thing is that I was asked whether I would want to come to the States to continue my training, to go back to France and continue on with my work.</span> <span id="s839">To tell you the truth, I would have gone blind-folded to the moon.</span> <span id="s840">I would have gone anywhere.</span> <span id="s841">This was it.</span> <span id="s842">Was I was ready for a change.</span> <span id="s843">And why me?</span> <span id="s844">Why not Jacqueline?</span> <span id="s845">Jacqueline didn't know English.</span> <span id="s846">She was just as qualified, but I knew English.</span> <span id="s847">This was a scholarship offered by the National Council of Jewish Women, who had set up a program of scholarships to give additional training for people who had worked under these circumstances; in, in Europe, not just in France.</span> <span id="s848">And would return to their countries to continue to improve the situation.</span> <span id="s849">So I had a very hard time.</span> <span id="s850">It's Georges Garel, who actually was wrote paper upon letters upon letters to get me a place on a boat, and I came on a warship in 1946.</span> <span id="s851">And the Council of Jewish Women sent me to Tulane University.</span> <span id="s852">And for one year, but extended my scholarship for a second year, which I completed in Cleveland, and got my Master's Degree in social work.</span> <span id="s853">But in the meanwhile, I had met my future husband.</span> <span id="s854">But I did return to 20 Women’s Army Corps (WAC after 1978).</span></p> <p><span id="s855">France before we got married, and worked for the Joint Distribution Committee.</span> <span id="s856">And there I am worked in -- really, at that time, the local agencies who had all these children's homes and all these children had to reassess the needs of these children.</span> <span id="s857">And I did survey upon survey of facilities -- not just OSE of various children's homes -- to assess their need and to see what else could be done with the children.</span> <span id="s858">And I also set up L'Association des Travailleurs JuivesI started with training workers in the various homes, with my newly acquired wisdom in social work.</span> <span id="s859">And I started this program going, going through the JDC.</span> <span id="s860">And my commitment was for at least two years, but I was itching to get back and to the States.</span> <span id="s861">And after a year, I came back to the States.</span> <span id="s862">And that's the end of the story, I guess.</span> <span id="s863">I continued in social work for the rest of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: What -- tell us a little bit, if you would, about your adjustment to the United States.</span> <span id="s865">What had that year been like when you were here, and what was it like when you returned?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">02:23:57</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: Well, when I originally came -- there's two stages there.</span> <span id="s868">It's interesting.</span> <span id="s869">When I went to Tulane University I found this to be a dilemma, which was far below what I was used to in my own work and in my own experience.</span> <span id="s870">And I didn't feel -- besides, I really had no intention of getting a degree.</span> <span id="s871">It was just a year to be exposed to things here.</span> <span id="s872">So I didn't work very hard.</span> <span id="s873">I was asked to talk about my war experience, and I found it very strange.</span> <span id="s874">Why talk about my war experience?</span> <span id="s875">Everybody else had done it.</span> <span id="s876">And why did I have to talk about it?</span> <span id="s877">And yet I did because I was their first student.</span> <span id="s878">And I went to their triennial conventions, and I talked about it.</span> <span id="s879">I don't know what I said and how I told the story then.</span> <span id="s880">There was a lot of publicity.</span> <span id="s881">And it bothered me for two reasons.</span> <span id="s882">One, because as I said, it seemed so natural to have done that.</span> <span id="s883">I didn't see what was the big fuss, the heroism about it.</span> <span id="s884">Everybody did it, in my mind.</span> <span id="s885">And the other thing is, is the thought of all the children we didn't save.</span> <span id="s886">And how can you sort of make it this beautiful story?</span> <span id="s887">There was just one other thing is that there were there was a program of Ship-a-Box the Council of Jewish Women had.</span> <span id="s888">And I accepted to talk, provided they sent packages overseas.</span> <span id="s889">And that was one of the, you know, redeeming features of my talking.</span> <span id="s890">When I transferred to Case Western -- no.</span> <span id="s891">It wasn't Case Western, it was Western Reserve University.</span> <span id="s892">I got a somewhat different experience.</span> <span id="s893">And yet, I remember my supervisor, or my faculty advisor, never asking me what my experience had been or what, what my expertise.</span> <span id="s894">I mean, after all, I had left I was By then, I was 26 years old.</span> <span id="s895">I was not a kid fresh out of high school.</span> <span id="s896">I mean, this was graduate school because I got credit for all my work I had done.</span> <span id="s897">And I didn't find the academic work any difficult at all.</span> <span id="s898">I didn't find -- what surprised me very much is the true and false kind of multiple choice kinds of things, because I'm not used -- I wasn't used to that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s899">And there was a naïveté about people.</span> <span id="s900">I had a sense that they didn't know what life was what real life was about.</span> <span id="s901">It was all textbook kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s902">Until I finally got one supervisor who asked me about -- not about my work during the war, but about my concepts about working with people and children.</span> <span id="s903">And I said, "Finally, somebody feels that we know something there, too."</span> <span id="s904">You 21 The Association of Jewish Workers (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s905">know, it's not just in the United States that they have invented social work, or that we -- to me, it was much too theoretical and so unhum-- it was right and wrong, and there was no nuances.</span> <span id="s906">There were I fought tremendously with my faculty advisor about one particular area.</span> <span id="s907">Social workers were being trained to work in children's homes in the United States, and I did my field work at Bellfaire in Cleveland, which was one of the top-notch child-care agencies.</span> <span id="s908">They were training the social workers who saw the child one hour a week.</span> <span id="s909">To me, it made much more sense to do it the way we did it in France, and that is, train the house parents who worked with the children on 24 hours a day basis.</span> <span id="s910">And I couldn't understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">We would train people in France who lived with the children, who were with them all the time.</span> <span id="s912">But we're training a therpa-- a social worker therapist, who saw the child one hour a week.</span> <span id="s913">And that didn't make sense to me.</span> <span id="s914">Does that answer your question?</span> <span id="s915">And but more, I think one of the reasons I was just thinking of something.</span> <span id="s916">One of the reasons I clamed up, too, is that there was such a lack of comprehension as to what really happened.</span> <span id="s917">The questions sometimes were so -- excuse me, but -- stupid.</span> <span id="s918">And it's hard to talk about it.</span> <span id="s919">It still happens today.</span> <span id="s920">I'll give you an example.</span> <span id="s921">Very recently, in Chapel Hill, I was asked to talk to a junior high school.</span> <span id="s922">A very sweet young teacher had her class read The Diary of Anne Frank.</span> <span id="s923">And could I -- she got my names through the Jewish Federation, because I'm very active in the community there.</span> <span id="s924">And could I come and talk about my own experience?</span> <span id="s925">And I did, at what I hoped it would be junior high school level -- which is not particularly my forté, but I tried to tailor it to, to them.</span> <span id="s926">And especially ask questions.</span> <span id="s927">And the kids were wonderful.</span> <span id="s928">They really had some very pertinent questions.</span> <span id="s929">The teacher, when I recalled the incident of being arrested and, and Charlotte being put into prison, said, "But on what basis did they arrest her?"</span> <span id="s930">And you know I mean, there's this you feel like screaming!</span> <span id="s931">And, and in front of the kids, I didn't want to tell the teacher what kind of question is that.</span> <span id="s932">I said, "This is war.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">This is you know, you don't have to have any reason."</span> <span id="s934">And so on.</span> <span id="s935">So in retrospect, I think, also this was one of the reasons maybe I didn't talk about it.</span> <span id="s936">The other thing is, in Cleveland we really had -- there were some people there was a whole a group of German Jews who had left Germany.</span> <span id="s937">That's how I met my husband.</span> <span id="s938">He's, he's from Germany.</span> <span id="s939">He has a whole other saga to tell, but which he wouldn't tell, because he cannot talk about it.</span> <span id="s940">But there was a group of what I called people with European background, and as one didn't need to talk about this.</span> <span id="s941">This was really my circle.</span> <span id="s942">One of my very close friends was from Italy.</span> <span id="s943">My husband's friends were from Germany.</span> <span id="s944">And you didn't have to dwell on these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">02:31:03 It was part of what you brought with you to your daily living.</span> <span id="s946">And, and I realized, when I started talking about it in Syracuse -- it all started when the Council of Jewish Women in Syracuse had a workshop for teachers in the public school to teach the Holocaust, to introduce the teaching, whatever that means, teaching the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s947">And I participated in this workshop.</span> <span id="s948">And I became aware, and I began to accept, to recount some of that.</span> <span id="s949">Again there was, you know, when I say “Rivesaltes” to most my, my close friends or the people who come from Europe or come from France, it immediately evokes something.</span> <span id="s950">But then I have to go into the detail as to what Rivesaltes, why Rivesaltes, where Rivesaltes, how Rivesaltes.</span> <span id="s951">And it's difficult, and there is this lack of background to do it.</span> <span id="s952">It's interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">When I went to France, well, it just so happened that my husband was transferred to France from '83 to '86.</span> <span id="s954">So I retired from my -- I was teaching at Upstate Medical Center by then, in the pediatric residency program.</span> <span id="s955">And I left.</span> <span id="s956">I retired.</span> <span id="s957">And my clinical practice as well.</span> <span id="s958">So here I was having all this time, and I reconnected with people that I hadn't seen, with people I had worked with in the camps, and so forth and so on.</span> <span id="s959">And we put together our selected memories.</span> <span id="s960">And it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s961">And I was asked by a group I became active in WIZO-- which is the equivalent of Hadassah -- which I had never done, because I had never had time for this kind of thing.</span> <span id="s962">But I was very happy to create an educational program for them, and a program of activities; and I was asked to talk about my war experience.</span> <span id="s963">It surprised me.</span> <span id="s964">But then I realized there's a new generation.</span> <span id="s965">And they were mostly Jews from North Africa, because the Sephardic community is so much bigger in France today than it's ever been.</span> <span id="s966">And these Jews had all been coming in the '50s -- after the war -- and they didn't know.</span> <span id="s967">Yet, at the same time, there was a physical closeness being there in Europe.</span> <span id="s968">And when I said “Rivesaltes,” or when I say and name any place, there is some response, which made it easier for me to talk there.</span> <span id="s969">And even to talk here.</span> <span id="s970">And that, that's a reality.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: Is there anything you would like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s973">I'll probably think about it tonight.</span> <span id="s974">I, I want to add that I always find it very difficult to do this, to give these talks in the first person.</span> <span id="s975">And yet I know I've got to do it, because that's the only way people will I've had more people who have heard me talk in Chapel Hill recently relate to exp-- pieces of experience.</span> <span id="s976">Each one comes away with another little piece, not the whole.</span> <span id="s977">And I think it's important, because I can -- personally, I cannot relate to anything that's fictionalized about the sho’ah,the television series on the sho’ah, or anything that's fictionalized in books or in the media, I just can't even watch.</span> <span id="s978">To me, it's not the real stuff.</span> <span id="s979">And so, I suppose that by my talking and sharing it with others, it's the real stuff.</span> <span id="s980">And maybe something remains for them.</span> <span id="s981">I feel that responsibility.</span> <span id="s982">I really do.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s984">Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s985">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION End of Tape #2 Conclusion of Interview 22 Women’s
