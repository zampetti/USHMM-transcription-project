CRAWFORD CAMP: DACHAU DATE: NOVEMBER 13, 1979</span></p> <p><span id="s2">Q: Our guest is Eugene McPheeters, and Mr. McPheeters, could you give us your whole name?</span></p> <p><span id="s3">A: Eugene Quentin McPheeters.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Q: And what is your home now?</span> <span id="s5">Where?</span> <span id="s6">A: Chamblee, Georgia.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Q: In Chamblee, Georgia.</span> <span id="s8">Are you a Georgian by birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A: No, I’m from Tennessee.</span> <span id="s10">Cleveland, Tennessee originally.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: So am I.</span> <span id="s12">So is my father.</span> <span id="s13">We are talking about the experience you had during World War II, and seeing Dachau, the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s14">But could we start by a brief history, for example, of your military career?</span> <span id="s15">Were you in the Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: Yes, I was in the Army.</span> <span id="s17">I went originally into an armored outfit, and we were sent overseas to England.</span> <span id="s18">We stayed there several months, five months as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s19">We were transferred to the infantry, given six weeks of infantry training, and sent over to the front lines.</span> <span id="s20">I landed on Omaha Beach in October and then was sent to the front line, as a replacement, to the 103rd Infantry Division.</span> <span id="s21">I was hit three days after I was in combat.</span> <span id="s22">I went back to the hospital and stayed for one month.</span> <span id="s23">I was hit the day before Thanksgiving, and on Christmas Eve I was sent back to my outfit so I missed the Battle of the Bulge.</span> <span id="s24">We were in the 3rd Army sector at the time, even though we were assigned to the 7th Army.</span> <span id="s25">We had been assigned to the 3rd Army sector to the Saar Valley to reinforce the 3rd Army.</span> <span id="s26">We kicked off the last drive on March 15th, and we crossed the Seigfried Line and went across the Rhine to Darmstadt.</span> <span id="s27">Then our outfit was reassigned, and we turned south.</span> <span id="s28">We went through southern Germany, through Landsberg.</span> <span id="s29">I went into the cell where Hitler spent his prison days and then we went on down through southern Germany and Austria and met the 5th Army through the Brenner Pass, in Austria.</span> <span id="s30">I stayed with the 103rd Division as occupation in Austria until September...</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Of 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: 1945 and then they sent the younger people who didn't have enough points for discharge up to the 45th Division.</span> <span id="s33">They were encamped near Munich, I believe, and we went up to Dachau one day.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Now, what month was this in?</span> <span id="s35">August?</span> <span id="s36">September?</span> <span id="s37">A: This was in September.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Of 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Did you know about Dachau's existence before this?</span> <span id="s41">How did you find out that Dachau existed?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Yes we knew about it through the Stars and Stripes and other publications.</span> <span id="s43">We had started working out...yes, we knew about it.</span> <span id="s44">In fact, I had talked with people who had actually been in the outfits that took the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: So how did you get up there?</span> <span id="s46">Did you have a truck, a jeep?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: We were in temporary billets.</span> <span id="s48">I am not sure exactly what facilities we had in Munich, but we discussed the thought of going up to see what had happened at Dachau, so we went on a military truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: What do you remember about that experience at Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: I remember the high masonry walls, stucco walls, and they were capped with terra cotta coating, and they had speakers around the walls that the local people told us played music all the time.</span> <span id="s51">And then we went on in through the gates.</span> <span id="s52">In fact, the Army trucks pulled in through the gates.</span> <span id="s53">I believe we had quite a large parking area there.</span> <span id="s54">They had wire fences, like chain link fences, with barbed wire on top, and these different areas were divided into different sections, like you would have maybe a corral or a cabin or something like that where fences would be more secure.</span> <span id="s55">There were little shacks.</span> <span id="s56">I don't remember exactly how they were built, but temporary, and they were built of the same type.</span> <span id="s57">And they were in these different compounds.</span> <span id="s58">The main building was a mason building.</span> <span id="s59">It was quite complex in structure, and it had different rooms -- holding areas, I would assume -- and I remember quite distinctly this large holding room with quite a low ceiling.</span> <span id="s60">And then off to the east, I believe, was a large room -- I would say about 25 feet x 50 feet -- and it looked like a shower.</span> <span id="s61">We had a guide, and he told us that this was the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s62">But it looked very much like a large shower.</span> <span id="s63">It had drains on the floor, and it had the showers in it.</span> <span id="s64">Through the end of this building were two large doors and connected to this room, through the doors, was a large high-ceiling room, which was even bigger than the shower.</span> <span id="s65">I would imagine it was maybe 50 or 60 feet square with the high ceilings, probably 12, 14, maybe 15 feet.</span> <span id="s66">When we were there the camp had been cleaned and all the bodies had been removed, but you still could hardly stand the odor that was in the chamber.</span> <span id="s67">We didn't have gas masks with us at the time, but I would have liked to have had a gas mask on, even though it had been weeks since the bodies had been removed.</span> <span id="s68">As we went on through this large holding room, there was another room that had the furnaces, crematoriums.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">There were about a dozen of these masonry furnaces, which looked like ceramic kilns.</span> <span id="s70">And they had the trotters that they laid the bodies on and pushed them into the kilns, then they'd rake the bodies off and pull them back out.</span> <span id="s71">I don't know how many of those they could cremate in one time.</span> <span id="s72">I went on down below this area, and the ashes of the people dropped out from below the kiln and they were just gathered together in a big hopper.</span> <span id="s73">They had little crock pots that looked like little flower pots, and they put these ashes in those little pots.</span> <span id="s74">We were told that they sealed these pots and these ashes were shipped to different relatives in different countries and they sold them for money, telling them these were the ashes of their relatives.</span> <span id="s75">But they were just anybody's ashes; they were all mixed up.</span> <span id="s76">One thing I can't forget is that large room.</span> <span id="s77">There were no bodies there, but you could see where the bodies had been packed in there to the ceiling, and there were pieces of scalp and skin sticking to the ceiling in front of us that you could still see.</span> <span id="s78">And it was very, very depressing.</span> <span id="s79">I never could forget that scene because I could see that those bodies had actually been stacked there.</span> <span id="s80">I knew they had been.</span> <span id="s81">We went on through, after we left the building, out to the different compounds.</span> <span id="s82">We saw different types of ways of disposing of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">They had one area.</span> <span id="s84">They said that there were dogs and they would put these people in there with the dogs.</span> <span id="s85">There was also a wall which they called, I believe, the Execution Wall where they lined people up in front of the wall and then machine-gunned them.</span> <span id="s86">There was one young man there, a young child really.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">He was probably a teenager.</span> <span id="s88">He had been liberated in the camp, and he said his parents, his whole family, had been killed in that camp.</span> <span id="s89">He stayed there; he didn't want to leave.</span> <span id="s90">He spoke as the guide, but he just wanted to stay there because that's where his folks were and he didn't want to leave.</span> <span id="s91">There were other people around that were more or less guides, and people who had been in camps.</span> <span id="s92">I didn't remember anybody specific.</span> <span id="s93">I guess we spent about six or eight hours there.</span> <span id="s94">I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: There was no question in your mind that this had been a real concentration camp, that people had been killed here, cremated here, their ashes had been disposed of?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Certainly no doubt about it.</span> <span id="s97">Q: It couldn’t have been faked.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: No, no, it was all true.</span> <span id="s99">I don't know how people could disbelieve it for the facts had been presented.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: You are an architect today.</span> <span id="s101">Dachau was the first concentration camp that the Germans built, the first one, and then all the rest of them were modeled on it.</span> <span id="s102">I have been curious trying to find out where that design came from, and finally a Russian survivor told us that they came from the gulags that Stalin had set up in Russia in the 1920s.</span> <span id="s103">The Germans had gone over there in the days when they were friendly with the Russians, seen the way that the gulags, the concentration camps, were built, and came back and built that one as a model.</span> <span id="s104">So, what you were seeing was a plan that had already been worked out for control of the inmates, and the fences were electrified so that anybody who touched the fence would die almost instantly.</span> <span id="s105">And they evidently did have complete control because there was never rebellion.</span> <span id="s106">There was never an effort to break out of Dachau which was an interesting thing.</span> <span id="s107">They had a moat down one side.</span> <span id="s108">I think the water halfway went down one of these big wire fences.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: I remember a ditch there.</span> <span id="s110">I don’t remember if there was water at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Were there any Germans being kept as prisoners of war or prisoners in Dachau?</span> <span id="s112">A: Not that I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: By that time they had filled it up someplace in there.</span> <span id="s114">Someplace.</span> <span id="s115">I am not sure, historically, when it happened, but they had captured a whole bunch of POW Germans and they had put them in that camp.</span> <span id="s116">Just trying to control the Germans.</span> <span id="s117">This may have been by Christmas of 1945, or much later.</span> <span id="s118">Did you have a chance to notice the homes that were over on one side of Dachau?</span> <span id="s119">The Dachau area was a staging area for an SS Division, and that was their port, and they had served guarding part time when they were there and then they would go train and do something else.</span> <span id="s120">But there actually were hundreds of homes built for the officers and the sergeants, the ranking and enlisted men.</span> <span id="s121">They lived there.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Their families lived there, even when the men went to fight in Russia.</span> <span id="s123">Those families, those officers, the SS officers, were billeted in those homes.</span> <span id="s124">Those homes that were built for the SS officers still exist and they’re occupied by Germans today.</span> <span id="s125">It’s a peculiar twist to history.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: I remember that there was...looked like a residential area.</span> <span id="s127">Q: That’s right.</span> <span id="s128">That was the area.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: I knew that they had to billet the officers and men somewhere, but we weren't told anything about it at the time.</span> <span id="s130">I don't remember if we were.</span> <span id="s131">But they were very nice houses.</span> <span id="s132">It was in an area about 8 or 10 miles north of Munich I believe.</span> <span id="s133">I remember it and the surrounding area, but not with a lot of details.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Did you see any other concentration camps?</span> <span id="s135">In Austria there was a thing called Mauthausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: No.</span> <span id="s137">This was the only one I saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: It was over in Austria.</span> <span id="s139">We got a little booklet that one GI gave us of an auxiliary camp called Gunskirchen.</span> <span id="s140">Just about as awful as anything I’ve ever seen.</span> <span id="s141">If you want a copy of it I’ll give it to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: I would like a copy.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: When did you finally get back to the states?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: I came back in November of 1945.</span> <span id="s145">We were training to go to the Pacific, the 45th Division, and they dropped the atomic bomb, and we came back.</span> <span id="s146">I was discharged in December of 1945 at Ft. McPherson.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: You stayed here in Georgia?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: I had about a three-week leave of absence at home after I came back.</span> <span id="s149">Then I came back and was discharged in December.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: At the time you saw Dachau and in reading the Stars &amp; Stripes, did you realize that there were other inmates in that camp besides Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Did they tell you how many priests and nuns and Protestant ministers and whole Jehovah’s Witnesses organization...?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: They didn't tell us how many, but we knew there were different nationalities.</span> <span id="s154">Q: French and Romanians.</span> <span id="s155">Anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: It wasn't just a Jewish concentration camp.</span> <span id="s158">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: There really was everything.</span> <span id="s160">They told you that?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s162">In fact, I don't believe we knew at first that there were so many Jewish people there.</span> <span id="s163">We thought they were political prisoners mainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: That's interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Now, that was my opinion.</span> <span id="s166">I don’t really think anybody [unintelligible] Jewish.</span> <span id="s167">In fact, we had heard rumors about it, even when we were in combat.</span> <span id="s168">But until after the war was over, when we began to get the details and information on it and the information began to come together, we didn't know a lot about it, frankly.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Was there ever any dilemma or question in your mind about the Germans doing something like you saw at Dachau?</span> <span id="s170">In other words, here is a great civilization that's supposed to have culture and music and religion and arts and all of a sudden there was Dachau which was a major upheaval experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Something from another world.</span> <span id="s172">At the time, we were so mentally programmed toward the Germans that we weren't particularly surprised.</span> <span id="s173">But after awhile, when you got the...for instance, we stayed in Austria several weeks after the war was over in Europe.</span> <span id="s174">We got to know the Austrians and some Germans, and they seemed just like regular people to us.</span> <span id="s175">I couldn't really imagine how they could do what they had done.</span> <span id="s176">Another GI and I got into a little bit of an argument about some local people.</span> <span id="s177">He was going to kick some people.</span> <span id="s178">We were at a gate between the French and the American sector, and these people wanted to go through to see some relatives, to take some animals and cows and things through.</span> <span id="s179">And he got sort of mean toward the people.</span> <span id="s180">He wanted to know what they were going to do, and he started fishing around.</span> <span id="s181">He said, "Look what these people have done.”</span> <span id="s182">And I said, "The same thing could happen to some of us maybe, if you happen to be in the wrong place at the time."</span> <span id="s183">But you find people everywhere that are made up the same way, and unless we have openness, know what is going on politically, this thing can happen here, in England, or anywhere.</span> <span id="s184">You have to know what people have on their minds and in their hearts, what kind of people they are, what they want to do to other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: We’ve got sixty Americans sitting over in... A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Whatever.</span> <span id="s187">So, you do understand that the Holocaust could happen again.</span> <span id="s188">In fact, this Cambodia with the million people murdered....</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s190">Right.</span> <span id="s191">[Unintelligible.]</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Did you happen to see the Holocaust television series?</span> <span id="s193">A: Yes, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: What did you think of the series?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: I thought it was pretty accurate.</span> <span id="s196">Like any dramatic production, especially on television, or movies, or radio, you have actors who don't really always feel what had happened, so they have to act.</span> <span id="s197">You can't really make this a real thing.</span> <span id="s198">It’s actors, but I thought it portrayed the message very well.</span> <span id="s199">Anybody who really wanted to listen, and wanted to see what had happened, there was no question about getting the message.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: We are so grateful for your taking the time to come and tell the story.</span> <span id="s201">It is upsetting, it always is, always will be for some reason, but because you have this hurt, you are helping us all.</span> <span id="s202">We thank you so much.</span></p></body></html>
