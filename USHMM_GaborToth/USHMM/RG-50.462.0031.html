twice he got the silver medal and the third time he got the Iron Cross, and the last time for personal bravery—he became the personal courier of the last King, and he was stationed in the palace, the court palace in Vienna.</span> <span id="s20">According to the Nuremberg Laws, he wouldn’t be considered a Jew because of those medals and his records in the Navy, but he died when I was five years old, and the German occupation in Hungary took place in 1944.</span> <span id="s21">He wasn’t alive at that time, and those laws, even if they were applicable, I did not find, they didn’t give the documentation out to Jews from the archives, so I couldn’t prove it.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">JF: In other words, the Nuremberg Laws that were applied in Hungary would have exempted him from Jewish status or identification because of his service to the Crown.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">EB: Yes, because of his service to his country.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">JF: Because of his service to the country, so that you, had that been documented, had you had those papers, your immediate family would not have been under any kind of persecution whatsoever?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">EB: He wouldn’t be, his wife and his child, if he would be alive; but my mother remarried so it wouldn’t be applicable to my mother.</span> <span id="s26">I was the only one who would be able to use that protection.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">JF: This was a special protection that was issued by the King.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">EB: This was a special protection issued by Hitler, by Hitler’s law.</span> <span id="s29">This is the Hitler Law, and I don’t know if you call it “Nuremberg Law,” if it was active in Nuremberg or not.</span> <span id="s30">I can not call it, I am not a historian.</span> <span id="s31">The only thing I can tell is that certain Jews were exempted, and they got the non-Jewish status.</span> <span id="s32">They were the Jews who were awarded for bravery during the First World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">JF: Such as an Iron Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">EB: Such as an Iron Cross and such as two silver medals what he had.</span> <span id="s35">I have one in here, even.</span> <span id="s36">And the other one is, if you were crippled, amputated, or...those people were exempted as Jews.</span> <span id="s37">They were not considered Jews and...</span></p> <p><span id="s38">JF: Did that hold even through the German occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">EB: Yes, even in Germany.</span> <span id="s40">Hitler had one of the generals who was Jewish because of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">JF: One of the Hungarian generals?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">EB: No, German.</span> <span id="s43">In Hungary we didn’t have Jewish generals.</span> <span id="s44">The highest rank I guess that the Jews had was a colonel.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">JF: Your father died when you were quite young.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">EB: My father died when I was five years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">JF: Do you recall, or did your mother ever tell you any information about whether or not it was difficult for him to rise in the military system in Hungary because of his Jewish background?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">EB: Yes.</span> <span id="s49">The stories that my mother and my father’s sister told me was he was beaten by the...in 1919.</span> <span id="s50">It was a Communist uprising in Hungary.</span> <span id="s51">After that, Horthy, who after the King, he became our governor, and my father served under him because he was an admiral and he was on the Navarre, that was the second submarine which my father served on.</span> <span id="s52">He was the admiral in the Navarre, and my father served under him.</span> <span id="s53">And my father finished at the naval academy on the ships and when he was in the Navy, because he had enlisted before the war, and Horthy was a very antisemitic person by himself.</span> <span id="s54">He had antisemitic ideas and he had the Guard, they called it the White Guard, who were killing off the Red Guard, the Communists.</span> <span id="s55">Now, in the meantime, they were cleaning out Jews, too, not only the Communist Jews but, if they find a Jew on the street or wherever, they took it to the Britannia Hotel in Budapest and some of them were skinned alive or shot, and my father was on a trip...that time it was in 1919, after the war and the King wasn’t in power anymore, and Horthy became the power and my father was on a trip in the country, and they pulled him up off his car and they beat him savagely.</span> <span id="s56">Because he was a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">JF: This was the White Guard.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">EB: Yes, this was the White Guard, and he was beaten savagely.</span> <span id="s59">He died of lymphosarcoma.</span> <span id="s60">At that time, the lymphosarcoma, they did not have the studies—they didn’t know what.</span> <span id="s61">It could be because the submarines were not developed, and the caissons were dangerous and he was serving on submarines for a long time.</span> <span id="s62">At that time they said that the beating had something to do with that, because he was savagely beaten and left on the field dead by the White Guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">JF: You said that he had served under the admiral on the Navarre.</span> <span id="s64">At that time did he experience this antisemitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">EB: I really don’t know because, quote, unquote my father had red hair, very light complexion, very German looks.</span> <span id="s66">Everybody thought he was German.</span> <span id="s67">His second tongue was German; and he spoke Italian.</span> <span id="s68">He was stationed in Poland and in Italy.</span> <span id="s69">So nobody would know unless they knew that he was a Jew, so I don’t know what he experienced, because, unfortunately, I missed that part of my life, to know about his personal experiences.</span> <span id="s70">I knew dramatic experiences about this beating.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">JF: This you were aware of, or this was reported to you by your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">EB: My mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">JF: Your mother told you?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">EB: My mother told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">JF: You said that your mother came from a different kind of background when we talked about this earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">EB: Yes, my mother was born in Transylvania and my grandparents in that city, it was Sighet, the city that Elie Wiesel is coming from.</span> <span id="s77">The same town!</span> <span id="s78">That town was populated 75% by Jews.</span> <span id="s79">Very Orthodox Jews, with caftans and shtreimels and payes.</span> <span id="s80">My grandfather was not from that town.</span> <span id="s81">He came from a different part of the country, not that religious, but my grandmother was from that town, so my grandfather adjusted and he became a pious Jew, a very honest, very lovely, pious Jew.</span> <span id="s82">They were very Orthodox, and it was a golden time of my life to go to that city and see oh, everybody was Jewish.</span> <span id="s83">They had farmlands and they had lumber, even the maids were Jewish.</span> <span id="s84">The woodchoppers were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">JF: This was quite in contrast to your upbringing in Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">EB: And my regular life, I spent my summer vacation there, and it was such a different background and a different culture, but I really loved it because everything was so warm, and the beggars were Jews, and I learned about being a Jew there, when my grandfather on my first seder there, I remember...It was after my father’s death and I was five years old and my grandfather had a seder and all the doors were open, and at that table, I don’t know, we sat around 18 or 28 people—I don’t know—I was little—and my grandmother made a wine out of raisins and I drank so much, I got drunk.</span> <span id="s87">I recited every prayer with my grandfather.</span> <span id="s88">My grandfather sat at the top of the table, with white pillows, wearing the kittel.</span> <span id="s89">The kittel is the white dress for when you are buried, that’s what they are wearing and I said everything whatever he said.</span> <span id="s90">And then I got drunk, and I was put in bed, but the doors were open because Grandmother and Grandfather said that not only the prophet, but everybody that was hungry or didn’t have a place to sleep—their door was always open for people to come in and be fed and have a shelter.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">JF: Did that happen, did people come in?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">EB: Yes, my grandmother brought up so many strange boys, because there were poor people and they sent them to Grandmother and Grandfather because they knew they will give their home and their food to them.</span> <span id="s93">And Grandmother was always the first one in the town.</span> <span id="s94">My grandmother was a very proud woman and very stern, a beautiful big lady who was very snobbish in her own way.</span> <span id="s95">And she was not very social with anybody whom she didn’t know way back; and they had to have a certain standard.</span> <span id="s96">But when a poor girl wanted to get married and they didn’t have a dowry, my grandmother was one of the first who gave and went around town to everybody who could afford it and collected for that girl’s wedding and for the dowry.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">JF: Your grandparents were of an upper class then in the town, or an upper middle class?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">EB: No, middle class.</span> <span id="s99">They were very wealthy once, and then after the First World War they were robbed and they were not wealthy at all.</span> <span id="s100">They were good people, but not wealthy people, but they had a nice life.</span> <span id="s101">My grandmother every year went to Baden Baden or Marienbad...for the cure, to the spas.</span> <span id="s102">She always bought the best things for the children.</span> <span id="s103">She went to Vienna and she ordered the clothes, or she went to Budapest to the stores and ordered things, but there were much richer people there.</span> <span id="s104">They were not rich at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">JF: So, your mother came from this observant background and this very intense Jewish identity.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">EB: Except my grandfather’s brother, who was the banker in the town...they had the first motor car.</span> <span id="s107">The family was well-to-do.</span> <span id="s108">They came from...they had lumber... My great-grandparents, my grandfather’s parents, owned flour mills, and my grandmother’s parents they owned a canteen in the mining town, close to Sighet, had a salt mine, and a canteen and a tobacco shop.</span> <span id="s109">The license was given by the government, was given to my other great-grandfather on my mother’s side.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">JF: And your grandfather was in what kind of business, your mother’s father, your grandfather?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">EB: He was a farmer.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">JF: He was a farmer and he was able to own land?</span> <span id="s113">That was not an issue?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">EB: They didn’t live in a ghetto.</span> <span id="s115">The city had certain areas where the Jewish people lived.</span> <span id="s116">My grandparents never lived in this area.</span> <span id="s117">They were mixed, mostly where they lived, there were mostly Christian, Gentile people.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">JF: And was that difficult?</span> <span id="s119">Did that present any problems that you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">EB: No, they were very friendly with those people.</span> <span id="s121">My grandparents never liked to live in a ghetto, in an environment where there were just...My grandmother said, “You belong to a land,” and they spoke several languages, and actually, my grandmother went to a cloister, to the nuns to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">JF: This was a common way of Jewish girls becoming educated in those days?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">EB: Yes, because in those days they had just parochial schools, and my grandmother went to the parochial school, and even when they had the play Cinderella, she was the Prince on the stage.</span> <span id="s124">That was her big experience.</span> <span id="s125">But she wasn’t academically educated, and she liked to learn but she made a point that her children were educated.</span> <span id="s126">Her only son became a dentist.</span> <span id="s127">She had eight living children.</span> <span id="s128">The girls went to parochial schools.</span> <span id="s129">My mother graduated from the Gymnasium, and she went to Budapest to study pharmacy.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">JF: Is that how she met your father, when she went to Budapest?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">EB: Yes, because her older sister was already married and living in Budapest, and she met my father in Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">JF: Your grandparents’ home was an observant home?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">EB: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">JF: Kosher?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">EB: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">JF: Your grandmother wore a shaytl.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">EB: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">JF: And yet, she was a modern woman in many ways, in terms of her education and what she wanted for her children.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">EB: She had a lot of common sense, and she had a born intellect, and she always wanted to learn.</span> <span id="s140">Even my aunt was telling me, that when they came home from school she was always sitting down with them.</span> <span id="s141">Her name was Rosie and she said, “Rosie wants to learn, too.”</span> <span id="s142">She wanted to learn what she never did, because she just finished elementary school.</span> <span id="s143">In those days, you know, in the early 1800’s, she went to the parochial school to the nuns and she finished that.</span> <span id="s144">But she had an urge to learn.</span> <span id="s145">Even when I was a little girl, she wanted to know what I learned.</span> <span id="s146">I had to teach her whatever I learned.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">JF: She had a hunger for the outside world.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">EB: She wanted to learn about poems and poets, and she had a, not a good voice, but a nice voice, and she liked to sing, and I have an awful voice, and she even tolerated that, and she was the one who built me up all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">JF: Your father’s background was obviously not as observant as your mother’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">EB: Yes, that was an interesting thing.</span> <span id="s151">My father was an agnostic.</span> <span id="s152">He ran away from home; that is why he joined the Navy because his father wanted to make a rabbi out of him, because of the background and he was very much against it.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">JF: So, he was rebelling against his background of the rabbis in his family and he became an agnostic and was not personally observant.</span> <span id="s154">What happened to their marriage?</span> <span id="s155">Your mother had come from a very different...</span></p> <p><span id="s156">EB: So, he had to observe what my mother wanted.</span> <span id="s157">They had a kosher home because my grandparents wouldn’t eat in any other way when they came and my mother was very attached to her parents and my grandparents always came and visited us.</span> <span id="s158">So he said, “Whatever you do in the home, that’s your business, that’s your home.</span> <span id="s159">Whatever I eat outside and whatever I do outside, I do, but don’t ask me to wear a hat at the table or go to the synagogue.”</span> <span id="s160">So once in a while he did it for the sake of my mother.</span> <span id="s161">He went to the synagogue on the High Holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">JF: This is what your mother told you later?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">EB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">JF: Do you have any early memories of what things were like before he died?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">EB: Little things.</span> <span id="s166">He was an exceptionally brilliant man and he was disappointed that he didn’t have a son, so he wanted to make a son out of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">JF: You were the only child?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">EB: I was the only child, yes, so he asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, and I said that I wanted to be a ballerina or a star, a movie star.</span> <span id="s169">He said, “No, you can’t be.</span> <span id="s170">You will be a politician and an attorney,” and I insisted that I wanted to have some artistic things.</span> <span id="s171">Every little girls have this.</span> <span id="s172">He said, “If you are that artistic then you can become an author.”</span></p> <p><span id="s173">JF: He had definite ideas.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">EB: Absolutely, not only that.</span> <span id="s175">He exercised me since I was born!</span> <span id="s176">Before I was born, he already put up the gym equipment in the house.</span> <span id="s177">He put me up on a big fence because we lived in our home at that time and we had a big fence and he put me up on the fence, which was a sloping fence, to walk on it and I said, “I am scared.”</span> <span id="s178">And he said, “You cannot be scared.</span> <span id="s179">There is no such a word, there is no fear.</span> <span id="s180">You are building it into yourself.</span> <span id="s181">You cannot have fear.”</span> <span id="s182">He got very angry, that’s what I remember.</span> <span id="s183">He said, “You cannot have fear, you have to overcome.”</span> <span id="s184">And I wasn’t even five years old when he enrolled me in a private Jewish school, because he wanted to teach me to read and write and he started when I was three-and-a-half or four, and I didn’t do well and he was very disappointed.</span> <span id="s185">He thought that I was a hopeless case.</span> <span id="s186">That’s what I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">JF: This was a private Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">EB: Yes, I dropped out of that.</span> <span id="s189">After his death, my mother took me out because I was too young for that.</span> <span id="s190">And I was very playful and they advised my mother that it is not my time.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">JF: This was a school that was connected with the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">EB: Yes, a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s193">They had Jewish private schools at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">JF: And when you say reading and writing, are you talking about in Hungarian or in Hebrew?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">EB: Hungarian, not in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s196">It was not a religious school, it was a parochial school, like Protestant, Catholic, Jewish.</span> <span id="s197">And it was privately owned by the Jewish community and you had to pay fees, because a public school you don’t have to pay fees, or very little.</span> <span id="s198">But in the Jewish schools they measure up your financial status and according to your financial status, you pay your fees in the school because you are keeping up that school, and then the poor kid can come without paying anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">JF: Was this a common thing in the social group in which your parents were, to send your children to a Jewish private school?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">EB: We had private schools and we had tutors that were private besides that.</span> <span id="s201">So what happened...he knew he was dying, he diagnosed even himself.</span> <span id="s202">He was very fluent in Latin and he had the best professors who were taking care of him.</span> <span id="s203">In Hungary or in Europe at that time, the medical profession didn’t believe to tell the patients.</span> <span id="s204">They diagnosed and they kept it as a secret.</span> <span id="s205">He had a feel that what he had...and so he called one professor up in the name of the other on the telephone to get the diagnosis and because he was so versed in Latin.</span> <span id="s206">The diagnoses are always [unclear] in the late ‘40s and early ‘50s in Hungary, in the Hungarian medical school you have to know Latin because everything was in Latin and not in Hungarian; now it’s changed.</span> <span id="s207">So, if you were a doctor, your diagnosis was in Latin.</span> <span id="s208">So they didn’t assume that anybody who was not in that field could diagnose in Latin and converse in Latin.</span> <span id="s209">So he called them up and he got his proper diagnosis.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">JF: This must have been a while before he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">EB: It was a year before he died, so he decided that I have to learn how to read and write and be aware of things, and I still was a little child who was very playful.</span> <span id="s212">And at school I did not behave like...They couldn’t discipline me because I was playful and talking and chatting and enjoying myself and putting ink all over my dresses and doing lots of other things.</span> <span id="s213">When you are with the six and seven year olds and you

They enacted a law that the Jewish kids had to learn some crafts.</span> <span id="s650">Either they became mechanics, the boys, or this is examples—and the girls either seamstresses, or whatever, but not the higher education, not the Gymnasium, and not what was necessary to have a degree to go to the university.</span> <span id="s651">It was closed and they started to close everything front of us, so the Jewish Gymnasium had 800 pupils.</span> <span id="s652">We had schools all over the country and they decided to establish a certain school which one will teach us the Gymnasium subjects plus subjects that we can use.</span> <span id="s653">Like learning how to design, how to sew, learning business school, like accounting, and languages, so they combined three or four different types of school systems which what they thought we can benefit by when we graduate.</span> <span id="s654">And most of the university professors who were Jews, they were fired from the universities.</span> <span id="s655">A Jew couldn’t be a university professor.</span> <span id="s656">A Jew couldn’t be a Gymnasium teacher.</span> <span id="s657">They were all fired because of the Nuremberg Law, so they realized that the professors being hired by the Jewish community center who was the head of that Jewish Gymnasium and they became Gymnasium teachers.</span> <span id="s658">So they decided to establish a experimental school that they are going to teach exceptionally the bright children and they selected from—you could apply from all over the country, you had to have the basic.</span> <span id="s659">You had to be an excellent student.</span> <span id="s660">You had to have your credits.</span> <span id="s661">Most of the parents could afford this because it was very expensive experiment to set up this school system with machines and with everything, so the parents had to be able to support the school, beside the usual fee that was always in private schools.</span> <span id="s662">It had an extra amount so you had to have ability to support the school beside that.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">JF: This was the experimental school that you were referring to before.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">EB: Yes, and by the percentage how much we paid, they allowed a couple of children who couldn’t pay but they were excellent students.</span> <span id="s665">So, we didn’t exclude the poor ones.</span> <span id="s666">It was how much we could afford and nobody knew who paid and who didn’t.</span> <span id="s667">So, what happened?</span> <span id="s668">There was 1000 of us who applied from the country in that point.</span> <span id="s669">Now, they gave the test that was the equivalent with the test college tests here, I guess, and 40 of us passed the test from the 1000, and I was one of them.</span> <span id="s670">We learned English in that school.</span> <span id="s671">We learned English shorthand, what I don’t know any more.</span> <span id="s672">We graduated simultaneously in English and in Hungarian.</span> <span id="s673">It was a tremendous stress put on us.</span> <span id="s674">We went to the school and the classes started at 8:00, but we went earlier when we had tests.</span> <span id="s675">Because they experimented with us and they thought that they could put all of the knowledge into us that they taught at the universities and they really worked us to the bones, so six of us got nervous breakdowns.</span> <span id="s676">They couldn’t finish and after the first year they left the school and then two more, so 32 of us finished.</span> <span id="s677">Everybody was in a [unclear] under stress and it was such a stress that you didn’t have time for anything—and it was a good point, too, because as you asked me what was my thinking about leaving the country.</span> <span id="s678">We didn’t have time to think about our private life.</span> <span id="s679">We worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">JF: Why do you think the stress was that great?</span> <span id="s681">What do you think the heads of the school were trying to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">EB: They were in love, probably, with the German idea of the supermen, because after the war, they ceased the school system.</span> <span id="s683">They said that you cannot bring up the elite.</span> <span id="s684">This was a very elitist idea.</span> <span id="s685">It didn’t work, it really didn’t work.</span> <span id="s686">It was too much.</span> <span id="s687">Like, I have lots of knowledge, but I don’t master anything.</span></p> <p><span

Mother wouldn’t move into anybody’s house where the room wasn’t freshly painted and cleaned, so we painted it and we cleaned it and we managed to have a whole room for three of us; for mother, my sister and me.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">JF: You had the time, they gave you the time to paint it?</span></p> <p><span id="s947">EB: Yes.</span> <span id="s948">We painted it... We cleaned the bath.</span> <span id="s949">We cleaned the kitchen because my mother was an immaculate woman and she wouldn’t move into a place when it was not absolutely clean, spotless.</span> <span id="s950">Another family was in the other room.</span> <span id="s951">It was a young woman, it was a smaller room and she also arranged it, so we moved in and another lady whose husband was a Gentile who came just to register there because of the law, but her husband most of the time took her out, so we weren’t crowded as other people.</span> <span id="s952">This was a two-room apartment basically, but we had one bathroom and a kitchen and it was an unusually good situation because we bartered for money and this other woman whose husband was in the labor camp, by that time he was already dead, but we didn’t know it—in the Ukraines in the Russian front—had a baby also the same as my sister.</span> <span id="s953">She was a young woman and she got the smaller room and she had a day bed there and a little crib for her baby and a little hot stove and we used the kitchen together and we had the larger room which one we had a sofa bed where my mother and I slept and a crib for my sister and we had some furniture and we had the kitchen.</span> <span id="s954">So mother always managed.</span> <span id="s955">She had the ladies from the farmer’s market who always sent her something because she paid for it, so we had food and she had the goose liver, they sent her gooses and she kept the goose fat and she put the goose part in that to keep it because she was afraid that she cannot feed us if she didn’t have that.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">JF: So, if you had money you could buy food above and beyond...</span></p> <p><span id="s957">EB: For a certain time, but you were limited to get out of the house between certain hours and that was cutting shorter and shorter and if you went shopping and you had the yellow star, they wouldn’t give you the food.</span> <span id="s958">So this certain farmer that came to the yellow star house sometimes, they robbed you.</span> <span id="s959">If you could afford it you could and so...</span></p> <p><span id="s960">JF: Oh, so they came to the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">EB: Sometimes, and my mother had good connection because we lived in the same place for a very long time and they know her and she was a good customer and so, she managed.</span> <span id="s962">She managed somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">JF: What happened with your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">EB: It was given to a Gentile couple.</span> <span id="s965">They moved in.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">JF: And your possessions?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">EB: We could move out our possessions, certain possessions; they let us certain possessions to move out and we put it at an upholsterer who worked for my father.</span> <span id="s968">He was a Jewish man, and in his house where he worked his... and in his cellar he put it away and at that house nobody bothered belongings, and we took certain things with us to the yellow star house.</span> <span id="s969">Finally, the bombing was going on and the war was escalating.</span> <span id="s970">The Russians were coming very, very close, and Horthy, who was our regent, declared on October 15, that he is joining the Allies and that was the biggest mistake that he made because it was too late.</span> <span id="s971">He was always vacillating between Hitler and the Allies, and when he made up his mind, it was already too late and most of his people in the government were fascists and on Hitler’s part, and Hitler knew about it and he asked him over to visit him in Germany and he put him under arrest and he never came back.</span> <span id="s972">So the Arrow Cross took over, and the Arrow Cross government is made out of riff-raffs and absolute killers.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">So that was the 15th of October and on the 16th of October, the massacre began in Budapest.</span> <span id="s974">I am talking about Budapest, but you asked me about the occupation.</span> <span id="s975">I have to tell you that in different parts of the country, the deportation was already closed by August and they already were transported in cattle cars, the Hungarians except Budapest, the Jews in Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">JF: Why was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">EB: Because Horthy...they had a very good connection to Horthy, because as I told you, lots of his friends were Jewish and he was convinced that if he was keeping the Jews in Budapest alive [unclear] because we had most of our men in the labor camps—whoever remained there, he had a good point with the Allies, and somehow they convinced him of that.</span> <span id="s978">And by that time they couldn’t deport us to Auschwitz because everything was bombed out.</span> <span id="s979">The train connections were bombed in Upper Silesia and in Czechoslovakia, so they had to deport and detour.</span> <span id="s980">The transports couldn’t go to Auschwitz, they went to Austria instead of Auschwitz and they went to Germany instead of Auschwitz, even in the last minute after October, from Budapest.</span> <span id="s981">So I am not talking about the total Hungarian population.</span> <span id="s982">I am talking about Budapest.</span> <span id="s983">You have to understand that.</span> <span id="s984">What I am aware of and I can give you a picture of what happened in Budapest on October the 15th after he declared that he is getting out of the war and he’s not on the Axis side.</span> <span id="s985">The Arrow Cross took over.</span> <span id="s986">And on the 16th of October the massacre of Budapest Jews began.</span> <span id="s987">What happened—the Arrow Cross and some of the S.S. and S.A. came to the houses.</span> <span id="s988">We were still in the yellow star houses and took the people out and killed the children and killed the people.</span> <span id="s989">Unbelievable torture was going on.</span> <span id="s990">On the 16th of October, this is my personal story.</span> <span id="s991">Mother got very restless and she got very afraid for us, so she packed a little bag and she dressed my sister up in two outfits.</span> <span id="s992">It was a cold fall.</span> <span id="s993">I dressed and I had my school case, an attaché case in my hand and we decided that we would look up some of our Christian friends to hide us, and we went on the streets.</span> <span id="s994">We took off our yellow star.</span> <span id="s995">We didn’t have any papers with us, but we passed the Arrow Cross guards and they looked at us, but we went by.</span> <span id="s996">We arrived at this friend’s house and we asked for shelter and she said that she cannot have us and that we should go back to our home.</span> <span id="s997">And we were wandering on the street and nobody would take us in, so we had to go back to the yellow star house.</span> <span id="s998">On our way back, we ran across a [unclear] an Arrow Cross [unclear] and picked us up and took us to the precinct.</span> <span id="s999">We couldn’t talk them out of it and they put us in jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Now, the police were quite nice to us.</span> <span id="s1001">When we arrived at the precinct, we were seeing lots of friends of ours, Jewish friends there, and everything was filled with people.</span> <span id="s1002">And they were taking their vital statistics down and when they came to us, and it was our turn to give our vital statistics, the sergeant, the police sergeant and then a plainclothes detective, two plainclothes men came down and looked at us and they went back to the sergeant and they said to us, “You just go back to the cell and later on we will come to get you.</span> <span id="s1003">We are not taking statistics down.”</span> <span id="s1004">We really didn’t know what was happening, and they were clearing the people out.</span> <span id="s1005">They were taking them in police cars and later on we heard they were put in wagons and they went to some of the concentration camps and they were gassed.</span> <span id="s1006">They never came back.</span> <span id="s1007">The whole wagon went to be gassed, and we were there.</span> <span id="s1008">And there was another lady whom I know through a friend of mine, a friend of my mother’s who was this lady’s friend, and we were talking and the detectives, and sergeant thought she was with us, that she belonged to our family.</span> <span id="s1009">I had never seen those policemen before or those detectives before, and they hadn’t seen us before either.</span> <span id="s1010">So, finally, when they cleared everybody out, it was midnight, and they came over and they said that it is your turn, and then the two uniformed policemen and the two detectives said, “Now, where do you live?”</span> <span id="s1011">And we said that we are in this yellow star house and we have to go back there and they said, “Don’t you have any place to go where you will be safe?”</span> <span id="s1012">And we said, “No, nobody is taking us in and we have to go back there.”</span> <span id="s1013">And then they asked the other lady, “Do you live with them?”</span> <span id="s1014">And she said, “No,” and my mother said, “Yes, she does.</span> <span id="s1015">She is coming with us.</span> <span id="s1016">She doesn’t have,” she didn’t, a place to go any more.</span> <span id="s1017">So she came with us, and they didn’t talk too much, the policemen, but they said, “On the street if we run into a patrol of Arrow Cross, we will tell them we are taking you to interrogation to the Parliament, to the Arrow Cross headquarters, and you just shut up and don’t say a word.”</span> <span id="s1018">So, they took us back; and they saved our lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">JF: Why do you think they were so sympathetic to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">EB: They were good people and they saved our lives.</span> <span id="s1021">They just took us back.</span> <span id="s1022">Four strangers.</span> <span id="s1023">They just couldn’t stand it any more and that is what they said.</span> <span id="s1024">They just cannot stand it what these hoodlums are doing, what was everybody, and whatever they can do, they do.</span> <span id="s1025">And they did it.</span> <span id="s1026">After the war, when you had to vouch for people what they were doing with the police and with certain governmental functions, mother went and vouched for them, because they really saved our lives, for nothing.</span> <span id="s1027">Just out of the goodness of their hearts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">JF: All the other people that day had been shipped off and this was the end of their day, and this was one more family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">EB: We had a friend and we know them very well, and they were cleared and others we know, because the detectives and the policemen told us because they followed it up and they told us what happened.</span> <span id="s1030">So we went back and that was after midnight and so mother made a bath for us and we had a bath and this lady had a bath with us, and whatever mother left in the kitchen and in the icebox we ate and the whole house was very happy to see us, and in that yellow star house, they always nominated a house, they always had Christian people there and they could move out and they could get a better quarter from the Jews.</span> <span id="s1031">And in that house most of the Christians didn’t move out.</span> <span id="s1032">They stayed in the yellow star house and they said, “This is our home.</span> <span id="s1033">They were our neighbors, not all of them because we had Jewish neighbors, and we are not moving out because they were good before.</span> <span id="s1034">They are good for us and we are staying in the yellow star house.”</span> <span id="s1035">And they stayed with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">JF: Were these people that you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">EB: I didn’t know them because it is a different house.</span> <span id="s1038">I will tell you what happened to the house where we lived, and where I grew up, and Mother was good for the manager of the house, because it was an apartment house.</span> <span id="s1039">Her son, he became the manager and he became an Arrow Cross man.</span> <span id="s1040">His son reported me to Eichmann, to the S.S., and to the equivalent...that I was a spy, an English spy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">JF: This was a family from your own home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">EB: Before we moved to the yellow star house.</span> <span id="s1043">I am not doing it in the periods that I should.</span> <span id="s1044">I am going ahead of myself and I am not doing this part.</span> <span id="s1045">Now, this part is important because what happened... They came out to investigate me.</span> <span id="s1046">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">JF: Who is they?</span> <span id="s1048">Who came to interrogate you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">EB: They were the Hungarian Counter-Intelligence officers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">JF: So, they were Hungarian men?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">EB: Two Hungarian Counter-Intelligence officers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">JF: And they worked under Eichmann?</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">EB: Yes, because by that time, I don’t remember the name of the German, Weissmueller [phonetic] I guess, who was the governor at that time, the German governor, and everything belonged under the German protectorate so, the Counter-Intelligence was a branch of Eichmann’s.</span> <span id="s1054">They were a cooperating, not official branch.</span> <span id="s1055">But its a cooperation and it was basically directed by Eichmann, who was residing in the Schwabe Mountain.</span> <span id="s1056">That was the name of the mountain, and that was his headquarters, so the counter-intelligence always worked together with the Germans.</span> <span id="s1057">And the counter-intelligence and the Jewish question was under Eichmann.</span> <span id="s1058">Eichmann was the man who everybody reported to finally, so the counter-intelligence men came and they looked at me and said, “Are you Eva Wahrmann?”</span> <span id="s1059">And I said, “Yes, I am.”</span> <span id="s1060">They said, “Are you sure?”</span> <span id="s1061">And I said, “I am sure.”</span> <span id="s1062">They said, “You are a little girl,” and they were looking for a femme fatale, for a spy, a woman, and they got this little girl who at that time had not even 98 pounds!</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">JF: Did they question you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">EB: Yes, certainly they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">JF: Were they rough in any way in their questioning?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">EB: No, no.</span> <span id="s1067">They saw the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1068">I don’t know basically [unclear].</span> <span id="s1069">They showed me the papers.</span> <span id="s1070">The whole thing started... It was a revenge and they were very nice and they said, “Now you disappear.</span> <span id="s1071">You get some papers and disappear.</span> <span id="s1072">You are in danger.”</span> <span id="s1073">Because they showed me...if I recognized the writing.</span> <span id="s1074">Because the name was a false name.</span> <span id="s1075">Whoever reported me didn’t report it in their own name.</span> <span id="s1076">They used a false name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">JF: So, at that point you didn’t know...</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">EB: I know because of the writing and I remember... They showed me and I remembered the handwriting.</span> <span id="s1079">They were extremely nice.</span> <span id="s1080">They were absolutely nice.</span> <span id="s1081">My mother was so shocked that she went in the kitchen and opened the gas because she wanted to commit suicide.</span> <span id="s1082">She was so scared, and they ran in and they brought her back and they said, “Don’t worry.</span> <span id="s1083">This is a ridiculous thing and just don’t worry.”</span> <span id="s1084">But they gave me an advice, and they said, “You get some papers.</span> <span id="s1085">And even if you don’t, you don’t look Jewish, but get away from here.</span> <span id="s1086">You have enemies and they are going to kill you.</span> <span id="s1087">You have to get away, you cannot live in this house and you cannot stay here.”</span> <span id="s1088">And they went away.</span> <span id="s1089">They said that the whole thing is ridiculous but, “The only thing what we are asking you to do, for two weeks you don’t leave the house because we are going to report it, that we interrogated you and we put you under arrest and you are not here.</span> <span id="s1090">After that you escape and you disappear.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">JF: You were to be under house arrest?</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">EB: No, no.</span> <span id="s1093">They were supposed to...</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">JF: They were supposed to have taken you and put you in prison?</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">EB: Yes, that is what they reported.</span> <span id="s1096">Some people did things and I haven’t seen them before and I haven’t seen them after.</span> <span id="s1097">They were good people.</span> <span id="s1098">Now, it happened that I didn’t go out for ten days, really, but I couldn’t get away to leave my mother and leave my sister and we couldn’t get anywhere, so I stayed and then we moved to that yellow star house.</span> <span id="s1099">But for ten days nobody had seen me, so they didn’t know if I was under arrest or not because these people were in the house.</span> <span id="s1100">Now, what happened, the manager’s wife, after the German occupation, came over and said to mother that the Germans were here looking for us and if mother gives them 10,000 pengö, then they can protect us.</span> <span id="s1101">And mother told me.</span> <span id="s1102">I came home that day and mother said to me, “You know, honey, that was Mrs. Seidler, that was the name of the woman, told me if I give her 10,000 pengö she will protect us, because the Germans came and asked how many Jewish families do you have in the house and what are they doing, who are they?</span> <span id="s1103">But she can save us if I give her money.”</span> <span id="s1104">And I say, “Mother, this is blackmail, and she won’t save us.</span> <span id="s1105">She just wants to blackmail you and she won’t do anything.”</span> <span id="s1106">And I went down to her and I said, “Look, Mrs. Seidler.</span> <span id="s1107">Did you talk to those S.S. men?</span> <span id="s1108">Since when are you talking German?”</span> <span id="s1109">They speak fluent Hungarian.</span> <span id="s1110">“They were speaking German,” she says.</span> <span id="s1111">“We were talking German.”</span> <span id="s1112">And I said, “Since when do you speak German?”</span> <span id="s1113">And the German S.S. men wouldn’t come to her and tell her that she take care of us for 10,000 dollar [pengö] and then nothing happens to us.</span> <span id="s1114">And I said, “Well, you leave my mother alone and you won’t get a penny from us.”</span> <span id="s1115">So, after that, that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s1116">So, when we moved to the yellow star house, which was a couple of houses down the street in the same block, the people were very nice there.</span> <span id="s1117">They didn’t know us, but they were very nice to everybody.</span> <span id="s1118">The manager was a lovely woman and everybody was just really nice in that house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">JF: The manager was Christian?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">EB: Christian.</span> <span id="s1121">Yes, and you know, they were very nice people.</span> <span id="s1122">In that house, as I told you when we came back—now I will go back to that point when we came back from the precinct, the next day there was a bombing raid, a big bombing raid.</span> <span id="s1123">I didn’t like to go down to the cellar and most of the Jews didn’t, because we enjoyed it when it was bombing.</span> <span id="s1124">That was the only time when we went up to the roof and we could breathe, and we were people and everybody was in the same shoes, so we didn’t like to go down to the cellar, but we had to because the squadron captain said, “You have to go down.</span> <span id="s1125">And I had such a premonition.</span> <span id="s1126">I never, usually I’m, I wasn’t afraid in my life.</span> <span id="s1127">I didn’t know what fear was, since my father told me not to fear anything.</span> <span id="s1128">But that time I was just shaking.</span> <span id="s1129">And I..</span> <span id="s1130">.</span> <span id="s1131">had such a tremendous fear.</span> <span id="s1132">And I told mother, “I don’t know, Mommy, but I have such a fear something is going to happen to me today.</span> <span id="s1133">I just don’t know.</span> <span id="s1134">It’s just, I just, I just don’t know.”</span> <span id="s1135">And after the raid we came up and I was knitting a little sweater for my sister.</span> <span id="s1136">And around 6:00 in the afternoon, it was dark, dusk, we heard a tremendous noise.</span> <span id="s1137">Because we had to lock the gates, because we weren’t allowed to get out at all.</span> <span id="s1138">To a certain [unclear] we can get out, and then we couldn’t get out.</span> <span id="s1139">We were locked in, in the yellow star house.</span> <span id="s1140">And we heard a tremendous noise, like a dynamite going up, and that was it.</span> <span id="s1141">Twenty-two S.S. men came in, with machine guns, guns, and hand grenades.</span> <span id="s1142">They threw the hand grenades in through the doors, and they said, “All the Jews downstairs!</span> <span id="s1143">You line up, you put your coat on, and go down!”</span> <span id="s1144">So, we put our coat on and they lined us up on the street.</span> <span id="s1145">The street lights were darkened because of the raids, the air raids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Tape three, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">JF: This is tape three, side one, of an interview with Mrs. Eva Bentley, on March 18, 1985.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">EB: They lined us up eight abreast and they surrounded us on both sides.</span> <span id="s1149">They draw their guns and they had their machine guns out and they told the neighboring tenants and occupants of the building to go inside.</span> <span id="s1150">They had to go inside anyway.</span> <span id="s1151">After 6:00 nobody could go out the street any more.</span> <span id="s1152">And across the yellow star house was the Protestants’ church and the living quarters of the Protestant minister and his family.</span> <span id="s1153">The man didn’t go inside.</span> <span id="s1154">He leaned out of his window with his wife and with his children, looking at us, and they let him be there.</span> <span id="s1155">Then the S.S. men started shooting.</span> <span id="s1156">First they shot their lights out, totally, the street lights.</span> <span id="s1157">And then they started to shoot and saying things and, derogatory things about us.</span> <span id="s1158">This lady, when we came home from the precinct, was standing beside my mother, between me and my mother, and when they started to shoot I asked her to change places with me.</span> <span id="s1159">And I didn’t realize one of the S.S. men had a gun drawn and had his machine gun pointed at me, from the back.</span> <span id="s1160">And I didn’t realize that.</span> <span id="s1161">So he started to, when we changed places, he already shot.</span> <span id="s1162">And he shot that lady.</span> <span id="s1163">She had six bullets in her lungs, the whole lung and her heart came out from the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">JF: Why...did you ask to change places with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">EB: I said, “Now they are going to kill us.</span> <span id="s1166">I’d like to stand beside my mother.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">JF: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">EB: And she said, “Of course.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">JF: Mmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">EB: And that was her downfall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">JF: And he didn’t continue to shoot?</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">EB: Yes, he did.</span> <span id="s1173">He continued to shoot, but Mother padded me the day before, and this day, too; when we went down to the air raid shelter I always had sardine cans and chocolate and everything on me because Mother said, “If anything happens, until we are dressed and they are coming for us, you have to have those foods because then I can feed you and Agi and we won’t starve if they are taking us.</span> <span id="s1174">Because they were always taking people to places.</span> <span id="s1175">It was going on every minute.</span> <span id="s1176">So we were aware of it.</span> <span id="s1177">So I was such a skinny girl.</span> <span id="s1178">And she padded me and nothing showed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">JF: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">EB: And I had all those sardine cans and canned foods and three pullovers and one culottes and under the culottes two panties.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">JF: And the cans were stuffed inside your...</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">EB: I, and I had my winter coat on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">JF: Your shirt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">EB: So he continued shooting, and all those machine gun bullets came down on my breast and tore apart my coat, tore apart the cans of sardines, but didn’t hit my heart.</span> <span id="s1185">It went down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">JF: They were diverted?</span> <span id="s1187">They, they...</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">EB: They were diverted by the can of foods, and the chocolates!</span> <span id="s1189">Now what happened, he, the others started—it was a good game—so another one drawed a gun and he shot me in the kidney.</span> <span id="s1190">I got four shots in my kidney.</span> <span id="s1191">Because I was so padded it didn’t harm my kidney, it went above my kidney.</span> <span id="s1192">Two bullets came out, two stayed there.</span> <span id="s1193">At that time I didn’t know what was it.</span> <span id="s1194">I..</span> <span id="s1195">.</span> <span id="s1196">went down and I was shot up.</span> <span id="s1197">I was dead for a couple of seconds.</span> <span id="s1198">So I was on the street, lying on the street.</span> <span id="s1199">Mother wanted to know what happened to me.</span> <span id="s1200">And they were shooting.</span> <span id="s1201">They were constantly shooting, until they ran out of bullets and they refilled their gun and machine guns.</span> <span id="s1202">That was the time when they had a little recess.</span> <span id="s1203">So that time Mother tried to bend down.</span> <span id="s1204">And when I came to myself, because I was unconscious and perhaps, I don’t know how long, I told Mother.</span> <span id="s1205">Mother said, “What’s happening to you?”</span> <span id="s1206">I said, “I am all right, Mother, don’t worry.</span> <span id="s1207">I’ll be all right.</span> <span id="s1208">I’ll be all right.”</span> <span id="s1209">And so Mother bent down and one of them had a bayonet.</span> <span id="s1210">They had the bayonets also.</span> <span id="s1211">And he drawed a bayonet and cut off my mother’s coat.</span> <span id="s1212">But by that time we were wearing winter coats.</span> <span id="s1213">And Mother’s winter coat, it was a fur-lined winter coat.</span> <span id="s1214">So that saved her.</span> <span id="s1215">And she had in her arm my sister, who was 22 months old, 20-some months old.</span></p> <p><span

harmed her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">EB: Look, it was dark.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">JF: So he couldn’t tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">EB: He didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1226">It was such a confusion there, and so many people.</span> <span id="s1227">And they were just shooting, and enjoying the killing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">JF: So he felt that he had injured her or whatever...</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">EB: He was in euphoria of that killing and killing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">JF: And he just went on to the next person.</span></p> <p><span

Mount Sinai.</span> <span id="s1280">It was taken over by the military.</span> <span id="s1281">They took over an old Jewish school, a high school, and that was our shelter or hospital, outside of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1282">By that time they were building the ghetto and everybody’s supposed to move from the ghetto to a week later, from the yellow star homes to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1283">They were cutting us down and down.</span> <span id="s1284">And that hospital, so-called hospital, was working out from that school, outside of the ghetto’s gate.</span> <span id="s1285">So they took me there.</span> <span id="s1286">And we didn’t have any medicine.</span> <span id="s1287">We didn’t have bed, enough beds.</span> <span id="s1288">We didn’t have blankets.</span> <span id="s1289">We didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s1290">We didn’t have food.</span> <span id="s1291">And in that night, they brought in 180 serious wounds, gun wounds, because that was going on in different parts of the city, with the Arrow Cross and with the S.S.</span> <span id="s1292">They were going around and doing that.</span> <span id="s1293">That was the first night, when they started, and they were going around doing that for a long time, until the Russian took over...Budapest.</span> <span id="s1294">So, they were treating people.</span> <span id="s1295">The doctors didn’t have too much to operate with.</span> <span id="s1296">They didn’t have themselves food.</span> <span id="s1297">Most of the doctors weren’t there because after the proclamation of Horthy everybody left the hospital and they thought they are free.</span> <span id="s1298">And now the new regime is starting, the war is over.</span> <span id="s1299">So, the next day or, it was a day-and-a-half later of the proclamation when this whole horror began.</span> <span id="s1300">We didn’t, the doctors couldn’t come back, even if they started, what we later learned, they were caught and they were killed and massacred, too.</span> <span id="s1301">So whoever could slowly come back some way, they came back to help.</span> <span id="s1302">But the others either were killed or they went into hiding.</span> <span id="s1303">They couldn’t get out.</span> <span id="s1304">So, I was on the floor without blankets and without anything for a week.</span> <span id="s1305">And my kidney got damaged, so I couldn’t urinate.</span> <span id="s1306">And when I started [to] urinate it was just blood coming out.</span> <span id="s1307">And so I was operated and I stayed there.</span> <span id="s1308">And then I saw the horror because everybody, whoever had been saved somehow, came in.</span> <span id="s1309">And the stories were tremendous and...unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1310">[tape off then on] The Russian Army was approaching Budapest.</span> <span id="s1311">By November 6th they’re supposed to be in Budapest, but they were stopped by Stalin and with other political reasons what we can read

nighties, and barefooted.</span> <span id="s1321">They marched them through Budapest in that snowy night, at midnight, to the Danube, to the bank of the Danube, and they shot each and every one, killing them into the Danube.</span> <span id="s1322">They froze in there.</span> <span id="s1323">By that time the Danube was not the Blue or Brown Danube, it was a Red Danube, because of Jewish

saved.</span> <span id="s1401">You just have to be a man.</span> <span id="s1402">You just have to be human under inhuman circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">JF: Like the man who stood up to the men who were shooting you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">EB: Yes, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">JF: And the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">EB: And that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">JF: And these guards responded to him, and stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">EB: And you know what?</span> <span id="s1409">We didn’t live in that house, and we weren’t good or bad or anything to that manager and janitors there in that, the yellow star house.</span> <span id="s1410">And you know what happened, there was the manager’s niece, who was a..</span> <span id="s1411">.</span> <span id="s1412">cook for somebody.</span> <span id="s1413">It’s not in that house, somewhere else, but she lived with the manager during that period of time.</span> <span id="s1414">And she didn’t even know me, just knew me when I was in that house and I said hello to her.</span> <span id="s1415">And we weren’t even too friendly.</span> <span id="s1416">She went up to the...place where we lived, in the...yellow star house.</span> <span id="s1417">And from the pantry she took out jams and food and brought it...to the hospital to me and to Mother, risking her life, because that time the Russian were shooting the Germans, and the Hungarians.</span> <span id="s1418">And house to house fighting was going on.</span> <span id="s1419">And among the bullets she was running several times, bringing food to us.</span> <span id="s1420">And there were other people, another neighbor there, who came into the hospital, who didn’t know us either, another Gentile neighbor from that house, who brought some juice to us, his own, what he saved.</span> <span id="s1421">And nobody had too much food at that time, not Gentile or Jew in that city.</span> <span id="s1422">And Mother had given for a ten days’ old loaf of bread a thousand pengö, what was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">JF: How much is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">EB: It would be equivalent with a thousand dollar, what you can buy before.</span> <span id="s1425">I mean, if you want to have the real deficit of that time, it was no such a thing because it was a war-time currency.</span> <span id="s1426">But before the war, five pengö was a dollar.</span> <span id="s1427">So you can equate with that.</span> <span id="s1428">But what you can buy, the buying part, or a, in salary this was equivalent with a thousand.</span> <span id="s1429">And she put it in water and she fed us.</span> <span id="s1430">But the goose flesh and the goose [unclear] enough, because when I was in the hospital and Mother was allowed, once when she find out—for ten days she didn’t know where I was—and when she find out, because they were locked in in that, in the yellow star house, they were lucky again because one man.</span> <span id="s1431">After I was shot down the whole house was put up in...big trucks, and they were taken to a center where all people were sent to the concen-, from, where the older people were sent to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1432">Now this lieutenant or captain, police captain, who was in charge of them, who took them, said, “You don’t get out of the trucks.</span> <span id="s1433">You stay there, and I’ll take care of you.</span> <span id="s1434">I’ll take you back.”</span> <span id="s1435">And when the Arrow Cross people came and said, “Well, now you have to empty your trucks and go to the, to this point and leave the people,” he...said, “Those are my charge.</span> <span id="s1436">I am not responsible for you.</span> <span id="s1437">I am responsible for my unit.</span> <span id="s1438">I am taking them to my unit.”</span> <span id="s1439">And he turned the trucks around and took them back to their homes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">JF: And they didn’t stop him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">EB: No.</span> <span id="s1442">You have seen those policemen who weren’t stopped, who stood up.</span> <span id="s1443">You have seen that one doctor.</span> <span id="s1444">You have seen that police captain or lieutenant, I don’t know the rank because Mother told me this story.</span> <span id="s1445">So when my mother find out—they were locked in, the houses were locked, permanently locked; they couldn’t go out even for food.</span> <span id="s1446">So many people died of hunger there.</span> <span id="s1447">So Mother had these saved goose things, the lard, and other things.</span> <span id="s1448">And the first time when she heard I was in the hospital, that was my birthday, the sixth of November.</span> <span id="s1449">And she came with a little food, poppy seed noodles, and she brought her saved goose things.</span> <span id="s1450">And then I said, “Well, I will leave it here because it’s safer.</span> <span id="s1451">I don’t know what’s going to happen there but at least,” we were thinking, I was thinking, “Mother, you stay in this hospital.</span> <span id="s1452">Don’t go back.”</span> <span id="s1453">But she had to go back because my sister wasn’t with her.</span> <span id="s1454">“The next time when you come you will stay.</span> <span id="s1455">I will arrange it.”</span> <span id="s1456">So she brought the food in and that’s the way we survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">JF: You stayed in the hospital then, until the end?</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">EB: Until the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">JF: And your mother was able to stay.</span> <span id="s1460">They didn’t check to see...</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">EB: They checked, and they wanted to kick her out.</span> <span id="s1462">That is another man who comes into our life, again, who saved us.</span> <span id="s1463">He was a Jew.</span> <span id="s1464">He was a doctor.</span> <span id="s1465">He is a doctor.</span> <span id="s1466">He lives in Washington.</span> <span id="s1467">He owns Jefferson Memorial Hospital.</span> <span id="s1468">If you like to see his write-up in the Fortune 400, he’s one of them.</span> <span id="s1469">He deserves it.</span> <span id="s1470">That man saved lives.</span> <span id="s1471">He didn’t have anything to eat.</span> <span id="s1472">he wouldn’t take the food away from his patients.</span> <span id="s1473">We had a chapel upstairs.</span> <span id="s1474">This was the Jewish school.</span> <span id="s1475">We had a chapel upstairs.</span> <span id="s1476">And he slept on the bare floor, on the chapel, a couple of hours at night.</span> <span id="s1477">[unclear] had to get undressed and he operated day or night.</span> <span id="s1478">He was that time I think 29 or 28 years old.</span> <span id="s1479">They screamed, the patients, because we didn’t have enough food.</span> <span id="s1480">The toilet, toilets!</span> <span id="s1481">The lot of toilets were overflowing.</span> <span id="s1482">In front of the lava-, in the lavatory, people, wounded people, were on the floor, laying there, in the feces and you just, the horror.</span> <span id="s1483">And what you have seen.</span> <span id="s1484">And we had the best!</span> <span id="s1485">Because the ghetto was overflowing.</span> <span id="s1486">People were dying of hunger.</span> <span id="s1487">My second father’s mother died of hunger in the, in there.</span> <span id="s1488">She went blind first.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">JF: Then, your second father’s...</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">EB: Mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">JF: Mother died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">EB: Yeah, yeah, my step-grandmother.</span> <span id="s1493">And her daughter survived her but committed suicide in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1494">The ghetto, it was a terrible place—no food, no, that...people upon people.</span> <span id="s1495">The Arrow Cross come in every, every night and killed people in the...cellars and wherever they had.</span> <span id="s1496">They had a shooting area near there, killing people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">JF: You had said that this doctor saved your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">EB: The way...he operated on me he saved my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">JF: And he, you also said that he kept your mother in the hospital so that she could be saved.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">EB: Because they were, the selection was going on.</span> <span id="s1501">And they selected the people who didn’t need it, medical attention.</span> <span id="s1502">And even who needed medical attention but their life was not, their situation was not life-threatening.</span> <span id="s1503">My situation was life-threatening at that point, because of the kidney shots and bleeding.</span> <span id="s1504">And I had a drain passing my kidney.</span> <span id="s1505">And I was quite in limbo if I survive or not.</span> <span id="s1506">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">JF: What did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">EB: And...they always had a selection committee, made out of other Jewish doctors in the hospital, and other people, because they needed the place.</span> <span id="s1509">They put, in life-threatening situation in one bed three people.</span> <span id="s1510">Because we didn’t have a bed.</span> <span id="s1511">Finally I had a bed.</span> <span id="s1512">That was the biggest thing.</span> <span id="s1513">The nurses arranged it for me because they liked me.</span> <span id="s1514">And they wanted to save me.</span> <span id="s1515">I don’t know, God took care of me.</span> <span id="s1516">And Mother was in that bed and my sister.</span> <span id="s1517">So they said they can put two patients with me in that bed.</span> <span id="s1518">So they made a selection and Mother’s supposed to go the next morning to the ghetto, with my sister.</span> <span id="s1519">And I said, “If Mother goes, I’ll go.”</span> <span id="s1520">And they said, this committee said, “O.K., that’s your decision.</span> <span id="s1521">That’s your life.</span> <span id="s1522">If, we cannot keep them here; if you want to go with them, you go.</span> <span id="s1523">If you die, you die.</span> <span id="s1524">We cannot take care of you there.</span> <span id="s1525">But that’s your decision.”</span> <span id="s1526">If, so many people are dying, so one more or one less, everybody was critical at that point.</span> <span id="s1527">We were, decided that we don’t have a chance in a million to survive anyway, so only until then, they had to take care of their patients.</span> <span id="s1528">So, this doctor, who was the most honest person ever, because you can meet people, whenever you are in every situation.</span> <span id="s1529">Some doctors, they were good.</span> <span id="s1530">They weren’t bad.</span> <span id="s1531">They took some food from the patients.</span> <span id="s1532">If they had.</span> <span id="s1533">Some people gave some jewelry to these certain doctors; they were taking it.</span> <span id="s1534">We are human.</span> <span id="s1535">Because we are Jewish, they are human.</span> <span id="s1536">This man wouldn’t take a blanket for himself.</span> <span id="s1537">This man was, in that time, an angel.</span> <span id="s1538">He wanted to save lives.</span> <span id="s1539">That was his duty.</span> <span id="s1540">And he would not tolerate himself to take anything from anybody.</span> <span id="s1541">And I had friends among the nurses, and one of the little nurses said to me, “Eva, you go to Dr. Tabor.”</span> <span id="s1542">Because they named him the head, because he was so honest that they know his decision wouldn’t be altered by anything, just by just.</span> <span id="s1543">He was a just man that time.</span> <span id="s1544">And if he makes a decision, nobody questioned it, because nobody can alter his way of thinking just to do the best.</span> <span id="s1545">So I said, “O.K.” And that was the first time I stepped out of my bed, and I made my steps.</span> <span id="s1546">I couldn’t walk!</span> <span id="s1547">And I had to make myself to go.</span> <span id="s1548">And I walked up to the third floor, to the chapel.</span> <span id="s1549">And I saw this man, dead tired, laying on the marble floor, the bare marble floor, in this, in it was in early January, in the cold of January, with nothing, and sleeping a dead man’s sleep.</span> <span id="s1550">He was, he was out.</span> <span id="s1551">He was, operated on 120 people that day.</span> <span id="s1552">And he couldn’t stand it.</span> <span id="s1553">And I leaned over him and he opened his eyes.</span> <span id="s1554">And a smile came over and he said, “What is it?”</span> <span id="s1555">I..</span> <span id="s1556">.</span> <span id="s1557">had always been afraid of him, because he was very stern.</span> <span id="s1558">And he didn’t have time to talk to anybody.</span> <span id="s1559">He was, I thought, “Oh, he is so mean and he hates me.”</span> <span id="s1560">I was scared.</span> <span id="s1561">I was absolutely scared of him.</span> <span id="s1562">And I said, “Dr. Tabor, they selected Mother in the selection committee.</span> <span id="s1563">And Mother and Agi has to go tomorrow to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1564">And if they go I’ll go with them.</span> <span id="s1565">What is your decision?”</span> <span id="s1566">He said, “You go back to bed.</span> <span id="s1567">I won’t let you and your mother and your sister go there.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">JF: Mmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">EB: “You stay here.</span> <span id="s1570">And your mother stays here and your little sister stays.</span> <span id="s1571">I wouldn’t put anybody in that bed but you.</span> <span id="s1572">You offered that bed, and you are sharing with your, because of your mother and your sister, you are suffering for that.</span> <span id="s1573">I wouldn’t put another patient.</span> <span id="s1574">We are not missing anything.</span> <span id="s1575">And if they survive, you’ll have to survive.”</span> <span id="s1576">I hadn’t seen this man until 1969.</span> <span id="s1577">You know what would happen to my mother?</span> <span id="s1578">My homeroom teacher was in the hospital the same day, and her daughter, who was my classmate, who was [wore?]</span> <span id="s1579">a nurse’s hat, you know, just to save her life, and she couldn’t stand the stink and- Tape three, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">JF: This is tape three, side two of an interview with Mrs. Eva Bentley.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">EB: My homeroom teacher, and her husband, who was a rabbi and a religious teacher, [unclear] and her daughter who was my classmate, [unclear] she was passing as a nurse’s hat [unclear].</span> <span id="s1582">She was working there.</span> <span id="s1583">And she brought her parents in.</span> <span id="s1584">And they didn’t [unclear] people were sitting there all night.</span> <span id="s1585">And she just couldn’t stand the stink and the, sickness and she said, “I’m getting out of it.”</span> <span id="s1586">And she got a Schutzpass, a Swiss Schutzpass, for Swedish, and she went to this home because they had the homes which were, came under the umbrella in different countries and different embassies.</span> <span id="s1587">And she said, “I am going back, now back.”</span> <span id="s1588">She couldn’t go back there.</span> <span id="s1589">They took them to the ghetto, because they dismantled those [unclear], and everybody had to go to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1590">So she...went to the ghetto that morning.</span> <span id="s1591">And everybody who was selected to go to the ghetto that morning, that was Mother’s transport, if she would be in that selection, and I, because I would go with my mother, we would go to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1592">Now they designated a first-aid cellar for us, from the hospital, which was the first house in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1593">And that was almost the last night before the Russians liberated the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1594">All those people were killed that night, the following night.</span> <span id="s1595">In the morning we’re supposed to, when we were supposed to go to the ghetto in the morning, [tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">JF: The Arrow Cross...</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">EB: The Arrow Cross came in that night and massacred everybody in that cellar—my homeroom teacher, her husband.</span> <span id="s1598">And she asked her daughter to come with her, and she said, “No, Mommy, I can be helpful here, I don’t leave the hospital.”</span> <span id="s1599">And she went in the next morning, because that time the Russians were approaching and we already freed, the ghetto was freed before the, our part.</span> <span id="s1600">And she went in and she found her mother had slashed, and her father massacred, terrible.</span> <span id="s1601">And that would be my fate, and my mother’s and my sister’s.</span> <span id="s1602">That’s why I’m saying that man saved my life.</span> <span id="s1603">Not only when he operated on me, because he operated on me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">JF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">EB: Oh, also, but saved physically our lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">JF: You said you met him in 1969.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">EB: Yes.</span> <span id="s1608">He was a student in the Jewish Gymnasium in a different time.</span> <span id="s1609">He graduated in 1932 and, because his father, he was again, he didn’t count as a Jew because we had the Numerus Clausus in...Hungary.</span> <span id="s1610">And in medical school the Jews weren’t admitted at all.</span> <span id="s1611">Numerus Clausus in certain universities, but in medical school, no Jew was, after the First War, admitted.</span> <span id="s1612">And he was admitted because his father was a war hero.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">JF: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">EB: He died in the First War.</span> <span id="s1615">And him and his brother, his brother attended the engineering

again.</span> <span id="s1623">You said that this happened shortly before the Russians entered the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">EB: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">JF: Were you still in the hospital when they came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">EB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">JF: Can you tell me about that, about the liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">EB: It was a strange thing.</span> <span id="s1629">The ghetto was liberated first because the ghetto was undermined and the German wanted to blow up the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1630">So, the Jewish underground, which one we had some Zionists, you know the...we called them the Siserat [?]</span> <span id="s1631">because most of them they were the Jewish Zionists.</span> <span id="s1632">And they were working in the underground making the false papers and coming.</span> <span id="s1633">And basically that were, the focal point of their [unclear] that was the hospital, because the hospital was outside of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">JF: The focal point of the Jewish und-, of the Zionist underground...</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">EB: And the Jewish underground was the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">JF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">EB: Because everybody was then coming in and out and in the basement and they tried to make false papers and they...had, they changed uniforms.</span> <span id="s1638">They went in, like my cousin, who looks like an Aryan Aryan—blond, blue-eyed—he was wearing an Arrow Cross uniform, and went into the ghetto and got his parents out of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">JF: Did you know all this was going on while you were in the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">EB: We had a somehow feeling, yes, because everybody was coming in and out and all those men, and they were trying to do.</span> <span id="s1641">It was, you know, they really didn’t do it openly because you never know.</span> <span id="s1642">And because we had real Arrow Cross people, too, coming in and Gentile people too, but that was the focal point of the underground, the hospital.</span> <span id="s1643">Everything was going on there.</span> <span id="s1644">So, they liberated the ghetto first, and then they liberated us.</span> <span id="s1645">But they were coming through the ghetto, because these people, the underground, led the Russians through the ghetto, to the...other part of the town.</span> <span id="s1646">And we were at the gate of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1647">We were not in it, but we were in front of the ghetto, at the gate.</span> <span id="s1648">It was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1649">The night before, we were talking with Mother and Mother said, “Sweetheart, what do you think?</span> <span id="s1650">What’s going to happen?”</span> <span id="s1651">I said, “Mommy, at this point I don’t think, so few people ever, ever survive.</span> <span id="s1652">We are going to die.”</span> <span id="s1653">That was the point when I couldn’t keep my mother’s spirit up.</span> <span id="s1654">And I couldn’t be positive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">JF: Before

together.”</span> <span id="s1662">And by that time I didn’t know the Russians were already in the cellar.</span> <span id="s1663">And we were already free!</span> <span id="s1664">And that was just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1665">And whatever happened after, it’s not that simple, but some other time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">JF: Your father was in a labor camp during this entire time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">EB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">JF: Did you have any way of communicating with him?</span> <span id="s1669">Did you know where he was?</span></p> <p><span

again, luck has so much to do with life.</span> <span id="s1674">He, all his contemporaries were drafted much more before, earlier than he was.</span> <span id="s1675">And they were killed off.</span> <span id="s1676">He was one of the last ones when the German takeover, that, who was drafted and went in.</span> <span id="s1677">Now he was stationed in Budapest, as I told you, at the airport.</span> <span id="s1678">And then after that in another school they were stationed there.</span> <span id="s1679">They were the clearing crew, of the, after the bombs.</span> <span id="s1680">And when the Arrow, and that time it was a period when Horthy didn’t know which way he is going, so those people were relatively safer than the others because everybody was in

they...evacuated all those people.</span> <span id="s1686">That’s where Wallenberg comes in, he went on those wagons, and freed those people, and took care of them.</span> <span id="s1687">So he was taken to the western part of Hungary, the border of Austria and Hungary.</span> <span id="s1688">And from there, in March, end of March, we were already free.</span> <span id="s1689">Budapest was free.</span> <span id="s1690">But that part of the country was not.</span> <span id="s1691">He was evacuated and marched to Germany.</span> <span id="s1692">And then he was taken to Mauthausen, to the

used this as an air-raid shelter never touched anything, whatever I left, what was the most interesting thing.</span> <span id="s1727">That’s why I know that I have family in America, because I had my school books in my room furniture, my whole room furniture was there.</span> <span id="s1728">And I didn’t remove my school books from my drawers.</span> <span id="s1729">And I had, not the Megillah,

Do you want to tell...me about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">EB: You see, there were little children whose mothers had to go to the forced labor camp or this concentration camp, as I told you, from their houses.</span> <span id="s1787">My brother-in-law’s mother went under this category.</span> <span id="s1788">He was three years old that time.</span> <span id="s1789">His father was already killed in the labor camp somewhere in Russia.</span> <span id="s1790">We didn’t know he was, that time we didn’t know he was killed, but later on we found out he was already dead.</span> <span id="s1791">So his mother had to go.</span> <span id="s1792">He was three years old.</span> <span id="s1793">And they put these children in the makeshift orphanages, all those children who [were] left in the homes.</span> <span id="s1794">They gathered them together, the Jewish organization, [unclear] with the Red Cross, and...these underground, the Israeli underground, the Zionists, and they put them in different places, in houses.</span> <span id="s1795">Now the Arrow Cross knew about them.</span> <span id="s1796">After they took care of the Jewish orphanage they went to every houses where they had those little children shot.</span> <span id="s1797">This was one of the homes, and I don’t know how many hundreds of children there, and they...did shooting practices out of the children.</span> <span id="s1798">They were on the third floor, and they were throwing them down in the yard, and shooting in the air, and shooting.</span> <span id="s1799">And my little brother-in-law was among them, and they had so many dead children in a pile, and they throw him down, and then threw other children on top of him, he was protected by the others and he wasn’t harmed.</span> <span id="s1800">So after the shooting was over, and these people went away and it quieted down, he crawled out under the dead children and he started to roam the streets.</span> <span id="s1801">And, again, the Red Cross and the Jewish underground and Zionists were rummaging the streets for the survivors.</span> <span id="s1802">And they were helping.</span> <span id="s1803">And they find him walking on the street.</span> <span id="s1804">So they had the Red Cross homes.</span> <span id="s1805">He was put in those, one of those homes.</span> <span id="s1806">And after the war they couldn’t identify them, because most of them they were so young.</span> <span id="s1807">They...didn’t know their names.</span> <span id="s1808">They didn’t know their parents.</span> <span id="s1809">They didn’t know where they lived.</span> <span id="s1810">They knew something, but some of them knew but the parents didn’t come back.</span> <span id="s1811">The children without parents, without homes.</span> <span id="s1812">They were young, older, old, and they were little savages on the street.</span> <span id="s1813">They were hiding in the ruins and they were feeding for themselves and ate rats and they were little gangs.</span> <span id="s1814">Or they were in little, in homes, what the Joint put up for them.</span> <span id="s1815">All by the Red Cross now.</span> <span id="s1816">If they couldn’t find a parent, then people who wanted to take care of the children, like foster...parents, they came in and asked for children.</span> <span id="s1817">They could be Gentiles or Jews or whoever.</span> <span id="s1818">So in this particular Red Cross home came a couple of farmers, and he said, “Well, we’ve always wanted a little boy.”</span> <span id="s1819">And they selected my brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s1820">And they took him with them.</span> <span id="s1821">And his mother came back from Dachau and she was looking for her son.</span> <span id="s1822">And to research the papers it was very hard.</span> <span id="s1823">Finally she found out, she went through hell for a whole year.</span> <span id="s1824">It took her a year day and night, searching for her son.</span> <span id="s1825">Finally she came to this farmer’s place in the country.</span> <span id="s1826">She traced him.</span> <span id="s1827">And that time he was already four years old.</span> <span id="s1828">And that was in a summer day, high noon.</span> <span id="s1829">And in Hungary a high noon is a very hot time, and the farmers are usually having their main meal that time under a shade.</span> <span id="s1830">And they were sitting under a shady tree and they’re having their meal.</span> <span id="s1831">And this woman was coming across the field, walking across the field.</span> <span id="s1832">And this little boy stood up and starts screaming and running.</span> <span id="s1833">He said, “Mother!</span> <span id="s1834">Mother!</span> <span

Bentley, done on April 2nd, 1985.</span> <span id="s1851">Could you tell us a little bit about how the Jewish community organization functioned during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">EB: We had the...address, the Jewish community address, and as you know from the history of it, it has a very bad reputation, because the Hungarian Jewish community, the people tried to...please Eichmann and the Germans and the authorities.</span> <span id="s1853">And that, I don’t know if firsthand that is true or not, but it has happened that they knew about Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1854">They knew about the deportation, and they didn’t told the Jewish community, and that’s why most of the people were docile and went to their, their way to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1855">And I still, an argument about it that Hoess should have been [unclear], but I cannot judge.</span> <span id="s1856">I am not a judge.</span> <span id="s1857">I’ve just been there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">JF: What was your understanding as to why they didn’t tell?</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">EB: You know, hindsight is great.</span> <span id="s1860">That time we didn’t know that they know more what they were telling.</span> <span id="s1861">They...didn’t want to cause trouble or revolution and maybe they were naive—what I cannot believe—and they didn’t know what was happening.</span> <span id="s1862">But the history proves that most of them knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">JF: Were they doing anything during the time of the German occupation that you felt was helpful...</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">EB: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">JF: To the German people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">EB: Yes.</span> <span id="s1867">Uh, they...</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">JF: I’m sorry, to the Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">EB: Yes, as much as they could they tried to give a little assistance and food and shelter and organize the people.</span> <span id="s1870">But in the same time when they organize they organize the people to go to the labor camps and go to the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1871">So, the good things for us aside, because the bad thing is so magnified and so horrendous that we don’t remember the good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">JF: You’re talking about the cooperation with Eichmann.</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">EB: With Eichmann and with the Germans.</span> <span id="s1874">Weisheimer, Eichmann, and with the government.</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">JF: How...</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">EB: But in the same time they served a purpose, because they were the head and they...tried their own way.</span> <span id="s1877">But...they were serving the Germans.</span> <span id="s1878">They were subservients.</span> <span id="s1879">And maybe that’s the generation and the believing in law and order.</span> <span id="s1880">So it’s easy for us to judge them.</span> <span id="s1881">They were in, we don’t know how any other organization would behave under a certain government.</span> <span id="s1882">So they...tried what they thought was the best.</span> <span id="s1883">And they thought probably if they saved some, they don’t lose everybody.</span> <span id="s1884">They didn’t want to lose everybody and they tried to save some people and they...did their best, according to them.</span> <span id="s1885">If they could do better, that’s the history to judge.</span> <span id="s1886">And I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">JF: Were they involved in the Gymnasium that you were attending?</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">EB: Yes, now it belonged...</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">JF: Were they supporting it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">EB: Oh, at that time, yes, but after that it was closed.</span> <span id="s1891">It belonged to the...Jewish community.</span> <span id="s1892">It was a privately owned place and everybody was supported by...the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s1893">We had very wealthy Jews, like the, the industrial barons, textile manufacturers, the biggest iron ore manufacturers–Weiss, Manfred–mine owners, and all of them, like in here, they supported the Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">JF: Do you think that these people...</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">EB: They supported the Jewish hospitals, the Jewish...the Gymnasium, the Jewish schools, the Jewish orphanage.</span> <span id="s1896">It’s all been privately owned, and not subsidized by the government.</span></p> <p><span

No.</span> <span id="s1899">No.</span> <span id="s1900">Mr. Goldberger, who was a, the biggest textile manufacturing in central Europe and is still one of the biggest textile manufacturing compound, owned by the government now, died in Dachau, one of the...baron Weisses died.</span> <span id="s1901">Some they went to Switzerland, but really, they couldn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s1902">They went their way too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">JF: They couldn’t do anything to save themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">EB: No.</span> <span id="s1905">One of the...Baron Weiss, one of them, went to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1906">But I don’t know it’s before or...during, with money, had come to that point, with money they...tried to save some children.</span> <span id="s1907">To, the S.S. needed the money as a reserve for raw goods and for ammunition.</span> <span id="s1908">And they promised that two plane load of children will be exempted and go to Switzerland and some people.</span> <span id="s1909">Now, they, first they deported those, for money, and they deported them to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1910">And from Bergen-Belsen there was a compound.</span> <span id="s1911">And they took the children with the plane load to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1912">But the plane had the S.S. insignia on it.</span> <span id="s1913">And it was the end of the war when it happened.</span> <span id="s1914">And it was shot down by the Allies, and all the children died.</span> <span id="s1915">So the next transport—I know this firsthand because my best friend was among those children, and she was in the second transport.</span> <span id="s1916">And they were, she stayed in Bergen-Belsen because the second transport didn’t took off.</span> <span id="s1917">It was already too late for that.</span> <span id="s1918">And the first transport, I had two friends in the first transport, two school mates of mine, who died.</span></p> <p><span

safest way out, because no Jews could leave the country.</span> <span id="s1925">And the S.S. took them, like they deported them to Bergen-Belsen, and Bergen-Belsen, they had one barrack for those children.</span> <span id="s1926">And the first transport left, I think so, with 60 children, and they were shot down.</span> <span id="s1927">And some of the parents were on the plane, too.</span> <span id="s1928">I had, my physics teacher was on that plane, and her husband was an industrialist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">JF: Do you know approximately when that occurred?</span></p> <p><span

back because the S.S. right away occupied their homes.</span> <span id="s2521">If, what happened—actually, the Gestapo had their offices in their home—the Jewish homes...were the most elaborate or the richest Jews, one was taken over and became offi ces or quarters for the Gestapo or for the S.S. And my husband’s father was the head of the railroad.</span> <span id="s2522">He was a engineer and he was a man well-decorated in the First War.</span> <span id="s2523">He...should be exempt under the Jewish Nuremberg Law, but they managed, a paper came after he was already deported, his exemption papers.</span> <span id="s2524">And they had different degrees of collecting the Jews in that town, or probably in every town.</span> <span id="s2525">The very prominent Jews, like the congressman who was a Jew, my father-in-law who...was the head of the railroad and had a title—it’s “Most Honorable”; it’s equivalent with “Most Honorable”, given to him because he reached that point being a Jew—and other prominent Jews, were taken to a home, not into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2526">And they were the first ones who were put on the...wagons, of the cattle wa gons, and they went straight to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2527">The second transport, which one was from the ghetto, couldn’t go to Auschwitz because that time the railroad was bombed to Ausch witz and they were the ones who went to Vienna in Austria and they survived.</span> <span id="s2528">This group, which one was my husband’s family, they went to Auschwitz, and his mother, who was 40 years old, his grandmother was 60, his brother was 17, his father was 56 when he was taken, 57 when he came back, was taken to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2529">His mother, grandmother, and his brother never came back.</span> <span id="s2530">His mother and grandmother went to the gas chamber right away.</span> <span id="s2531">And his brother we don’t know what happened because for a while he was with his father.</span> <span id="s2532">And then he was taken to a different camp and after that we don’t know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s2533">He never came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2534">JF: And after your father-in-law was in Minsk, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s2535">EB: He said regardless he was a prisoner, but he was handled very nicely by the...Russian comparatively what the German did.</span> <span id="s2536">The Russian gave them food whatever they can.</span> <span id="s2537">They didn’t have too much either, because they...were famished in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s2538">JF: Why, what was his understanding of why he was put in another camp, and not permitted to go home?</span></p> <p><span id="s2539">EB: He was Hungarian, and the Hungarians were enemies, so he was a prisoner of war, regardless he was a Jew or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s2540">JF: So it had to do with the fact that he was Hungarian.</span></p> <p><span id="s2541">EB: Yes.</span> <span id="s2542">That was the explanation.</span> <span id="s2543">But in the same time Wallenberg wasn’t a Hun garian.</span> <span id="s2544">He was taken by the...Russian.</span> <span id="s2545">They were French, Dutch and all kind of Jews there, and non-Jews, who were taken.</span> <span id="s2546">Like the...forced labor camp people who escaped and became prisoner of...the Russian.</span> <span id="s2547">They were treated very badly the same way as the Germans.</span> <span id="s2548">They were put together with the Germans.</span> <span id="s2549">They didn’t have differential.</span></p> <p><span id="s2550">JF: They were in, prisoners along with the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2551">EB: With the Germans.</span> <span id="s2552">And they...were transferred in, now I’m not talking about my father-in-law right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2553">JF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2554">EB: I’m talking about the prisoner of war, who were, like forced labor camp Jews, the Jewish men, who were taken in wagon trains where they were caught through...Russia without food for weeks, and without any food.</span> <span id="s2555">And they died in the wagons, too.</span> <span id="s2556">So the Russian didn’t discriminate, “You are a Jew or you are a German.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2557">JF: Did your father-in-law come back from Minsk?</span></p> <p><span id="s2558">EB: Yes.</span> <span id="s2559">He came back...</span></p> <p><span id="s2560">JF: And how...</span></p> <p><span id="s2561">EB: In 1945, in September or August in 1945, and he was freed in January 16th from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2562">See he should be back in January.</span> <span id="s2563">And instead of January he came back the end of the year.</span> <span id="s2564">But he was the lucky one who came back.</span> <span id="s2565">Some never came back.</span> <span id="s2566">They were put down to mines, to copper mines, to work, or salt mines or wherever, or Siberia.</span> <span id="s2567">And they never came back.</span> <span id="s2568">We never heard of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2569">JF: Your father-in-law was not placed, then, with Germans in this specific labor camp that he was in.</span> <span id="s2570">He was not with other German prisoner of wars.</span></p> <p><span id="s2571">EB: No, no, he was with...Jews from Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s2572">JF: From Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s2573">EB: And they were treated, he said, decently.</span> <span id="s2574">Because he was a very fair man and he said that the Russian let them out from the camp during the day time.</span> <span id="s2575">They could go in the streets.</span> <span id="s2576">They didn’t work.</span> <span id="s2577">They didn’t make them work.</span> <span id="s2578">They just kept them there, and whatever food they could give them they gave them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2579">JF: What was...</span></p> <p><span id="s2580">EB: Even cigarettes sometimes.</span> <span id="s2581">And he never smoked so he got some bread for the cigarette, because he was a non-smoker.</span></p> <p><span id="s2582">JF: What was your experience with the Russians that came in to Budapest right after the liberation, your personal experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s2583">EB: It’s a mixed experience.</span> <span id="s2584">I was very happy that there weren’t Germans, and I thought I was free.</span> <span id="s2585">So, I couldn’t walk very well for a long time, because of my wounds.</span> <span id="s2586">I was lame in one leg.</span> <span id="s2587">I was pulling my leg.</span> <span id="s2588">And I had a friend of mine, my homeroom teacher’s daughter, who survived in the hospital—she was working there like a nurse’s aide—and, as I told you in the other tapes that her parents were killed in the last night of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2589">So we were very hungry, she and I. And so we went on the streets and everybody was robbing and pilfering the stores, bakery shops, everybody, because the Hungarians were under siege, you know, the city was under siege for more than six weeks, hand to hand battles between the Russians and the Germans.</span> <span id="s2590">Since, more than that, because it was January 18th when the Russian took over the ghetto, and the siege started in October.</span></p> <p><span id="s2591">JF: You were in the hospital then during the siege itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2592">EB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2593">JF: You were not...out of the hospital until after the siege had stopped and the Russians...</span></p> <p><span id="s2594">EB: Yes, until after...the 18th of January I didn’t step out of those, I couldn’t even walk, I couldn’t get out of the bed.</span> <span id="s2595">But the first thing in the, on the, when the Russian came in the next morning, her name is Yehudit, she lives in Israel.</span> <span id="s2596">Yehudit and I went on the streets from the hospital because we wanted to know if we can go back to home.</span> <span id="s2597">And so we went out, and on the streets we saw people going to pastry shops and bakeries, this is everything what is really laughable.</span> <span id="s2598">We went by a pastry shop and everybody was robbing that pastry shop from pastry.</span> <span id="s2599">And we stopped, I don’t know how the, a window was bombed out.</span> <span id="s2600">And in the rubbles we saw one big onion in the pastry shop’s window.</span> <span id="s2601">I don’t know how this big yellow onion got into that pastry shop window!</span> <span id="s2602">[laughing] And we grabbed it!</span> <span id="s2603">[laughing] You know, we didn’t go in.</span> <span id="s2604">Everybody was robbing cakes and flour...</span></p> <p><span id="s2605">JF: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2606">EB: We just got hold of that big...</span></p> <p><span id="s2607">JF: You got the onion!</span></p> <p><span id="s2608">EB: Onion!</span> <span id="s2609">[laughing]</span></p> <p><span id="s2610">JF: Aw.</span></p> <p><span id="s2611">EB: And then we went to visit a friend of mine, whose parents were Jewish but they were exempt under the Jewish law because her father lost his arm in the First War.</span> <span id="s2612">And he had the gold medal and the family was exempt under the Jewish law.</span> <span id="s2613">Exemption meant they could keep their home.</span> <span id="s2614">And they had a liquor store and they could a bar in a liquor store and they could manage it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2615">JF: So they, the people who were exempt were permitted to continue to own their property and function...</span></p> <p><span id="s2616">EB: They [unclear] yes, except the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s2617">JF: Normally.</span></p> <p><span id="s2618">EB: If the children were over 18, then they had to wear the yellow star and they had to go to a labor camp, like their son who was that time twenty, was at the labor camp, in the same labor camp as my husband.</span> <span id="s2619">So he was lucky.</span> <span id="s2620">But their daughter, my friend, was underaged, so she didn’t have to wear the yellow star.</span> <span id="s2621">And she was, I decided to take Yehudit there and visit them.</span> <span id="s2622">Maybe we can get a, to eat something in their home.</span> <span id="s2623">So we went there and they had lunch.</span> <span id="s2624">And you know, in Hungary, the lunch is the big meal time.</span> <span id="s2625">And they were seated at the table.</span> <span id="s2626">And we were looking at them and they said, “Are you hungry?</span> <span id="s2627">The bakery in the corner is giving bread out.</span> <span id="s2628">You can buy some bread there.”</span> <span id="s2629">And my girlfriend’s eyes were watery when her mother said that.</span> <span id="s2630">She started to cry and she said, “I’ll go for bread for you.”</span> <span id="s2631">And she came with us and we lined up and we got a loaf of bread and we had the onion.</span> <span id="s2632">And we were the happiest people on earth.</span> <span id="s2633">We ran back, there was a..</span> <span id="s2634">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2635">JF: You had a picnic.</span></p> <p><span id="s2636">EB: We...thought we will because Mother had that goose fat, you remember?</span> <span id="s2637">The goose fat was saved [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s2638">JF: You still had the goose fat!</span></p> <p><span

know?</span> <span id="s2646">You can preserve goose liver and goose...broiled goose, you know, broiled goose pieces in...the fat of the goose.</span> <span id="s2647">It won’t spoil.</span></p> <p><span id="s2648">JF: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2649">EB: And it was very cold.</span> <span id="s2650">We didn’t have any heat in the hospital anyway, and it was a cold winter.</span> <span id="s2651">So Mother, that’s what...saved our lives.</span> <span id="s2652">We had something to eat.</span> <span id="s2653">Now we had the bread.</span> <span id="s2654">We had a loaf of bread between Yehudit and I.</span> <span id="s2655">We had the onion.</span> <span id="s2656">And Mother had that goose liver, little tidbits, and the fat.</span> <span id="s2657">So we were...not hungry.</span> <span id="s2658">We were the happiest person in our lives.</span> <span id="s2659">We were alive.</span> <span id="s2660">We were free.</span> <span id="s2661">And we could eat!</span> <span id="s2662">[tape off then on] So...now we are free, we are going home.</span> <span id="s2663">We decided, Mother and I, and...my sister...</span></p> <p><span id="s2664">JF: This is after, the ghetto now has been liberated by the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s2665">EB: Liberated and we are liberated.</span> <span id="s2666">Now we are going home.</span> <span id="s2667">We cannot go home because in our home there is a Gentile people living in our original home.</span> <span id="s2668">So we go back to the yellow star house.</span> <span id="s2669">And my poor mother, she is carrying on her back the beddings what she took into the hospital.</span> <span id="s2670">And we left all the other things.</span> <span id="s2671">And I tried to help, and I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s2672">I was still bleed-, not bleeding but gangrenous.</span> <span id="s2673">The gangrene was still coming out of my wound.</span> <span id="s2674">And I started to walk.</span> <span id="s2675">And I just couldn’t.</span> <span id="s2676">I don’t understand.</span> <span id="s2677">I used to be always very strong, and quite athletic.</span> <span id="s2678">And for my weary body I was muscular.</span> <span id="s2679">And I just couldn’t...help.</span> <span id="s2680">So we went back to the...yellow star house and we had a little pot belly stove there.</span> <span id="s2681">We didn’t have...our wood, you know, in the cellar we always had, we had wood.</span> <span id="s2682">Mother bought wood for this pot belly stove before...I was shot and we were preparing for the winter.</span> <span id="s2683">And Mother always managed somehow, with jewelry, with a little money, with, she was always very good at it.</span> <span id="s2684">And so we went back there and we didn’t have any food, because even in the yellow star house the Arrow Cross people took over and they gave their members our place.</span> <span id="s2685">And whatever it was left there it was robbed.</span> <span id="s2686">For instance, I had my dolls there.</span> <span id="s2687">And they were cut off to bits and pieces because they thought maybe we hid some jewelry in there.</span> <span id="s2688">All my books, I had a big collection since I was very little I always collected books, and some of my father’s books were there.</span> <span id="s2689">Every thing burned.</span> <span id="s2690">All the books were burned.</span></p> <p><span id="s2691">JF: This was all the Arrow Cross’ doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2692">EB: The Arrow Cross people who got our...yellow star home.</span> <span id="s2693">You see, whatever was really valuable and good we took it out to a friend’s land, to, they had a big villa, Aryan friends.</span> <span id="s2694">And we thought it will be saved.</span> <span id="s2695">And most of the furniture was stored, as I told you, in that place, but we took one room furniture and the kitchen was furnished by us.</span> <span id="s2696">And some things were [unclear].</span> <span id="s2697">And among them my books and some of the books.</span> <span id="s2698">Because we thought when we went to the yellow star, I was always an avid reader, so was my mother, so we decided that we will survive if we have a good book.</span> <span id="s2699">So the books were very important to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2700">JF: So a lot of the books were...saved.</span> <span id="s2701">But the ones...</span></p> <p><span id="s2702">EB: We saved it, but the Arrow Cross burned it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2703">JF: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2704">EB: These people, who got our homes, and who got that clothing and everything in the yellow star house, first our home, the Gentile took over.</span> <span id="s2705">Then we went to the yellow star house.</span> <span id="s2706">And when we...had to leave the yellow star house I was shot and my mother came to the hospital, as I told you.</span> <span id="s2707">Now, the other people who lived in that compound were taken to the labor camp and every place was taken over by families.</span> <span id="s2708">The Arrow Cross gave the Jewish homes to those families.</span></p> <p><span id="s2709">JF: So the books were, had been kept at the Arrow Cross...</span></p> <p><span id="s2710">EB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2711">JF: By the...</span></p> <p><span id="s2712">EB: But this family who took over our place and...that woman who was in Dachau, who died in Dachau, and left a little baby and whose husband died in the labor camp, who was, as I told you, a certain square meter was given to us, appropriated in...the yellow star house.</span> <span id="s2713">But we were very lucky and managed it, with money that my mother and my sister and I were in one big room and this other woman was in another room.</span> <span id="s2714">So we had just two families in that apartment, which one was, a biggest privilege what you can imagine.</span> <span id="s2715">Because in one room usually was 30, 32 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2716">JF: So what happened when you found this destruction when you went back?</span></p> <p><span id="s2717">EB: My mother had to- Tape five, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s2718">JF: This is tape five, side one of an interview with Mrs. Eva Bentley on April 2nd, 1985.</span> <span id="s2719">You were talking about after the return to your yellow star house, and the Arrow Cross family that had lived there had fled, after destroying much of what you had left, much of your possessions.</span></p> <p><span id="s2720">EB: Whatever they couldn’t take with them, because they stripped the place.</span> <span id="s2721">Whatever we had there they took—food and clothing and everything whatever they could move in a hurry they took with them.</span> <span id="s2722">And whatever they couldn’t, they destroyed.</span> <span id="s2723">The doors were...cut up to pieces.</span> <span id="s2724">The books were burned.</span> <span id="s2725">And we went back home and Mother didn’t have anything to feed us with.</span> <span id="s2726">We had a neighbor of ours, a Gentile neighbor who stayed in the yellow star house because I, as I told you, several of the Gentiles who lived there originally and they were offered bigger and better homes for their homes, they didn’t took up on that because they didn’t want to move into any Jewish home which one was left.</span> <span id="s2727">And they stayed there.</span> <span id="s2728">One of our neighbor, whose apartment was bombed out half way, he had some lemon juice saved, because the Gentile people didn’t have anything to eat, too, because everything was bombed out.</span> <span id="s2729">The firms didn’t existed and...Budapest was a besieged city.</span> <span id="s2730">He gave the lemon juice to Mother to give it to us, to my sister and me.</span> <span id="s2731">And I wasn’t feeling well, and I..</span> <span id="s2732">.</span> <span id="s2733">there was a Christian doctor, a pediatrician, across the street.</span> <span id="s2734">And Mother took me there.</span> <span id="s2735">And he took my temperature, and my temperature was 104.</span> <span id="s2736">And we thought that was the gangrene.</span> <span id="s2737">And that was not.</span> <span id="s2738">I had the measles.</span></p> <p><span id="s2739">JF: It just didn’t stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s2740">EB: So I had the measles and Mother had to feed me, and us.</span> <span id="s2741">So what she did, she went back to this partner of ours, who had that store from my father, and who were gentiles, and we thought they were decent people because most of our belongings were hidden in their villa, in the country.</span> <span id="s2742">And Mother went there and said, “Look, we are free.</span> <span id="s2743">We survived.</span> <span id="s2744">Could you give us something to eat?”</span> <span id="s2745">And then the man looked and said, “You are free now.</span> <span id="s2746">This is your world.</span> <span id="s2747">You get something to eat wherever you want,” and threw Mother out.</span> <span id="s2748">So what the people did in Budapest, there were the dead horses on the streets, and they were cutting it up and taking it in to eat.</span> <span id="s2749">And they...find some frozen potatoes.</span> <span id="s2750">And that was, everybody [unclear], so Mother wouldn’t lower herself to cut that meat—she couldn’t eat that no matter how hungry we were—but she found some of the frozen potatoes.</span> <span id="s2751">And this friend whom I mentioned, the Jewish friend of mine whose parents were exempted, when we find that...bread and onion, in the same place they were giving out frozen potatoes.</span> <span id="s2752">And I brought the potatoes—I have forgotten, my mother had the potatoes.</span> <span id="s2753">Now the frozen potatoes are the worst thing whatever anybody can taste!</span> <span id="s2754">So Mother didn’t know what to do, and that, she had somebody, this man was a supplier of my father at the store.</span> <span id="s2755">And he came, he was a Jewish man.</span> <span id="s2756">He found out that we are alive and he came to the yellow star house.</span> <span id="s2757">And Mother said, “You look so well-fed.</span> <span id="s2758">How did you survive?”</span> <span id="s2759">And he said he was hiding but he knows sources where we can find some, where Mother can buy some flour and some dried peas, yellow peas.</span> <span id="s2760">And, so Mother gave Father’s cigarette case, a gold cigarette case, and his insignia ring, signet ring, and we got five kilo of frozen yellow beans.</span> <span id="s2761">No, the yellow beans didn’t came from there, the peas.</span> <span id="s2762">We got...flour, some sugar, and...something else.</span> <span id="s2763">I don’t know what else, for this gold.</span> <span id="s2764">Half a..</span> <span id="s2765">.</span> <span id="s2766">kilo of flour and a little sugar and something, a bread or something.</span> <span id="s2767">And then Mother gave, because we had two rooms in that apartment then, some people were evacuated from another place where they find a dead bomb.</span> <span id="s2768">And they weren’t sure if the whole building will go up so they had to be relocated.</span> <span id="s2769">So these people were looking for a room.</span> <span id="s2770">And they came because we had the two rooms.</span> <span id="s2771">And Mother said, “O.K., I’ll give the room if you give me some food.”</span> <span id="s2772">So they gave us...five kilo of frozen peas.</span> <span id="s2773">Since then I cannot stand peas!</span> <span id="s2774">So, and water was very scarce also, because the water were shut off in Hungary anyway.</span> <span id="s2775">They were, the water mains were bombed out and so Mother somehow managed the water and she was cooking the peas all the time!</span> <span id="s2776">And I was sick.</span> <span id="s2777">Well, I put my sister beside my bed but she didn’t get the measles.</span> <span id="s2778">To get the measles and get it over with!</span></p> <p><span id="s2779">JF: You had mentioned before that there was some mistreatment by the Russian troops.</span></p> <p><span id="s2780">EB: Now let me tell you what happened, if we are going back to the Russians.</span> <span id="s2781">So you see, if you have this kind of disease like measles...scarlet fever, what is a catchy disease, you put out a red paper on your door, and you stated, “Don’t...come into this house because...”</span></p> <p><span id="s2782">JF: Like a quarantine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2783">EB: It’s under quarantine now.</span> <span id="s2784">At that time we didn’t have the official yellow papers, but we find in one of my book a yellow pa-, a red page.</span> <span id="s2785">And we put out that page and not to let anybody come in.</span> <span id="s2786">And well a Russian soldier came in and I was so happy.</span> <span id="s2787">I thought, “Oh, if a Russian soldier comes in we will have some food!”</span> <span id="s2788">Because the first troop was very nice.</span> <span id="s2789">The first troop which went, came in, they were the fighting troops, not the occupational troops.</span> <span id="s2790">And they were just passing by.</span> <span id="s2791">They gave on the streets bread and whatever they can, food, they shared with the people.</span> <span id="s2792">So they...in the beginning, in the first step, the first day or the first couple days they had a good reputation that they are giving food to people.</span> <span id="s2793">But the occupational group were terrible.</span> <span id="s2794">They raped and robbed and they were absolutely terrifying.</span> <span id="s2795">So this was the other group already because we were home.</span> <span id="s2796">And he came in.</span> <span id="s2797">He came in not to give, but to take.</span> <span id="s2798">But he saw me and he saw the terrible circumstances, and he ran out of the door!</span> <span id="s2799">[chuckling] After I recouped, you

refused to hid us, and we went to her and we told her that we are here.</span> <span id="s2801">And she made a very good dinner for us.</span> <span id="s2802">A very good dinner means she shared with us what she had, and she explained to us why she couldn’t hid us.</span> <span id="s2803">She was already having in her place four Jewish people.</span> <span id="s2804">And we came and we were very visible...front of the neighbors.</span> <span id="s2805">So she was scared that she is going to risk the four lives if she is going to take us in.</span> <span id="s2806">So she had to make that decision.</span> <span id="s2807">And I understood it.</span> <span id="s2808">Mother couldn’t forgive her.</span> <span id="s2809">But I really understood her, her position.</span> <span

place.</span> <span id="s2830">So she couldn’t risk, we didn’t come secretly enough.</span> <span id="s2831">So, it wasn’t arranged.</span> <span id="s2832">So she had to refuse us openly, and very loudly, to protect the others and herself.</span> <span id="s2833">Because she could be killed too.</span> <span id="s2834">So...she was in a very bad...compromising situation, that she explained to

went on the street and a Russian officer, a Captain, came over to me and said, “Come in to this house.”</span> <span id="s2837">And two Russian soldiers surrounded me.</span> <span id="s2838">And she started to run and I couldn’t run because I couldn’t walk properly.</span> <span id="s2839">And I wasn’t afraid of the Russians, so I went into this house, which was a headquarter for the Russian Army for this particular platoon.</span> <span id="s2840">And it was a bombed out house, and they had their headquarters in the cellar, in the air-raid shelters.</span> <span id="s2841">And the tenants of

room there were other Russian officers, and women, but the women were Hungarians.</span> <span id="s2854">So I asked one of the Hungarian women what’s going on, what’s happening, why he took me in.</span> <span id="s2855">I said, “He says I am...a spy and I’m a Jewish girl.”</span> <span id="s2856">I said, “I, look, I cannot walk, and I was shot down by the Germans.</span> <span

sitting there and everybody was still in the cellars because some bombs didn’t go off.</span> <span id="s2876">The fighting was going on in Buda.</span> <span id="s2877">That was Pest, one side of the

asked about her and this nun and the priest said, “Oh, they were killed because of those Jews.”</span> <span id="s2888">You see, they were always talking openly to me because at that time I find my good coat.</span> <span id="s2889">I didn’t have the yellow star on my coat any more, on that coat I never had, because that was my good coat and I hid it in the cellar in the downstairs and I find a

<span id="s3092">He never wanted to live anywhere else, just in Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s3093">JF: He had been in...</span></p> <p><span id="s3094">EB: Concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span

now it’s too late because she had, they have two elderly parents and the situation is such that they cannot leave and as it will be possible, but now when you are getting older it’s very hard to establish yourself if you are 40.</span> <span id="s3114">That’s much harder.</span> <span id="s3115">She is, regrets that now, but it’s too late.</span> <span id="s3116">Because you cannot get a job or you cannot change; it’s very hard to change life after 40.</span> <span id="s3117">And you have to have it within.</span> <span id="s3118">You have to be cut out to be an immigrant.</span> <span id="s3119">You have to know, “I left everything behind me,” because after that, under the circumstances we had a very, very good life, a beautiful home.</span></p> <p><span id="s3120">JF: You’re

<p><span id="s3126">JF: You said that you had known your husband before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s3127">EB: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3128">JF: And you were not, you did not date until after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s3129">EB: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3130">JF: Can you...speak a little bit about what it was like to be a teenager during that time, how it...affected your life as you look back on it now?</span></p> <p><span id="s3131">EB: You were not a teenager.</span> <span id="s3132">You were an adult.</span> <span id="s3133">You had responsibilities.</span> <span id="s3134">You always had responsibilities.</span> <span id="s3135">But, in any circumstances...youth prevails.</span> <span id="s3136">If you had a piece of chocolate, you had to decide, we had rationing.</span> <span id="s3137">It’s nine, twelve decagram of, after the war, twelve decagram of sugar per person, for a month.</span> <span id="s3138">I don’t remember how much was the flour.</span> <span id="s3139">And everything was rationed.</span> <span id="s3140">And you have to line up for hours to get it even there.</span> <span id="s3141">And on the black market if you had a little jewelry, because the inflation was rampant, you can get some eggs or powdered eggs or a little chocolate.</span> <span id="s3142">And I was very lucky because I had relatives in America and they sent me CARE packages.</span> <span id="s3143">So I can change it for...shoes, because all my clothing was robbed.</span> <span id="s3144">These people, who- Tape five, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s3145">JF: This is tape five, side two, of an interview with Mrs. Eva Bentley, on April 2nd, 1985.</span> <span id="s3146">You were speaking about the robbery.</span></p> <p><span id="s3147">EB: After that, when we got, finally, we got our original home back, it had a slight bomb damage.</span> <span id="s3148">So we didn’t have our toilet.</span> <span id="s3149">The porcelain of the toilets and the bathroom were shattered to pieces.</span> <span id="s3150">The windows were shattered to pieces, because of the fighting.</span> <span id="s3151">And glass was non-existent in that time so you had to paper your windows.</span> <span id="s3152">To get it, just one toilet replaced was a big thing.</span> <span id="s3153">Finally we managed that.</span> <span id="s3154">Our furniture, some of our furniture was saved in that cellar, that we got back what we never expected.</span> <span id="s3155">Nothing was touched and...in the safe places where our really valuables were hidden, we never got back not even our clothing or fur coats or my...or silvers and art objects and whatever, because those people, who didn’t need it, that people who had the villa, said they were robbed by the peasants in that countryside and they didn’t give a single thing back to us.</span> <span id="s3156">And they resented the Jews.</span> <span id="s3157">The people who took over our possessions resented us that we are alive.</span> <span id="s3158">So most of them, they looked at us, you didn’t dare to ask back your things, and even if you did you wouldn’t get it back.</span> <span id="s3159">Most of the people, were some decent people, and most of them were not.</span></p> <p><span id="s3160">JF: So you did not get back what you stored in the cellar.</span></p> <p><span id="s3161">EB: No, not from those people, no.</span> <span id="s3162">We got back what we put it in the open air raid shelter in that carpenter’s or, upholstery man, who worked for my father, who had his own workshop.</span> <span id="s3163">And we put everything in that workshop—my room furniture and all our furniture.</span> <span id="s3164">Most of our furniture was there, and in the yellow star house.</span> <span id="s3165">Nobody touched that.</span> <span id="s3166">It was an open air raid shelter.</span> <span id="s3167">In that house the people were so decent they wouldn’t touch anything, not a leaf of my school books were missing.</span></p> <p><span id="s3168">JF: Did you find after the war that there was any increased antisemitism in Hungary?</span></p> <p><span id="s3169">EB: Certain parts, yes, in the countries.</span> <span id="s3170">Very few people came back from the camps, but who came back they...went back.</span> <span id="s3171">They belonged there.</span> <span id="s3172">They belonged there for centuries.</span> <span id="s3173">They went back to their homes which was...no existent.</span> <span id="s3174">The family, they were, everybody ran back to their own place because they were waiting for their loved ones.</span> <span id="s3175">They were waiting for their family to return.</span> <span id="s3176">And they thought if they are there, the others will come back.</span> <span id="s3177">They were waiting for them.</span> <span id="s3178">Most of the homes were ransacked, or other people lived there.</span> <span id="s3179">And ninety per cent of the population resented the Jews who came back.</span> <span id="s3180">There was a saying going that more came back than went.</span> <span id="s3181">This is just like the Zonder [phonetic] case now, and all the other cases.</span> <span id="s3182">They said...they revived from the ashes like the Phoenix and...they multiplied.</span> <span id="s3183">When a village, when you had 5,000 Jew and one came back, then they multiplied.</span> <span id="s3184">Well in certain parts they started pogroms.</span> <span id="s3185">In 1945 and ‘46 they had pogroms in the country.</span> <span id="s3186">So most of the Jews left the country and they came to Budapest, because it was no use to wait any more.</span> <span id="s3187">Nobody would come back.</span> <span id="s3188">They realized that.</span> <span id="s3189">But it took a while to sunk in that people are not coming back.</span></p> <p><span id="s3190">JF: Was there increased antisemitism in Budapest?</span> <span id="s3191">Or had it not changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s3192">EB: Not changed.</span> <span id="s3193">Not changed.</span> <span id="s3194">They...were not open because they were afraid of the Russians.</span> <span id="s3195">Because that time, and in the government were...Jews in the government, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s3196">They didn’t say they were Jews; they were Communists.</span> <span id="s3197">But some, some Jews were Communists, or Communist Jews, or whatever, but they were Communists.</span> <span id="s3198">They didn’t associated with the Jews and they...were not Jewish, but they were Jewish origin, and therefore they were Jews.</span> <span id="s3199">And...you know, now it was open.</span> <span id="s3200">The universities were open for Jews.</span> <span id="s3201">The Numerus Clausus didn’t exist, and most of us who survived and wanted to go to, could go to universities, enroll to universities.</span> <span id="s3202">And the older people could get jobs in the government.</span> <span id="s3203">Some of the attorneys became judges, the doctors practiced and everything went back to...a democratic stage because it was democracy, so-called democracy.</span> <span id="s3204">And antisemitism was punishable by jail.</span> <span id="s3205">And they had their war criminal trials, the Hungarian war criminal trials, going on, on and on.</span> <span id="s3206">The atrocities and the trials, whoever were caught, were tried.</span> <span id="s3207">Some of them were executed and hung.</span> <span id="s3208">So, it was an atmosphere when it was not healthy to express antisemitism, especially not in Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s3209">JF: What do you think kept you going through all that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s3210">EB: God.</span> <span id="s3211">Believing in God.</span> <span id="s3212">And God helped me and made me a goose [unclear], brought me back from...death.</span> <span id="s3213">The only thing is when you are alone, and when you have trauma and when you have hardship, and when your life is at stake you realize you are all alone, and whatever happens it’s God’s will.</span> <span id="s3214">And God is the only thing, for me, God was the only thing what made me survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s3215">JF: Is there anything else that you would like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s3216">EB: Not right now, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s3217">Lots of other things, but right now it’s just...</span></p> <p><span id="s3218">JF: O.K.
