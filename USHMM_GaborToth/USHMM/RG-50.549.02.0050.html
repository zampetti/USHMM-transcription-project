Let’s start just with sort of a brief overview of your experiences during the war, before we move on to -- to after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Answer: Yeah.</span> <span id="s17">I was born, and went to school in Holland, in The Hague, and in August of 1942, my mother and my brother and I went into hiding.</span> <span id="s18">My father had already died, in 1936.</span> <span id="s19">We had gotten a place to hide through the Jesuit, of the Catholic church, who were working in the Resistance, and they found a place to hide in The Hague, with a widow who took in Jews in order to -- not necessary help Jews, but to help her to go to heaven.</span> <span id="s20">That particular hiding place did not work out, because the -- the lady was so in -- exceedingly anxious that her sons, who knew about that we were hiding there, told us that we needed to leave.</span> <span id="s21">They did tell us that we were found out, but that was not really the truth.</span> <span id="s22">So then we went from The Hague, again to the Catholic church, we found another -- not we found, but th-the Underground found another place in Delft with a Catholic family with seven children in a very small, little whole downstairs, where it was the barber shop and the beauty parlor, and we were upstairs, and we stayed there.</span> <span id="s23">We were supposed to be staying there temporarily because it was not a proper -- not proper -- it’s not a good place to have three more people in the house, and especially three Jews, because there were seven children, it was very dangerous for the whole family.</span> <span id="s24">We did stay there until the end of the war, because my mother always told them that she did not want to be separated from her children.</span> <span id="s25">So we stayed there until the war was over in 1945, May fifth, 1945.</span> <span id="s26">We --</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Wh-Who was it -- Who made up your family?</span> <span id="s28">How many -- it was your mother, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: My mother, my older brother, and myself.</span> <span id="s30">My father had already died.</span> <span id="s31">My grandparents, who had immigrated from Germany, and my uncle, who had immigrated from Germany in the 30’s, were hiding in the eastern part of Holland, but we did not know where they were hiding.</span> <span id="s32">There was a little bit of contact between them and us, through a third party, who supplied us with ident -- false identity cards.</span> <span id="s33">So -- But we really didn’t know where they wer -- we didn’t know where anybody was, really.</span> <span id="s34">We didn’t know that my uncle and aunt, and their little daughter had gone to Westerbork, and then were transported to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s35">My uncle went to Sobibór, we didn’t know where anybody was.</span> <span id="s36">I mean, we only found that out later.</span> <span id="s37">So that was really my immediate family, my mother, my brother, and I, and my mother didn’t want to be separated from her children.</span> <span id="s38">My brother, at the beginning of the war in 1940, was 14, and I was 11.</span> <span id="s39">So, anything else that you would like to know about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Well, during that time, how much information could you get when you were -- when you were in hiding?</span> <span id="s41">I mean, did you have any sense of what was going on either in the world, or how dangerous it was for you at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: I found out later that -- I wasn’t aware, I was kind of numb during the war.</span> <span id="s43">I found out later that my brother would go in one -- in the only toilet of the -- of the house, and apparently the neighbors had a new radio, and they were listening to -- illegally to -- it was called ra -- Radio Oranga, Radio Orange [indecipherable] was -- it came from England, and he knew -- he -- he would listen very carefully what they had to say, what was going on.</span> <span id="s44">He did hear a little bit what’s going on.</span> <span id="s45">We knew that the invasion of Normandy, for instance, we were very happy, because we thought we would be liberated quickly.</span> <span id="s46">And we knew that they -- all they had -- all -- came all the way to Ireland, I mean Holland, and -- I mean, we -- we heard some stuff, but we didn’t know really the -- the -- the -- the -- the scale of the -- of the war, and the destruction of the Jews.</span> <span id="s47">We would hear planes coming over, going -- the German planes going to England, and the English planes going to Germany to bomb [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s48">We -- I was really pretty numb, that’s really what it was, so I was -- I just was kind of waiting for it to be over, and took a long, long, long time.</span> <span id="s49">You have nothing to do, [indecipherable] happen.</span> <span id="s50">Nothing to do, so days were very long, and nothing happened, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Was that one of the hardest, the boredom?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: No, th-the -- the hardest thing was really the fear.</span> <span id="s53">Boredom was -- somehow you -- you know, as a g -- as a girl I would -- could -- if there was some food, we could peel potatoes, I could knit, I could read.</span> <span id="s54">We were keenly aware that we were very much in the way, that we endangered the people we were hiding with, that there was not enough food.</span> <span id="s55">That we had -- somehow there was a terribly -- disturbance in the family, that my hiding mother was extremely anxious, that my hiding father was the one who wanted this, who did this, with all his heart.</span> <span id="s56">So we -- we -- we kind of picked up constantly these -- these -- these cues, I would say, from everyone.</span> <span id="s57">The children were angry, the little ones were -- the young ones in -- in that family were not -- you know, they -- they couldn’t play the way they would play before, or talk, because they had to keep this a secret that we were there.</span> <span id="s58">A family would visit, we had to quickly go upstairs to the bedrooms, and then be very quiet.</span> <span id="s59">So it was a very tense situation.</span> <span id="s60">I -- Boredom was -- I would almost say secondary [indecipherable] you know, it was -- it was really the fear that any of us would do the wrong thing, and then it would leak out that we were hiding there, and then we would be sh -- sent to the camps, and al -- and of course, my hiding father would be also picked up and sent to the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s61">We didn’t quite know that, but we knew it was extremely dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: You often mentioned in the videotaped interview about Walter?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Walter?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Walter, Walter Verhane -- see, in Holland, that -- the -- the young man, who between 16, and whatever, older, 26 or so, were sent to the camps -- not the camps, to the -- they had to go work camps, yes, work camps.</span> <span id="s66">And he was -- he was the one who was called up to go to one of those work camps in -- in -- in Germany.</span> <span id="s67">He decided to go and not to go into hiding.</span> <span id="s68">And luckily he came back.</span> <span id="s69">That was one of the most horrendous things for us, because we knew -- we always suspected he had gone there because we were in the house, and that he really couldn’t go into hiding, because, well, we needed to find another place, they would be looking for him.</span> <span id="s70">And after the war, we -- we always heard that he suffered terribly.</span> <span id="s71">It was very difficult to think about, always, that he went there because of us, and I never realized how long he was there, he was there from 1943 to ’45.</span> <span id="s72">I thought he was there maybe for a half year.</span> <span id="s73">So many, many years are -- many, many decades after the war, I wrote him a letter, and asked him exactly why he had decided to go to a work camp, and then he wrote back that he -- it was adventurous -- an adventure for him.</span> <span id="s74">I don’t know if he was completely truthful.</span> <span id="s75">He was a very religious man and he believed that he -- that he would be saved, that he would not get hurt or killed.</span> <span id="s76">He had a terrible time there.</span> <span id="s77">He was -- He was imprisoned there, I found out later.</span> <span id="s78">I -- I mean, I -- I -- I probably heard this all in 1945, but somehow I pushed it away, and he -- I found out later that he had been in a work camp, and then he said something that -- against the German nation, and somebody revealed that to -- I don't know to whom, and he was eventually taken to prison in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Did you -- So, did you continue a correspondence with him [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Yeah, well, I go regularly to Holland, I mean, regularly every three years, four years, five years, and we always meet up.</span> <span id="s81">And he has done -- which is very interesting, he has made contact with other people who were in there, in [indecipherable] were in the same prison, in the same workcamp, and they have a reunion, so they have done quite, you know, similar thing what we have done, kind of come out, and talked to others who were in the same situation, and he even wrote about it, and I have his -- his story.</span> <span id="s82">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: What was the name of his story?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s85">I re -- can’t remember.</span> <span id="s86">I [indecipherable] can’t remember.</span> <span id="s87">I don’t know if he gave it a name yet, or -- but, you know, it’s just a personal memoir.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: So what was the relationship like between your family and your hiding family?</span> <span id="s89">It was [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: During the time, it was very -- it -- very tense at times.</span> <span id="s91">After the war, we would -- we still -- we always go there, although my -- my hiding parents are dead now, but I -- when I’m in Holland, I always visit with them.</span> <span id="s92">My brother always sends them -- he’s in Israel -- he sends, around Christmas [indecipherable] he sends oranges, or -- or grapefruits from Israel.</span> <span id="s93">We call at Christmas, and we call at birthday, to the er -- just the oldest d-daughter, not all -- not all seven of them, but one or two are -- have -- one -- one of the sons is very angry with us, because they thought that my mother was very rich, that she had a lot of money, and that she didn’t give enough money for our hiding to her parents.</span> <span id="s94">My mother was very poor, she was a widow.</span> <span id="s95">The -- The other childs, that’s the one, two, three, fourth oldest, and there is another one who also doesn’t feel so comfortable because they think that, you know, he -- we should have given more money.</span> <span id="s96">We didn’t -- My mother didn’t have money, and they were paid very little through the underground, or through my uncle, who was -- he was -- as a fact, he was in hiding in -- in -- in the east of Holland, and I think they sent like, only some money, cause he owned a factory.</span> <span id="s97">With the others, it’s -- it’s -- it’s a pretty good relationship.</span> <span id="s98">We always have to be thankful for them because we -- now the children, you know, they -- they are aware that they suffered, too, while we were in hiding there, and the interesting thing is this happened very recently, I got -- for our 50th anniv -- wedding anniversary, we got a letter from the third oldest child, who is really -- I would almost say obsessed with the war.</span> <span id="s99">He reads everything, he talks second World War, and -- all the time, and he now has written -- he wanted us to read this during our party, but we didn’t because we had to translate this, and it wasn’t quite appropriate.</span> <span id="s100">But in the -- in this particular letter that he -- was sent the 10th of May, which was kind of interesting, this -- the war started in Holland, 10th of May of 1999, he sent this letter, and there was a paragraph in there which said that the children of rescuers were not recognized, especially not in Holland.</span> <span id="s101">And it just so happened that I know a psychologist in Holland, who had just written a book about the -- the selection, and dislocation of the children of rescuers.</span> <span id="s102">So, what I did, I put them in contact with each other, so that this man, who is in his 70’s now, not well, can talk to this woman who just wrote the book.</span> <span id="s103">She is -- Her name is Luma Abbas-Amden, she’s a psychologist, she has written quite a few books about rescuers.</span> <span id="s104">She was in hiding herself, was found, and went to a concentration camp, so she has -- she is very, very, very familiar with -- with subject, has done quite a bit of resear -- research.</span> <span id="s105">So, I hope it will help this particular man, Donald Prafana is his name.</span> <span id="s106">Maybe if he speaks to this Luma Abbas-Amden, maybe he gets a little bit of validation, and a little bit of relief.</span> <span id="s107">So that’s kind of right now my relationship with -- actually the -- only now with the children of my rescue family.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Let’s -- I guess let’s -- let’s go on to after the -- after the war, after liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: After liberation, that was very strange.</span> <span id="s110">We -- We had to leave there, but we had no place to go, we were in hiding in Delft, and we were -- returned from The Hague.</span> <span id="s111">So my mother found a place for me to stay with a -- actually, it was the hiding family of a great aunt of mine, who was an ice skater, I can’t remember for how long, until she found an apartment, you know, she was given an apartment in -- in -- in The Hague.</span> <span id="s112">I -- I can’t tell you how long, or -- how long I was there.</span> <span id="s113">The -- The only thing I remember that, it was a very strange family, and that for the first time, I saw somebody who used opium.</span> <span id="s114">Th--Th-The father in that -- in that household [indecipherable] can’t tell you, it’s the only thing I remember.</span> <span id="s115">He was addicted.</span> <span id="s116">That was like in May, June, of 1945.</span> <span id="s117">My mother found it very necessary that I would go back to school, and my brother went -- they tried to find work for him.</span> <span id="s118">He didn’t want to go to school.</span> <span id="s119">He went and -- He went on hashava [indecipherable] from Israel.</span> <span id="s120">I don’t know exactly what the dates were when he went.</span> <span id="s121">So my mother and I lived in the apartment, which was -- she had gotten apartment in a very bad neighborhood of The Hague, and eventually we moved to a better neighborhood.</span> <span id="s122">I did go to school.</span> <span id="s123">I went -- My mother felt that it was necessary that I would go to school with girls my age, 16 or 17 years old.</span> <span id="s124">So I went -- She got me -- and this is remarkable -- she got me into a school for home economics, which was kind of an -- kind of after high school you went there, and at night I went to evening high school.</span> <span id="s125">And then we found the Zionist organization, and that’s what we did in our free time, and that’s where we found back -- actually we didn’t find back, we found other people that were in hiding that came back -- back from -- from the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s126">I didn’t find back my friends, my old friends from before the war, except one.</span> <span id="s127">So that was really my life after -- after the war.</span> <span id="s128">My mother tried to make a living, didn’t succeed very well.</span> <span id="s129">She didn’t have specific skills, she was -- I think she was selling some perfume, and stuff to stores, and then eventually she found a job as a manager in a clothing -- in clothing stores.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: Was everyone at that time trying to -- just go back to normal life?</span> <span id="s131">I mean, did -- did -- did it -- you know, like it could possibly be like [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: We tried desperately to go back to normal life, but it was very difficult, because all around us, everything was different.</span> <span id="s133">You know, you always be -- you -- you know, just me going to school for home economics with girls who had gone [indecipherable] to school -- to high school.</span> <span id="s134">I didn’t fit in, you know?</span> <span id="s135">In the evening school, the evening high school, I didn’t fit in either.</span> <span id="s136">So, it was kind of an -- we tried desperately to kind of live a normal life, but I think in Holland, we couldn’t really do it.</span> <span id="s137">There were too many -- it -- it -- it was just so -- it was such a destruction of the Jews that w-we constantly were reminded of it, even if you don’t want just to really face it on, [indecipherable] see it, but we were constantly reminded of it.</span> <span id="s138">And my uncle, and my aunt, and my -- my cousins were -- were killed in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s139">So, I didn’t have family.</span> <span id="s140">My -- Luckily, my grandparents, and my uncles also survived the war.</span> <span id="s141">They were just caught maybe two days before the liberation, and they didn’t know what to do with two old people.</span> <span id="s142">And my uncle, they put him in prison, and then the Germans left, and so my -- then -- then they were freed.</span> <span id="s143">But it was just at the last moment that they were caught, and -- and like I said, the Germans didn’t quite know what to do with them because the war was almost over.</span> <span id="s144">I-It -- What I remember, the best part of our lives was then the Zionist organization where we all came together with those who survived, and had weekends of -- you know, like camp -- like studying, and we danced, and we sang, and we talked every night.</span> <span id="s145">We all wanted to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s146">My brother was called up to go to Indonesia, because that’s -- in 1946, they were going to fight to keep Indonesia at that time, the Dutch East Indies independent.</span> <span id="s147">And the Jewish -- many of the Jewish survivors, young men, didn’t go, and they went on illegal alleyah to -- to Israel.</span> <span id="s148">And my -- So my brother left -- I guess it was in 19 -- maybe 1946, or so -- earlier than that, to southern France, and -- and then went, I don’t know, maybe stayed there.</span> <span id="s149">The whole trip was like three months, and then he went on one of those boats illegally to Israel, and he was -- he was on the last boat that [indecipherable] was caught, but went all the way to Israel, and went into an -- in a camp.</span> <span id="s150">He didn’t go -- The next boat went to Cyprus [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s151">So he has been, since 1946 [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s152">So -- So my mother and I were left.</span> <span id="s153">I met Ed in the -- in Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s154">He left in -- Yeah, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: What was it about the Zionist organization that -- what did that do for -- for you, and -- and the other [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: We didn’t talk about it, wh-what it did for us was we -- we knew that we had the same experience.</span> <span id="s157">We didn’t talk about it, but we knew, we -- it felt comfortable.</span> <span id="s158">It didn’t feel comfortable with the non-Jewish youngsters because they had -- didn’t have such a disruption in their lives as we had had, and they didn’t have so many losses in their lives as we had had.</span> <span id="s159">They said they suffered terribly in -- in -- in the war, but it -- they didn’t quite understand what happened to us, that when you -- when we came out of the war, we couldn’t go home, because there was no home any more.</span> <span id="s160">Our -- To go back [indecipherable] that it seems that as soon as we went into hiding, they emptied our apartment, and all the furniture, everything was gone, in no time.</span> <span id="s161">You know, they just emptied it out.</span> <span id="s162">So, we didn’t have a place to go back to, so to be with them was wonderful, wonderful.</span> <span id="s163">And then the other thing that was wonderful, we had the Israeli soldiers, who were in the British brigade, came also to Holland, and they represented healthy young men who had fought in the second World War, and were not persecuted, and so they were like symbols of health, and -- and -- and was wonderful.</span> <span id="s164">And many of our friends went with them back to Israel.</span> <span id="s165">Some got married, they fell in love, got married, some married [indecipherable] you know, just to bring somebody into Israel without being -- I forgot what [indecipherable] in -- in the -- something that they were allowed to go into as well, so our friends also disappeared, you know, like my brother, he went illegally to Israel, so even in those times, people went -- left us.</span> <span id="s166">They kind of, you know they went to Israel, and -- and then I, like I said, I met Ed.</span> <span id="s167">Ed left in June of 1947, and we didn’t quite know if we were going to get married, or not, but we were going to kind of see if -- the separation, if it lasted through writing.</span> <span id="s168">I completed my schools there, and I -- we got a visa for United States because -- very quickly, because my mother was German born, and the quota for German born people was very low, compared to the Dutch, and I was underage, too, so I left for the United States in January of ’49, which was quite something, because we really didn’t want to go to the United States, really wanted to go to Israel, but I want to get married to Ed, so I had to go first to United States, before I could go to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: But you knew -- you -- you [indecipherable] United States, but you -- you didn’t think you [indecipherable] want to stay in Holland?</span> <span id="s170">Is that --</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: There was really very little in Holland for us.</span> <span id="s172">Looking back now, it -- it didn’t feel comfortable any more.</span> <span id="s173">There were very few Jews at that time.</span> <span id="s174">I don’t know what -- I don’t think we saw a future in Holland.</span> <span id="s175">Course you have to remember, the Zionists, so there was only a future in Israel.</span> <span id="s176">You didn’t even want to even consider that there was a future in -- in -- in Holland.</span> <span id="s177">And we would just go to United States to kind of go there, and then go to Israel, which we did in ’51.</span> <span id="s178">The period in -- in -- in -- here in United States, between ’49 -- for me from ’49 until ’51 was kind of strange.</span> <span id="s179">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s180">We got married six weeks after I came to the States, it was the smallest wedding you can imagine, there were -- you know, there were five people at this ceremony, with the justice of peace, and seven people at the lunch.</span> <span id="s181">Course we didn’t have -- everybody was poor, and we didn’t have family.</span> <span id="s182">Ed went back to work, he had a job there, I went with him to -- it was in Ossening, New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: What did you think when you got to the United States, [indecipherable] strange?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Strange, well, because I never really wanted to go, probably, and it was -- was kind of another disruption, and we really didn’t want to stay, so it was like a vacation here, but not quite, because we had to live a daily life, and -- and again, I had a hard time connecting.</span> <span id="s185">I realize that now, I didn’t realize that then.</span> <span id="s186">I wasn’t like the other American kids who were 19 years old and had gotten married, I di -- hadn’t gone to school here.</span> <span id="s187">I had a strong accent, I didn’t know the ways of you -- you know the ways of the Americans.</span> <span id="s188">So it -- it felt as if I didn’t belong, which I -- I didn’t belong, really.</span> <span id="s189">I eventually went to work [indecipherable] to make some money, go to Israel.</span> <span id="s190">That felt a little better because I -- I worked, and my days were structured.</span> <span id="s191">I didn’t work there very long.</span> <span id="s192">I was a filing clerk, I knew foreign geography, so I had a special assignment.</span> <span id="s193">Was -- I think at that time I always wanted to go to Israel, that’s [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s194">Also, my friends had gone there, you know, fr-friends from Holland.</span> <span id="s195">We went in 1951 to Israel, because Ed was about to be called up for the Korean war, and so he left before he got enlisted for the Korean war.</span> <span id="s196">I -- We arrived in late January of ’51 in Israel, we went to the kibbutz where my brother was, and I felt really very good there.</span> <span id="s197">I had my first child was born in December of ’51, it was for me a very good time [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s198">I was a worker, a mother, and a member of the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s199">I had voting rights, which was very unusual as a woman.</span> <span id="s200">I fitted in.</span> <span id="s201">There were other people from Holland, which, you know, we had the little group of Dutch people, not that we always spoke Dutch, I don’t think so, but we had the same background, so I was really appreciated as a -- as a worker, I was -- worked with babies, and with the toddlers, and I had my own group, and that was -- that was a good time.</span> <span id="s202">Our child got sick, she had tuberculosis of the lymph nodes, here, lymph, and that was a horrible time, she was in the hospital for six months, and then she needed to be separated still from other people.</span> <span id="s203">That was horrendous.</span> <span id="s204">Ed was not very happy in -- in the kibbutz, it was very difficult for him to kind of fit in that -- in that kind of rigid structure.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: This is an continuation of the interview with Carla -- Carla Lessing, and this is tape one, side B.</span> <span id="s207">You were just talking about in the kibbutz that Ed was --</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: -- less happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Ed was less happy.</span> <span id="s211">He had a hard time with -- like I said, rigid structure.</span> <span id="s212">Also, at that time, there was very -- what can I say, little chance for anybody to do any -- anything different than what you were assigned to do.</span> <span id="s213">To get, for instance, go to Haifa to take a painting course, I as -- I remember was somebody want to do that, that had to go through many, many people, it had to be okayed by the general meeting.</span> <span id="s214">I mean, everything was -- nowadays you could do it easily, you could go and study, but in those days it was a -- more of the pioneer times.</span> <span id="s215">So we decided to -- Ed decided really, and I kind of agreed, to go back to the United States for a couple of years, because E-Ed I think, might have been one of the very few people who had not one relative in Israel.</span> <span id="s216">I had, besides my brother and my sister-in-law, I me -- they had one child at that time, I had an uncle, a maternal uncle and aunt, and a cousin in Israel.</span> <span id="s217">So I had a little bit of family in Israel, but he had none.</span> <span id="s218">So that was a difficult period because we went back, and that, of course, in those days, was very, very bad that you go back to the United States.</span> <span id="s219">You were kind of a deserter.</span> <span id="s220">And we couldn’t go back to the States, because my daughter had had tuberculosis, we could go back to Holland.</span> <span id="s221">So we decided -- we couldn’t enter the United States because she had had tuberculosis, we decided to go to Holland.</span> <span id="s222">And we stayed for one year in Holland, she was then healthy enough to go.</span> <span id="s223">The American embassy let us go, gave us a visa.</span> <span id="s224">The year in Holland, and that was in 1955 - ’56, was kind of a vacation for us.</span> <span id="s225">We went to Holland knowing that we’re not going to stay, we kind of enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s226">Ed went to work, I took care of our daughter.</span> <span id="s227">We had some old friends there, it was familiar, we spoke the language.</span> <span id="s228">And we knew it was only going to be a short period of time.</span> <span id="s229">So we arrived here in the United States in October of ’56.</span> <span id="s230">Let’s see, Ed had an -- h-his grandfather lived in Amsterdam, so we had a little bit of family in Holland when we were there.</span> <span id="s231">We arrived October ’56, in the United States, again.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: At that point, were you thinking that maybe you would get back to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: Yeah, we were going to go back to Israel in -- after a few years.</span> <span id="s234">I -- I -- I didn’t really want to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s235">That never happened.</span> <span id="s236">He started -- Ed found a job here where -- in the neighborhood where we lived, in Dobb’s Ferry.</span> <span id="s237">My daughter went to school, went to kindergarten and Dan was born in ’58.</span> <span id="s238">Ed went to evening school, to Pratt Institute.</span> <span id="s239">So, we kind of led this normal family life, where the husband g-goes to work, and he went to school at night, and I took care of the children, and -- and we tried to live kind of an -- a normal life, as Holocaust survivors.</span> <span id="s240">It was more normal than when we did not have children, because you know, you have to -- you have children, you have more contact with the other people, because the -- like my daughter went to kindergarten, and we met some other people whose children went to kindergarten, or she brought girlfriends home, and I met the parents, and so that was more often a normal life, although it was a difficult life, cause Ed was away a lot, going to school, and then that he had a lot of homework and so on.</span> <span id="s241">And we didn’t have a lot of money, we had very little money.</span> <span id="s242">That time I see as -- it was kind of a good time, having th-the children, and having contact with other people.</span> <span id="s243">We then moved from Dobb’s Ferry, actually to here.</span> <span id="s244">That was in 1963, Ed had just graduated from Pratt Institute, and my daughter went to junior high, and our son went to kindergarten here.</span> <span id="s245">And we were not involved at all with survivors, except my whole family.</span> <span id="s246">My mother was a -- is a -- you know, was a survivor, she w-worked in New York City, my in-laws were survivors, they lived in Springfield, Massachusetts.</span> <span id="s247">My -- My two brothers-in-law were, you know, they -- they went to college.</span> <span id="s248">Like I said, my children were surrounded by survivors, they grew up with survivors, that’s -- was their family.</span> <span id="s249">I went to college too, in 1967, to community college, Westchester Community College, completed that, went to Mercy College, the Catholic College right near here, completed my Bachelor’s degree.</span> <span id="s250">Trying to catch up, because I really wanted to do something, but I didn’t have the degrees.</span> <span id="s251">Before that, I was an assistant nursery school teacher.</span> <span id="s252">I worked part time when Dan was five years old.</span> <span id="s253">So I worked from, he was five, ’63 to I went to -- full time to Columbia School of Social Work in s -- I worked for 10 years, ’73 I went there.</span> <span id="s254">So I worked for 10 years as an assistant nursery school teacher, because I didn’t have a degree.</span> <span id="s255">That was nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Had you known for a long time that you wanted to go back and get an education, and the degrees?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s258">Actually -- Ash -- Ed pushed me, said “Why don’t you go to school?”</span> <span id="s259">And so I did, and I really enjoyed going to school, enjoyed very much going to social work school, although again, it was kind of -- I don’t think there was any survivor in my class.</span> <span id="s260">There were lots of young people who had gone to Ivy League schools, and I realized that my education was far less solid than their education, that my papers were not very well written.</span> <span id="s261">But at that time, I was very lucky, Columbia Unis -- University School of Social Work had never ax -- never had accepted ex -- very, very few older people.</span> <span id="s262">And when I applied, they had -- they had to accept older people, so I was accepted, with some other older people.</span> <span id="s263">I was already in my 40’s.</span> <span id="s264">So I was lucky at that time.</span> <span id="s265">Social work school was interesting, because I was placed in -- my first internship was in an Protestant foster care agency, and there was a woman there who was, I thought that she was a little anti-Semitic, and -- well, a lot anti-Semitic, and which happened, I would almost say to be true.</span> <span id="s266">She -- The -- I was in the student unit, and there were two Orthodox Jewish student -- social work students, and one was taking off all the holidays, and she was kind of punished for that, she eventually had to leave.</span> <span id="s267">And there were other things that happened that were kind of what I felt was anti-Semitic, and I feel very -- I felt very uncomfortable, and was about to quit, but I said, “I can’t.</span> <span id="s268">I -- I need to get a social work degree.</span> <span id="s269">I must -- I must stay and -- and -- and conquer this.”</span> <span id="s270">And I did, in a very -- it was, I felt, a very hostile environment.</span> <span id="s271">I finished the first year, but tha-that really was -- was very hard on me.</span> <span id="s272">The second year, luckily, I was placed in an -- in another place where there -- I had a Jewish supervisor, so she couldn’t be anti-Semitic.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Well, at that time, how much of your identity had to do with being Jewish, or being a survivor?</span> <span id="s274">I know you said that you didn’t -- didn’t have many survivor friends, you didn’t really know, sort of, you know, you -- there wasn’t a sort of community.</span> <span id="s275">How much was it part of your identity at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: I think I wasn’t aware of it, that I -- it -- it was always there.</span> <span id="s277">I was always different, like I was saying to you, when I went to social work school, and all these young -- young s -- young men, women, who had gone to the very good schools.</span> <span id="s278">I mean, I had nothing -- and I was older.</span> <span id="s279">I had nothing in common with them.</span> <span id="s280">Even the ones who were maybe in their late 20’s and early 30’s had -- I don’t think there was anyone who had gone through -- through what I had gone through.</span> <span id="s281">No [indecipherable] interest, somebody would say, you know, where you come from, I said from Holland, and okay so, interesting, I like Holland, I like Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s282">They would say to me, “People are friendly in Holland?”</span> <span id="s283">And you know, that was about it.</span> <span id="s284">People were not really interested, as I recall.</span> <span id="s285">I might also have given them messages that I didn’t want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s286">So, it wasn’t really -- it was a -- as you say, how much was my identi -- I wasn’t so much aware of it, but it was always there.</span> <span id="s287">I always felt different.</span> <span id="s288">And if people were asking, and -- about maybe you know, where were you in the war, and in hiding, I didn’t want to talk about it, because it felt uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s289">It felt uncomfortable because -- and it -- over and over and over again, I noticed that when I started to talk about it, people became very serious, and some people kind of looked at me, and they became sad when I was talking about it.</span> <span id="s290">And I felt I inflicted pain on them, rather than not -- not inflict pain.</span> <span id="s291">That’s really what I always saw when I would talk about it, and you know, when I would say, you know.</span> <span id="s292">If somebody would say to -- how -- “What happened to you when you were a teenager?”</span> <span id="s293">You know, “Were you allowed to wear silk stockings?”</span> <span id="s294">I mean, when I was a teenager, I was in hiding.</span> <span id="s295">I mean, or you know, it was such -- it was funny bizarre, if you know [indecipherable] these questions.</span> <span id="s296">I was glad to have socks, you know?</span> <span id="s297">So, how could I explain this to them, that you know, or that the main thing was that you know, in the morning that there was a piece of bread with maybe a little bit marmalade on it.</span> <span id="s298">That was -- That was wonderful, but going out --</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Tell me about within your family, with -- with your kids, and with your husband Ed, did -- you know, did you have conversations about --</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: About --</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: Like I said, it was always there.</span> <span id="s303">I can’t recall.</span> <span id="s304">I spoke less about it.</span> <span id="s305">When I took my daughter in 19 -- in -- when was it, 1976, how old was she then?</span> <span id="s306">Yeah, 1976 to -- to Israel, and then later on to Holland, and introduced her to my rescuers.</span> <span id="s307">I mean, there was always something going on, but it wasn’t very open, you know?</span> <span id="s308">I introduced my daughter to my -- actually when we were in Holland the first time, she knew already my rescuers, so -- and then we went again in ’76, we again mes -- met my rescuers.</span> <span id="s309">We t -- also took our son to Israel, and to -- to Holland, and all -- France.</span> <span id="s310">He also met my rescuers.</span> <span id="s311">So it -- it was always there, but it wasn’t -- we didn’t a -- they never asked, tell me now from the beginning, you know, what happened.</span> <span id="s312">There were little funny stories sometimes, that we talked about.</span> <span id="s313">The interesting thing is our son spoke at our anniversary party, and he kind of said that when he was a teenager, he realized that his parents were different from other parents.</span> <span id="s314">Something -- He didn’t realize when he was a kid, but he realized that we didn’t know a lot about baseball, or all these -- foo -- or football.</span> <span id="s315">He didn’t realize that, but later on he realized that we had a different history than his par -- than the parents of his American friends.</span> <span id="s316">So it was there, always, with our children, because not only that, my mother-in-law had been in Bergen-Belsen, and my father-in-law always kind of protected her, because she had been in Bergen-Belsen, she had suffered more than us.</span> <span id="s317">My father-in-law, and my brothers-in-law, and Ed were in hiding.</span> <span id="s318">My mother-in-law had suffered more than an-anyone else, so it was always there, it was kind of there, and -- but not a whole lot of -- talked about.</span> <span id="s319">The kids knew, and it -- it -- it was there, yes.</span> <span id="s320">You know, everybody had an accent, to start out with.</span> <span id="s321">You know, my -- my mother, my mother-in-law, my father-in-law, not my younger brothers-in-law.</span> <span id="s322">S -- He -- They knew they were children of immigrants, and -- and they were n -- interesting if -- is that my son’s best friend was a -- I don’t know exactly when his father came, his father was an immigrant.</span> <span id="s323">I don’t know if his father came in late 30’s or early 40’s.</span> <span id="s324">Father was originally born in Russia, went to France, and came here wh -- I don’t know if he was a survivor, but maybe a refugee.</span> <span id="s325">My daughter’s very best friend father escaped from Poland, came here the United States.</span> <span id="s326">I don’t know ex -- he probably was a refugee.</span> <span id="s327">And so there is something that they got connected up with people who had a similar background.</span> <span id="s328">They didn’t quite know, I mean, what it was, they just kind of discovered it later, that this was the -- the attraction, or the connection that they had with -- with their friends.</span> <span id="s329">My daughter, later on, when she moved up to -- near Peekskill, across the road was another family, a young family, and th -- and she was a daughter of a hol -- of hol -- two Holocaust survivors.</span> <span id="s330">Best friends still, today.</span> <span id="s331">So something is, you know, they get connected with people who have a similar family history.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: And when did that start to happen for you?</span> <span id="s333">When did you start to become more of a community of survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Actually, in the early -- in the early 80 -- actually, probably late 70’s, or early 80’s, I become more aware that I was different, that I had been in hiding, and there must be a lot of people who were in h -- had been in hiding, right around here, but I couldn’t get to them, and since I was a social worker, and was a group -- also a group worker, I said, I -- I should maybe get this support group together.</span> <span id="s335">And what I did was I called the Dutch consulate, and I knew that other Dutch Jewish immigrants were in -- had been registered there.</span> <span id="s336">And so -- And luckily, the woman I spoke to was a social worker, so she knew what I was talking about.</span> <span id="s337">And I ask her if I could send -- if she would send a letter from me to people she knew who had been in the war in Holland, Jewish people who had been in war in Holland, and if they would then contact me, maybe we could meet.</span> <span id="s338">And so I started a support group, I think it was in 1982, of Dutch Holocaust survivors who had been in hiding.</span> <span id="s339">And the difficulty was that I th -- that we came from New York City, Westchester county, New Jersey -- I had k-kind of asked her to send letters to the me -- metropolitan area.</span> <span id="s340">And we met the first time was kind of an interesting [indecipherable] maybe 20 people in -- in New York City.</span> <span id="s341">We met, and there were older people who had been in hiding, and younger ones, like people who had been in hiding when they were in their 20’s.</span> <span id="s342">And one man said immediately, he said, “You know, we don’t need a group, we know who we are, but you youngsters, you were children and teenagers, you didn’t ha -- you really didn’t have an identity.</span> <span id="s343">You suffered more than we did, because we had an identity.”</span> <span id="s344">And he wasn’t so wrong, but I couldn’t quite understand what this was all about.</span> <span id="s345">And so we met another two years with the people who were younger, because the older people said you know, that we don’t want the group, and so on.</span> <span id="s346">We had this -- I had this support group with younger people who were children and teenagers in the war.</span> <span id="s347">And that was very interesting, only difficult -- we had a difficult time to find a place to meet, and -- and that kind of -- like I said, it was two years, that was until 1984.</span> <span id="s348">And so we had -- I ha -- I realized that y -- I found people I had something in common with.</span> <span id="s349">I think what -- maybe what I’m not talking about is that we really kind of led a so-called normal social life here, in -- in resh -- here in Hastings.</span> <span id="s350">You know, we went out, we had friends, we had dinner parties, but it -- it -- plus we were always a little different.</span> <span id="s351">It wasn’t that we were completely isolated from -- from -- you know, from our neighbors, or the parents of our friends, or friends we had made on our own.</span> <span id="s352">But it wasn’t like -- we didn’t quite belong, it -- I can tell you, we were at the dinner party, and people had invited some friends, and there were like a couple of couples, and there were two couples who didn’t know each other, and then they found out that they grew up on you know, in the same neighborhood in the Bronx, and all of a sudden, they had such a strong connection, even, to you know, I don’t know which one it was, Public PS whatever, and do you know that, you know, this one, and do you know that one, and what did you play in the street, stickball, and you know, we didn’t do this, whatever they played.</span> <span id="s353">And I realized, I never can meet anybody who I went to school with.</span> <span id="s354">So these kind of things did happen, and I felt very kind of isolated, and when the -- when do I ever meet somebody I went to school with?</span> <span id="s355">So, I guess what I wanted to say to you is we kind of led an -- an -- a normal social life here, but felt different, because we had gone through the war.</span> <span id="s356">When we -- When I had the s-support group of Dutch Hidden Children, we had some connection, I had some connection.</span> <span id="s357">And in the meantime, I had become a Social Worker, and I was working as a Social Worker, and -- which was -- I -- I -- I loved my work, and -- but I didn’t have the same background as they had, although, you know, I was very well integrated in my, you know, professional community, of where I worked, at work, you know, there was -- I -- I -- I felt pretty -- pretty comfortable there.</span> <span id="s358">Then, in ni -- 1980 -- 1990, we did our interview in -- in -- in Washington, and it’s a very complicated story how we -- how they -- how we found them, and how they found us.</span> <span id="s359">We did go for a weekend to Washingt -- to be int -- to Washington to be interviewed, and I forgot ex -- was a terribly rainy day, and it wasn’t in the museum yet, because the museum wasn’t there yet, it was somewhere else in the studio.</span> <span id="s360">And I remember that I watched -- watched Ed on a monitor, but not in the same room, and he watched me on a monitor, and we were completely wiped out after we had told the whole story.</span> <span id="s361">It was really from -- you probably saw -- you saw the video, so it was from early years, and then into -- into the war years.</span> <span id="s362">And we were absolutely emotionally exhausted.</span> <span id="s363">And that was really the very first time that I had told my whole story.</span> <span id="s364">I -- I even now get, you know, very moved about it, and I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s365">So that was in 1990.</span> <span id="s366">At the same time -- at the same -- around that time, one of my colleagues gave me an -- he said, “You know, you might be,” -- I had spoken with him, I guess, about my background.</span> <span id="s367">He gave me an announcement of an -- of a conference in -- in New York City, about the psycho-his -- the psycho-history association gave an -- an -- an -- an -- an -- an conference for children of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s368">And it was -- he said, “You might be interested.”</span> <span id="s369">So, I said, “Yeah, I might be interested to do that.”</span> <span id="s370">So I went there, I took a day off, I went to that seminar, and there was a whole row of people there sitting behind a table, and -- and I was there, and I -- you know, somebody was going to listen to all these papers they were going to present.</span> <span id="s371">And I listened to the papers they were presenting there all about -- they were very professional and they had done a lot of research on children of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s372">And all I heard was kids who had been in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s373">And I, at one time I wanted to ask -- I ask a question to these professional people, was -- one was Judith Kastneberg, and some others, Eva Fogelman, and some others, and I ask a question, if they had done any research on children who ha -- children of the Holocaust who had been in hiding.</span> <span id="s374">And they said no, they hadn’t, they don’t have any data on that.</span> <span id="s375">And somebody in the back heard my question, and came over to me, and she says, “You have been in hiding?”</span> <span id="s376">And I said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s377">“You know, we are planning a conference for Holocaust survivors who had been in hiding, or children who had -- Holocaust survivors who had been in hiding, are you interested?”</span> <span id="s378">And I said, “Yes, I’m interested.”</span> <span id="s379">So, we exchanged telephone numbers, and she said, and there’s a meeting whenever, to -- in one week or two week.</span> <span id="s380">I went to that first meet -- for me that first meeting, of children -- wh-which was -- which was later called Hidden Children of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s381">And they p -- were planning a conference from the Memorial Day weekend of ’91.</span> <span id="s382">And so I started to work with them, and I said, “You know, I’m a social worker, I can plan workshops.”</span> <span id="s383">And so I got connected to this group of people who all were -- had been in hiding, and -- and wherever, Poland, France, Belgium, not one from Holland.</span> <span id="s384">And we started to work on this conference, which was very intense, and regular, you know, meetings, and planning, and shouting, and arguing, and -- and was very interesting.</span> <span id="s385">And I started my work, getting workshop leaders together, I got -- you know, there were lots of people who had been in hiding, who were in the mental health profession, so I had no problem finding psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, in this country, or overseas, or in Holland, or in England, or in Israel, I mean there were lots of them.</span> <span id="s386">So I began my work with the Hidden Children, and in a ki -- in a sense, I found my community.</span> <span id="s387">I -- I did things I had never done before.</span> <span id="s388">I didn’t know anything about how to organize workshops, but I did.</span> <span id="s389">I -- I -- You know, we made all kinds of decisions about -- about the conference, how confidential it should be, who should -- what we -- we -- we planned workshops, we had to give names, you know, we had to find out what was -- what would be appropriate workshop for people who had been in hiding as children.</span> <span id="s390">And we came up with all kinds of -- you know, we got some consultants, there’s a psychiatrist in -- in Vancouver, who was a hidi -- had been in hiding as a child, who had been very involved in child survivors of the Holocaust, so we -- we contacted him, and we -- we got all the names for the workshops, and -- and titles for the workshops, really.</span> <span id="s391">We had to read up on it, you know, like abandonment, trust, you know, relationships, all these problems of -- of people having because of the Holocaust, and the experiences they went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: What was that -- What was that like to all of a sudden look at these issues in such an intellectual way, rather than just from your own, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: From my own exp -- oh, it was wonderful to do it in that way.</span> <span id="s394">Was great, I mean, I -- well, don’t forget, I have been in psychotherapy -- I ha -- in -- in therapy since ni -- I was in therapy already since 1979.</span> <span id="s395">1970, I had been in therapy, so I mean, I could look into -- intellectually in -- in a way that -- cause I had my -- you know, I had done some work in therapy.</span> <span id="s396">There was -- I think what happened that you felt kind of a little control, and a little power, to do it like that, you know.</span> <span id="s397">It wasn’t that easy when people talked about it, you know, when other people talked about how they were abandoned by their mother, when their mother waved them goodbye, or when they were placed in a convent, you know, I mean that -- that wasn’t easy to kind of listen to.</span> <span id="s398">But to plan it, wonderful.</span> <span id="s399">I still -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: This is a continuation of the interview with Carla Lessing, and this is tape two, side A. And you were just -- actually, I want to backtrack just a little bit --</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: -- from where you were before, when you -- you said you did the first video interview, and that was the first time that you really told your whole story , sort of [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: Chronologically, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: And -- And I wonder if you just could talk about that a little bit more, what that was like to begin to see that experience as a -- as a story?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: You know, you talked about how was it intellectually, you know, you can do all these workshops, you know, that -- the titles of the workshops, and you can talk about abandonment, and all this kind of stuff, and the -- the interesting thing is that when I have written a -- a paper about the vanished culture of Holocaust survivors, and I was just going to be published this summer, and I write about it, that there are other therapies for Holocaust survivors, other than individual and group therapy.</span> <span id="s406">There -- Such as giving a testimony in a chronological order, not only that you’re going to validated, but somebody is listening, and that your -- for whatever hours it is, to your story, rather than to just a brief segment, and -- but that you are being validated, that you go through it, that it is your story, that -- and not only I say that it is, you know, therapeutically very important for anyone to tell their whole story, chronologically, other professionals, I mean I -- it’s not my inve -- you know, I didn’t find that out, I -- I read that over and over again, from other professionals.</span> <span id="s407">It is -- I didn’t realize that it was so important.</span> <span id="s408">Not that I’m watching my video, I never look at it, I -- you know, but it’s there, and we gave it to our children, as a document.</span> <span id="s409">And you can see I get -- every time [indecipherable] and I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s410">Because I have kept it -- You know, one of the workshops we have, keeping -- keeping a secret, I -- I actually did the workshop, keeping -- keeping a secret, and this is what we really have done, because we wanted to lead a normal life.</span> <span id="s411">And we succeeded.</span> <span id="s412">You know, we had -- we had a family, we had children, we went to the PTA meetings, we went -- we went on vacations with our children, but there was so much else.</span> <span id="s413">So, I think that when I did this interview, in a sense, for the first time somebody listened, and asked me questions.</span> <span id="s414">Like I said, I was -- I s -- I was -- I was validated, it was -- it appeared to be a very important document.</span> <span id="s415">And when I so casually said, you know, they take a little s -- you know, a little piece out of, then put it on the -- I wasn’t pleased with what they took out at the museum, but it’s there, and -- and you know, when my -- my -- one of my daughter’s friends went to the museum, and she said, “I saw your mother on the -- you know, on th -- on the -- on the video.”</span> <span id="s416">Or -- And somebody else said, “I looked for you on the video.”</span> <span id="s417">Something happened, something -- and like I said, something -- the story that I kept hidden all these years is now out in the open.</span> <span id="s418">So, I think that’s important.</span> <span id="s419">It’s -- It seems to be more important than writing it down, because when I -- when I wrote my paper, or -- or when I spoke, you know at some conferences about it, it isn’t the same.</span> <span id="s420">It’s not that I’m talking about myself in the paper, but it’s about Holocaust survivors and their losses, and their -- the -- the terrible harm that it has done to people who have been in the Holocaust emotionally, and how people have continuously to suffer, some more, some less, and you know, s -- most of us every day think about the Holocaust in -- in a very -- sometimes just a minute, you know, or -- or sometimes longer, but there’s always a reminder, something.</span> <span id="s421">There’s always in your life a reminder of the -- those years that we were in hiding, or even before.</span> <span id="s422">See, you must have seen in my video, that when I was in Germany with my grandparents, I already was persecuted there in a s -- in a sense, because I couldn’t -- like [indecipherable] and my grandfather said, “Oh, you may not speak loudly, you may -- don’t -- don’t draw any attention to yourself.”</span> <span id="s423">And I saw -- you know, I saw the SS already marching around.</span> <span id="s424">So I grew up with -- for a long time since 1936 until 1945.</span> <span id="s425">So I -- My -- My -- My whole life until 1945 was the Holocaust really, you know?</span> <span id="s426">So when it is -- when I gathered -- when -- you were asking about the video, I think it was very important for me, and that I had a -- like I said, it’s been -- it’s stored away, and I don’t think of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: [indecipherable] just to know it’s there?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: No, I actually -- maybe to know that it’s there.</span> <span id="s429">I don’t know what’s going to happen to it when I’m not here any more, but it’s there.</span> <span id="s430">And -- And -- And there are so many [indecipherable] I don’t know how important -- it’s important for my family, my countrymen.</span> <span id="s431">We were a -- a -- I don’t know if you know, we were also interviewed by Jane Marks, who published the book, “Hidden Children: Secret Survivors of the Holocaust.”</span> <span id="s432">I don’t know if you know that.</span> <span id="s433">And our stories is in that book, and -- and people read our story.</span> <span id="s434">It’s -- It wasn’t so intense as the one in the -- you know, in 1990.</span> <span id="s435">This was after the conferences she did this.</span> <span id="s436">Actually, in February of ’91, I was interviewed by New York Magazine, and I also told my story there, and it was published in the New York Magazine, with five others who were in hiding.</span> <span id="s437">That wasn’t as important to me as the -- as the video.</span> <span id="s438">You know, it’s -- it’s -- I’m in a magazine, you know, so -- and my story is in there, so people read it.</span> <span id="s439">It didn’t have the depth of it, you know?</span> <span id="s440">Because he edited it, of course, a lot, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: [indecipherable] the whole story from beginning to end?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Now I don’t know.</span> <span id="s443">I -- I don’t -- I don’t know exactly what it is.</span> <span id="s444">I -- I guess I don’t want to minimize this, but I guess the video makes it more real, because I’m there, I’m talking.</span> <span id="s445">But it is printed, it’s kind of I have given it away, you know?</span> <span id="s446">And -- And the person who interviewed me, and edited it, it becomes more her story.</span> <span id="s447">I don’t know, I -- I did something with it that I don’t know I want -- I don’t know what I did with it.</span> <span id="s448">It’s really what -- what -- what this video did for me.</span> <span id="s449">Is there anything else that you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Well, a couple other things just in terms of how, you know, as you look back on your experiences, and how it shaped who you’ve become now, in terms of things like, let’s talk about religion, first off.</span> <span id="s451">I know that in your video interview you say, one thing that I thought was very interesting, about how proud you were to wear a yellow star, and to be Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Not Jewish as a religious person, Jewish as [indecipherable] people.</span> <span id="s455">One experience I remember is that when I was in hiding in the second -- with the second family, maybe a year into that, so let’s say that 19 - 1943 - 1944, at one time I realized I don’t understand that I -- I, or any -- or my mother, my brother, had to go through this.</span> <span id="s456">Cause we were kind of innocent people, we didn’t harm anybody.</span> <span id="s457">And if there was a god, why -- why did He do this?</span> <span id="s458">Why did He do this to us, and to the other Jews?</span> <span id="s459">And in particularly there was round -- when we -- we -- before the war, there was a Jewish family around the corner, they had two very small children, babies, and they -- somehow we knew that they were not in hiding, I don’t know why, but that they were shipped -- that they went to -- to the camps, and I just could remember these little girls, and [indecipherable] what happened to them, and -- and you know, that they would not sleep in their own beds, and they would be somewhere in -- in Westerbork, and I don’t know what would happen to them, we didn’t quite know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s460">These little kids, you know?</span> <span id="s461">Horrible, when I think about it.</span> <span id="s462">So I -- I -- At the time when I was in hiding, I think about [indecipherable] of God.</span> <span id="s463">Why, why did He put us here?</span> <span id="s464">I mean, in hiding, we afraid every day for your life, and for the other people’s lives.</span> <span id="s465">So, I kind of said, I -- I don’t es -- I don’t believe there is a God.</span> <span id="s466">And I still don’t -- I mean, I’m still struggling with this in a sense, because I don’t know how this all happened around me.</span> <span id="s467">But we are not religious.</span> <span id="s468">We celebrate Hanukah, and Pesach, and Rosh Hashanah, mo-more as a -- as a tradition, and as ee -- having a Jewish identity, not necessarily religious identity.</span> <span id="s469">And we were also [indecipherable], so we got kind of an -- a different identity.</span> <span id="s470">When you go to Israel, you -- you don’t need to be religious to be Jewish.</span> <span id="s471">So, our children were not Bar Mitzvahed, and Bat Mitzvahed, we have never belonged to -- to a temple, we are not affiliated.</span> <span id="s472">But when my mother -- before my mother died, I went to a - to the temple down here, it’s a Reform temple, went to the rabbi, if he wanted to do a service, and he said yes.</span> <span id="s473">And when my mother died, I went down there, and he did the service -- graveside service, you know?</span> <span id="s474">So there is some -- I think it is more -- my Jewishness is more connected to tradition, and to the Jewish people, rather than to religion.</span> <span id="s475">I went a little bit to Hebrew school in Holland, but that was not a very good experience, because my mother sent us to shul on the holidays, and she usually didn’t go, and -- and it was very boring, and it was all in Hebrew, and we didn’t understand anything, and -- and -- you know, the men were there, and the women were upstairs, and it was not a good experience.</span> <span id="s476">So, I guess you get the picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: How about in terms of your [indecipherable] family, and -- you -- you talked a little bit today about the importance of having, you said, a normal life.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s479">I think what we all -- most of us who went through the war wanted to lead a normal life, which meant getting married, and having children, although there are many -- quite a few hidden children who never got married because they’re -- they [indecipherable] had a terrible hard time with relationships.</span> <span id="s480">With -- I got married when I was 19, and -- and I think that’s the most important thing, to have a family lead so called a normal life, have -- our -- both our children got married, they both have two children.</span> <span id="s481">It’s amazing.</span> <span id="s482">I mean, that -- that this happened after we were not supposed to be here.</span> <span id="s483">So when -- when we had our anniversary, and yo-you know, months ago, there were our children and our grandchildren.</span> <span id="s484">Unbelievable, you know?</span> <span id="s485">So I think that’s -- th-the -- the accomplishment that we -- I’m most proud of.</span> <span id="s486">And they seem to -- a little -- I’m -- our children are affected by our Holocaust experience, they seem to be managing quite well.</span> <span id="s487">My daughter is married for 23 years.</span> <span id="s488">Our son is married for 10 years, more than 10 years.</span> <span id="s489">So somehow we have instilled in our children that family is important.</span> <span id="s490">They’re good parents, they are extremely good parents, sometimes a little too permissive, but they’re good parents, they love their children very much.</span> <span id="s491">And you see it every day, you know?</span> <span id="s492">They -- So, I think that that’s my proudest accomplishment.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Is there anything else that you would want to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: To what?</span> <span id="s495">To family?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: To everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s498">Oh, the -- you want to know a little bit?</span> <span id="s499">How much more do we have?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: We -- We have enough time.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Well, the -- the -- the mo -- the other important thing is that -- I was telling you about working on the Hidden Child conference, and that we did have the conference, and it was an incredible success.</span> <span id="s502">We had -- We had expected 300 - 400 people, there was 1600 people and we didn’t know what to do, the people in the workshops, that were like workshops -- 75 people [indecipherable] you know, the workshops [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s503">But it was such a success, and it changed many people’s lives, including my husband’s, which you probably will hear on tape.</span> <span id="s504">It changed because people found each other, connected with each other, and what we did after the conference, we started support groups, and I’m still running a support group here in Westchester county.</span> <span id="s505">We just had a meeting yesterday.</span> <span id="s506">So that’s from August of ’91 until now, is eight years, we run -- once a month we have a meeting.</span> <span id="s507">It’s not always easy, but we do have a meeting, and I have been working since then for the Hidden Child Foundation, which is the organization, and in the last few years since I retired from the clinic, and I only working part time at night, private practice, I am working with Holocaust -- needy Holocaust survivors.</span> <span id="s508">What I’m doing is trying to help them connect with resources, financial or psychological resources, so that they don’t continue to suffer unnecessarily.</span> <span id="s509">And that keeps me quite busy.</span> <span id="s510">I go once a week to New York City, and I work with -- I -- with agencies, or with the Holocaust survivors.</span> <span id="s511">They don’t [indecipherable] to have been in hiding, anyone -- anyone who was in concentration camp, or child of Holocaust survivors who are needy for whatever, psychological services, or financial services, I will connect them up with whatever is available.</span> <span id="s512">So, that fills kind of, my life.</span> <span id="s513">This is not all, you know, because I s-spend about two -- two and a half days in my private practice.</span> <span id="s514">I have my family, whenever they want to come over [indecipherable] we always there.</span> <span id="s515">But it is a major part of my life to be involved in Holocaust survivors, and their -- their needs, or just maybe a party or an -- an -- like we had yesterday a brunch, where people get together and connect, because that’s really one of the most important things for the survivors, to connect with others.</span> <span id="s516">So -- Because, for instance, with hiding, we understand what it means -- when I talk to somebody else who has been in hiding, I know what it means to be -- have been in hiding, and have your schooling interrupted, your family life interrupted, your friendships interrupted, everything interrupted, I never was normal again after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: What -- What is it about you and your husband that have led you both to become so involved in this way, where others may -- may not?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: Well, Ed wasn’t involved in the planning of the conference.</span> <span id="s519">I did -- I kind of dragged him along.</span> <span id="s520">And then he got involved very much when -- with the sh -- with the Shoah Foundation, when he started to do the interviews, he got very involved, which is only I think the last three years or so.</span> <span id="s521">I don’t know -- I am involved because I think I can contribute.</span> <span id="s522">It’s my community.</span> <span id="s523">Although socially we don’t get together, it’s -- it’s an interesting contradiction.</span> <span id="s524">I can work with them, but socially, you know, with a few, but not with the whole -- with all the people that I am in contact with.</span> <span id="s525">I can only -- it -- it -- it feels -- it feels good to -- to do this.</span> <span id="s526">It -- I ha -- kind of -- I can contribute because I’m a social worker, ca -- ca -- I can do the work, it’s not difficult for me to do this.</span> <span id="s527">I -- I can’t really tell you why -- it -- it -- it just -- that’s what I need to do.</span> <span id="s528">I can also tell you that I never was a member of any organization before this.</span> <span id="s529">I never was a member of Hadassah, I never was a member of, like I say, of the temple.</span> <span id="s530">I never was a member of any organization before I got connected to the Hidden Child Foundation.</span> <span id="s531">I didn’t belong, I didn’t feel comfortable, I -- I me -- I mean, I am now a member of the Clinical Social Work Society, I go to their meetings, but it’s not the same, it’s a professional organization.</span> <span id="s532">So, I guess that’s where I feel I belong.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: I thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: You -- You’re welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Okay, and that
