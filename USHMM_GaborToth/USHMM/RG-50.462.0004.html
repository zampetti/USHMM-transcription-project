it was very depressing.</span> <span id="s483">If you worked, the time passed and it wasn’t so depressing.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Tape 2 of 2, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q:Could you continue telling me about those early days?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s487">We stayed there six weeks, and after six weeks we were told to stand in rows of five, and that’s when the selection took place.</span> <span id="s488">We had been tattooed on our arms; I forgot to say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q:When did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A:Shortly after we got there, maybe the next day or two.</span> <span id="s491">We were pulled by our arms and the tattoo number was taken down and we were put to one side and other people were put to the other side.</span> <span id="s492">And then we were told that some of us were going to go to a labor camp.</span> <span id="s493">And again we went into cattle cars and to the labor camp.</span> <span id="s494">We were very much surprised when we got out.</span> <span id="s495">There were nice barracks painted all different colors_blue, green and yellow, and red with numbers on the barracks and it seemed then that this would be a better place than Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q:How far away do you think you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A:We could not have been too far; it was in Upper Silesia.</span> <span id="s498">The camp was called Christianstadt, the city of Christians, and there we had women, S.S. women, guarding us.</span> <span id="s499">And they were very cruel and very bad.</span> <span id="s500">We worked in an ammunition factory.</span> <span id="s501">We walked one hour there and one hour back and in different shifts_a morning shift, an afternoon shift and an evening shift_and they switched us.</span> <span id="s502">We were cleaning grenades.</span> <span id="s503">It was a grenade factory, hand grenades.</span> <span id="s504">We met some foreign workers there.</span> <span id="s505">There was some sort of sabotage going on, some farm workers and some of our girls put some holes in the grenades, did something to them to sabotage them.</span> <span id="s506">And you had to be very careful not to get caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q:Was anybody caught that you know of?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A:No, not that I know of.</span> <span id="s509">It was a lot of satisfaction, and things were quite bad then.</span> <span id="s510">We didn’t get enough to eat.</span> <span id="s511">It was not as bad as Auschwitz but much worse than Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s512">We worked, we slept on cots or bunk beds, two or three in a row.</span> <span id="s513">There were girls falling asleep on the job, and so forth, and the foreman was very upset.</span> <span id="s514">And he kept saying, “What in the world are you doing?</span> <span id="s515">Why can’t you perform properly?”</span> <span id="s516">One of the girls said, “We don’t get enough food and we have to go to work and when we come there is chores to do; we can’t rest and we don’t get enough sleep.”</span> <span id="s517">He said, “Well, I will make sure that you have enough food and the food gets better.”</span> <span id="s518">But I don’t know whether he did or not because things didn’t get better and they treated us very badly.</span> <span id="s519">Very cruelly.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q:You were guarded on this walk by the female S.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q:And the walk went through the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A:I don’t know whether it was S.S. officers or not.</span> <span id="s524">I forgot that already.</span> <span id="s525">When we came into camp things were still the same.</span> <span id="s526">When they broke up with one of the soldiers or something they let it out on us.</span> <span id="s527">They were very cruel.</span> <span id="s528">The woman in charge was about 24 or 25 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q:What did they do when they let it out on you?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A:Well, they would call the roll call_which they had to do, that was ordered you know_but you know people are sick and they couldn’t care less.</span> <span id="s531">And we asked, “Couldn’t the sick person please remain in the barracks in their bunk?”</span> <span id="s532">And oh no, they made you stand outside in the cold weather, with 104º temperature, and they would drop.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q:How long was roll call?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A:They make them pretty long; I don’t know how long, but too long for some people.</span> <span id="s535">And things were bad there.</span> <span id="s536">In February ‘45, the beginning of February ‘45, seems like the Russians were after us and we were told the Kommandant wanted us to get all our things together and leave.</span> <span id="s537">“We are going to get our things together and we have to leave.</span> <span id="s538">We are going to walk.</span> <span id="s539">The Russians are behind us and we have to get away from them.”</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q:The camp that you were in was not technically part of Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A:No, it was a separate camp.</span> <span id="s542">It was a labor camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q:It had both men and women in it?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A:No, just women.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q:Just women?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A:But I am talking about guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q:There were both male and female guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A:Yes, and so we marched and...</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q:Did you have any idea where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A:No, we had no idea.</span> <span id="s551">The Kommandant said [not clear], “How many there will be at the end is not my responsibility.</span> <span id="s552">I am just supposed to bring you, so...” Some were shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q:Some were shot when?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A:On this walk.</span> <span id="s555">They couldn’t walk anymore and some tried to run away and were shot and others got away.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q:How were you dressed for this march?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A:We had civilian winter coats.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q:Civilian winter coats?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A:Yes, and we had a little square striped piece on our winter coats.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q:Where was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A:On the back of the coat.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q:Was that sewn on?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A:A square hole was made into the coat and it was sewn into the coat.</span> <span id="s564">But most of us had for some reason scissors and a needle and thread in the camp, so what we did is a few months before that put a piece of material from our coat underneath that and then sew the striped piece back on.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q:Why did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A:When we had a little free time we all did it.</span> <span id="s567">I don’t know; there must have been something behind it.</span> <span id="s568">I don’t know, if you want to run away or something.</span> <span id="s569">It just seemed like somebody had the idea and we all copied it.</span> <span id="s570">We all had some material we could use: some material from big hems or from a tall person.</span> <span id="s571">And as we marched my girlfriend and I were talking.</span> <span id="s572">[not clear] She said to me that there seems like there are less girls anyway.</span> <span id="s573">Some were shot and some died.</span> <span id="s574">There were so many women you couldn’t keep track of who is missing.</span> <span id="s575">So, one day before we got our rations for bread we got together.</span> <span id="s576">We had made the plans at night, what our names would be and what we would say to people, and if there is an opportunity the next day we would try to run off.</span> <span id="s577">So, as we gathered, we had a little rest, and as we gathered again in rows of five, the two of us, Carmine and I, ran, and thank God nobody saw us.</span> <span id="s578">And we took our scissors and we cut off these pieces of striped material, so that the coats were free of the striped material.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q:What did you do with the patches?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A:We threw them in the brook.</span> <span id="s581">And we sang songs, and we got stopped by a policeman and he said, “Aren’t you two girls from the Jewish group that went by?”</span> <span id="s582">And we made the attempt to look very surprised, how could he think that we would be two Jewish girls?</span> <span id="s583">And after that we stayed with some people overnight and we told everybody that we were cousins.</span> <span id="s584">And we changed our names to [not clear] and we went on our way.</span> <span id="s585">And we joined a troop of German refugees and we went to the Sudetenland in Germany, so that means closer back to our place.</span> <span id="s586">My girlfriend was not from Prague; she was from a small town in Moravia.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q:Where did you leave your coats?</span> <span id="s588">Did you have on regular coats?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A:The only thing that we had that would have been an indication would have been a tattoo on our arms.</span> <span id="s590">Which, somebody would have had to pull our sleeves up.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q:But nobody challenged that?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q:So, the German that you had learned in Prague was the German that you had.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A:Yes, and it helped us.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q:And I assume that your friend’s German was equal to yours.</span> <span id="s596">So you were going to the Sudetenland?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s598">There we took jobs with some families; she was a teacher and I was with a family taking care of children.</span> <span id="s599">We stayed there a few weeks, and all of a sudden a command came that German refugees would have to leave and go back to Germany.</span> <span id="s600">And we were devastated because we were closer to the border now and now we would have to go back to Germany again.</span> <span id="s601">So [not clear]...that we have good German friends in Prague, in the protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.</span> <span id="s602">It was not called Czechoslovakia anymore.</span> <span id="s603">So, they said, “Oh sure, if you want to go there, go.</span> <span id="s604">But you just have to get out of this area.”</span> <span id="s605">So they gave us a pass and we got some money from the people that we had worked for and went on a train to Prague.</span> <span id="s606">Our feelings were very mixed.</span> <span id="s607">We met all kinds of people on the train; we talked in German.</span> <span id="s608">We arrived in Prague, scared stiff that someone might recognize us.</span> <span id="s609">Finally, we got to my uncle’s house and stayed there.</span> <span id="s610">His wife was Dutch.</span> <span id="s611">I would not dare to go in and I told my girlfriend to go to a phone and call while I waited in the coffee shop, and say that your niece Irma is here.</span> <span id="s612">I had written them from the Sudetenland that we have ration cards, that we were working and to say that it was Frances’s daughter Irma, or something like that, so that they would know that it was Eva.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q:You gave your mother’s correct name?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q:So that they would know?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A:Yes, and that we were doing fairly well.</span> <span id="s617">I couldn’t say that we [not clear], only that we had ration cards and we were working, my cousin and I. I think I wrote, “Frances would be proud of us.”</span> <span id="s618">So then my aunt said to come to the house, the apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q:Carmine called?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A:And my aunt said for both of us to come.</span> <span id="s621">We went up and they put us into the apartment; and they had maids there that had known me.</span> <span id="s622">And she said, “Oh, she looks like Eva.”</span> <span id="s623">And my aunt said, “No, this is just a friend of mine.”</span> <span id="s624">It has been a few years and I changed and I talked in German all the time.</span> <span id="s625">My aunt said, “Let’s go into the office.”</span> <span id="s626">My uncle was still in business; they had a paper mill.</span> <span id="s627">There my aunt talked to us and she gave us money to dye my hair red, and gave me some glasses that were just made of glass to look a little different, and gave us money for a hotel room.</span> <span id="s628">She wouldn’t dare let us stay with her and I wouldn’t dare ask her to.</span> <span id="s629">This was either March or April of 1945.</span> <span id="s630">I found a job with a woman whose husband was an S.S. man but he was at the front.</span> <span id="s631">She was Polish and had a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q:You lived with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q:When you were with your aunt and uncle were you able to find out what had happened to any of the other members of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A:No, they hadn’t heard anything.</span> <span id="s636">And I was in touch on the phone a couple of times but I didn’t go to see them until after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q:The two uncles that you mentioned who had married Christian wives, were both of them able to stay in Prague throughout the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A:No, one of them was divorced.</span> <span id="s639">He was in camps, Theresienstadt as well as other camps, and the other was an aunt that married a gentile.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q:I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A:And they both went into camps, she in Theresienstadt for a few months.</span> <span id="s642">My uncle had a Dutch wife; never went anywhere because he was working for the Jewish community council there, and they needed him there, so he never had to go anywhere.</span> <span id="s643">He was lucky.</span> <span id="s644">[not clear] I think, I don’t know if they sent me money once or not.</span> <span id="s645">I can’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q:There was a separate camp for the Christians.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A:Yes there was.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q:Of the Jewish people that were in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A:Yes there was but I forgot what they called it.</span> <span id="s650">My aunt and uncle went there for just a few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q:And they were released?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A:Yes, both of them.</span> <span id="s653">They are both not alive anymore now.</span> <span id="s654">They both died of natural causes.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q:What was your experience then of working with this family of the S.S. officer?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A:Well it was very strange; the woman was pregnant, most likely by another man because her husband had been on the front for a long time.</span> <span id="s657">And she had a nanny that was taking care of the baby, and the nanny was kind of against me.</span> <span id="s658">She was Polish and the woman was also Polish, and she wasn’t home very much; she must have had a boyfriend or something, because she left the house and the child to me and the nanny most of the time.</span> <span id="s659">I took care of him and I raised him.</span> <span id="s660">Then one fine day, it was towards the end of the war, she said, “Oh by the way, it’s getting bad here now.</span> <span id="s661">The war is coming to an end and I don’t want to be caught here as the wife of an S.S. man.</span> <span id="s662">You are my maid and you are going to have to go with me one day soon; I will let you know and we will have to go to Germany.”</span> <span id="s663">I thought, “Oh boy, that is all I need.</span> <span id="s664">Here I am in Prague and the war ends and I am right where I am supposed to be.”</span> <span id="s665">I didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s666">I didn’t say I wouldn’t go but I was really scared.</span> <span id="s667">The 5th of May she took off as she had many a day and she said, “I want you to do what you are supposed to and nanny will help you.</span> <span id="s668">And I may come home tonight and I may not come home till tomorrow.”</span> <span id="s669">That is the day that the revolution started.</span> <span id="s670">Across the street was a factory and it put up the Czechoslovakia flag.</span> <span id="s671">And in the meantime we were the only Germans in the house; they were all Czechs and they didn’t know what had happened.</span> <span id="s672">When I went for milk they called the old lady and me all kinds of names.</span> <span id="s673">And I just smiled and it was like I was in an unwanted atmosphere there, but the superintendent, she seemed to like me, although I was supposedly a German.</span> <span id="s674">Sometimes she asked me how the woman treated me.</span> <span id="s675">So that day, the day of the revolution, I finally made up my mind and it was a beautiful day and I opened the window and I said, “What was going on?”</span> <span id="s676">_in German_and they said, “Don’t you know?</span> <span id="s677">The war is over.”</span> <span id="s678">I thought now is my time.</span> <span id="s679">I had my packed bags under the bed.</span> <span id="s680">I grabbed my two suitcases and went out.</span> <span id="s681">The nanny said, “Where are you going?”</span> <span id="s682">And I said, “I am going out.”</span> <span id="s683">And she said, “The Mrs. said you were to take care of the baby.”</span> <span id="s684">And I said, “I don’t care what she said.</span> <span id="s685">I am going out.”</span> <span id="s686">So she takes a big key and she locks the front door on me.</span> <span id="s687">I said, “Do you want me to scream for the police?”</span> <span id="s688">And she said, “No,” and she took the key out of her big pocket in the apron and she opened the door, and I ran like the devil chased me.</span> <span id="s689">And where could I go_because there was shooting outside_so I went to the superintendent.</span> <span id="s690">As soon as I walked in she said, “Oh, Anna, what are you doing here?”</span> <span id="s691">And I said, “Mrs. Kutch,” and I started talking in Czech.</span> <span id="s692">She was sitting at the sewing machine sewing a Czech flag together.</span> <span id="s693">It was different, the same colors but different.</span> <span id="s694">And I said, “What is going on?”</span> <span id="s695">And she said, “We are at the end of the war.</span> <span id="s696">How come you speak Czech?”</span> <span id="s697">And I said, “Well, I am born here.</span> <span id="s698">I am Czechoslovakian.</span> <span id="s699">My name is Eva Gerstl and I ran away from the concentration camp.”</span> <span id="s700">And she was hugging and kissing me and there was a lot of crying going on and hugging and kissing.</span> <span id="s701">We sang the national anthem, all of us, and later on a man came down and warmed bottles for the baby.</span> <span id="s702">So then one woman started bringing me food and telling the whole house who I am and started bringing me food because they thought I must be hungry for so long.</span> <span id="s703">And they gave me slices of bread and butter.</span> <span id="s704">And one woman said that she didn’t believe me, that I could be a German just hiding under this pretense.</span> <span id="s705">Then somebody took my hand and said, “Would you have an aunt or an uncle here, any relatives?”</span> <span id="s706">And I got my brother’s girlfriend on the phone to identify me.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q:Did you identify yourself as a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A:Yes, and they were really wonderful to me.</span> <span id="s709">I stayed there for a couple of days.</span> <span id="s710">And in the meantime I called my uncle and he said, “Yes, this is Eva; she has been hiding and she has been in touch with me but she was afraid to stay with us.</span> <span id="s711">It was too risky.”</span> <span id="s712">And so I stayed with them for a couple of months and then I called my brother’s girlfriend and she came to pick me up.</span> <span id="s713">Then I went to my uncle’s house, and I stayed there for a little while, with my other aunt and uncle for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q:Did you find any feeling about your Judaism, staying with these Czech people in the house?</span> <span id="s715">I mean once you had identified yourself as a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A:No, there was no difference.</span> <span id="s717">They didn’t care.</span> <span id="s718">Maybe they had been anti-Semitic but the fact that we were all fighting against the Germans and we were Czechoslovakian citizens and that kind of brought us together.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Tape 2 of 2, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q:As you look back over the time that you had in the camp, what do you think kept you going the second time?</span> <span id="s721">In the Theresienstadt camp you had the music, you had your mother and your father.</span> <span id="s722">What kept you going the second time around?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A:I think it was just the will of survival, to survive this whole ordeal.</span> <span id="s724">And I think I would say the main factor was youth, the optimism of youth.</span> <span id="s725">It didn’t permit any thought that we wouldn’t survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q:What did you see around you in terms of the other young women?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A:Well, most of us were that way.</span> <span id="s728">There were some of us that were, naturally, depressed at times.</span> <span id="s729">We had people like that too.</span> <span id="s730">And what we saw mostly was_the fact was known in all the camps_that the higher intellect the people were_not all of them but many of them_they couldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s731">They would not wash.</span> <span id="s732">They would not brush their teeth.</span> <span id="s733">They would deteriorate much faster.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q:People with the higher intellect?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A:They had the hardest time of all.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q:This was commonly felt throughout the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A:This was commonly known, not just women, but men.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q:Why do you think that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A:I don’t know.</span> <span id="s740">I could never explain it to myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q:But you saw this.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A:Yes, I saw this, and spoke to others about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q:Did you spend much time thinking about the possibilities of your own death in the second camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A:No.</span> <span id="s745">The only time that I wanted to end my own life was in Auschwitz and that would have been by running to the fence and being electrified and ending it that way.</span> <span id="s746">But the will to survive, and the will to see my parents and my brother, and it wouldn’t be fair to them just because I had some hard times taking things, just to end my own life.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q:This was during the time you were in the barracks in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A:Yes, because that was real desperation there.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q:How long actually were you in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A:Six weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q:Six weeks totally.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q:And after that time was the selection.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s755">This was time in July till February when we ran away.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q:Were you aware of any kind of religious services or observance going on either in Auschwitz or in Christianstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A:No, not there but in Theresienstadt there was.</span> <span id="s758">Some people lit candles for Shabbas and there was some praying going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q:The people that you came across later did not observe, there was no discussion of religious observance?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A:No, there wasn’t; there were many people who defied God, who said, “How could there be a God, to let things like this happen?”</span> <span id="s761">And it wasn’t until many of them married and had their own families that they believed in God again.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q:What happened to your own faith?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A:I don’t really remember.</span> <span id="s764">I was never too religious.</span> <span id="s765">I really didn’t become too religious until I came to America.</span> <span id="s766">It made me a stronger Jew and personally aware and proud of being Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q:Did you have much of a physical recuperation after the experience of the march?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A:Well, I hadn’t eaten well, and I got terrible attacks of gall bladder problems which got worse, and I had to diet.</span> <span id="s769">And later on in January ‘49 in Buffalo, New York, I had to have my gall bladder removed due to the fact that I didn’t have enough food; and then all that rich food, it must have built up over the years.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q:To catch us back up, after the war was over you stayed with your aunt and uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A:I stayed with one of my aunts and uncles and I met my husband (at the time friend).</span> <span id="s772">We started to go out together and two-and-a-half years later we were married in Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q:During that time you were living with the aunt and uncle?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A:Yes, I was living with the aunt and uncle and then I was living in a rooming house, a boarding house, and renting a room from one of my former girlfriend’s mothers whose daughter meanwhile was married, so that she did not live with her and she rented her room.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q:What did you learn of your families’ whereabouts?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A:I didn’t know anything about my mother, other than she left Theresienstadt in October ‘45 [‘44?</span> <span id="s777">-ed.]</span> <span id="s778">.</span> <span id="s779">They both left.</span> <span id="s780">I don’t know if on the same transport.</span> <span id="s781">My father I found out a year after the war was over.</span> <span id="s782">I had a note_I had been on vacation_and my landlady left me a note that, “This man wants to get in touch with you.”</span> <span id="s783">And I was to call him and see him.</span> <span id="s784">He was in the Jewish community service and found out that someone returned from the family, a daughter; that was me...[unclear] So I saw that man; he was not Jewish, he was in camp with my father and he told me that my father worked in camp, and he worked out of camp.</span> <span id="s785">He was good friends with my father.</span> <span id="s786">And he told me when he came home...</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q:Was that in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A:No, another camp, but I don’t remember which camp; and when he came home....</span> <span id="s789">This man’s name was Tony.</span> <span id="s790">[not clear] When Tony came home he found out that my father was beside himself...happy and told him that while at work they were called up and told what whoever was Jewish should raise their hand because they could go to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s791">So, he said to my father, “You raised your hand?”</span> <span id="s792">My father said, “Yes, all of us did.”</span> <span id="s793">So apparently in that particular camp, which it was unusual, because usually Jews were marked.</span> <span id="s794">Apparently at that time they didn’t know who was Jewish and who was not...[not clear] You kind of hoped maybe somebody would be alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q:He doesn’t know what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A:No.</span> <span id="s797">He does not know what happened but it was a trick to get them to Auschwitz or someplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q:Did you ever hear what happened to your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A:No.</span> <span id="s800">Just that she went on a transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q:But you still had hopes?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A:I had hope that they might be someplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q:When did you give up hoping to see your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A:Oh, two or three years after that.</span> <span id="s805">It wasn’t very likely that she would be alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q:Did you hear many different stories from other family members that had been in different camps, anything that you could share with us?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A:No.</span> <span id="s808">I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s809">I know some but it would be better if they were to tell you themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q:Your husband was in a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A:He was in six or seven camps but I don’t remember their names.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q:And you married in Prague?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A:I married in Prague in November 20th, 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q:And then when did you come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A:We came here in June 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q:Is there anything else that you can think of that we haven’t covered or that you thought of after we talked about it that you would like to add to our discussion?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A:No, I can’t think of anything.</span> <span id="s818">We covered quite a bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q:O.</span> <span id="s820">K., thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">USHMM Archives, RG-50.462*0004 page \* arabic49 From the collection of the Gratz College Holocaust Oral History Archive.</span></p></body></html>
