came ... opened the concentration camps, and what were the impressions you had and what effect on you did it</span></p> <p><span id="s2">have?</span></p> <p><span id="s3">RABBI ABE KLAUSNER: My um particular experience was to enter the Dachau concentration camp in 45, May of 45, I was attached to a hospital unit called the 116th evacuation hospital.</span> <span id="s4">I was given no instruction as to what I would do nor did anybody advise me.</span> <span id="s5">I just found myself with the medical team in the camp.</span> <span id="s6">And the, I had to determine what I was to do, and that of course was a development which began with my coming and lasted with a period of practically, approximately five years.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">SWB: You told once about how difficult for you to actually go up and enter the camp, can you tell me about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">RABBI ABE KLAUSNER: Well my first experience with uh the liberated was terribly devastating, by virtue of the fact that I realized that they weren't liberated.</span> <span id="s9">The camps were open so to speak, but the people weren't uh taken in hand and uh comforted and provided with necessities and told that now you'll have a place to sleep, things to do and they'll be a program of some sort for your uh repatriation or delivery to-to-to uh some security, what they were do- what was done was they were put back behind barbed wire.</span> <span id="s10">They uh occupied more or less the same uh ambience that they uh occupied uh before the liberation, with the exception of course, they weren't going to be killed.</span> <span id="s11">And they were going to be fed.</span> <span id="s12">Dachau was an exception in the sense that Working transcript: not spell

id="s14">We had uh three medical units, the 116th, the 127th evac, and the tenth field hospital which was nearby at another camp called Allach.</span> <span id="s15">And for a short period of time, oh perhaps uh four to six weeks maybe a little longer, the hospital units uh drawn from the military, remained in the area taking care of the immediate problems of the uh sick and the dying.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">SWB: Tell me about first going through the gate and then going into a barrack for the first time.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">RABBI ABE KLAUSNER: Well I came uh into Dachau at night uh, and uh I saw nothing except the main square coming through the big gates.</span> <span id="s18">And of course uh I waited for the morning quite anxiously and when morning came uh I uh walked through the barbed wire gates into the barracks area, and uh selected one of the barracks.</span> <span id="s19">I entered and there met the first of the survivors.</span> <span id="s20">Uh it was a uh difficult experience for me because I was not confident that uh I could serve a purpose.</span> <span id="s21">I had nothing to offer, I had nothing to give.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">People needed amenities, needed attention of various kinds, and I had nothing, but nevertheless there I was in Dachau and I felt I had to do something, and so I entered the barracks and stood there, terribly disturbed.</span> <span id="s23">Here we were in a period of liberation and the people were still in barracks, stretched out on shelves, there were three rows of shelves, nothing other than the shelves, there wasn't a-a-a- piece of linen of any kind, there wasn't a bar of soap, there wasn't a chair, place to sit down, it was just a uh, a uh dirty uh-uh situation and uh here were the people uh either stretched out on the shelves or uh moving about listlessly.</span> <span id="s24">Paid no attention to me as if I didn't exist.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">No one came towards me to say welcome or uh what is it you Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/10/95 RABBI ABRAHAM KLAUSNER Page 3 want.</span> <span id="s27">They just uh, I was just an apparition.</span> <span id="s28">Until one uh, one uh of the liberated, of the survivors walking around came, stared at me and finally looked up at me and uh, asked me a strange question.</span> <span id="s29">I remember it very distinctly.</span> <span id="s30">He asked me if I knew his uncle, gave me his name, in Toledo.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">And I was taken aback, that was the first conversation that I had with the, with the liberated.</span> <span id="s32">And I stood there lost, not knowing what to do or what to say.</span> <span id="s33">I was wearing a raincoat at the time and in my pocket I had little cellophane packages of Bizouzot, they were these little uh uh symbols uh that the Jewish welfare board had made and delivered to chaplains for distribution to soldiers and for a moment I thought I would take out a few of these and hand them out.</span> <span id="s34">But as I thought about it I thought that would be ugly, it would be to-to-to to respond to a great tragedy with a little icon of some sort didn't s-seem to be the proper thing to do.</span> <span id="s35">And then I was saved.</span> <span id="s36">I call it the epiphany.</span> <span id="s37">A voice came from one of the uh, one of the shelves, very thin voice, crying so to speak, and uh it said to me, I had a brother, we grew up together in our village but my brother left and went to the United States and there became a Rabbi.</span> <span id="s38">And he continued to speak but at that point, uh, when he said he became a Rabbi, I interrupted him and said I know your brother.</span> <span id="s39">He is here in Europe.</span> <span id="s40">And then the voice began again to cry and say, don't be compassionate for the sake of compassion, he assumed that I was just going to be nice, uh, but it was uh, a strange moment.</span> <span id="s41">I said no uh, my voice over his uh, I'm gonna bring you your brother.</span> <span id="s42">And I left the barracks at that moment because I couldn't handle it beyond that.</span> <span id="s43">And uh, on the outside of the barrack, I now felt that there was a purpose in my coming, if nothing more, I was gonna bring him his brother.</span> <span id="s44">Of course people ask me, when I tell the story, Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for

officers uh, in the United States to Scotland, England, across the channel, we were in box cars across France, in the back of the bulge in the Battle of the Bulge, and that voice, the lilt in that voice I had heard it before, and to me there was no question about it, and-and and I was so familiar with the rhythm, the lilt of the voice, that I immediately assumed that the voice that I heard in the boxcar, n- in the travels, was it the brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">And uh it turned out I was correct, I uh, found the brother and I brought them together.</span> <span id="s48">This was my first, not only experience, it was the thing that uh, that uh encouraged me to an odyssey that stretched over uh the four or five years working with the displaced persons.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">SWB: RABBI ABE KLAUSNER: No uh, first of all uh, I saw it only from the so-called area of Dachau.</span> <span id="s50">I didn't know what was happening beyond the gates of Dachau at the moment.</span> <span id="s51">Uh, I was confident in those days that it wasn't really a serious problem, the sick were being taken care of by the 116th evac.</span> <span id="s52">And uh I knew, I was confident that the next day or two or three days that all the great American institutions, especially the Jewish institutions would be there.</span> <span id="s53">And uh they would do what had to be done to-to-to give these people the redemption that should have been offered them.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">SWB: RABBI ABE KLAUSNER: Well when uh the-the-the question that this-this figure asked me about his uncle in Toledo bothered me.</span> <span id="s55">I just didn't dismiss it.</span> <span id="s56">And I began to think about Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for

there were little moments which were of a religious nature uh that I was involved with but uh, it didn't seem to be something that had to be represented uh, assuming that it was felt.</span> <span id="s66">For example, I had decided that we would have a, uh a kind of a Thanksgiving service at one of the camps, uh, in Munich, at the edge of Munich.</span> <span id="s67">And uh I had a case of uh prayer books, the JWB, the Jewish Welfare Board prayer book that was prepared for soldiers, and I came and there was a big assembly of survivors, and uh we passed out the prayer books, and when the

id="s69">Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/10/95 RABBI ABRAHAM KLAUSNER Page 6 understand then at the moment what was happening but later of course it all became clear to me.</span> <span id="s70">The, there were moemtns which were ritually connected, which spoke about religious practice.</span> <span id="s71">I could tell you the story of uh, of some women that I had found in the Alps.</span> <span id="s72">I was on my way to Italy because uh, we were going to establish a kind of a, escape route, of getting survivors over to Italy where they would be able to take the illegal ships to Palestine.</span> <span id="s73">And on my way, traveling with a doctor, always traveled with a doctor, I hit upon a sign that indicated that in one of the valleys of the Alps, there were some DP's.</span> <span id="s74">So we made that trip, it was a difficult trip, we finally came to the end of the valley actually, and uh found a series of barracks, and entered one in which there were quite a number of Hungarian Jewish women.</span> <span id="s75">And we were the first uh to connect with them in terms of the world Jewish community and these women.</span> <span id="s76">And it was my practice of course to carry lists of names in my pocket, and I pulled out all the lists and I put em on the table and they all fell on the table, starting to scratch for the names to see if they could connect with one of the names.</span> <span id="s77">And while this was going on, a young girl, I don't know, maybe 16 or 17, walked out of this area of this room and returned in a little while with a prayer book.</span> <span id="s78">I didn't know it was a prayer book at the moment.</span> <span id="s79">And then she held it up from the distance and said see what I have.</span> <span id="s80">It's my prayer book.</span> <span id="s81">And then she added to that, I brought it from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s82">Of course this, [laughs] this was a kind of excitement because I knew the procedure by this time, that you couldn't take anything into, in-into a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s83">[coughs] People were stripped of any possessions they had and there was no way of carrying a prayer book into a camp and uh holding onto it, and I of course asked, how did you do it, and she told me that when they gave her her first Working transcript: not spell checked or

but not completely, made a hinge of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">And then dug out the crumbs in the heel of a loaf of the bread, and put her little prayer book and carried the bread with her and of course bread was something you weren't going to, you weren't going to steal one from the other, and so forth.</span> <span id="s86">Y- this was one of the religious elements in terms of uh, uh then of course in time uh, as people settled in the camps, they took on their uh religious practices, and I dealt with them accordingly.</span> <span id="s87">The Klausenberg Rabbi, the great Hassidic leader whom I found in Dachau, we nourished him back to health and then brought him to Feldafing, he had some disciples, and so we have a whole history with him.</span> <span id="s88">I found uh in one of the uh, buildings, in Munich, a large uh- uh Polish Hebrew library that the Nazis had uh had uh confiscated.</span> <span id="s89">And every time I would pass the building, I'd go in and take a few of the volumes and then on my way to one of the camps I would drop them off so that the people who were interested uh, would have uh, have the text of the tradition in front of them.</span> <span id="s90">Uh, religion didn't play a-a dominant role in the sense that we were doing things religiously.</span> <span id="s91">Religion manifested itself in terms of the behavior of the people as they related to the faith prior to their coming into the camp and uh, whatever the camp uh would uh allow them.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">SWB: Tell me your impressions of the problems that existed in most of the DP camps very early on.</span> <span id="s93">Describe the</span></p> <p><span id="s94">conditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">RABBI ABE KLAUSNER: The camps, to begin with, were not

Dachau, came about because when the American forces came through the area, particularly the community of Tutzing, they found this company of survivors, that is of DP's, that the Germans were moving from one place to the other to get them away from the oncoming allied forces.</span> <span id="s100">But by the time uh the Americans got there the Germans have fled and the people were there.</span> <span id="s101">And now it became the job of Army to do something with them, so they assigned an officer and said, do something with them.</span> <span id="s102">And they ended up in what we call an SDAP school, this was a school uh that uh-uh that trained the children of the elite, Nazis, for positions, for positions in-in-in in the party and in the government.</span> <span id="s103">And so these people were then pushed into this camp, same thing happened in Landsberg, a series of camps called the Kalfering camps.</span> <span id="s104">Uh, same thing happened in Mithenwald, and we had wherever we went there were these collecting points, and each one was handled differently depended upon who was handling it, there wasn't a general policy, there wasn't a program, there wasn't an, a department within the military to say we're going to take care of these people.</span> <span id="s105">There wasn't an institution, the UNRHA wasn't there, the American Joint Distribution Committee wasn't there, no one was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">And so it became a makeshift operation and depending upon the officer in charge, you'd get either a better or a worse situation.</span> <span id="s107">But the camp itself was really incapable because of, to handle the people and so you had a kind of a, tragic uh, uh I wouldn't call it poverty but absence of any uh sensible response to the people that had suddenly been liberated, and that became one of the first problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Secondly, the fact that they were locked up, barbed wire, they couldn't they had no freedom, couldn't get out one in the morning and say I'm going to take a walk through the, Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span

them.</span> <span id="s111">They didn't have an identity card.</span> <span id="s112">They were just a mass of people which the army was gonna herd from one place to the other, and that became the basic element with which we had to deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">SWB: RABBI ABE KLAUSNER: The uh logic of the situation was not something that that we debated or the people, the people uh- uh reflected on.</span> <span id="s114">The people, uh, faced the problems of their own connections, their own identity, and so that was their primary concern.</span> <span id="s115">Uh, what was happening to the perpetrators, the Germans and so forth, this really was not something that we were, just about to-to-to waste our energy</span></p> <p><span id="s116">on.</span></p> <p><span

though they had in one form or another commonly been oppressed by the Germans.</span> <span id="s121">Once the liberation took place, old animosity surfaced, and some became quite intense.</span>

ABRAHAM KLAUSNER Page 10 from day to day people were actually killed, and uh, the dead rose in number and uh, it was obvious to me that uh, something had to be done.</span> <span id="s124">Secondly, in terms of the Jewish survivor, I felt that in order to restructure a living pattern and to uh uh excite some kind of a cultural development or a return to a- a previous rhythm of life, we couldn't do it in a mixture.</span> <span id="s125">There was no way of uh dealing with one group and not dealing with another group.</span> <span id="s126">And uh I wasn't prepared to serve other than a response to the Jewish survivor.</span> <span id="s127">And so I decided that we're going to have to have segregated or Jewish camps.</span> <span id="s128">And so I took the matter up with some military figures and they were against it, but eventually we devised a way in which they would not have to take a position in favor of separate camps, and yet allow me to create Jewish camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">SWB: Did they simply not understand...</span></p> <p><span id="s130">RABBI ABE KLAUSNER: They were prompted by a, the general American concept of uh of uh multiculturalism, in other words, as one officer said to me, after all we're Americans, we're we-we uh uh are proponents of democracy, of-of containing people within a common objective.</span> <span id="s131">And here you're coming and saying to, to us after the war which we fought in terms of a democratic uh concept that you're going to go back on it and you're gonna separate the people.</span> <span id="s132">And I said theoretically, you're absolutely correct.</span> <span id="s133">But in practice, it just won't work at this time and in this place.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">And so uh, we were able to make a kind of a deal which I was able to create, the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">SWB: Tell me about what length people would go to find surviving members of their

11 RABBI ABE KLAUSNER: The-the compulsion, or the drive was so great that people broke out of camps and walked, traveled, there weren't any forms of transportation across Czechoslovakia, Poland, into Russia, looking for uh, for-for uh, fragments of families, and people came out of East Europe into Munich, and we set up a large tracing program.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Besides the-the books that were published uh we had a center in Munich at the Deutschishe museum for, where people came from all over Europe and uh, uh came asking about their family.</span> <span id="s139">Interesting thing was that we put a table out in the lobby, so to speak, people would come and tear the pages out of the book and we would have to feed the table with books and then we would nail the pages down so they would last a little longer.</span> <span id="s140">But if a person came and found no name in the book, they would go over to the wall, it was a very large wall, and they write a note on the wall saying for example, I was here, addressing it to a parent or to a child.</span> <span id="s141">I've been looking for you, and I will be here or going there so that there'd be some point at which they might be able to connect.</span> <span id="s142">We were very much involved in looking for children in uh Eastern Europe, people who had left their children either with Christian friends or others.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Wanted to find those children and so we had to set up a program for the search of children, which was haphazard but in many cases it was very effective.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">SWB: RABBI ABE KLAUSNER: Well uh, as I came to know the-the-the contours of the problem and realized that Dachau was only one little place, and that throughout

of other places that I had already had.</span> <span id="s150">And slowly when I would come back to Dachau I would then have some of the people join these names to others, and uh after a while I went up to the town of Landsberg and found uh a printer.</span> <span id="s151">It was not legal for printers to operate after the war, you had to have military permission, the military wasn't giving out permission for any kind of uh printing of newspapers or anything of print nature.</span> <span id="s152">And then with a cup of coffee, I mean a can of coffee or tea or something, chocolate, cigarettes, which uh these things were uh negotiables, we would get uh the books published and then we'd have to distribute them.</span> <span id="s153">We'd get people going to Poland to take some books, or to Hungary or to Rumania and so forth.</span> <span id="s154">In fact, I had a man come from Kobna, a Christian, who brought me a child.</span> <span id="s155">And with the child he brought

first, the original books.</span> <span id="s163">Uh, the best that we could do at that time was to get the name of the survivor, the place and date of birth, this was about as much information that we could handle and we though that would be at least some kind of a resource which would help people locate one another.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">SWB: RABBI ABE KLAUSNER: I uh, remember that very clearly.</span> <span id="s165">I was driving into the camp of Feldafing, and whenever I drove in, the people would congregate around the car as I came in, so it would move very slowly, and they would shout to me all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s166">Their complaints or just a general greeting or something.</span> <span id="s167">It was a kind of a festival situation when I came into a camp, and I came in one day and there was a tall figure, angry looking like a prophet, and he shouted out to me and he said Chaplain, we need a newspaper, and my response of course was always positive.</span> <span id="s168">I says, okay, you'll have a newspaper.</span> <span id="s169">Of course I had no idea how you have a newspaper, but, if he wants a newspaper let's see what can be done.</span> <span id="s170">And so I got to know this person, he turned out to be uh a person from Kobne, his name was Shalatin at the time, Levy, he had been a young journalist and he had worked uh in uh as a journalist, and uh, we then started to explore how we could uh publish a newspaper.</span> <span id="s171">Well, we needed paper.</span> <span id="s172">That wasn't a big Working

Well I was with Ben-Gurion.</span> <span id="s196">Ben-Gurion uh came uh to-to Germany and uh he met with uh with-with uh Eisenhower, uh, Judge Rifkin who was the advisor to Jewish affairs took him to see Eisenhower and then uh he came down to Munich and he, I joined him there, first he spoke, he was the speaker at our uh-uh-uh call it uh convocation of the central committee which met in the Rafthaus, the city hall of Munich.</span> <span id="s197">And then I took him uh through the camp situation, took him up to St. Tetillion, a hospital, up to Landsberg, Feldafing, so forth.</span> <span id="s198">And uh just uh made sure that he saw what uh we were all about.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">SWB: RABBI ABE KLAUSNER: Well it of course meant a great deal in the sense that uh, here was a figure, a personality which uh which uh represented to them that there was a reality beyond the camps, that there was a world and there was a, there was a battle, and there was a voice, there was a-a promise that uh as he indicated uh his theme was we're going to get you out of this, there's going to be a land, and there's going to be a new home.</span> <span id="s200">Uh, it uh, it was a

people, and uh, uh we were going to be redeemed.</span> <span id="s203">I don't think the people ever felt for a moment that this was going to end badly, that uh somehow all this is nightmare which

obey them.</span> <span id="s206">I didn't take an action against anything.</span> <span id="s207">Now the first action that I took which was contrary to a-a military order was that after uh, uh we were in Dachau the first six or eight weeks, the 116th evacuation hospital was ordered out, because actually this was not part of uh military procedure, bringing a military hospital into a civilian situation.</span> <span id="s208">But it was something that uh, that the army decided to do as far as Dachau was concerned.</span> <span id="s209">But uh, uh all other soldiers were on uh rest and

was a member of the 116.</span> <span id="s211">Nobody paid attention to the fact that I had a role that I created for myself, but the unit moves, you're part of a unit, military orders, and so,

the army told me, I got on a truck that morning, and uh rode off.</span> <span id="s214">Came to a rest center, everybody got off the truck, I stayed there a moment, I said what am I gonna do here,
