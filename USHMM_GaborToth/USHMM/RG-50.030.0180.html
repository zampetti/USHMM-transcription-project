You want from the...before the war, so I tell you.</span> <span id="s36">My mother...in this town was few families what they were very poor.</span> <span id="s37">They have many children and they were very poor so my mother every week, Thursday, she packed few packages to take to the poor one...to the poor families and when they came from public school, she gave me this to...to...to deliver to this family.</span> <span id="s38">It was 2 kilometers to the east, prunes, sugar, eggs, to have for them for .</span> <span id="s39">So this every week, and I had to hid this because she didn't want people to know that she delivered to this families because this families were ashamed to be poor."</span> <span id="s40">So we were Jews and my father brought always from the a beggars.</span> <span id="s41">They came over there for for the meals.</span> <span id="s42">He brought sometimes 2, 3 and somehow my mother find always enough food for everybody.</span> <span id="s43">And this was only for the meal.</span> <span id="s44">So from small kids we learned how to give...how to give to...to people what shared... to people what they don't have.</span> <span id="s45">And we wasn't rich but when a beggar come in, he never went out hungry from us.</span> <span id="s46">My brothers went to the Yeshiva".</span> <span id="s47">They were...they were...they were real Yeshiva boys.</span> <span id="s48">My father was a very Hasidic man and my mother...wore a wig.</span> <span id="s49">And on , my father was wearing his .</span> <span id="s50">I don't know whether you know what a and in...silk , and they were very, very Hasidic .</span> <span id="s51">Our family, my mother's special family...was a child didn't...didn't have to say a by...by a marriage who...uh...they want this or this.</span> <span id="s52">The parents made the marriages, so I was like a rebelling.</span> <span id="s53">And it was hurting very much my parents that I didn't want to marry a Hasidic boy.</span> <span id="s54">I told my mother...I promised my mother, "Listen, Mommy.</span> <span id="s55">You want me to..." I talked to her always Jewish.</span> <span id="s56">"You want me to be happy?"</span> <span id="s57">So she says, "Yes.</span> <span id="s58">What you are asking such a silly question?"</span> <span id="s59">So I told, "So let me...let me match to me a boy and to you I swear I will not go with a lower family that we are.</span> <span id="s60">If...if I..</span> <span id="s61">.</span> <span id="s62">I will never look on a boy what is in a lower family."</span> <span id="s63">And this I remembered even after the war, that I promised her, even she wasn't alive and it was hurting me after the war very much that I didn't give her this...I should marry a "Hasidic boy and gave...give the "Nahas from me.</span> <span id="s64">I had two brothers and I was painting from small kid.</span> <span id="s65">And I want my parents to...to let me to go in art school.</span> <span id="s66">They say you are already a girl, not a girl, and that I didn't want to follow this everything what they want me to follow to marry the Hasidic boy.</span> <span id="s67">And you paint enough good.</span> <span id="s68">You sell already your painting.</span> <span id="s69">Show me one girl that know how to paint like you.</span> <span id="s70">I was writing before the war poems.</span> <span id="s71">I was painting.</span> <span id="s72">I was...I was think I will be a..</span> <span id="s73">.</span> <span id="s74">I will be something very big, but when...when the war came, everything was going to the drain.</span> <span id="s75">Then I had two brothers and a sister.</span> <span id="s76">My sister was a small child.</span> <span id="s77">I was also a leader of the "Ikeba what was hurting very much my parents because over there was boys and girls.</span> <span id="s78">I was not...uh...uh...it was half religion organization, but a funny way.</span> <span id="s79">It was against my parents' will.</span> <span id="s80">So I was leader in the...in the "Ikeba, and it was...when it was "Pakisha... This means when every leader came together I never told my parents that I am going from the "Pakisha and I go to my Grandparents...to my Grandparents over there to visit.</span> <span id="s81">And I went to the "Pakisha.</span> <span id="s82">I left here a picture from this.</span> <span id="s83">Then...then, also I was taking private lessons because they didn't let me go only...they let me go in only they let me go only in the business school.</span> <span id="s84">In business school, I finished business school.</span> <span id="s85">But...but they didn't let me go gymnasium and this, so I took private lessons philosophy.</span> <span id="s86">Later to graduate I took private lessons.</span> <span id="s87">And when I sold pictures I paid for the lessons.</span> <span id="s88">Then...then...uh...then it came my...when...when it came they war, when they marched in, we were in Krakow.</span> <span id="s89">My brothers and I we went to Krakow, because we were going to move from this small town to Krakow.</span> <span id="s90">We love it Krakow.</span> <span id="s91">So I with my brothers were in Krakow, and my mother came to visit us one time and...and we were going to make...my brothers were going to make a business for my father to sell everything over there, the house and everything to come to a bigger town, to a bigger city.</span> <span id="s92">My brother...my father had over there two brothers in the same city.</span> <span id="s93">He had two sisters in United States from before the war.</span> <span id="s94">That's why I have the pictures or not I wouldn't have pictures because he was sending the pictures to his sisters and when I came to the United States they were still alive, so they gave me the pictures.</span> <span id="s95">And one...in here one sister, my mother had...was from six children so they have all the children.</span> <span id="s96">This...everything went to the gas chambers, but my...when the...when...1939, when the war started, we were in Krakow.</span> <span id="s97">My brothers went right now when they hear it will be war, they went right now home to the small town to Tyczyn because they were thinking that they will be enlisted to the...to fight the Germans so they went and I was still left over there.</span> <span id="s98">But when I saw there marching in.</span> <span id="s99">.</span> <span id="s100">in 1939 the first...in the...in the first of September, I was thinking I will not be in Germany and they will be in Poland because I saw they are moving very fast so I started to...to...I went on a train to go home but the train was bumped and then I was going by foot.</span> <span id="s101">I started out the first of September and I came home the 8th of September because by foot we went in night time mostly.</span> <span id="s102">They were...they were bombing us.</span> <span id="s103">They were shooting to us...to the civil people.</span> <span id="s104">I will not tell about this because this was the first nightmare what I saw so many people killed.</span> <span id="s105">I was thinking this will be the worsiest in my life but this wasn't the worsiest.</span> <span id="s106">Later I found out this was not the worsiest.</span> <span id="s107">When I came home, one day later my sister was 12 years...one day later it was her...her birthday and, 12th birthday, the Germans marched into our town.</span> <span id="s108">It was the 9th of September and then...this was her birthday.</span> <span id="s109">And then we knew what was happening and the Kristallnacht over there.</span> <span id="s110">We knew that...we heard...we heard that they are burning in the way...in the marching way, they are burning synagogues.</span> <span id="s111">They pushed in Jews into the ghetto with this...with the...with the synagogue the Jews went to flame and we knew that it comes a disaster.</span> <span id="s112">We were all scared.</span> <span id="s113">My father when I..</span> <span id="s114">.</span> <span id="s115">when I told him I am scared, he says, "Why you are scared?</span> <span id="s116">God is over us."</span> <span id="s117">He...he left everything to God.</span> <span id="s118">"God will save us.</span> <span id="s119">England declared war in the 3rd day of the war and France, they will defeat German."</span> <span id="s120">But they...it started in the beginning very slow.</span> <span id="s121">It started that they caught us in the street.</span> <span id="s122">They took us to dirty work.</span> <span id="s123">They degraded us by slapping in the face, by hitting.</span> <span id="s124">This was the beginning.</span> <span id="s125">Then they started.</span> <span id="s126">They...they started to catch from the streets to...to sent away.</span> <span id="s127">My brother one was sent away, but it wasn't far.</span> <span id="s128">He was working over there something for them, and we found out where he is and then after 2 weeks he came back...uh...then in...starved, but he came back.</span> <span id="s129">And then we were looking only how long we will...and then the stores were closed.</span> <span id="s130">Jews shouldn't have a store.</span> <span id="s131">The lawyers shouldn't practice law, the Jewish lawyers.</span> <span id="s132">The...the...the doctors, the Jewish doctors, shouldn't be doctors.</span> <span id="s133">They shouldn't practice.</span> <span id="s134">This...for what you live?</span> <span id="s135">So I..</span> <span id="s136">.</span> <span id="s137">I with my brother...right now they...bands we had to wear, white bands with blue stars.</span> <span id="s138">It is death sentence if you...we don't wear.</span> <span id="s139">From 6 years everybody has to wear.</span> <span id="s140">So how we can live when we don't have a store?</span> <span id="s141">So I with my brother, we decided with one brother, with Hersh, we decided to travel to take food to Krakow and to bring back things what the...what the farmers need...uh, the public here needs.</span> <span id="s142">So we...we...we didn't tell our parents that we take off after we pass our city, we take off our bands and we go on the train to Krakow.</span> <span id="s143">We didn't tell this because they would not let us, but we risk our lives to make a living for for my...for the family.</span> <span id="s144">It took...it took a year or so.</span> <span id="s145">We were every week going.</span> <span id="s146">And then...then we couldn't go anymore with the train so...because it was very dangerous, so we started Jawisowice kitchen and Jawisowice was already a ghetto.</span> <span id="s147">This was 8 kilometer from...from our town.</span> <span id="s148">It was only... walking distance, it was only 1-1/2 hour but we went with the, because the buses were already confiscated by the Germans, so we went with the...with the horses and , and it was all kind of danger we were what we never told the parents even.</span> <span id="s149">Because they wouldn't let us.</span> <span id="s150">They were starving.</span> <span id="s151">They wouldn't let us.</span> <span id="s152">And then in 1942, the beginning of 1942, it was a struggle.</span> <span id="s153">It was this...I will not tell this everything because it would take til tomorrow.</span> <span id="s154">Uh...so in 1942 in the beginning came in two Gestapo to our home with guns and they say, "Whose the owner of this house?"</span> <span id="s155">So my mother and father...they brought the paper I don't know til now for what they brought the paper to sign, my mother and father should sign that they give this for...for good will to the German government.</span> <span id="s156">So they signed because it was guns pointed.</span> <span id="s157">They signed.</span> <span id="s158">They say, "In 5 minutes you have to go out from this house."</span> <span id="s159">We were living little bit in the suburbs from the town.</span> <span id="s160">Where to go Tyczyn to the center of Tyczyn.</span> <span id="s161">Okay.</span> <span id="s162">To the center of Tyczyn.</span> <span id="s163">We went to the center of Tyczyn.</span> <span id="s164">They gave us in.</span> <span id="s165">.</span> <span id="s166">right now, they stayed a neighbor, a goy Pollack stayed and took the keys from the Germans, so he knew that we will be deported.</span> <span id="s167">He probably applied for the house.</span> <span id="s168">And...and then when we came...we came and we got only one room for the six people we got one room, and a kitchen.</span> <span id="s169">But we were glad that we had the one room.</span> <span id="s170">My...my uncle had already people put in because put in people to every ...who has two, three rooms, they matched in...they put in other families in the one room because it was, it was lack of rooms.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: Who organized that?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: The Jewish .</span> <span id="s173">To manage to have the... Then we had to register.</span> <span id="s174">Then it came contributions.</span> <span id="s175">Everybody...every Jew has to give away what...whatever gold he has, he has to give away.</span> <span id="s176">So my mother took off the wedding ring, the ear rings, and...and everybody had to give.</span> <span id="s177">They were Nazis they had sent us.</span> <span id="s178">Then it came a contribution with money.</span> <span id="s179">We had to deliver this and this much money.</span> <span id="s180">If not, ...uh...they will take 10 people and kill.</span> <span id="s181">Uh...so...so we delivered the...the money to the Gestapo, and it was enough.</span> <span id="s182">The "Kapo delivered and it was enough, but they...they counted.</span> <span id="s183">You can prove to them, they killed off anyway the 10 people.</span> <span id="s184">Then first we had to give away even my when you have to the Germans this.</span> <span id="s185">First it was to search and then they gave a order: Who has to...who is owed the Pollacks money had to give under the death sentence if he will not pay off, and when the Pollacks owed the Jews, they don't have to pay.</span> <span id="s186">So one Pollack went to the Gestapo and said over there that my father owes him hundred...hundred dollars here, not hundred , hundred dollars.</span> <span id="s187">And this wasn't true.</span> <span id="s188">He didn't owe him.</span> <span id="s189">Because he wants to black our...blackmail that we will pay him not to be killed.</span> <span id="s190">So...so from , the President came running to us, and he says: Nafstali...to my father...Nafstali, ...uh...uh...just hide some place because the Gestapo is coming for you because the goy", this goy"" tells over there that you owe him and he says that he came for you to ask the money...for the money, and you told he says when you will not give you the money, I will go to the German...to the German authority, so you told him...he says that you told him I have you in my ass together with the Germans.</span> <span id="s191">And this wasn't true.</span> <span id="s192">He even didn't come to us.</span> <span id="s193">So I was thinking my father will go with the beard, with this, they will kill him.</span> <span id="s194">So I told...I told I will go.</span> <span id="s195">I went to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s196">The whole town was looking that I will never come back because one Gestapo on one side and the other on the other side with rifles and I in the center.</span> <span id="s197">Everybody was crying.</span> <span id="s198">They were thinking they will never see me back.</span> <span id="s199">But when I came over there, then got that.</span> <span id="s200">.</span> <span id="s201">that the Gestapo didn't understand Polish, and he told what my father told it was a lie, and I started to talk to them in German.</span> <span id="s202">And I told them, "Listen, you gave an order that we have to give back.</span> <span id="s203">They blackmail us.</span> <span id="s204">He doesn't have a penny in his... Go to his home.</span> <span id="s205">You will see.</span> <span id="s206">He has I don't know how many children.</span> <span id="s207">They are going with bare foots.</span> <span id="s208">He doesn't...didn't have money even to...he doesn't have.</span> <span id="s209">He owes us in this store money and he never gave us back.</span> <span id="s210">And we couldn't even make a claim because we don't have what to take from him.</span> <span id="s211">Go to his home.</span> <span id="s212">You will see how...how he is lying.</span> <span id="s213">You'll see that he so poor he didn't have rgw hundred dollars is like in this time was 500 "Slotas.</span> <span id="s214">So I told, he didn't have a "slota in his pocket.</span> <span id="s215">But he knows that...he was thinking we will pay to save our lives, and I was talking so nice to them, and he was screaming and they told him, "Shut up," and...and they let me go.</span> <span id="s216">They believed me.</span> <span id="s217">They let me go.</span> <span id="s218">You can't imagine what was happening in the whole town when they saw me alive back.</span> <span id="s219">The whole town was running to me and kissing me because they were thinking I..</span> <span id="s220">.</span> <span id="s221">they will never see me back.</span> <span id="s222">This was in the beginning everything.</span> <span id="s223">Then it was Passover.</span> <span id="s224">This was the last Passover together.</span> <span id="s225">We sit already in this one little room.</span> <span id="s226">My daddy was...was...uh...leading the...the...the , and the first time I saw my father crying, the tears were coming over his beard.</span> <span id="s227">We all looked at each other.</span> <span id="s228">Here we were...had the same thing in mind.</span> <span id="s229">Will we sit together, the next Passover together?</span> <span id="s230">It was already in ghetto, and we never sit together.</span> <span id="s231">This was the last Passover.</span> <span id="s232">And then...then right after Passover came a order: Everybody to the ghetto, to the ghetto, to the Sheslow ghetto.</span> <span id="s233">It was from all towns.</span> <span id="s234">It was going...it was going so many.</span> <span id="s235">It was like a..</span> <span id="s236">.</span> <span id="s237">like a river of people earning the way to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s238">They were killing.</span> <span id="s239">They were...I saw so many people killed, and the family was keeping only together.</span> <span id="s240">I didn't see my uncle with the children.</span> <span id="s241">I didn't see nobody.</span> <span id="s242">Only because we were keeping one...because we hired...uh...a..</span> <span id="s243">.</span> <span id="s244">goy with...with a wagon, with...with...with horses to put some belongings over there, to take to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s245">And I..</span> <span id="s246">.</span> <span id="s247">the first thing what I took was the...the...the writing wall what we made in home for decoration and I painted to every panel, I painted a picture.</span> <span id="s248">This I took with me because to have privacy if we are someplace together with people.</span> <span id="s249">We came to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s250">It was order everybody has to be registered.</span> <span id="s251">If they found somebody on the street, they...they...they will kill.</span> <span id="s252">So everybody had to get a..</span> <span id="s253">.</span> <span id="s254">a room.</span> <span id="s255">My uncles over there, my mother's brothers and my father's sister had already many people so we got a room on a attic.</span> <span id="s256">It was a iron window on the attic and...and we were glad that we have already the room.</span> <span id="s257">First day my brother went out to go to the end for something and they caught him from the street, the Gestapo, to send away.</span> <span id="s258">When we heard...they caught only this time, only men, men and boys, and when we found out I..</span> <span id="s259">.</span> <span id="s260">I with my mother, with my sister, run with a knapsack to bring him, to bring him some food and some clothes.</span> <span id="s261">And my mother when to the , to the head of the...of the Gestapo and she begged him, "I want to give the last kiss of my...to my son and give him this."</span> <span id="s262">So he hit her over...over the head with a whip and she fell on the pavement.</span> <span id="s263">And...and she cried, "I want to give the last kiss to my son."</span> <span id="s264">And we told her, "He will not let you.</span> <span id="s265">Mommy, you come home."</span> <span id="s266">"I will not go away."</span> <span id="s267">My brother from far away, he was already standing about 200 or 300 boys.</span> <span id="s268">He saw my mother on the...felling on the street and he wants to run and they already want him to kill so he couldn't and I saw him from far away wiping the tears.</span> <span id="s269">And they sent him away.</span> <span id="s270">And my mother and I only went to...to deliver to one solder, "Please deliver this to my brother."</span> <span id="s271">I don't know whether he delivered.</span> <span id="s272">I even didn't ask later.</span> <span id="s273">In the meantime, it started selections.</span> <span id="s274">First, they say everybody has to register to work.</span> <span id="s275">The young people!</span> <span id="s276">My mother wasn't old.</span> <span id="s277">She was 57.</span> <span id="s278">My father was 61.</span> <span id="s279">So, they.</span> <span id="s280">.</span> <span id="s281">they wasn't...they wasn't allowed to register.</span> <span id="s282">And I didn't want to register.</span> <span id="s283">I told, "I want to go together with you.</span> <span id="s284">I will not."</span> <span id="s285">So my mother says, "You have a little sister.</span> <span id="s286">You have the brothers.</span> <span id="s287">One brother they sent away.</span> <span id="s288">Maybe you will need something to send him or something.</span> <span id="s289">Just...just please be the mother for the children."</span> <span id="s290">So she...it was crying this, but I had to go because she...she says you bed the of your sister because her...her...they will kill her right away.</span> <span id="s291">She is a little girl.</span> <span id="s292">So I..</span> <span id="s293">.</span> <span id="s294">I went.</span> <span id="s295">I went with tears and we registered to work.</span> <span id="s296">As soon we registered to work, they made a old ghetto and a new ghetto.</span> <span id="s297">The old ghetto is the people what they are not registered to work, and we were in the young ghetto.</span> <span id="s298">The ghetto was so crowded, 2, 3 families in one...in one room.</span> <span id="s299">The rooms were big, but one room, so I was glad that I have my dividing wall, that I have some privacy.</span> <span id="s300">And then it came....uh...we...we didn't see.</span> <span id="s301">We were already divided with the parents, and we saw through the window already the transports.</span> <span id="s302">Every day was a transport, thousands of people.</span> <span id="s303">It was 220,000 people registered...uh...Jews registered in the ghetto and every...every day was...and we saw through the window my uncle.</span> <span id="s304">He was 41, my father's brother.</span> <span id="s305">He was 41.</span> <span id="s306">She was 39, his wife.</span> <span id="s307">And the 6 children.</span> <span id="s308">The two were twins.</span> <span id="s309">They were from a but one died for a triple, but one died 8 days before it was born, but they were already 6 years old.</span> <span id="s310">Six children.</span> <span id="s311">They are already to be sent away.</span> <span id="s312">Young people!</span> <span id="s313">And they looked up to our window.</span> <span id="s314">They were crying and we couldn't go down.</span> <span id="s315">We were crying.</span> <span id="s316">And they were sent away.</span> <span id="s317">Every...every child had one...one knapsack, the 6 years old.</span> <span id="s318">And then they saw they are taking away on the truck the knapsacks, so my aunt...my aunt took quick out from the knapsack one dress more to put on the children to have to change because she saw that they taking away.</span> <span id="s319">After they left from this , I saw the Polish...the Polish people taking apart from the...from the truck, the things and taking for themselves, putting in the pockets and laughing and the Polish police.</span> <span id="s320">We saw this that...that even when they take with them, they don't have nothing from this.</span> <span id="s321">And so...and it was heartbreaking to see my....... (end of tape 1, side A)...to our home.</span> <span id="s322">We lived in one town.</span> <span id="s323">And then...then we...we were taken every day to work.</span> <span id="s324">I, with my sister, my brother, and we didn't know nothing about the other brother.</span> <span id="s325">Where he was sent.</span> <span id="s326">Then it came time that they...that we heared that my...that the street my parents where they are, they are going away.</span> <span id="s327">They are sent.</span> <span id="s328">.</span> <span id="s329">they will be sent away.</span> <span id="s330">And every day when we went from work, we tried to exchange with the Poles on the way because a Gestapo was in the front and a Gestapo in the back, but...but we took out things to exchange for bread for something to bring to the ghetto because they didn't give us food.</span> <span id="s331">But we had to manage by ourself.</span> <span id="s332">So, and I smuggled into my parents some...some food, and then when I heared that they are going to send my parents, I went....I told my sister you go.</span> <span id="s333">You go to work and when they call...when they call you, you will answer and when they will call my name, you will answer too because it was 200 girls going to the same place to work.</span> <span id="s334">So.</span> <span id="s335">.</span> <span id="s336">so she went and I..</span> <span id="s337">.</span> <span id="s338">I will try to...I was so naive.</span> <span id="s339">I was think I will try to save my parents.</span> <span id="s340">And I went...I wouldn't...I said goodbye to my...to my mother and she says...she says to me, "Please don't cry.</span> <span id="s341">I made...I made a promise to God that I will not one tear shed by saying goodbye because...because in the...maybe...maybe he will save my children.</span> <span id="s342">And be brave."</span> <span id="s343">And I wrote about this a poem also because about everything I wrote later poems.</span> <span id="s344">My father fell in my arms, and then my mother was taken away.</span> <span id="s345">My father fell in my arms.</span> <span id="s346">He was crying.</span> <span id="s347">And the...the...the SS men started to hit him over the head and he says, this what I saw, the last of my father.</span> <span id="s348">A young SS man hitting him over the head and chasing him to the .</span> <span id="s349">And then later I went to the and I saw...I didn't see them.</span> <span id="s350">They probably saw me because I was between the Germans...between...and I went to one Gestapo.</span> <span id="s351">I kissed him in the hand, and I told, "Save my parents.</span> <span id="s352">We are working all and we will keep my parents."</span> <span id="s353">And it was so silly.</span> <span id="s354">And he says, "If you don't go down from this place, from this, I will kill you and your parents in your eyes."</span> <span id="s355">So I was thinking I will...so I went down.</span> <span id="s356">I went away because I was thinking...I didn't know they are sent to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s357">I was thinking they are sent to work some place.</span> <span id="s358">So this was the last what I saw my father and mother.</span> <span id="s359">And then I went again next day to work.</span> <span id="s360">And we were working and in the meantime it came...it came...uh...uh.</span> <span id="s361">one, somebody came from this place where my brother was over there sent away and he is working on the...on the.</span> <span id="s362">.</span> <span id="s363">uh...on the...this means on the...on the airport.</span> <span id="s364">He is working over there for the Germans in the other town, from "Jowiszowice was maybe about 20 kilometers.</span> <span id="s365">So I..</span> <span id="s366">.</span> <span id="s367">I decided I will go and bring him something...food.</span> <span id="s368">I will take off my band and I will smuggle myself out and I will...and I will go over there and I will dress myself nice.</span> <span id="s369">I will dress myself in a hat, in a..</span> <span id="s370">in a nice dress, and I will go like a..</span> <span id="s371">.</span> <span id="s372">a..</span> <span id="s373">.</span> <span id="s374">like not a Jew over there, and I will bring...so my brother says, Maybe I will see the last time my brother.</span> <span id="s375">I want to go too."</span> <span id="s376">So I told him, ""Hinue" I called him "Hinue, it was his name Hersh.</span> <span id="s377">"Hinue they will recognize that you are Jew.</span> <span id="s378">He says, "No.</span> <span id="s379">I will dress myself nice, and I..</span> <span id="s380">.</span> <span id="s381">and I will go with you."</span> <span id="s382">I..</span> <span id="s383">.</span> <span id="s384">We looked like it.</span> <span id="s385">I had black eyes and I had green eyes and this saved me not one time.</span> <span id="s386">And he had...but we looked like, but he says I will go.</span> <span id="s387">So we went.</span> <span id="s388">But wherever I went to a store to buy something for my brother, to bring him over there, they didn't want sell us so I told to Hinue, "They recognize that we are Jewish.</span> <span id="s389">They don't want to sell us, the fools, nothing."</span> <span id="s390">Then it went the with Gestapo and the...the coachman was a Pollack and he told him something and I told to Hinue, "You know, he told...he told them something and they looked back.</span> <span id="s391">This was Gestapo with helmets.</span> <span id="s392">They...uh...He told that we are Jews.</span> <span id="s393">We were without bands, nice dress.</span> <span id="s394">So he says, "Let's go in this little street."</span> <span id="s395">And we hear behind us with the rifles and this means Jew Stay still.</span> <span id="s396">So we came back to them and I started to talk Polish.</span> <span id="s397">I made believe that I don't understand German because the Pollacks didn't understand and I told, "Listen.</span> <span id="s398">They...they take us for Jews.</span> <span id="s399">We are not Jews."</span> <span id="s400">So he says, "You are not Jewish, but he is Jewish."</span> <span id="s401">So I told, "He is my brother.</span> <span id="s402">If he's Jewish, I'm Jewish, but he's not.</span> <span id="s403">He's not Jewish.</span> <span id="s404">They opened my pocketbook.</span> <span id="s405">In my pocketbook, I had a powder...a powder case.</span> <span id="s406">Under the powder case I had my father and mother with a beard and my mother in a..</span> <span id="s407">.</span> <span id="s408">in a wig because this was from the "Meldacot, from the German "Meldacot.</span> <span id="s409">I kept this everywhere with me.</span> <span id="s410">I kept this with me.</span> <span id="s411">And they opened the powder, I was thinking that's it.</span> <span id="s412">They will not...they will see my father and mother.</span> <span id="s413">They will know that I am not Jewish...that I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s414">But they opened so the powder covered and they didn't see.</span> <span id="s415">I saved my brother because then I..</span> <span id="s416">.</span> <span id="s417">I..</span> <span id="s418">.</span> <span id="s419">they told they will look in his pants because in Poland, the Polish people weren't circumcised and he was circumcised and I heared in German, they say they were looking in his pants and they pushed and I didn't want to go away from him.</span> <span id="s420">So they pushed me.</span> <span id="s421">I fell in the...in the dust...and the hat fell down and I..</span> <span id="s422">.</span> <span id="s423">and I started to scream to them in Polish, and I told how...how animals you are, you Germans.</span> <span id="s424">I was thinking you are educated people so you first come in...in and see or I am Jewish, come to this village, I told some village what is very far.</span> <span id="s425">And come to...to my village and you will see that I am Polish.</span> <span id="s426">And I saved with my screaming at them so fresh.</span> <span id="s427">I saved the life of my brother.</span> <span id="s428">I later was very sorry that I saved his life because he died in a very awful way later.</span> <span id="s429">And I..</span> <span id="s430">I..</span> <span id="s431">.</span> <span id="s432">and I and this time, my brother was very angry at me.</span> <span id="s433">He says, "Why you saved my life?</span> <span id="s434">Why you didn't go?</span> <span id="s435">You left over there a sister alone, and you...you...you could be killed tonight."</span> <span id="s436">So I told him but I saved your life.</span> <span id="s437">He says, "One time, " , but we have to remember over there is a sister and when one of us get killed, the other has...some of us has to survive to tell this story.</span> <span id="s438">This...but he didn't go anymore, because over there was a and I was...went alone.</span> <span id="s439">I went alone and I teared out...from the field, I teared out some carrots to bring him and some money and some...some clothes.</span> <span id="s440">When I came over there and I saw him, he was not the same brother.</span> <span id="s441">He was so thin with bare foot and then when...when...the...the...the officer what he took care of the...he was a Jew and I went to him to please let me see my brother.</span> <span id="s442">I am Jewish, but I want to see him.</span> <span id="s443">So he says, "Okay.</span> <span id="s444">Go.</span> <span id="s445">Go here in the...in the...in this little hill and hide and see him, but you don't have time more than 5 minutes."</span> <span id="s446">We fell in each other's arms and he knew already that my parents were sent away.</span> <span id="s447">That our parents were sent away.</span> <span id="s448">We cried.</span> <span id="s449">I gave him the carrots.</span> <span id="s450">He ate.</span> <span id="s451">He says, "I am like an animal.</span> <span id="s452">You see with...with the dirt I eat because we eat here grass. "</span> <span id="s453">He...so he says, "I'm...I'm now like a animal eating without washing.</span> <span id="s454">I am so hungry."</span> <span id="s455">And it was only 5 minutes we saw each other.</span> <span id="s456">We only cried.</span> <span id="s457">We didn't have time even...we couldn't bring out a word.</span> <span id="s458">Then I go...went back and met with my brother because my brother hid over there...the other brother hid over there and waited for me.</span> <span id="s459">And we came back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s460">And that time they send that brother...the brother didn't want to know where they will send him.</span> <span id="s461">The sent him back.</span> <span id="s462">I wrote about this in the...I will not repeat this.</span> <span id="s463">They sent him back to the ghetto and I wrote in the diary.</span> <span id="s464">I have everything written down.</span> <span id="s465">And then in awhile, they sent him also away from over there to the Treblinka.</span> <span id="s466">And he was about 2 months he was in the ghetto working, and we were working other places.</span> <span id="s467">From the 220,000 Jews was left by the end only 2,000.</span> <span id="s468">It was going transports every day.</span> <span id="s469">We were beaten up.</span> <span id="s470">We were...we were always by the work.</span> <span id="s471">One time the , he...he hit only girls...girls, not boys, only girls.</span> <span id="s472">And one time I was packed with things to take out to change for...for food, and I heard the is over there, so I went back quick to throw down...in the ghetto, to throw down the things because I knew he is...the...is very strict over there....to throw down.</span> <span id="s473">We came back.</span> <span id="s474">He...Well, he says, Where you go?"</span> <span id="s475">I told, "To my group.</span> <span id="s476">Here is my group."</span> <span id="s477">He gave me with the...with the whip over the...over the face and...and...and he said, "Stay.</span> <span id="s478">Stay here with your sister."</span> <span id="s479">So we stand...and we knew we will get 25 because he gave 25 and in Europe nobody was wearing pants.</span> <span id="s480">No girl was wearing pants, only skirts.</span> <span id="s481">And he picks up the skirts and on the...on the...on the silky panties he gives 25 with the whip.</span> <span id="s482">When he gave me the 25 I went to him and begged him not to hit my sister.</span> <span id="s483">She is only 14 years old.</span> <span id="s484">She will not be able to take it, the 25.</span> <span id="s485">I was biting my...my lips not to scream, not to give him the satisfaction when he was hitting me, but then I went to him and I kissed his hand and I begged him, "Hit me once more and don't hit my sister."</span> <span id="s486">But they kept me by the wall and they started to hit my sister.</span> <span id="s487">Then I was screaming to get off my sister, but my sister didn't get 25 because every whip she was so young, a child 14 years, every whip was with blood.</span> <span id="s488">So he gave her...and she...she told me just last week, she had only six.</span> <span id="s489">I didn't know how many, but.</span> <span id="s490">.</span> <span id="s491">but she had only six times.</span> <span id="s492">But we couldn't sit a long time later.</span> <span id="s493">And she...she was laying always, when she went in bed, she was laying on the...on the belly.</span> <span id="s494">But the next day, we had to go...we had to go off anyway to work, so we went to work every day.</span> <span id="s495">And by the work we were hit too.</span> <span id="s496">One time a hit me.</span> <span id="s497">Good I had a coat because it was winter.</span> <span id="s498">So he hit me with his cane, so he broke on me the cane in few...in few pieces.</span> <span id="s499">And...and then he called me to the office and he says, "Tomorrow you will have to bring me other cane because I broke the cane.</span> <span id="s500">If not I will...I will kill you tomorrow."</span> <span id="s501">So the whole...when I came back to the ghetto, the whole ghetto was looking the cellars and the...for a cane to bring me the cane and... because...and they brought me about 10 canes.</span> <span id="s502">So beautiful, some of them were silver things what the people left what they were sent away.</span> <span id="s503">.</span> <span id="s504">to give him and I gave him the whole thing...10 canes because he broke on me the cane.</span> <span id="s505">Such things!</span> <span id="s506">They degraded us so, I was not caring anymore, but I promised my mother that I will take care the rest of my family so I..</span> <span id="s507">.</span> <span id="s508">I didn't care to be killed already.</span> <span id="s509">Then... then my brother, my last brother, was sent away.</span> <span id="s510">And this brother...and this brother what I saved his life, he came one time home and he says, "Mina, I heard...I heard that they will go to...to liquidate woman in ghettos.</span> <span id="s511">I will not let myself anymore tear apart.</span> <span id="s512">That's it.</span> <span id="s513">We are enough teared apart.</span> <span id="s514">We will run away, but I have to look for you for a place because with girls I can't run without a place.</span> <span id="s515">So he went out.</span> <span id="s516">He took 2 weeks til he came back.</span> <span id="s517">I was thinking they killed him already because he took off the band and everything and he went to look for a..</span> <span id="s518">.</span> <span id="s519">he with his boyfriend.</span> <span id="s520">They were both Yeshivas...Yeshiva boys, but in this time, they didn't wear already the , nothing.</span> <span id="s521">They went and they found a place so we...we took...we... the day what we had to go away to...we were to meet outside, uh.</span> <span id="s522">.</span> <span id="s523">outside ""Jawiszowice, we told him one this place we will meet.</span> <span id="s524">So we stood first my sister from the...from the...when we went from work, then I, and my brother from other place, we met over there...uh...in...in this place where we told we will meet and we went night time over there.</span> <span id="s525">This was near Tyczyn.</span> <span id="s526">This means Tyczyn was our town, and where they found the place, it was in a village, but it was...by our...more walking distance from our town from Jawiszowice, about 3 hours walking.</span> <span id="s527">They found it a place by a..</span> <span id="s528">.</span> <span id="s529">by a goy what he five children and they were very poor.</span> <span id="s530">And this time wasn't...wasn't law that if somebody keeps Jews, they get killed together with the Jews, but we promised him to give him every month nice money.</span> <span id="s531">They made with him arrangements and for the food what he will give us, they...uh...knew he will pay him whatever he spends.</span> <span id="s532">So we...uh...but they were in the other place, the 2 boys.</span> <span id="s533">We were in one place, but they were waiting til they will make for us a bunker.</span> <span id="s534">They made for us a bunker.</span> <span id="s535">They made for us a bunker from the stable to go down on a ladder.</span> <span id="s536">How they were working, you can't imagine to take out so much ground from over there.</span> <span id="s537">The stable was outside.</span> <span id="s538">The...the...uh...the bunker was outside, but the walking in was to the stable inside.</span> <span id="s539">So it was a bunker what we couldn't...uh...uh...walk straight only put down, and they made a bench over there to be able to sit a whole day and for night time when the children will go to sleep, they will let us out to the stable to sleep.</span> <span id="s540">And the stable was...I wrote about this too a poem and in the diary too...and my brother and this boy were an hour walking distance through the forest.</span> <span id="s541">When they...they had the other place.</span> <span id="s542">When they came to visit us once a month I told them don't go.</span> <span id="s543">You can be caught.</span> <span id="s544">He says Germans are not here.</span> <span id="s545">And we go only when it is not the moonlight.</span> <span id="s546">It is...when it is the dark light we go through the...nobody will find us.</span> <span id="s547">They came to us three times.</span> <span id="s548">The third time they were caught by the Poles, by 19 Poles.</span> <span id="s549">And they beat them up so badly.</span> <span id="s550">My brother, they cut...they cut the throat, but they didn't kill him... only little he was cut.</span> <span id="s551">And the beat him so up that he will black blue old...old.</span> <span id="s552">And I know they caught him only 5 minutes from us...not 5 minutes...5 minutes from us they started to chase them the two boys, but they run in the opposite way because they didn't want bring them to our place so they were caught only...only 10 minutes from us.</span> <span id="s553">The boy, the boyfriend of...of my...of my brother, he...he'll...they...they throwed out his eye...his eye was hanging over the face and they were chained to take to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s554">And the Gestapo they...later I found out, that on the Gestapo, the Poles, the 19 Poles, told that they have some place two sisters because they knew us because they came to our store to town...to the town from the villages.</span> <span id="s555">They knew that my brother has two sisters.</span> <span id="s556">Over there, they were tortured to...by the Gestapo, to say where the sisters are.</span> <span id="s557">Sure they will not tell because we are alive.</span> <span id="s558">And then they...they were token...take to be killed.</span> <span id="s559">To tell you about the...the bunker, we didn't have air to.</span> <span id="s560">It was lack of oxygen.</span> <span id="s561">We had a carbide lamp, but a little light over there couldn't light nothing.</span> <span id="s562">Not...not a candle, because it was not oxygen enough.</span> <span id="s563">Only the carbide.</span> <span id="s564">They goy what he kept us.</span> <span id="s565">They are such anti-semitic goy, but they were very religion goys.</span> <span id="s566">They...they...uh...they said they charged us so much money and they gave us so little food.</span> <span id="s567">And my sister one time she...she got fever.</span> <span id="s568">Two weeks she couldn't recognize me even.</span> <span id="s569">She was talking from the fever and we were under the ground in this...in this bunker and from night time we went down up to the stable to sleep and over there was a cow...a cow and a..</span> <span id="s570">.</span> <span id="s571">and a goat and a..</span> <span id="s572">.</span> <span id="s573">and chickens and rabbits and we were sleeping on a bundle of straw.</span> <span id="s574">When the children went to bed and they will not know that we are over there.</span> <span id="s575">He was...was so awful to us.</span> <span id="s576">this goy.</span> <span id="s577">He was starving us, and he was telling us, "You ate enough.</span> <span id="s578">When I came to your store the...the chickens and just everything, the smell that came Friday, the with this everything, this smelled so nice.</span> <span id="s579">Now you will little bit starve.</span> <span id="s580">You will be humans.</span> <span id="s581">We knew that he can kill us.</span> <span id="s582">Nobody will know even.</span> <span id="s583">So we told him because he was a very religion Christian, we told him that after the war we will change to Christianity.</span> <span id="s584">And we were thinking future Christians he will not kill.</span> <span id="s585">He is a religion.</span> <span id="s586">They went every Sunday.</span> <span id="s587">They went to the church.</span> <span id="s588">Once a month he went to...to confession.</span> <span id="s589">But the confession in teaching the...the...the church wasn't teaching.</span> <span id="s590">The...the priest wasn't teaching.</span> <span id="s591">He told them he has two...two...two girls, Jewish girls that he asked who are they.</span> <span id="s592">Glucksman.</span> <span id="s593">They will convert to...because we were Glucksman from home.</span> <span id="s594">They will convert to Christianity.</span> <span id="s595">He knew that my father's daughters will never change to Christianity.</span> <span id="s596">So he told him so.</span> <span id="s597">When you make a crime, you will be forgiven.</span> <span id="s598">But if you five innocent plans will go from this world, you will be always in Hell burning.</span> <span id="s599">We didn't know what he told him, but when he came from this confession, we saw he is very angry and "Go to .</span> <span id="s600">I don't want you Jews and this and this."</span> <span id="s601">I told him, "Listen, we didn't come to you with a gun to take us.</span> <span id="s602">We don't have where to go.</span> <span id="s603">Ghetto is already liquidated because the ghetto was few...few weeks later when we are run away, ghetto was liquidated.</span> <span id="s604">They make one grave and the 2,000 were killed over there in...in this grave and the the goy came, this goy came and he said the grave is moving up and down three days already because it was probably over there Jews already what...what they were still alive there buried.</span> <span id="s605">And just 4 weeks later, my father's cousin, 32 years old and his wife and children, 3 or 4, this I don't remember, were caught by the...by the Poles to they were hiding.</span> <span id="s606">They even didn't go.</span> <span id="s607">I didn't know that they didn't go in the ghetto because it was such a mishmash in this ghetto.</span> <span id="s608">Who...who...only the nearest family, you knew where they are.</span> <span id="s609">And this was my father's cousin.</span> <span id="s610">So, they...they caught him.</span> <span id="s611">They hit him and the little girl said to the mother...she was 8 years old...because they got married very young.</span> <span id="s612">So she says to the mother, "Don't cry.</span> <span id="s613">We will go.</span> <span id="s614">We will not suffer anymore in this hole.</span> <span id="s615">We will go to Heaven when they kill us."</span> <span id="s616">So the goy" came home to me and he said, "They will not go to Heaven.</span> <span id="s617">They are Jews.</span> <span id="s618">They are not Christians.</span> <span id="s619">They will go to Hell, not to Heaven."</span> <span id="s620">They were laughing at this, but the little girl told...she...she was the comforting the father and mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s622">You can go back to the story now.</span> <span id="s623">You said...you were saying you thought you would go out to be killed with your brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: When he was...they were taken to death, I knew everything.</span> <span id="s625">It is now on?</span> <span id="s626">I knew everything what is going on because they came every minute to tell us what is going on with my brother.</span> <span id="s627">And...and we want to go.</span> <span id="s628">My sister says.</span> <span id="s629">"Let's go.</span> <span id="s630">Let's go and be killed here.</span> <span id="s631">Anyway we will not live.</span> <span id="s632">Let's be killed together with them."</span> <span id="s633">So I told her, "Sabina", You know what they will do us?</span> <span id="s634">We are girls.</span> <span id="s635">They will rape us and they will...and they will dirty us up and then they will take us to the...to the Germans to be killed."</span> <span id="s636">But we were going out from our minds.</span> <span id="s637">I was thinking something we have to do to occupy...the whole time when we were over there, I taught her everything what I remembered because she had only 6...6 public schools finish, and then she couldn't go anymore because the war started.</span> <span id="s638">She was 12.</span> <span id="s639">So I taught her everything by memory what I remember...what I remembered and I tell her stories and I told her...I make up stories to tell her to occupy her.</span> <span id="s640">She was sick 2 weeks and she didn't...couldn't...she couldn't recognize me and I couldn't even take a doctor...nothing... because we were...so I..</span> <span id="s641">.</span> <span id="s642">like here, it's aspirin.</span> <span id="s643">Over there, it was other name of this.</span> <span id="s644">I sent him for the aspirin, and I begged him, "Make something warm for her.</span> <span id="s645">Something because they cooked for us potatoes, and they gave us for a whole day over there to the whole over there the potatoes and...uh...and...uh...she couldn't swallow this.</span> <span id="s646">She was sick.</span> <span id="s647">So one time I went...when we were up in the.</span> <span id="s648">.</span> <span id="s649">in the...so I was thinking I have to... meat...we didn't have the whole time...they were starving us.</span> <span id="s650">We paid much money, and they were starving us.</span> <span id="s651">So I told her, "Sabina, I have something to do.</span> <span id="s652">Something to give you."</span> <span id="s653">She said, "I can't swallow.</span> <span id="s654">I can't swallow the potatoes."</span> <span id="s655">And I was think she will die over there.</span> <span id="s656">I went upstairs and they were chickens and chickens...little chickens.</span> <span id="s657">So I was thinking, I will kill one chick.</span> <span id="s658">One chick for her.</span> <span id="s659">So I..</span> <span id="s660">.</span> <span id="s661">I..</span> <span id="s662">.</span> <span id="s663">I never killed nothing in my life, so I took a stone and I..</span> <span id="s664">.</span> <span id="s665">and I hit the chicken over the head and I killed the chicken and I went in the...in the bunker and I over there, I made from...from tooth no...uh...polish...polish...shoe polish, from...from the deck, I made with a virus...and I cleaned up the kitchen.</span> <span id="s666">.</span> <span id="s667">the chicken.</span> <span id="s668">I cleaned up the chicken.</span> <span id="s669">I cleaned up the bones and I buried over there inside in the ground and over there we had always wore it sometimes dripped from the walls.</span> <span id="s670">It dripped from this, so we had always wore this.</span> <span id="s671">So I cleaned this up, and I cut up little pieces and I put over ... I put little pieces in little water.</span> <span id="s672">It was so hygiene.</span> <span id="s673">Don't ask.</span> <span id="s674">And I made this for her.</span> <span id="s675">Then she started to fight with me.</span> <span id="s676">If you will not eat, I will not eat.</span> <span id="s677">So I told her, Sabina, I ate.</span> <span id="s678">.</span> <span id="s679">I ate the potatoes.</span> <span id="s680">I couldn't tell her that I wouldn't be able to take this in my mouth because I killed this.</span> <span id="s681">It was...my hands and feet were shaking when I killed this chicken.</span> <span id="s682">So...but I had to save her life somehow.</span> <span id="s683">So I made her the whole chicken.</span> <span id="s684">I cut up in little pieces and I made it over the carbide lamp so to give her something.</span> <span id="s685">And...uh...this and one time...one time, she passed out because we didn't have air to breath.</span> <span id="s686">Sometimes we had "hair black, hair black even from lack of oxygen so I saw she is passing out because when he.</span> <span id="s687">.</span> <span id="s688">when he...when we went to the.</span> <span id="s689">.</span> <span id="s690">uh...to the bunker, it was a little thing to pull through, a little opening, and he put on this dirt on a little dirt and then a big stone and I saw that she will pass out when I don't get some air in.</span> <span id="s691">So I went...I went...I went on the ladder.</span> <span id="s692">I couldn't pick up my hand because it was very narrow to go in.</span> <span id="s693">I went on the ladder and with my head.</span> <span id="s694">I don't know how I did...the stone was maybe by 1 yard big and by a half yard.</span> <span id="s695">How I did this I don't know.</span> <span id="s696">I don't know til now.</span> <span id="s697">When...when...in.</span> <span id="s698">.</span> <span id="s699">uh.</span> <span id="s700">.</span> <span id="s701">I pulled off the stone and I came for her.</span> <span id="s702">I dragged her over the ladder, up to the and I closed quick the door from the...from the stable because there were laying children around back and forth in the hallway.</span> <span id="s703">And I dragged her up to get some air.</span> <span id="s704">She came to herself.</span> <span id="s705">And he came in.</span> <span id="s706">He saw the door is closed so he knocked on the door.</span> <span id="s707">And he saw us.</span> <span id="s708">How you went out?</span> <span id="s709">Who helped you to take off the stone?</span> <span id="s710">So I told him, "Jesus helped us.</span> <span id="s711">Don't you know?</span> <span id="s712">Jesus helped us.</span> <span id="s713">He...he was sorry we didn't have with what to breath.</span> <span id="s714">He was sorry.</span> <span id="s715">He helped us.</span> <span id="s716">He told us go out."</span> <span id="s717">This was such a primitive goy.</span> <span id="s718">He believed in this, you know.</span> <span id="s719">He believed that it is impossible a human-being should be able to pick this up alone.</span> <span id="s720">So he.</span> <span id="s721">.</span> <span id="s722">he.</span> <span id="s723">.</span> <span id="s724">uh...he was very dumb.</span> <span id="s725">He didn't know how to write and read.</span> <span id="s726">When he came from this concentration, I saw that this taught him something and this also small town.</span> <span id="s727">He knew my father and Saturday he went with that with the garden with the to the synagogue with beard and .</span> <span id="s728">He knew.</span> <span id="s729">He saw him going to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s730">So...so he knew that his daughter will never...that we fool him only.</span> <span id="s731">So he told him this, but he didn't tell me what he told the...I knew that something he felt.</span> <span id="s732">And understanding that, you see, understanding that the Russians went back and forth with 6 months to fight, so back and forth they moved back, and they started to come nearer.</span> <span id="s733">And when they started to come nearer, he started to be good with us.</span> <span id="s734">So I told...and I knew it was coming the second time the...soon he will go to other confession.</span> <span id="s735">It is almost...almost a month.</span> <span id="s736">So I told him, "Tell me the truth.</span> <span id="s737">What priest told you.</span> <span id="s738">I know you came very hungry from the priest, from the confession.</span> <span id="s739">He told me what I want and he didn't make up these words because he wouldn't know how to compare his children to five innocent plants.</span> <span id="s740">He wouldn't be able this to...to compare so I knew this not his words.</span> <span id="s741">He told me...I with my sister looked at us.</span> <span id="s742">.</span> <span id="s743">at each each other and we.</span> <span id="s744">.</span> <span id="s745">we thought...how it is possible he told them to kill.</span> <span id="s746">He will go the second time.</span> <span id="s747">He will see he doesn't understand that crime will be forgiven and you five innocent...uh...will go from this world because of these two Jewish girls, he will be always in Hell.</span> <span id="s748">He will go second time.</span> <span id="s749">He will tell him he will see that he didn't understand.</span> <span id="s750">So I told him listen I will tell you...he bought us...uh...the...uh...Jesus.</span> <span id="s751">We were waiting this Jesus.</span> <span id="s752">He bought us this.</span> <span id="s753">We had to pay him for this but we were worrying.</span> <span id="s754">We didn't have a choice.</span> <span id="s755">So he...I told him...Listen go to other priest, to the other confession.</span> <span id="s756">We will see they are both sons of God...the both...every...every...everyone is a son of God.</span> <span id="s757">So go...go to other...to other town.</span> <span id="s758">Over there I knew they don't...the priest at least doesn't know my father because it was the other town.</span> <span id="s759">And it was the same direction.</span> <span id="s760">He listened to me.</span> <span id="s761">He went and he brought us back rosaries and books and I..</span> <span id="s762">.</span> <span id="s763">we had to pay for this...and.</span> <span id="s764">.</span> <span id="s765">the...the... priest will come to convert us right now after the war.</span> <span id="s766">Now he can come and God but the.</span> <span id="s767">.</span> <span id="s768">the...right now after the war he will come to convert us.</span> <span id="s769">Okay.</span> <span id="s770">I didn't believe that we will live until after the war.</span> <span id="s771">But after my brother died...after they killed him, I saw that we will go out from our mind so I told myself, we have something...I have something to occupy my sister.</span> <span id="s772">I have something to do.</span> <span id="s773">So I told him to buy copy books.</span> <span id="s774">He bought the copy books and we started to write a diary.</span> <span id="s775">That's why I have a diary.</span> <span id="s776">We were under this ground 20 and a half months, hiding, in terrible conditions.</span> <span id="s777">I had this in the diary written down.</span> <span id="s778">We had to work too.</span> <span id="s779">Sometimes they gave us work and we had to work.</span> <span id="s780">But we made from our old things what we had hidden.</span> <span id="s781">.</span> <span id="s782">old things, we made from...from...uh...pillow cases for this we made some scarves and I told him that I want dye.</span> <span id="s783">For what?</span> <span id="s784">I want to make myself some dresses, me and my sister.</span> <span id="s785">So he.</span> <span id="s786">.</span> <span id="s787">he says, "Who sees you."</span> <span id="s788">But we had always, you see, in Europe, you didn't wear cotton dresses.</span> <span id="s789">You wear all silk or wool and when we go down from the ladder, up and down, it tears the dresses.</span> <span id="s790">It was delicate.</span> <span id="s791">It tears.</span> <span id="s792">So we had to have something from...from cotton.</span> <span id="s793">So...from sheets, we made something so I told him we havse to make myself...ourself, two dresses, cotton dresses.</span> <span id="s794">So I..</span> <span id="s795">I..</span> <span id="s796">.</span> <span id="s797">I told him...we sewed this by hand with machine stitches but by hand, so we told him to bring us dye.</span> <span id="s798">So he says, "What you need dye?</span> <span id="s799">Who will see you?"</span> <span id="s800">But we were like for ourself buy...buy us 10 package this dye.</span> <span id="s801">I gave him money.</span> <span id="s802">He bought.</span> <span id="s803">So I told, "I don't like this color.</span> <span id="s804">Buy me red."</span> <span id="s805">He bought me red.</span> <span id="s806">I had put together few...few colors so I started to make for sale because I saw the money will go soon out.</span> <span id="s807">We didn't have a fortune.</span> <span id="s808">We have to do something.</span> <span id="s809">We started to make skirts, " skirts.</span> <span id="s810">No, the wear to the churches, they wear over scarves, brown scarves.</span> <span id="s811">We started to make from "dommers.</span> <span id="s812">It was like a design.</span> <span id="s813">We started to make scarves to sale.</span> <span id="s814">We started to make all kind of things for him to sale and we...we dyed this.</span> <span id="s815">Over there in the...in the bunker camp because we had enough water over there.</span> <span id="s816">We sometimes had to take off some buckets of water from over there because it would...it would cover us the water.</span> <span id="s817">So...so...we...we...we couldn't dry this in this stable.</span> <span id="s818">We couldn't dry this in the bunker because it will never dry.</span> <span id="s819">We dried this under us when we went to sleep...under us on the straw with our bodies.</span> <span id="s820">This was our life for 20 and a half months.</span> <span id="s821">To tell you the...the...that deaths...how many deaths I saw in the...in the...in the ghetto in my eyes killed, how they teared out children from the mother's hand and they throwed to the German shepherds, how the... This was in the ghetto before... before we went over to .</span> <span id="s822">It was by ten or maybe more in the...in the with little , they were someplace in a barrack.</span> <span id="s823">They were taken every day to work.</span> <span id="s824">We were then working on the railroad tracks because the railroad was bombed that we had to put new railroad tracks and this boys had to pick up this.</span> <span id="s825">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s826">There were already orphans because parents were already sended away.</span> <span id="s827">They were hungry.</span> <span id="s828">And one fell and the Gestapo kicked him between the feet.</span> <span id="s829">And I went to him and I want to give him my...my lunch what I took with me.</span> <span id="s830">He says, "I don't want.</span> <span id="s831">I want my mommy, my daddy."</span> <span id="s832">And I hurt so much.</span> <span id="s833">He hit me.</span> <span id="s834">It hurt so much.</span> <span id="s835">He kicked me.</span> <span id="s836">I don't know what they did to him.</span> <span id="s837">He couldn't stand up.</span> <span id="s838">In a while his voice disappeared.</span> <span id="s839">Probably sent away or killed, I don't know.</span> <span id="s840">They were someplace in the barrack.</span> <span id="s841">It was a time when they want to barrack us, our group.</span> <span id="s842">When we were in the ghetto, in the barrack, my brother's group we ran away from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s843">We run away.</span> <span id="s844">We didn't want to be in the barracks, barracked.</span> <span id="s845">We run away, and then later we came back because we didn't have a place to be.</span> <span id="s846">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s847">We looked everyday the dead in the eyes.</span> <span id="s848">I can't tell you everything what was going on because it would take til tomorrow.</span> <span id="s849">But I..</span> <span id="s850">.</span> <span id="s851">I tell you only fragments from this.</span> <span id="s852">It was a little boy 9 years old.</span> <span id="s853">In a ghetto she was 12 years old.</span> <span id="s854">They were left alone.</span> <span id="s855">They were working together with us.</span> <span id="s856">And it was...it was...uh... before we ran away.</span> <span id="s857">It was the...the...one time the little boy worked with us.</span> <span id="s858">We had to work very fast.</span> <span id="s859">I had to work for my... because my sister was also not so strong.</span> <span id="s860">She was 14 then already, but 14 years she was looking like 9 years.</span> <span id="s861">And she couldn't work so hard...so I had so fast, so I had to quick for her and quick for me for her not to be beaten up.</span> <span id="s862">This boy was beaten so much by them and he called his sister, "Blanca.</span> <span id="s863">Blanca.</span> <span id="s864">Save me."</span> <span id="s865">It was terrible things what I saw.</span> <span id="s866">And...and then...then... uh...he was beaten up, but then "Blanca went to the "Reichmaster, and she asked him, "Please let my brother go.</span> <span id="s867">Don't hit him.</span> <span id="s868">Hit me."</span> <span id="s869">It was such a devotion.</span> <span id="s870">Everybody would give life for the other person.</span> <span id="s871">And then it was...uh...it was also, we were working by the, you know, when the...when you take rolling thing, what they put in clay, and this to pick up with wet clay...it was such a..</span> <span id="s872">.</span> <span id="s873">it break down down the person.</span> <span id="s874">And we had to work this.</span> <span id="s875">For many, it was difficult.</span> <span id="s876">When you roll this already there's a cable to pick this up, and I had to pick up for my sister and for me and when we went over there it was the builders.</span> <span id="s877">They were Pollacks.</span> <span id="s878">And they say, "Quick work you...they called us awful name...quick work anyway you go from morning late to the...to the ovens.</span> <span id="s879">I didn't believe that they are putting in the ovens people.</span> <span id="s880">I was thinking the antiªSeminites, they called us" names, such low names, and work quicker quicker.</span> <span id="s881">Or one time it was , , so we brought the men what he looked after...over us, we brought him a trench...a beautiful trench coat, and we gave him to let us little bit early home on Yom Kippur on.</span> <span id="s882">.</span> <span id="s883">in Russishooner.</span> <span id="s884">You know what he did.</span> <span id="s885">Because he took the trench coat, but because he knew that we want to go early, he kept us a whole day, a whole night, and a whole day.</span> <span id="s886">We had to work 36 hours, 36 hours because...because we gave...gave...he knew that...and it was a Ukranian.</span> <span id="s887">He was Ukranian.</span> <span id="s888">Also they were wearing black things.</span> <span id="s889">How many times we were beaten up.</span> <span id="s890">One time...one time...this was before we run away from the ghetto, I went out with my sister and we...we went... uh...and my brother was still over there, and he had to give us nighttime, he will come under the ghetto and he will give us packages to take out because we planned to run away.</span> <span id="s891">To take out to hid over there, to one.</span> <span id="s892">.</span> <span id="s893">un....to one Polish family.</span> <span id="s894">They were very good with us.</span> <span id="s895">Before the war they were...they were teachers.</span> <span id="s896">They came to our store to buy.</span> <span id="s897">So we came under the ghetto...it came two, three...yal, three...uh...no, it was...this...uh...soldiers, and they say, "What you are doing here under the ghetto?"</span> <span id="s898">And they search us and I had a pound butter to give to my brother, and I say I came to sell butter to the Jews.</span> <span id="s899">He says...what...when he is in our window was going out, it was big wall, but our window from the ghetto went out to the Irish side, you know.</span> <span id="s900">And...and I saw my brother sitting over there withthis boy, sitting over there, and they say, "What you have to come?"</span> <span id="s901">I told he had to come here 10 o'clock at night to buy for us.</span> <span id="s902">So he says, "When they will not come, you will be killed.</span> <span id="s903">So we know that you are a liar."</span> <span id="s904">So I told, "Yes.</span> <span id="s905">He will come.</span> <span id="s906">He told he will buy from us.</span> <span id="s907">He went to work.</span> <span id="s908">He told he will buy from us."</span> <span id="s909">So...so he says, "Not in this window.</span> <span id="s910">Maybe this Jew will buy from you."</span> <span id="s911">And I knew...my brother will come out because he will expect that we are knocking, so" I told, "I don't know this Jew.</span> <span id="s912">How I knock to this window.</span> <span id="s913">I don't know this Jew."</span> <span id="s914">So he knocked.</span> <span id="s915">I saw my brother through the gate.</span> <span id="s916">I saw he is coming out.</span> <span id="s917">So I started to scream Polish to him, "I don't know this Jew.</span> <span id="s918">What you want from me.</span> <span id="s919">I don't know this Jew."</span> <span id="s920">So I want my brother to know not to come to the...to hear my voice, that we are in trouble, that he will not come to the gate because he will be right now killed.</span> <span id="s921">So...so he knew already that we are in trouble.</span> <span id="s922">In the meantime, he says, "Oh, you spoiled everything."</span> <span id="s923">He gave me a slap in face.</span> <span id="s924">"You spoiled everything because you are screaming.</span> <span id="s925">He would come here and buy this.</span> <span id="s926">You are screaming.</span> <span id="s927">You spoiled everything."</span> <span id="s928">So.</span> <span id="s929">.</span> <span id="s930">I..</span> <span id="s931">I told, "But I don't know this Jew."</span> <span id="s932">And I screamed again for him good to hear not to come to the gate.</span> <span id="s933">Then I hearrf, they...we make believe we don't understand German, but I hearded, they told they will take us some place in a..</span> <span id="s934">.</span> <span id="s935">in a..</span> <span id="s936">.</span> <span id="s937">in a..</span> <span id="s938">.</span> <span id="s939">a empty house and they will rape us.</span> <span id="s940">Oh, my God!</span> <span id="s941">So I..</span> <span id="s942">.</span> <span id="s943">I told...I..</span> <span id="s944">.</span> <span id="s945">it was a older German between them.</span> <span id="s946">It was two young German and one older.</span> <span id="s947">I went to him and I..</span> <span id="s948">.</span> <span id="s949">and I start to cry and I say, "Let us go.</span> <span id="s950">My mommy will...will over there think it's so late.</span> <span id="s951">Please let us go.</span> <span id="s952">Let us go because my mommy will over there worry.</span> <span id="s953">My mommy and daddy...my mommy and daddy was already in the gas chambers, but I told this because we made believe that we are Christians.</span> <span id="s954">So he said...so the older...the older German somehow had because I started to cry, because I was thinking...I knew what they are going to do to us.</span> <span id="s955">He had some...they are thinking that we are Christians.</span> <span id="s956">He had some this, and he started to talk with them quiet and they let us go.</span> <span id="s957">First they put a revolver to us.</span> <span id="s958">They will kill us because the Jew didn't show up and this.</span> <span id="s959">And we were thinking it better to be killed than raped.</span> <span id="s960">And then.</span> <span id="s961">.</span> <span id="s962">then...they let us go.</span> <span id="s963">The let us go.</span> <span id="s964">My God.</span> <span id="s965">We didn't...couldn't believe they will let us go.</span> <span id="s966">So how many times I had a revolver to my...to my heart with my sister.</span> <span id="s967">It was about three, four times already.</span> <span id="s968">And...and somehow... and I always, when they had the revolver, I told always my mommy, , save us.</span> <span id="s969">Always my mommy I called.</span> <span id="s970">I don't know.</span> <span id="s971">I never called and this time, it was times that I didn't believe in God.</span> <span id="s972">It was times that I was thinking it is impossible that it can be a God and can see this everything what happened to us and not to do something about.</span> <span id="s973">And the Germans had on the buckles, they had written.</span> <span id="s974">This means, "God is with them."</span> <span id="s975">You know!</span> <span id="s976">So I was thinking maybe they are right.</span> <span id="s977">God is with them, not with us.</span> <span id="s978">And...and...uh... so... so I was.</span> <span id="s979">.</span> <span id="s980">the...I was thinking...sometimes I was not believing.</span> <span id="s981">Sometimes...oh...when I called save us in Jewish, always to my mother, in my mind I was talking only Jewish.</span> <span id="s982">That's why I wrote when I wrote that poem to my mother, I was always writing Jewish, not Polish.</span> <span id="s983">The...the...the diary I was writing in Polish, but.</span> <span id="s984">.</span> <span id="s985">but.</span> <span id="s986">.</span> <span id="s987">when I talked to my parents through this, I write...wrote also the poem in Polish...in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s988">So I told save us.</span> <span id="s989">And somehow we were saved.</span> <span id="s990">So.</span> <span id="s991">.</span> <span id="s992">I still...I again believe my mother is watching us.</span> <span id="s993">And it was times that it was like a miracle happened that I started again to believe.</span> <span id="s994">But it was times that I were...I was not believing, not believing in nothing.</span> <span id="s995">How we were liberated, now I will tell you.</span> <span id="s996">We were 20 and a half months in this hell over there, in this hole.</span> <span id="s997">They wre terrible.</span> <span id="s998">We made believe that we have a gun so them to be a little bit scared.</span> <span id="s999">They never went to bunker because they were scared that it will cave in.</span> <span id="s1000">And one time it...my brother was still alive...it started to cave in.</span> <span id="s1001">Because over us was like...like two yards of...of ground, and it was 2 weeks before my hus...my brother was killed.</span> <span id="s1002">It started to cave in and...and...uh...but then my brother and this boy, they support us with wood...with wood and later night time...we didn't go in the morning to the bunker because it would not be safe.</span> <span id="s1003">And this was only 2 weeks before they were killed.</span> <span id="s1004">They were working so hard.</span> <span id="s1005">They save...they save us, but they went to death only because of us.</span> <span id="s1006">Because when they wouldn't come to visit us, they wouldn't be caught and they wouldn't be killed.</span> <span id="s1007">But because of us, and I begged him, "Don't go."</span> <span id="s1008">I was happy to see... to see them.</span> <span id="s1009">But I was scared that they will be...every time when they left, I was only listening what the will bring and they wasn't caught.</span> <span id="s1010">And they were caught.</span> <span id="s1011">The third time when they came they were caught...caught.</span> <span id="s1012">So they were only 3 months hiding and they were caught.</span> <span id="s1013">And so we started the diary to write.</span> <span id="s1014">And my sister not one time told me, "I want...I wish...I wish the Germans would find us and kills us already.</span> <span id="s1015">For what we live?" "</span> <span id="s1016">February, we will not live through.</span> <span id="s1017">And sometimes she throwed the...the... diary, and she said, "For what I am writing.</span> <span id="s1018">What they will use.</span> <span id="s1019">They will kill us.</span> <span id="s1020">We will...we will never be free from here.</span> <span id="s1021">They will kill us.</span> <span id="s1022">What they will do with this?</span> <span id="s1023">They will use this for toilet paper."</span> <span id="s1024">But I encouraged her again because I knew when not we will get crazy.</span> <span id="s1025">One time... (end of tape 2, side A) Beginning of Tape 2, Side B.</span> <span id="s1026">You know the Germans are running, and they are burning houses.</span> <span id="s1027">You want to go to because we are going away to the forest.</span> <span id="s1028">You want to go with us.</span> <span id="s1029">And I was scared because you see I didn't know the Poles over there, the farmers.</span> <span id="s1030">But they knew us because they came to this store.</span> <span id="s1031">And they.</span> <span id="s1032">.</span> <span id="s1033">they...they knew us, but we didn't know them because we were not staying in this store.</span> <span id="s1034">So I was scared.</span> <span id="s1035">We were scared to go out, but...but...uh...they told they will...they will burn the houses when they are running away.</span> <span id="s1036">So we went.</span> <span id="s1037">We put on scarves for them not to see us, and we...we went.</span> <span id="s1038">It was dark.</span> <span id="s1039">It was in the forest".</span> <span id="s1040">And we were over there about 2 hours.</span> <span id="s1041">We heared the Germans talking and running.</span> <span id="s1042">And then we went back over there in the...in the stable.</span> <span id="s1043">One time we saw that he doesn't cover us because right now in the morning he covered us.</span> <span id="s1044">Over there we had to go in the...in the bunker and he covered us.</span> <span id="s1045">And he doesn't cover us.</span> <span id="s1046">It is already day time.</span> <span id="s1047">I hear the children running over there on the hallway and I thought: What is it?</span> <span id="s1048">We looked out.</span> <span id="s1049">In the stable was a small window maybe by.</span> <span id="s1050">.</span> <span id="s1051">by 8 inches...a small window and I looked.</span> <span id="s1052">From far away I saw...I saw over there a soldier, and I saw there's another German.</span> <span id="s1053">Must be Russians.</span> <span id="s1054">Russians must be here already.</span> <span id="s1055">And he doesn't tell us because he wants to convert us.</span> <span id="s1056">So...uh...went to the...to the crack from the door, you know, and he came out from the...we saw him coming out from his room.</span> <span id="s1057">We knocked on the door and we told him...told him, "Why don't you cover us?</span> <span id="s1058">It's day light."</span> <span id="s1059">So he says...he says, "What do you.</span> <span id="s1060">.</span> <span id="s1061">uh.</span> <span id="s1062">.</span> <span id="s1063">what is so..." "Why you didn't tell us the Russians are here."</span> <span id="s1064">So he says, "So what.</span> <span id="s1065">So what.</span> <span id="s1066">So go.</span> <span id="s1067">You want to go."</span> <span id="s1068">So I told, "I will not go because I will not put you in danger."</span> <span id="s1069">Because the...uh...the Russians...the Germans can come back and the Poles will know where we were, and you're fine innocent...innocent plans will go from this world because of us so I don't want to put you in danger.</span> <span id="s1070">And really I wouldn't go out because I didn't know...I came over there in night time.</span> <span id="s1071">I never was over there before the war.</span> <span id="s1072">It was not in town.</span> <span id="s1073">It was no village.</span> <span id="s1074">I wouldn't know where to go.</span> <span id="s1075">In the day time, when I go, the Pollacks will kill...kill us off anyway.</span> <span id="s1076">They killed after the war.</span> <span id="s1077">They killed many Jews with nobody knows where.</span> <span id="s1078">So I made him so scared that he put us..."So what you want to do.</span> <span id="s1079">How you want to go out?"</span> <span id="s1080">So I told him, "Listen, put us for the day time over there in he called this in the hole.</span> <span id="s1081">Put us in the hole.</span> <span id="s1082">The bunker he called hole.</span> <span id="s1083">Put us in the hole for the day time.</span> <span id="s1084">In night time, take...take...uh...the wagon with the horses, put full straw on this and we will go under this straw and you will uncover us when you see the Russian Army.</span> <span id="s1085">So he says...he says, "Okay."</span> <span id="s1086">He got very scared.</span> <span id="s1087">So in night time, he did so.</span> <span id="s1088">We...we went under the straw...in the...in the...on the wagon with full straw.</span> <span id="s1089">He took us back and we heard still in Jawiszowice fighting because we heared the...uh...how they fight Germans with the...with the...with the Russians.</span> <span id="s1090">And I..</span> <span id="s1091">.</span> <span id="s1092">he went back over there to the Russian Army.</span> <span id="s1093">Over there in this town, I knew I have a teacher what she taught me and she was not Jewish, but she taught me when...when I was in...in public school.</span> <span id="s1094">So I told, "Take us to .</span> <span id="s1095">We went over there and she said, "Oh Mina, how you look!</span> <span id="s1096">My God, when your father and mother sees you...because we were yellow green...20 and a half months, we didn't see the air.</span> <span id="s1097">We were starved over there.</span> <span id="s1098">So...uh...uh...she says, "When you mother and father stays out from the grave and they see you."</span> <span id="s1099">And I was thinking why she tells me there're in the grave.</span> <span id="s1100">Maybe they are still alive.</span> <span id="s1101">Maybe we will meet.</span> <span id="s1102">I still hoped that we will meet somebody.</span> <span id="s1103">They went only to...because we were in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1104">We didn't know what was going on over there.</span> <span id="s1105">We didn't have mail.</span> <span id="s1106">We didn't have papers.</span> <span id="s1107">We didn't know what was going out without the ghetto...out from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1108">So she says, "But I can't keep you."</span> <span id="s1109">I told to let me...to let us be over night.</span> <span id="s1110">She says, "I can't because on our...on my garden, the "Partisan, the Polish Partison, they killed six Jews and I will not be a witness.</span> <span id="s1111">They would come right now to kill you and they find out you are Jewish...I have Jewish."</span> <span id="s1112">I was thinking she was a anti-semite.</span> <span id="s1113">That's why she doesn't want to take us.</span> <span id="s1114">So the goy got very scared.</span> <span id="s1115">So I told him, "Take us to the Russian Army."</span> <span id="s1116">She he came to the Russian... He...he took us to the Russian Army and he... Over there, I came and I asked...I knew one word of Russian.</span> <span id="s1117">.</span> <span id="s1118">is Jew in Russian.</span> <span id="s1119">So I told where is .</span> <span id="s1120">I didn't know how to speak .</span> <span id="s1121">I talked to them in Polish.</span> <span id="s1122">So they told me .</span> <span id="s1123">I came to him, a young boy in the 20s maybe.</span> <span id="s1124">I came to him and I told him, "You can talk Jewish?"</span> <span id="s1125">He says, "No."</span> <span id="s1126">So I couldn't talk...uh...Russian, but the Russian in Polish in similar you know.</span> <span id="s1127">So I told him that the Partisans, the Polish Partisans killed...is killing Jews when they see a survivor.</span> <span id="s1128">So he was laughing at me.</span> <span id="s1129">He says, "They work.</span> <span id="s1130">They fight with us together."</span> <span id="s1131">And I saw he is by name only a Jew, but he doesn't know nothing about Jews.</span> <span id="s1132">I asked about...about.</span> <span id="s1133">.</span> <span id="s1134">then later.</span> <span id="s1135">.</span> <span id="s1136">over night I was already over in the office sitting because I didn't want to go out out in over there slipping over there.</span> <span id="s1137">I heard what they did.</span> <span id="s1138">The Russian "girls and the Russian girls soldiers and it is going over there terrible things.</span> <span id="s1139">So I..</span> <span id="s1140">.</span> <span id="s1141">I sit in the...in the office, and the office was light and he was over there.</span> <span id="s1142">And he said, "Why don't you go to sleep?"</span> <span id="s1143">So I told, "I don't like to sleep."</span> <span id="s1144">And it was already second night we didn't sleep.</span> <span id="s1145">I don't like to sleep.</span> <span id="s1146">I want here to sit.</span> <span id="s1147">And he understood probably because he told something to the...over there to the Captains, and they were laughing.</span> <span id="s1148">He understood why we don't want.</span> <span id="s1149">In the morning, I went to look for a Red Cross and the Red Cross, Russian Red Cross and I asked again about "Avery and they showed me a .</span> <span id="s1150">I went to her and she knew Jewish because she was already in the 40s.</span> <span id="s1151">And she told me how I know you are not German spies.</span> <span id="s1152">I can't keep you.</span> <span id="s1153">I told her so.</span> <span id="s1154">You look German spies.</span> <span id="s1155">Like we.</span> <span id="s1156">Look at us.</span> <span id="s1157">So she didn't believe.</span> <span id="s1158">I told her the German "Meldacot.</span> <span id="s1159">I had the "medacot.</span> <span id="s1160">I showed her.</span> <span id="s1161">No.</span> <span id="s1162">She doesn't believe me.</span> <span id="s1163">Then, it came to my mind I have my father and mother in the powder case.</span> <span id="s1164">I showed her.</span> <span id="s1165">This is my father and my mother.</span> <span id="s1166">Look good and you will see.</span> <span id="s1167">I look like my father and my sister looked like my mother.</span> <span id="s1168">Look good.</span> <span id="s1169">Under the beard you can't see, but I have deep set in the eyes like my father.</span> <span id="s1170">And look and you will see resembles with my father.</span> <span id="s1171">Then she believed us.</span> <span id="s1172">She kept us over there.</span> <span id="s1173">She kept us over there 8 days, and then they started to pack and go farther.</span> <span id="s1174">And they didn't want to take us with us because civilians they can't take.</span> <span id="s1175">So we were walking to Jawiszowice.</span> <span id="s1176">It was ...it was very far.</span> <span id="s1177">But the 8 days by her, we came to us because they gave us good to eat and...and we were sitting on the porch to catch some air.</span> <span id="s1178">And the Pollacks over there were watching so...watching us so and they told through the porch, "We will take you here.</span> <span id="s1179">We will take you there."</span> <span id="s1180">And I knew they wanted to kill us.</span> <span id="s1181">Now...then I understood that the teacher told me the truth, that they kill Jewish survivers.</span> <span id="s1182">And then I went with the Russian Army, we went to Jawiszowice, walking.</span> <span id="s1183">They didn't want us taken on the trucks.</span> <span id="s1184">They are not allowed.</span> <span id="s1185">We were walking.</span> <span id="s1186">When we came it was already day time.</span> <span id="s1187">So we asked...we met a Jewish boy.</span> <span id="s1188">I recognize he's Jewish.</span> <span id="s1189">So I went..."You see some Jews.</span> <span id="s1190">Because we were living...we were only the one Jews left."</span> <span id="s1191">He says, "Yes, we took over a Jewish house , and we a house, and we...yal, over there 8 boys and you are the first girls what they show up."</span> <span id="s1192">So we came over there.</span> <span id="s1193">They gave us a room.</span> <span id="s1194">And over there...uh...started to come in other survivers.</span> <span id="s1195">Again a surviving, again it was already 12 boys, and then it came a family lived from east but they were also saved.</span> <span id="s1196">And then I went to the family upstairs.</span> <span id="s1197">It was dark.</span> <span id="s1198">It went upstairs to the family because we took over the whole house, the Jewish apartment house.</span> <span id="s1199">I went over there and...and I asked how they didn't meet my brother or somebody.</span> <span id="s1200">Because I still hoped that somebody's alive.</span> <span id="s1201">I knew already then from the boys, they...I knew they're just the gas chambers and I started to find out because some of them run away...was already saved, survivers from the...from the gas chambers from this.</span> <span id="s1202">So, I..</span> <span id="s1203">.</span> <span id="s1204">I..</span> <span id="s1205">.</span> <span id="s1206">I..</span> <span id="s1207">.</span> <span id="s1208">then I met my husband.</span> <span id="s1209">My husband was in uniform.</span> <span id="s1210">He was fighting.</span> <span id="s1211">He came from Russia because...

id="s1464">And I was ashamed to...to nurse the baby...so many people.</span> <span id="s1465">How I can do it?</span> <span id="s1466">So my husband said, "My God.</span> <span id="s1467">What you want the baby to die?</span> <span id="s1468">You are ashamed?"</span> <span id="s1469">So I told, "I will not nurse the baby.</span> <span id="s1470">I can't."</span> <span id="s1471">So over there was going from Hungarian also a couple and they were sitting near the wall...near the wall on the floor so they understood.</span> <span id="s1472">They didn't understand Polish, but they understood that I am ashamed to.</span> <span id="s1473">.</span> <span id="s1474">to nurse the baby, so they made me place...come here and sit down to the wall turn to the wall, and they gave me the...the place over there and from...then they say you sit here and they will sit in the middle.</span> <span id="s1475">And from then we got to be very good friends.</span> <span id="s1476">We came to United

scared.</span> <span id="s1586">A family comes and they were not rich.</span> <span id="s1587">My aunt.</span> <span id="s1588">And I was thinking, I told her, "Don't tell that you are my family because the Joint will take care of me."</span> <span id="s1589">So...so then my boy was running around.</span> <span id="s1590">He didn't eat nothing.</span> <span id="s1591">Five O'clock he couldn't eat.</span> <span id="s1592">And they told on the loud speaker whoever takes out food will be sent back to Europe.</span> <span id="s1593">So I was thinking, scared to take out the food for him, and he didn't eat so early he couldn't eat so early.</span> <span id="s1594">So I..</span> <span id="s1595">.</span> <span id="s1596">I..</span> <span id="s1597">uh.</span> <span id="s1598">.</span> <span

last time he went to the policemen.</span> <span id="s1606">He couldn't talk one word of English.</span> <span id="s1607">He showed them the boy.</span> <span id="s1608">He took the boy by the hand.</span> <span id="s1609">He showed him the boy and he showed some...showed something to drink for the boy.</span> <span id="s1610">The policemen took out 25 cents and we never forgot this.</span> <span id="s1611">And he gave... and my husband wants to ask him where to send back the address.</span> <span id="s1612">He couldn't talk to him.</span> <span id="s1613">And he gave...because he never took charity from nobody.</span> <span id="s1614">And he.</span> <span id="s1615">.</span> <span id="s1616">uh.</span> <span id="s1617">.</span> <span id="s1618">we bought him a glass...a glass of milk, a container with milk and a roll from this money, but the roll he couldn't swallow because he was so dried up.</span> <span id="s1619">Day before he ate.</span> <span id="s1620">And he was after two operations, and the third operation, we made him the tonsils because he had tonsillitis often.</span> <span id="s1621">Before we left, we made him the tonsil operation.</span> <span
