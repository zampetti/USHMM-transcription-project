id="s4">SWB: HENRY KANNER: OK, I remember the last days in __________________ uh going back to early January of 1945 where we knew something was going to happen, that the Russian Army was not too far.</span> <span id="s5">And sometime, I believe uh very early, January the 7th or 8th, I don't remember exactly.</span> <span id="s6">We were taken out of the Camp and uh told to march uh It was a brutal winter, as I remember, wickedly cold, and the the trouble quote un quote started almost as soon as we left the camp because the weakest people who didn't have sufficient protection from the elements and didn't have enough food, started to falter fall back, and within a very short period of time we began to hear shots and we knew what they were.</span> <span id="s7">Because anyone who faltered was taken to the side.</span> <span id="s8">And most the roads of Poland have ditches on both sides, so they were just pushed towards the ditch, shot and we just continued.</span> <span id="s9">I do not recall exactly how many days we were marching, but I do know that uh many people, many people uh were shot during the first two days.</span> <span id="s10">I believe it was after this second day of marching where we stopped at a what would appear a large farm uh I was one of the very lucky ones, because uh they put me with a group of people in a pig sty, which was great, because it protected us from elements.</span> <span id="s11">Uh, we stayed there for a while and someone in the group was very enterprising and he had a pocket-knife and uh we decided to butcher one of the pigs.</span> <span id="s12">There were loads you know around us.</span> <span id="s13">uh I recall it today...laugh.</span> <span id="s14">.</span> <span id="s15">almost you know with some humor because uh I uh vividly recall a whole slew of us sitting on the pig trying to hold it down while somebody tried to butcher it Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for

Eventually, uh we succeeded, I don't remember how it happened, how it finally it took probably hours, but we succeeded and uh the pig was butchered or torn apart and um we took a piece of whatever was available with us, we ate raw.</span> <span id="s20">And whatever was left over _______us and we started to march again.</span> <span id="s21">And just around the third day, uh I began to feel that I wasn't going to make it because cold was sever and I was getting weaker, although I was in relatively, and I emphasize the word, relatively, better shape when I then most when I left ______________.</span> <span id="s22">Eh, however, there were some friends who were much older, and I was only what... 15 or 16 at that time.</span> <span id="s23">And who were much stronger and who helped me.</span> <span id="s24">We finally uh I think it was the forth day reached a railroad yard of some sort and we were put in open cars, these weren't the cada____ these were open coal type of wagons, and we shoved I I mean we were pushed in pretty tight I I would assume that there were over a hundred people.</span> <span id="s25">And it was things got pretty bad then, because it was snowing heavily.</span> <span id="s26">We had again no protection at all.</span> <span id="s27">But, lucky for me there were again strong people in the car particularly there were a lot of uh German prisoners uh from ______.</span> <span id="s28">And most of the German's were in a a _____________position.</span> <span id="s29">So they were both well feed and and uh they were provisioned somewhat better than eh they were.</span> <span id="s30">In any case I had known some of them because of the fact that when I was in ___________I was working in a laundry and these guys used to come to us and to me and uh to have their laundry washed, which I did, and because I knew them from uh from uh that time uh they for some reason protected me.</span> <span id="s31">Or at least helped me.</span> <span id="s32">Eh, it was unpleasant the first two nights because there were too many people you know in uh in open air uh it was very bad.</span> <span id="s33">Uh the Germans took ...laugh...as I

and eh _____there was a container, and eh they made a bit of a fire and they melted some snow and we survived basically on drinking that melted snow and eating the remnants of the pig that we slaughtered the night or two before.</span> <span id="s38">They gained my memory state and I don't know how long we were in that car, eh, I do know that towards the end, eh I was so cold that I I I I thought I really wasn't fully conscious.</span> <span id="s39">We finally arrived and again I don't know how many days it took I I uh three four I don't remember.</span> <span id="s40">The train was very slow.</span> <span id="s41">It stopped at various points for hours and then moved again.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Anyway, we arrived at a place and I saw at a railroad station ___________ which I recognize immediately because we all knew Mauthausen was another one another one of the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s43">When uh the doors when uh yeah if you will call it doors were slid open eh most of the people were dead anyway and they fell out.</span> <span id="s44">I don't remember the exact number, but I don't think there were more than maybe eh eh a dozen left in my car comprising essentially, mostly of the of the Germans and maybe ya there was one Polish man and I.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Em we were told to to get out of the car and of course you know since because of conditions that we were in few of us could stand up immediately and but there was no no eh violence that I recall at the station other than the usual shouting by the SS eh "get going, get going."</span> <span id="s46">Eh .</span> <span id="s47">.</span> <span id="s48">sigh.</span> <span id="s49">.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">And any event I I do recall looking around looking down this train seeing corpses frozen stiff all over, they were hanging out of the cars or people pulling them out or they were laying already on the ground.</span> <span id="s51">We were then eh marched up eh

walls, towers, in any case, we entered the camp and we were made to stay in the main assembly eh eh square so to speak where they were, they were counting people_______and we stood there for several hours until an officer, an SS officer came and he spoke to us in German of course.</span> <span id="s56">And he said, "you have arrived at" (I'm not quoting ver ba ver bedim) but eh he said something to the effect extent you have arrived in Mounthauser???</span> <span id="s57">eh if you behave you have a chance if you don't you don't have a change.</span> <span id="s58">I subsequently found out that there was a Camp Commandant Commandant that made that speech.</span> <span id="s59">After that, we were then assigned to the various quarters.</span> <span id="s60">Mounthausen ????</span> <span id="s61">consisted of one, two, three, four separate, it was it was one camp that was divided and isolated by walls and doors into four camps.</span> <span id="s62">And of course the camp eh that eh we were put in was the worst one eh because well it had nothing else but because the barracks consisted of nothing else but four walls.</span> <span id="s63">There was nothing else.</span> <span id="s64">Eh, we....pause....got in, we were glad that we had a roof over our head.</span> <span id="s65">We were given towards the evening a the usual bowl of of liquid eh which was cold soup, but really, there wasn't much more to it.</span> <span id="s66">Then we were told it was time to go to sleep and that was an interesting situation because there were the couples who stood with big sticks over us, and they put people on the floor, head to toe, head to toe,</span></p> <p><span id="s67">like sardines.</span> <span id="s68">Pause</span></p> <p><span id="s69">2nd tape In any case eh ehe

fourth, third or fourth day when I was in the camp, eh an SS man entered the barracks and they made everybody line-up.</span> <span id="s75">And I recognized the SS man very well, his name was ____________ who was in ________and he eh walked by us and he says, "is there anyone over here from ______?"</span> <span id="s76">And eh I stepped out and said, "yes sir," I said, "I used to do your shirts."</span> <span id="s77">And he looked at me, smiled, didn't say a word, but he did smile.</span> <span id="s78">And eh he continued and just asked eh eh there were a number of eh bodies lying around and says, "what happened to them?"</span> <span id="s79">And a couple of the blacks said "oh the usual thing."</span> <span id="s80">He that was the end of that.</span> <span id="s81">We were, he left the the barracks, and we were then allowed to mingle or whatever.</span> <span id="s82">Eh he went towards the gate of this camp and I followed him.</span> <span id="s83">I don't know why, eh I went with him all the way to the gate and when he opened the gate and when he opened the gate, I asked him, I don't know what posses me, but I asked him, "May I go through the gate?"</span> <span id="s84">And he kind of shrugged his shoulders again that half a smile on his face and um I went through.</span> <span id="s85">And that allowed me to go into the main camp were all the old prisoners were, prisoners who might have been in in Mounthausen???</span> <span id="s86">for several years.</span> <span id="s87">And as I walked around, and I knew I had to get back because we all had numbers and</span></p> <p><span id="s88">we had to eh stand for the counting at the, twice a day.</span> <span id="s89">But, again eh providence, luck or whatever it was as I walked around I noticed a familiar face and I walked over to the man.</span> <span id="s90">And of course he was in a prisoners uniform, but, well in a clean prisoners uniform.</span> <span id="s91">And I asked him, "do you

came from _______."</span> <span id="s100">He looked at me, he was a wonderful man, I I will never forget him, and he said, "sit over here and don't move until I come."</span> <span id="s101">I did not know, I did not know at all what he had in mind, why, but I certainly sat down and waited for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Eh in about a half an hour, and that was late afternoon, in about a half an hour he came to me and he said, eh "try to make sure that you wear your shirt eh sleeves all the way down so that know one sees your tatoo."</span> <span id="s103">Eh I says, "why?"</span> <span id="s104">"Well the fact that today you are a Roman Catholic and you are Polish and you have been transferred from Camp 4 to Camp 1 and you are going to go ______I think it was Block number 3" And eh I just couldn't believe it because eh in Mounthausen????</span> <span id="s105">Jews were not supposed to live.</span> <span id="s106">It was something that was well known.</span> <span id="s107">Anyway I reported to the block where he told me to.</span> <span id="s108">Eh I should mention that eh the he was in a high position, he was a eh what they call a a Shriver which roughly

<span id="s110">What he has done what he has done, he went to the main office.</span> <span id="s111">He pulled my file and he changed it.</span> <span id="s112">He just left my name on it but it

<span id="s128">Eh, one of the things that I noticed immediately is that a lot of the SS men were disappearing and those who stayed suddenly were not wearing SS uniform, but rather the ________uniform.</span> <span id="s129">I also noticed that the guards around the parameter of the camp, the SS guards disappeared, and we were being watched by eh some comical looking eh guys with eh in the sixties with guns and eventually some would tell us that these were the fire-brigades eh from Vienna.</span> <span id="s130">Eh somewhere around that time I remember there was an air-raid and we had eh great Mauthausen on the top of the mountain with a great vantage point to observe what was going on.</span> <span id="s131">And eh one of the things that I remember is that a eh plane was shot down by the anti-aircraft and three American soldiers were brought into the camp, eh chained to the wall near the gate, beaten brutally.</span> <span id="s132">And eh the following day they were taken to the gas chambers and killed.</span> <span id="s133">Just about a few days later we began to hear distant artillery and we knew that things were going to happen.</span> <span id="s134">Sight...we were very fearful because we were told that the camp was mined and that the camp commander had issued orders that the whole thing be blown up before liberation.</span> <span id="s135">The day of liberation, I remember very very vividly because eh all of a sudden there was no one around the camp.</span> <span id="s136">There was no one at the gate.</span> <span

tank, American tank and they did not they did not ride into the camp or close to the camp.</span> <span id="s148">They just stopped there.</span> <span id="s149">Of course we rushed to them.</span> <span id="s150">I was one of the first, eh by the tank and eh I we started of course screaming out of joy or eh and one of the eh one of the eh em soldiers, a lieutenant, he started to speak, he eh you know tried to respond to what we were saying.</span> <span id="s151">Eh, of course everybody was talking in his own language but eh he tried to respond and I am sure to this day that he must have been Jewish because he tried to speak in German which sounded more Yiddish to me than it sounded eh German.</span> <span id="s152">The thing that is almost impossible forg to forget to me is the outcry, because you had several thousand people yelling at the top of their voices.</span> <span id="s153">And it wasn't eh as I recall eh a shout of joy or anything.</span> <span id="s154">It was just like an eh eh an animalistic outcry.</span> <span id="s155">People were just yelling at their top of their lungs.</span> <span id="s156">I was yelling.</span> <span id="s157">And and eh it it it's incredible to this day to me.</span> <span id="s158">Of course, eventually, eh it died down and eh the next thing that happened is that eh the eh prisoner the eldest, every camp every

what was happening.</span> <span id="s171">Eh in any event, we eh everyone ran to the gate and were went right through it eh, we ran to the tank.</span> <span id="s172">And we surrounded the tank of course, eh eh I was, I think I was one of the first people to reach one one of the first, one one of the first groups that that reached the tank and we tried to communicate with with the soldiers.</span> <span id="s173">Because of the languages of course, eh eh it was very difficult until one of the eh em, one of the soldiers tried to speak to us.</span> <span id="s174">And I recognized it he tried to speak German but eh it sounded much more Yiddish and I'm quite sure that he was eh eh Jewish.</span> <span id="s175">Eh after a while, the eh Prisoner Camp Eldest approached the Americans and spoke to them, he apparently spoke English.</span> <span id="s176">And then one of the American soldiers and the Camp Elder mounted the stand above the main gate and I will never forget because they stood over there with all of us, thousands of people down below, and he uttered in German these words, "______________" which translates, "you are free."</span> <span
