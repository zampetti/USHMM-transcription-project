and we came out and the church was gone.</span> <span id="s146">What happened, a lot of these places didn't use steel like they use in the buildings today, and they had the basement several floors down.</span> <span id="s147">So one gets hit, just crumbles right into the ground.</span> <span id="s148">And it is just a devastating thing.</span> <span id="s149">It is bad.</span> <span id="s150">The whole thing...you come back, it is not there.</span> <span id="s151">I mean, (laughing) it just packed in the underground.</span> <span id="s152">Well, uh I can talk about it.</span> <span id="s153">I don't know if you want me past that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Let's talk about what happened to you at this point.</span> <span id="s155">What happened to you when the Germans actually occupied Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Well, they were picking up Jews and nobodies.</span> <span id="s157">Things just started and Germans really couldn't recognize.</span> <span id="s158">They ask you, "Are you a Jew?"</span> <span id="s159">You know, you had to tell them.</span> <span id="s160">And we escaped from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s161">What happened, my sister had a fiancé.</span> <span id="s162">He was from the part of Poland where the Russians came in.</span> <span id="s163">Where he was staying in Warsaw, he was going to Warsaw Polytechnic--which is just like here, a university or something.</span> <span id="s164">And they supposed to go with each other when he went back on his vacation and summer.</span> <span id="s165">You know college started in September, he didn't get back to Warsaw a year.</span> <span id="s166">So after the war, we got a note.</span> <span id="s167">You know, people were smuggling each other through the border back and forth; and there was not the regular mail.</span> <span id="s168">And somebody brought a note.</span> <span id="s169">He asked my sister to go, now he asked the whole family to come over there.</span> <span id="s170">From two evils, the Russians were better than the Germans at that particular time.</span> <span id="s171">So my father decided that he lived in this city all his life and he's not gonna leave.</span> <span id="s172">He wants the kids to stay together.</span> <span id="s173">So we went to a train station.</span> <span id="s174">And while we were saying goodbye to our father, we were separated by some German, push around; and we got up on a freight train and we went toward Russia.</span> <span id="s175">And we were told if we got caught... Only that trip can make a two hours story.</span> <span id="s176">But really, we were told if we caught on the German side, tell them we came from the Russian side so they throw you back on the Russian side.</span> <span id="s177">If you get caught on the Russian side, tell them you are going to Germany so they chase you back.</span> <span id="s178">You know, just always tell them the opposite.</span> <span id="s179">And we had the nightman night, because we finally got on a train in a dark where was traveling some Christian people.</span> <span id="s180">They didn't know we were Jewish, they were talking about "Oh, the Jewish being murdered."</span> <span id="s181">One lady was telling them, "Hey, the Germans come and they shoot the whole Jewish family...shoot the Jewish."</span> <span id="s182">And that was a terrible conversation going on, and we were scared.</span> <span id="s183">Finally we went up in a little country place close to the border in order to cross, said the, uh, I guess you can call him a farmer.</span> <span id="s184">His name was Tom, and we told him what we want to do and he say he know some smugglers and he took us in and put us in the barn and he was scared also, but we gave him some money something.</span> <span id="s185">So finally someday he says he is going to take us toward the border.</span> <span id="s186">So they put me in the wagon, cover me with straw; and my sister and another lady and the driver of the horse and wagon.</span> <span id="s187">And they were worrying why Sunday, because people were going to Church.</span> <span id="s188">And so we mix with the church crowd.</span> <span id="s189">We came to the border and something didn't work out, we had to go back.</span> <span id="s190">Then we made the second trip.</span> <span id="s191">And finally two smuggler came and took us and put us over there in the barn.</span> <span id="s192">And in the middle of the night they came and wanted to rape the women.</span> <span id="s193">So my sister and the other girl was together, and they told them to lay on the top of them.</span> <span id="s194">But they were not...they give up, they didn't rape them.</span> <span id="s195">Then they were trying to get money; because my sister sick and if you she got rings.</span> <span id="s196">You know, we give them all we had.</span> <span id="s197">And then they was smuggling sugar, so while we were working with them and the Russian said they got long bags with sugar.</span> <span id="s198">You know Russia knows for shortages.</span> <span id="s199">And we came to a little stream and they were wearing the high boots; and they took us back in a carriage on the other side.</span> <span id="s200">And they told us again, if you see any Russians you tell them that you are going to Germany and they chase you back, you know.</span> <span id="s201">And we separated.</span> <span id="s202">Then we came to...I forgot what the place was--was some kind of bus station or train station.</span> <span id="s203">And everybody was sleeping on the floor, because people really didn't have a home or anything.</span> <span id="s204">Everybody was wandering around.</span> <span id="s205">And I lay down right on the floor I went to sleep.</span> <span id="s206">And...and somehow we travel, and we found ourself in Pruzhany [Pol: Pru_ana]--no, Brest-Litovsk.</span> <span id="s207">That was the first stop.</span> <span id="s208">And we were sitting at the table, and talking about the war and everything with some of my sister's friends.</span> <span id="s209">And then we continue on to Pru_ana which was closer to the border uh where my brother-in-law was.</span> <span id="s210">So my sister got mad because the Russians came up with the...they call it paragraph 11, which you are...I don't know how to translate it.</span> <span id="s211">I guess, a refugee.</span> <span id="s212">You right in the same country, but being you came from the German side.</span> <span id="s213">So they give you a passport, paragraph 11, and we stayed there.</span> <span id="s214">You cannot live in the city.</span> <span id="s215">On my...I know 100 kilometers from the border, you cannot get cross; and there was about 50.</span> <span id="s216">And I think it said that you shouldn't live in a city of 100,000 population, some kind of a restriction.</span> <span id="s217">So I didn't like that.</span> <span id="s218">I say if I have to go...I say if I have to go, a 100.</span> <span id="s219">I was 17 and I was with my sister; and they tell me to leave.</span> <span id="s220">Go 100.</span> <span id="s221">Where do I go?</span> <span id="s222">So I went back to the Police station, and I tell them I am not...I want to go back to Germany.</span> <span id="s223">And that was terrible.</span> <span id="s224">And the police chief told me that I was a 10 code or something you know; and called me all kind of names and told the guys to arrest me.</span> <span id="s225">I jumped out of the window and I ran and I hid.</span> <span id="s226">And my brother-in-law's aunt was a doctor and she got a lot of pull with the Russians.</span> <span id="s227">And her daughter was living in France during the... Before the war they sent a lot of... And she took a bunch of that stuff to the police chief and somebody else, and they give her my passport back.</span> <span id="s228">She told them I was a kid, and I didn't know what I was doing; and I was hiding in the attic in the cold.</span> <span id="s229">And the police chief said he let me go, but he don't want to ever come face to face with me because he gonna arrest me.</span> <span id="s230">So in the middle of night I was smuggled out of town and I was recommended to some friends of friends which were living in another town which was beyond 100 kilometers from the border.</span> <span id="s231">Then I had a terrible trip.</span> <span id="s232">We went and got this...they call it a Baalegole.</span> <span id="s233">That is a Jewish fellow who has a horse and wagon, and that's the way he makes... And he got a couple of goats in the house.</span> <span id="s234">They were very primitive.</span> <span id="s235">The goat was in the house, and the kids and everybody; and I was sitting on the wagon all night.</span> <span id="s236">And the only thing we were trying to get some food.</span> <span id="s237">You probably make it into town 30 minutes we go all night with a horse and wagon, so they try to get me food.</span> <span id="s238">The only thing we could get was leberwurst [NB: liverwurst].</span> <span id="s239">I don't like leberwurst.</span> <span id="s240">And we finally came to that little town called Roznau.</span> <span id="s241">Like it was just day, and there was a lot of Jewish farmers over there.</span> <span id="s242">And this guy was working behind a bunch of cows and had a big... I was from a big city, and I never seen it.</span> <span id="s243">And he was collecting cow manure, you know, for fertilizing and I arrived in that little city.</span> <span id="s244">And I..</span> <span id="s245">.</span> <span id="s246">yah, my sister came too, I think.</span> <span id="s247">You know, it is kind of... My sister came, and then she went back because she had to marry...after you marry somebody then like he become citizen.</span> <span id="s248">So after she marry my brother-in-law, she could stay.</span> <span id="s249">I don't know, I don't remember if she came the first trip.</span> <span id="s250">I know she came...maybe she came visiting for a few days; but I remember she coming in, because in the place where we were staying there were no beds.</span> <span id="s251">There was one thing right across the room and everybody was sleeping on it.</span> <span id="s252">(Laughing) The whole family.</span> <span id="s253">And I remember getting up in the morning, because you had the cows, you know.</span> <span id="s254">You know, people don't talk about Jewish farmers alot.</span> <span id="s255">Everybody imagine they're business people.</span> <span id="s256">I have electronic shop.</span> <span id="s257">You know, I repairs.</span> <span id="s258">And everybody asks me if I own a grocery shop.</span> <span id="s259">So I don't know why.</span> <span id="s260">(Laughing) Just a stereotype.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: So you are in this town, and you're living there now?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s264">How long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Well, I couldn't tell you exact times, but you know with the Germans kept going toward Russia one more time.</span> <span id="s266">And that was in '41, when they started a new campaign going toward Russian.</span> <span id="s267">A couple of days... Coincidental, a couple of days before that, there was a draft board.</span> <span id="s268">They were drafting soldiers for the Russian army.</span> <span id="s269">Being I was on the Russian side, we had to go to a draft board.</span> <span id="s270">Of course, it was real strange because we were naked and most of the people were women, you know.</span> <span id="s271">And, uh, when they were measuring you and this and that, and they asked me what kind of education I got, I say I got high school and I got electronics.</span> <span id="s272">And she said you be a lieutenant in the Russian army.</span> <span id="s273">And I think that was Friday or something or Thursday.</span> <span id="s274">Sunday morning, somebody knock on the door, all the people who got drafted and say, "We got a meeting in the city.</span> <span id="s275">Move your tail."</span> <span id="s276">We didn't know anything would happen.</span> <span id="s277">We get in the movie theatre, the draftees.</span> <span id="s278">And this Russian general, whatever, come out and said that the German pig stuck a..</span> <span id="s279">.</span> <span id="s280">What do you call?</span> <span id="s281">A snout in the Soviet...in the Russian garden.</span> <span id="s282">That mean they attack the Russian.</span> <span id="s283">And that was Saturday night when this started; and that was Sunday morning.</span> <span id="s284">And would you believe while we were at the movie theatre, there were airplanes coming and machine guns; and they start already.</span> <span id="s285">I was used to air raids at the time, but it was a terrible panic.</span> <span id="s286">And that was Sunday.</span> <span id="s287">And Monday, Russian...German tanks were coming in the town.</span> <span id="s288">You didn't even have time to run.</span> <span id="s289">So I stayed there for a little while, and then I went back.</span> <span id="s290">Because my sister and my brother-in-law were still in Pru_ana.</span> <span id="s291">So I hitchhike back on a German truck; and I came back to Pru_ana and then they turn it into a ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Tell me about the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: Well, (sigh) food was getting short, and things like that.</span> <span id="s294">And I..</span> <span id="s295">.</span> <span id="s296">we were beat.</span> <span id="s297">They were taking the young people everyday to work outside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s298">We knew that one day will come when they gonna take us out of there.</span> <span id="s299">And they...uh, food started getting rationed.</span> <span id="s300">There was a lot of harassment; even by the police, you know.</span> <span id="s301">And a couple of times, I got arrested and my brother-in-law got arrested.</span> <span id="s302">One day, we were in line for food.</span> <span id="s303">And then we see a pregnant lady.</span> <span id="s304">So my brother-in-law stand up for her.</span> <span id="s305">So policeman got after him, so I stand up for him.</span> <span id="s306">And there was another guy with us, he got in.</span> <span id="s307">The police was Jewish, but they working at the time for... So they drag all of us (laughing) to jail.</span> <span id="s308">And a friend of ours, he wear glasses, you see.</span> <span id="s309">You couldn't get glasses.</span> <span id="s310">Anytime was anything dangerous, a German could slap you in the face anytime.</span> <span id="s311">So first thing, he was putting away his glasses, you know.</span> <span id="s312">So he look at the police chief; but without the glasses, he just like that.</span> <span id="s313">Said...the police chief said, "What are you making eyes at me?"</span> <span id="s314">So he says, (laughing) "I wouldn't make eyes at you if you had something on your nose."</span> <span id="s315">So he slapped him.</span> <span id="s316">He put them away.</span> <span id="s317">He wasn't actually arrested.</span> <span id="s318">He came around, and he got in the dispute you see.</span> <span id="s319">How humanly were the things that put you away for anything, you know.</span> <span id="s320">We stayed there, and we were let out.</span> <span id="s321">And eventually, one morning, they tell everybody come to the market place, you know.</span> <span id="s322">And, of course, just like Germans did this type picking out, the people didn't want to go.</span> <span id="s323">Like he says, "Anybody sick, anybody's crazy or nuts, shot to death."</span> <span id="s324">And they put us on wagons.</span> <span id="s325">And at that time, we already knew about Treblinka and those death camps where you go for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: How did you know?</span> <span id="s327">This is 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Yeah, there were rumors.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Already in 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Yah, I think this was between 1941 or 1942.</span> <span id="s331">There were rumors.</span> <span id="s332">We were on the train, freight trains; and we didn't have an idea where we were going.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Describe that trip.</span> <span id="s334">What was it like inside that car?</span> <span id="s335">What kind of a train was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Oh, we were [in a] freight train.</span> <span id="s337">And when they put us in...first we were in a horse and wagon; and in the snow, too.</span> <span id="s338">We come to some place where the train--I am not familiar with the area--and we were loaded in the freight trains.</span> <span id="s339">The cars, that's what's called...freight cars, were filled.</span> <span id="s340">I mean, there was just about standing room on the inside.</span> <span id="s341">My sister was with a little baby.</span> <span id="s342">There was some Russians; but they somehow, they escaped during the night.</span> <span id="s343">They took towels and they wrapped around the head, so they don't bump their head.</span> <span id="s344">And through a little opening, somehow, all of them get out.</span> <span id="s345">And the snow.</span> <span id="s346">They were young guys.</span> <span id="s347">But we were like... everybody was with a family.</span> <span id="s348">And, really, it was no place to go; because there was so much anti-Semitism there.</span> <span id="s349">Anybody point out a Jew out, you know.</span> <span id="s350">There was some people hidden by friends, but you didn't have a prayer if you ran away.</span> <span id="s351">Some people did; but then you had to play like you...not Jewish, you know.</span> <span id="s352">And it was kind of hopeless with snow on the ground.</span> <span id="s353">Cold, no food.</span> <span id="s354">There was...to escape was a hopeless thing.</span> <span id="s355">And many instances, there was helplessness... was really no where to go.</span> <span id="s356">Maybe in the summer was better.</span> <span id="s357">There was somehow a thing when we were getting out of there, I think it was January or something.</span> <span id="s358">That was wintertime.</span> <span id="s359">So on a train with no food, everybody got some bread or something in a package, you know.</span> <span id="s360">But that was in March.</span> <span id="s361">I don't... forgot how long we remained in transit.</span> <span id="s362">And people practically dying--old people, children.</span> <span id="s363">They were doing it on themselves.</span> <span id="s364">And then everything...we developed this terrible thirst.</span> <span id="s365">And when the train stopped in different places... Every time was an air raid, you know, whistles came off and the train stopped; and some Germans, some Polacks came to the window.</span> <span id="s366">And we said, "Water!</span> <span id="s367">Water!</span> <span id="s368">Water!"</span> <span id="s369">He said got a watch or something, so we give him a watch for a little dirty water.</span> <span id="s370">Didn't have water.</span> <span id="s371">They took it from the locomotive or something...dirty water or some... So they were getting money, rings... But when you are thirsty and dehydrated, you give anything.</span> <span id="s372">I mean, you really...people really don't know that thirst is even worse than hunger.</span> <span id="s373">You know what I mean.</span> <span id="s374">Oh, it's devastating when you're thirsty.</span> <span id="s375">And they was giving away rings and anything, just for water; and a lot of time, they took it and didn't bring you water.</span> <span id="s376">Well, eventually we came to a place which was laid from all directions with spotlights.</span> <span id="s377">And we were not used to it, because due to air raids, you live in the darkness.</span> <span id="s378">While we were still in Pru_ana, we had during the night English or American...German planes going throughout the night.</span> <span id="s379">No, no...they was not American then.</span> <span id="s380">They were German planes.</span> <span id="s381">They were going towards Russia to bomb.</span> <span id="s382">And during the night, you heard that noise...(humming) all the time.</span> <span id="s383">And this... Course, everything was dark.</span> <span id="s384">Windows were...they had that tape across windows so they don't break.</span> <span id="s385">That was everyday picture you see.</span> <span id="s386">When we came and see that little place, you know, and we didn't know what happened.</span> <span id="s387">We knew that it is the end of the road.</span> <span id="s388">We were warned we were going there right away.</span> <span id="s389">And I think you call trestles; when the trains stopped, and we start to fall, like from that ceiling to the ground.</span> <span id="s390">Would you believe people were... They said, "Raus!</span> <span id="s391">Raus!</span> <span id="s392">Raus!"</span> <span id="s393">And a lot of people fall out.</span> <span id="s394">And the one who were gone were walking on the people who fell out, you know.</span> <span id="s395">And this "Andreten!"</span> <span id="s396">[Ger: "Line up!"]</span> <span id="s397">...you know: "Left, right, left, right."</span> <span id="s398">And we were surrounded by Germans with sticks.</span> <span id="s399">And there was uh, you know, a little contrast; because you know how neat the Germans are.</span> <span id="s400">How they shine the shoes and everything.</span> <span id="s401">They stayed there.</span> <span id="s402">And...and...and they started chasing us and beating us, and... And go in different lines.</span> <span id="s403">And I got hit, because I got a crazy idea.</span> <span id="s404">I got a bag with something.</span> <span id="s405">[Oh, my friend and I took a long string.</span> <span id="s406">I pass by and all of a sudden a little thing comes by.</span> <span id="s407">(ph)] And so he said, "Come back, come back."</span> <span id="s408">Hit me with the stick.</span> <span id="s409">(Laughing) Then they were throwing children.</span> <span id="s410">And it was a devastating scene.</span> <span id="s411">You wouldn't believe the inhumanities.</span> <span id="s412">They were knocking people down, hitting with the stick, and finishing them off, and... And tearing kids from women, and throwing them in the air.</span> <span id="s413">And the screams and the cries, that was just devastating.</span> <span id="s414">I have a bottle of cologne water.</span> <span id="s415">Going back in my mind, Russians used to drink that.</span> <span id="s416">Russians are big alcoholic.</span> <span id="s417">They used to come to a barber shop and drink half the after-shave lotion, the tonic.</span> <span id="s418">I see them like poison themselves with it.</span> <span id="s419">So what do I have to lose?</span> <span id="s420">I was so... It's alcohol.</span> <span id="s421">So I drink the cologne.</span> <span id="s422">They should put that in there for drink; because when you burp, it smells good.</span> <span id="s423">(Laughing) Really!</span> <span id="s424">That is the truth.</span> <span id="s425">And a German came up to me.</span> <span id="s426">And I was kind of a little drunk; and he smelled.</span> <span id="s427">He says, "Those Asians!"</span> <span id="s428">You know, like "Ignorants!</span> <span id="s429">," like "Drinking cologne!</span> <span id="s430">," you know.</span> <span id="s431">And we were in line.</span> <span id="s432">And they just take, of course, the ones who didn't make it.</span> <span id="s433">To give you a little idea, we were going in the transports like a cow.</span> <span id="s434">There was 10,000 people came out of the particular area, and this particular transport going to Birkenau.</span> <span id="s435">And I think, in a few days, we were only nine hundred.</span> <span id="s436">So we didn't know really what was happening to the others, you know.</span> <span id="s437">Nobody come and give you a daily report.</span> <span id="s438">You go this way, they go that way.</span> <span id="s439">You don't know anything.</span> <span id="s440">And why in Birkenau, then being transferred to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s441">We felt that smell in the air, and they said that was crematorium.</span> <span id="s442">And they were experimenting with people.</span> <span id="s443">Like in the morning it's called the "antret" [Ger: lining up].</span> <span id="s444">They count the prisoners in the morning, you know.</span> <span id="s445">And a lot of time, two or three [SS] walking, and they looked somebody in the face: "Out!"</span> <span id="s446">Put them on the side.</span> <span id="s447">"Out!"</span> <span id="s448">You didn't know where the people were going.</span> <span id="s449">And they were taking them for experiments in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s450">Of course, there was a bunch of people laying down who die in the night or something on the side.</span> <span id="s451">And the wagon.</span> <span id="s452">You see these wagons...pulled people.</span> <span id="s453">And the legs stick out here, and the head and a head.</span> <span id="s454">And they just thrown some on; they were naked, they were in prison outfits.</span> <span id="s455">And uh can you imagine...we went to work, we came back was a band playing.</span> <span id="s456">A first class band.</span> <span id="s457">They were people...</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: I am sorry.</span> <span id="s459">There was what?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: A band.</span> <span id="s461">You know, that gate "Arbeit Macht das Leben Frei" [Ger: "Work Makes the Living Free"] You probably seen it in pictures.</span> <span id="s462">We marched through it.</span> <span id="s463">And on the right side, there was a big band playing marches and they were all....musicians from all over Europe.</span> <span id="s464">I mean, they were excellent.</span> <span id="s465">They were playing marches.</span> <span id="s466">And on the right side...on the left side--I don't know if everytime--there were people laying shot to death, bleeding... And they said, "They were trying to escape.</span> <span id="s467">See what happened to them?"</span> <span id="s468">And the day we came, there was a table and a chair.</span> <span id="s469">And on top of the chair, there was a woman with her hands tied, bumps on the head.</span> <span id="s470">Oh, she was massacred!</span> <span id="s471">And there was a sign that her son escaped from the camp.</span> <span id="s472">And that was not for the Jews, because Jews don't leave any families.</span> <span id="s473">They were for the Polacks.</span> <span id="s474">There is a misconception.</span> <span id="s475">They think everybody in Auschwitz was Jewish.</span> <span id="s476">There was all nationalities.</span> <span id="s477">And they said her son escaped from the camp.</span> <span id="s478">"And if you escape, that is what is going to happen to your mother."</span> <span id="s479">You see, if she was there.</span> <span id="s480">On the table, on the chair, lot of blood, broken up with bumps... Really fixed up for the show, you know.</span> <span id="s481">And when you march, they tell you to look to the left; and there were people laying shot.</span> <span id="s482">They say they tried to escape, and a lot of times it wasn't true.</span> <span id="s483">I mean, we were working one time in there...one time in...they call it a..</span> <span id="s484">.</span> <span id="s485">werkhalle [Ger: "workshop"].</span> <span id="s486">Train comes through; and there was rails, you know, for trains.</span> <span id="s487">And those guys were walking back and forth; and a lot of time they took a stub from cigarette and throw it.</span> <span id="s488">We pick it up.</span> <span id="s489">So the guy threw the cigarettes on this side of the rails, so the prisoner wouldn't go.</span> <span id="s490">He said, "Go ahead and pick it up."</span> <span id="s491">So he go pick it up.</span> <span id="s492">And he reported the guy was trying to escape and they had another trick.</span> <span id="s493">If we were marching to work...a lot of times we were marching at night...somewhere on the highway to a factory, suddenly somebody sneaked out and escape.</span> <span id="s494">A lot of times was organized, like might been in cahoots with one of the guards.</span> <span id="s495">I was asked a couple of time to escape.</span> <span id="s496">They gonna help me.</span> <span id="s497">So what they did...</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Don't leave that just yet.</span> <span id="s499">You said you were asked by a couple of people to help organize an escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: No, to escape.</span> <span id="s501">I didn't trust them.</span> <span id="s502">I didn't trust them.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">One of them was true.</span> <span id="s504">Because after the war, I found out that he became a police chief in a certain city which I can't recall it.</span> <span id="s505">He was always working with the underground.</span> <span id="s506">He was a Polack.</span> <span id="s507">But we were fooled and cheated so many times, I just didn't trust him.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Go ahead.</span> <span id="s509">I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Anyway, somebody, like I said, escape from the column; well, they might take 10 or 15 people and shoot them to death and make out a report that "16 people were trying to escape.</span> <span id="s511">One made it, and I shot 15," you know.</span> <span id="s512">Big hero.</span> <span id="s513">So, (laughing) that's they way they were protecting themselves sometimes.</span> <span id="s514">There was a lot of good souls during the war, even Germans.</span> <span id="s515">Which I never want to forget, because I think if it wouldn't be for the good ones I wouldn't be alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Tell us.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: They were helping.</span> <span id="s518">I remember when the ghetto was closed because we were going to get out...being transported.</span> <span id="s519">At that time I was working...like you got a Coast Guard in the USA.</span> <span id="s520">Of course, this [wasn't] a Coast Guard; but this was a uh...like a border patrol, I would say.</span> <span id="s521">And they got high ranking officers.</span> <span id="s522">So one of them--I should remember his name--he was no more or less a high ranking officer.</span> <span id="s523">And he came with a..</span> <span id="s524">.</span> <span id="s525">You see, his idea was that after Hitler wins the war, they gonna make a special city and all the Jews are just going to live there and prosper.</span> <span id="s526">He wasn't very intelligent, but he knew it was wrong; so that was his idea.</span> <span id="s527">When I was in the ghetto, he came and got in an argument with a guard.</span> <span id="s528">He wants to get in, they wouldn't let him in.</span> <span id="s529">So finally he sent a message...a messenger, and I came to the barbed wire.</span> <span id="s530">He threw me one [of] his best leather briefcases, with newspapers and food, you see.</span> <span id="s531">Then another one was a Zollen...

I apologize.</span> <span id="s582">You came in, you were with your sister in Auschwitz-Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: To Birkenau, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Tell us what happened to your sister at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: Well, she wouldn't separate from her baby.</span> <span id="s586">And there was a lot of people; and I couldn't control it, and... I didn't see her any more.</span> <span id="s587">Only her...my brother-in-law was with me, but he went in about a couple of days.</span> <span id="s588">You see they pulled this like they told us to take all our clothes off and go into a shower.</span> <span id="s589">And he tripped over a rusted pipe, and his foot got swelling.</span> <span id="s590">And you know what they did with people which got sick.</span> <span id="s591">They just pick him up and put him in a gas chamber; and that's what happened to my brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s592">I never see my sister again.</span> <span id="s593">Then next day, I see the people, you know, in pajamas.</span> <span id="s594">You know, you see the outfits.</span> <span id="s595">And the area over there was very muddy, you know.</span> <span id="s596">Everything had big wheels.</span> <span id="s597">You keep pushing wagons, and back and forth, and doing a lot of unnecessary digging and work.</span> <span id="s598">And stuff like that.</span> <span id="s599">And eventually we were sent to Schwientochlowitz, which was a machine factory over there.</span> <span id="s600">They were making parts for airplanes and stuff like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: How far was this from Auschwitz-Birkenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: There's no way I could tell you.</span> <span id="s603">That wasn't too far.</span> <span id="s604">Like I said, might mean like here to Petersburg [NB: Virginia].</span> <span id="s605">It was in the general area.</span> <span id="s606">I couldn't recall.</span> <span id="s607">I know that it wasn't too far.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: What did you do in the factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Uh, I finally wound up working on a machine.</span> <span id="s610">And uh, I don't know where I had the experience from.</span> <span id="s611">I was working on the lathe machine.</span> <span id="s612">There was a lot of people.</span> <span id="s613">And then, I had 2 or 3 people I had to cover for.</span> <span id="s614">They didn't know nothing about the work, but they were very sick.</span> <span id="s615">And if they go outside, they would die.</span> <span id="s616">So I kept running back and forth and helping them.</span> <span id="s617">And couple of them met me after the war, and tried to give me money.</span> <span id="s618">(Laughing) But anyway....</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: Talk about this a little more.</span> <span id="s620">How did you cover for them?</span> <span id="s621">How did you...keep talking about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Alright.</span> <span id="s623">Recognizing you put a certain item on it, and it's a knife cutting.</span> <span id="s624">Right?</span> <span id="s625">So you put it on, and you just let it go and push the button when it's on this end.</span> <span id="s626">And wave to me, and I put another piece on, you know.</span> <span id="s627">There was something like, it takes time and...and...did... The guy who asked me if I wanted to escape, he was a civilian foreman.</span> <span id="s628">He made me a prisoner foreman.</span> <span id="s629">This is no like a carpet...this is work, you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s630">This is not... So I was covering for a few people as much as I could, but, uh... One was a Czech.</span> <span id="s631">He was Jew.</span> <span id="s632">He was a machinist, but he was so sick that he was breaking stuff.</span> <span id="s633">So I made a special thing I made for him so nobody...when he was making the run...those, so.</span> <span id="s634">I don't know how to explain.</span> <span id="s635">And you had to go to the machine, run; and he was breaking it.</span> <span id="s636">So I made a device to hold it.</span> <span id="s637">You see, if he doesn't do good they put him outside; and when he is sick that is the end.</span> <span id="s638">Then a bunch of people lift the crane, you know, like this big long thing was laying.</span> <span id="s639">And it fell down and broke about 20 people's legs.</span> <span id="s640">They all got shot, you know.</span> <span id="s641">They didn't care.</span> <span id="s642">And, uh, we worked there and one day, of course, uh while we go back from work we had to watch hangings before supper.</span> <span id="s643">They had 2 or 3 sets of wires--and electric wires--and the people to be hanged, they put them between the wires and they might stay there for three days with no food, urinating on themselves.</span> <span id="s644">And they bring them up when we come from work.</span> <span id="s645">And they put a table and a chair, and they hang them; and they read some funny sentence and they kick the chair out.</span> <span id="s646">And a lot of them...I see one that was shot before he was hanged.</span> <span id="s647">He started calling, "You murderers!</span> <span id="s648">You are going to lose the war!</span> <span id="s649">Hitler gonna die!"</span> <span id="s650">And all that.</span> <span id="s651">And the guy just...(making shooting sounds), and they hang them on top of that.</span> <span id="s652">And we just got so cold, it didn't bother anybody anymore.</span> <span id="s653">Looking at dead people, looking at people getting hung... You know, you get so...just like watching a movie.</span> <span id="s654">And you feel like after the war, how do you react to things, you know.</span> <span id="s655">But for some reason, you get back to normal.</span> <span id="s656">You see somebody hit by a car or something; and you...I think, with time you come back to your own self.</span> <span id="s657">You know what I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s659">Let's break it here and give them time to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: Oh, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s663">So you were the prisoner foreman in this factory trying to help people from being killed basically.</span> <span id="s664">What happened to you?</span> <span id="s665">What were the living conditions like for the factory workers?</span> <span id="s666">Where did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: We live in barracks and every day, I don't know what time it was, but was usually dark...we marched...that was the guard was helping me.</span> <span id="s668">He would be walking beside me, put a piece of bread in my pocket.</span> <span id="s669">A lot of time was dried out, but it was terrific.</span> <span id="s670">I mean you was starved.</span> <span id="s671">You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s672">And we walk every morning to the factory.</span> <span id="s673">I don't know how far.</span> <span id="s674">It took awhile and at night we walked back, and before you do anything, they were always counting the prisoners, you know.</span> <span id="s675">They say: "Antreten!</span> <span id="s676">One, two, three..." And even the dead ones had to lay dead to make the figure going.</span> <span id="s677">And we came to the factory, and then we get like 30 minutes or 5 minutes break.</span> <span id="s678">And we fall asleep instantly and then we get up, run to the machines.</span> <span id="s679">And the toilets were outside.</span> <span id="s680">That was the scariest part, to go out in the dark.</span> <span id="s681">First you didn't know if somebody was inside, was completely dark.</span> <span id="s682">Sometimes you just open the door, and you do it, and somebody scream, hey you did it my face, you know, and you run in the dark, and that was a every day situation, and, uh, food was any better than anybody else's you know.</span> <span id="s683">They were giving the same garbage to eat.</span> <span id="s684">And I don't remember we have any day we didn't work really.</span> <span id="s685">I couldn't recall.</span> <span id="s686">And, uh, a lot of time, they wake us in the middle of the night, and the start beating everybody, like somebody did something, you know.</span> <span id="s687">We had to watch hanging, you know.</span> <span id="s688">And that went pretty quick day by day, the same situation, and you felt yourself fortunate that you were working inside because people were in the snow and everyday you see the dead.</span> <span id="s689">People were dragged around and put ont he wagon and taken away, you know.</span> <span id="s690">If you were sick, you didn't get any help, but I suppose you want to come to the end of that episode.</span> <span id="s691">One day, the Russians start coming and we get evacuated, but before we do, we had to make the place spic and span.</span> <span id="s692">You had to clean everything, because the Russians wouldn't think much of the Germans if we leave that behind as you know, so we had to clean it up.</span> <span id="s693">Shine it up!</span> <span id="s694">And then march us to a railroad station, and we like cattle.</span> <span id="s695">It was very cold.</span> <span id="s696">I think it was in January.</span> <span id="s697">It was very cold, and they left us all outside and they were inside.</span> <span id="s698">And you know, you might have a stove one time when you take a chicken like a piece of chalk and go across her bill and she going to stay there.</span> <span id="s699">She thinks she's tied down and it was the same situation.</span> <span id="s700">We could get up and run, all of us.</span> <span id="s701">Of course, they probably machine gun us.</span> <span id="s702">But the guards, everything went inside because it was cold.</span> <span id="s703">We just, you know, prisoners just get together like chickens and just holding on to each other.</span> <span id="s704">And finally we took off and I don't know...it's kind of...I started developing typhus fever and, which came on on me, and we were like partial on trucks and on trains and eventually we were marching.</span> <span id="s705">And anybody couldn't walk, they take him under a tree and bingo.</span> <span id="s706">And people started disappearing a little bit.</span> <span id="s707">Because the Russians were getting close.</span> <span id="s708">Sometime you heard explosions, and cannons from far away, and air raids; and we were laying on the ground when there were air raids.</span> <span id="s709">And we marched.</span> <span id="s710">And I remember like a woman was walking with a bucket to the barn for pigs.</span> <span id="s711">You know, they put bread and all leftovers.</span> <span id="s712">And she walked a little too close to our column, and a couple prisoners jumped and knocked her down.</span> <span id="s713">And everybody got in on the top, eating from the ground.</span> <span id="s714">We were terribly hungry.</span> <span id="s715">We were out.</span> <span id="s716">And the guards were hitting us with the guns.</span> <span id="s717">And then several of them...I think some guards escaped.</span> <span id="s718">Well, finally...I forgot what transportation was used or how we did it.</span> <span id="s719">I think we got somewhere to Mauthausen, or Gusen.</span> <span id="s720">I told you I was going bad from typhus.</span> <span id="s721">And one remarkable thing over there was that when "Antreten," when everybody lines up and some guys came--they were wearing German uniforms, but they were prisoners.</span> <span id="s722">But they didn't have any insignias or anything.</span> <span id="s723">And they say, "All the kapos, come out."</span> <span id="s724">You know what a Kapo was.</span> <span id="s725">So they figured they going to get a new position; so they all lined up outside.</span> <span id="s726">Said, "Take then first one."</span> <span id="s727">He said, "Did he beat on anybody, or did he ever hurt anybody?"</span> <span id="s728">So nobody say nothing funny.</span> <span id="s729">While we were...at one camp, I think, Dresden-Bariza--oh, that's camp I forgot--we came from the factory from work one night...one morning, and we were infestated by louse.</span> <span id="s730">So they got big barrels of some kind of chemicals.</span> <span id="s731">We all have to take our clothes off and dip them in there.</span> <span id="s732">And then they wouldn't let us in the building, because we were wet.</span> <span id="s733">So we...everybody tied on the clothes; and we run around to try and dry it out.</span> <span id="s734">Because the guards would not let you in while you wait.</span> <span id="s735">And here it's January...is snow on the ground.</span> <span id="s736">And now and then, they were playing around.</span> <span id="s737">And this boy's father...I don't know, he was a little clumsy.</span> <span id="s738">So they told him to get in a barrel, and the guy put the arm around him and smoke a cigarette and wait until the guy die.</span> <span id="s739">They killed him in the barrel.</span> <span id="s740">So his son was young.</span> <span id="s741">He come out and he say, "He killed my father!"</span> <span id="s742">So the guard tell them, "Beat him up!"</span> <span id="s743">So he beats him up.</span> <span id="s744">He said, "Anybody want to help him?"</span> <span id="s745">So they open up...he said, "This guy mistreat me, officer."</span> <span id="s746">And all the Kapos were beaten by the prisoners.</span> <span id="s747">One guy, he had his head split four times.</span> <span id="s748">I swear, you can see it this way and that way--four splits.</span> <span id="s749">And bunch of them die.</span> <span id="s750">And in the morning, one got common sick.</span> <span id="s751">"Could somebody help me?"</span> <span id="s752">Said, "Oh, the dead ones.</span> <span id="s753">Hang him in the toilet."</span> <span id="s754">We tell the Germans that he hang himself during the night.</span> <span id="s755">(Laughing) And they put him out.</span> <span id="s756">We were surprised when they put him; and uh they said that they hang themselves.</span> <span id="s757">That happened in the Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s758">But now before we got there, I think...I forgot the order of things, I had to read it myself now.</span> <span id="s759">It's been many years.</span> <span id="s760">We were [in] Gusen.</span> <span id="s761">And look like we came in and everybody over there was naked, because they got some typhus or something.</span> <span id="s762">And so they took everybody's clothes away.</span> <span id="s763">And they also kill a few people there, because their rations were very little.</span> <span id="s764">So they were going by the morning count them; and after they deducted dead people, they say, "75 in this room, save 75 portions of bread."</span> <span id="s765">So what the Kapos did: they went in the washroom and see somebody weak or something, they killed them.</span> <span id="s766">Hold their nose and waited until he died.</span> <span id="s767">So they got extra bread.</span> <span id="s768">It's kind of sad, isn't it?</span> <span id="s769">But that's what actually happened.</span> <span id="s770">And uh uh then, of course, we were at Mauthausen...</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: Come back.</span> <span id="s772">The incident at Mauthausen...</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: Where they were beating up kapos.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: ...where they were beating up the Kapos.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: Yah, when we first came, they beat up a bunch of Kapos.</span> <span id="s776">They told the prisoners to get even.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Did you ever find out how Jews got ahold of German uniforms, and had the power to attack the kapos?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: I didn't know if they were Jews.</span> <span id="s779">I don't know if they were Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: The uniforms were, uh, sort of like the Schutzpolizei, but they didn't have insignia.</span> <span id="s782">Just like you go here to a surplus store, and you buy a uniform and don't have any... It's just wearing those uniforms.</span> <span id="s783">They were kind of blue.</span> <span id="s784">Because the soldiers were wearing green, and so I think they SS people.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: So you never found out how these people got the authority to get to allow you to do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: And then, uh, uh, then one night we were told to pick up.</span> <span id="s789">They were Mauthausen...I think it was in the mountains, and there was a lot of POW camps.</span> <span id="s790">And I think it was an outbreak when the Russians came.</span> <span id="s791">You know, they were Russian prisoners and they shoot the heck out of them.</span> <span id="s792">They shot the heck out of them.</span> <span id="s793">And they called us to pick up the dead...dead Russians.</span> <span id="s794">And uh they also had a thing in Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s795">They had a crematorium, that they were burning the dead people.</span> <span id="s796">We were cutting them up in front of the crematorium.</span> <span id="s797">And the irony of it was when one it was like a lunch time, we sit on a dead body.</span> <span id="s798">A lot of people had their clothes on, because they were deteriorated from blood and stuff.</span> <span id="s799">After the finish with whatever you had, you look in the pockets.</span> <span id="s800">If they got a little cigarette butt or something like that.</span> <span id="s801">Now, I tell you another incident.</span> <span id="s802">I was in Gräditz-Bareza (ph) when my typhus really went out.</span> <span id="s803">I know I hit the nurse in the head; and I don't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s804">So I was in the night shift there working on the machine.</span> <span id="s805">And the guards come to me and tell me to walk and walk back, and said, "Take him away."</span> <span id="s806">So they bring me back to the barracks.</span> <span id="s807">That was a memorable night.</span> <span id="s808">They brought me back to the barracks.</span> <span id="s809">I tried to lay down; and on every bunk is about 4, 5 people and people get real mean.</span> <span id="s810">So finally, I find a bunk in the bottom with just one guy sleeping.</span> <span id="s811">So I figure maybe he is a kapo or something special.</span> <span id="s812">So I put my hands on the ground so I didn't disturb the bed; and some kind of slipped on it, and I went to sleep.</span> <span id="s813">In the morning, the guy say, "You better get away from there, because it is wet on the bed and they are going to think you pee under the bed."</span> <span id="s814">So I jumped off, and I told this guy to get off too and they guy don't move.</span> <span id="s815">He says, "That man is dead.</span> <span id="s816">Don't bother him.</span> <span id="s817">That's just when he die, he wet it."</span> <span id="s818">I was sleeping with a dead man.</span> <span id="s819">Now my typhus got worse.</span> <span id="s820">I couldn't eat.</span> <span id="s821">Even the rubber bread.</span> <span id="s822">So I give it to a guy and he was carrying me, you know, under his arm.</span> <span id="s823">And the following night, I decided to hang myself.</span> <span id="s824">I had the belt and the belt was cut in half, you know, because I need... I got wooden shoes to part of the belt and tied my shoes, so I don't lose it...and I don't know what to do.</span> <span id="s825">So I went on the upper bunk and I put it around my throat and I tie it; and I jump off.</span> <span id="s826">That's all I remember.</span> <span id="s827">The next thing I open my eyes and I am on the ground.</span> <span id="s828">And a guy standing over me, he says, "You going to miss the bread.</span> <span id="s829">Come on!</span> <span id="s830">Come on!</span> <span id="s831">Come on!"</span> <span id="s832">I said, "Whose bread?"</span> <span id="s833">He said, "Come on!"</span> <span id="s834">Because I was giving it to him.</span> <span id="s835">So he finally gave up and he ran, because he would miss his too.</span> <span id="s836">You know they were giving out the bread.</span> <span id="s837">So I remember when I was laying, some Russian got to me and stole my shoes...he stole my...everything.</span> <span id="s838">When I was laying down, we were like a homeless people.</span> <span id="s839">I got a little metal box in my pocket and I got...I don't know, a nail and a half a razor blade and a couple of cigarette butts.</span> <span id="s840">I say, "I know what I am going to do.</span> <span id="s841">I am going to take that little blade and cut my wrist."</span> <span id="s842">Was stolen.</span> <span id="s843">(Laughing) My pockets were empty.</span> <span id="s844">(Laughing) The Russian [who] stole it saved my life, because I suppose if I slice it that it would be the end of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: You never found out who cut you down or who took you down?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s847">The guy took me down who I was giving the bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: Because he was holding on to me.</span> <span id="s850">You have to see some bread.</span> <span id="s851">I think it was steamed.</span> <span id="s852">I wouldn't even beg.</span> <span id="s853">I mean, it was a mess.</span> <span id="s854">The guy, finally, after the war...he wants to give me money because he was one of those guys I kept alive in Schwientochlowitz on a machine, you know.</span> <span id="s855">He didn't know a machine from a hole in the ground.</span> <span id="s856">I kept 2 or 3 of them going, because I was keeping that thing running, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: So what happened?</span> <span id="s858">You are lying on the ground.</span> <span id="s859">You have discovered that you failed at hanging yourself.</span> <span id="s860">You don't have a razor?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: He took me down, so he don't lose the bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s863">Your pockets are empty.</span> <span id="s864">You've been stripped.</span> <span id="s865">You can't cut your wrists.</span> <span id="s866">What did you do?</span> <span id="s867">What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: I did nothing.</span> <span id="s869">I just got up, I guess, and I just went on and.</span> <span id="s870">.</span> <span id="s871">I tell you whatelse happened.</span> <span id="s872">In a few days, we will have evacuate, and I was still have trouble walking.</span> <span id="s873">Friends of mine were holding on to me.</span> <span id="s874">So they say, "We going to be going, wherever.</span> <span id="s875">And the ones who can't walk, we are going to put them on the trucks."</span> <span id="s876">So the first thing, people stepped out.</span> <span id="s877">I make a step, and my friend says, "Don't be a..</span> <span id="s878">."</span> <span id="s879">I don't want to say the language.</span> <span id="s880">(Laughing) "Don't be..." you know what.</span> <span id="s881">"Stay here."</span> <span id="s882">Sure enough, they had shelters where the Germans were coming in, you know.</span> <span id="s883">Everybody was worrying about the Yperite gas, and they all got gas masks.</span> <span id="s884">So they have shelters, and the shelters have some kind of air coming in there, you know.</span> <span id="s885">Is separate from the outside air.</span> <span id="s886">They take all the people that couldn't walk and put them in there and throw Zyklon or gas.</span> <span id="s887">And we had to dig graves and they put them in the graves.</span> <span id="s888">And you know they even...all day they just spewed that white stuff... chloro somehow.</span> <span id="s889">And they wouldn't even cover up.</span> <span id="s890">And then when they marched us to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s891">And...oh, I think there was a thousand of us; and I think maybe a hundred made it.</span> <span id="s892">I don't know.</span> <span id="s893">They were shooting people on the way, and guards were disappearing.</span> <span id="s894">They were escaping.</span> <span id="s895">Prisoners were escaping.</span> <span id="s896">I couldn't go any place, because I was hardly moving.</span> <span id="s897">And I finally got to Leitmeritz [NB: Litomerice].</span> <span id="s898">I was in Leitmeritz, a friend of mine from Warsaw recognized me here.</span> <span id="s899">And he went up to me and he said, "Come on this side.</span> <span id="s900">They don't know I am a Jew.</span> <span id="s901">I am a Polack.</span> <span id="s902">I can get you on the other side."</span> <span id="s903">I refused to go.</span> <span id="s904">I was... My age, I was 21 at the time.</span> <span id="s905">So I refused to go.</span> <span id="s906">I said, "No, I am going to be here and I am going to die like a Jew.</span> <span id="s907">I am not going."</span> <span id="s908">He said, "You are an idiot!"</span> <span id="s909">And I stay with all the people.</span> <span id="s910">And sure enough they were taking people to Final Solution, you know.</span> <span id="s911">Well, I was trying to say, there's just rumors, the Red Cross told the Russians that we all going to murdered in Theresienstadt and this is a rumor.</span> <span id="s912">And they asked for volunteers, because they wasn't agreeing with the military plan.</span> <span id="s913">And they asked for volunteers, and a lot of Jews and other people came and we got liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: I am confused.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: I know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: Back it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: We were walking from the last camp toward Leitmeritz, which is next to Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: And when I got there, there were camps.</span> <span id="s920">A guy was trying to save me, and I wouldn't go in for it.</span> <span id="s921">I didn't care anymore.</span> <span id="s922">And they said that they gonna kill everybody, you know.</span> <span id="s923">So that's why he was trying to save me.</span> <span id="s924">He says they're going to take all the Jews now and finish them off.</span> <span id="s925">So they said that the Red Cross carried that to the Russians, that we all going to be destroyed over there.</span> <span id="s926">So the Russians asked for volunteers because that didn't agree with the military plan.</span> <span id="s927">But this is just what I heard.</span> <span id="s928">And one of the divisions or outfits or battalions went and liberated us.</span> <span id="s929">We were liberated by the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: And after the Russians liberated us, we gain a few people.</span> <span id="s932">There was a few Jews in the Russian Army, and they didn't want to be in the Russian Army.</span> <span id="s933">So they got in with us as war prisoners; and that's funny but that's what they did.</span> <span id="s934">Polish citizens were drafted in the Russian army, and they escaped.</span> <span id="s935">They got mixed in with us.</span> <span id="s936">And, uh, and right after that, there was a terrible typhus epidemic.</span> <span id="s937">I think I had typhus.</span> <span id="s938">What saved me was walking.</span> <span id="s939">That's what they tell me.</span> <span id="s940">Me keep on walking would save my life.</span> <span id="s941">And we were in a kaserne [Ger: barracks].</span> <span id="s942">How do you call it?</span> <span id="s943">Like a camps, military camps over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: What was it like?</span> <span id="s945">The Russians had taken you and put you into military type camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: That was Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s947">I think it was ghetto before, but original, I think, was a military place.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: How did the Russians take care of you?</span> <span id="s949">Did they feed you?</span> <span id="s950">What did they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: Well, we were kind of, more or less, free.</span> <span id="s952">We were kind of feeding ourselves.</span> <span id="s953">We went out and we pick up peaches and this, and they let us go.</span> <span id="s954">But the remarkable things...when we first came was still Germans.</span> <span id="s955">And one night, we were waking up, the Germans are capitulate, you know, and the Czechs were running up and down the streets.</span> <span id="s956">"The war is over.</span> <span id="s957">Long live Beneš!"</span> <span id="s958">Whoever was the President [of Czechoslovakia].</span> <span id="s959">And next morning, trains came with prisoners.</span> <span id="s960">And they didn't know the war was over.</span> <span id="s961">And we hollered to them, "You are free!</span> <span id="s962">The war is over!"</span> <span id="s963">And the Germans stayed there, and nobody was doing nothing.</span> <span id="s964">We were like the chicken with the chalk.</span> <span id="s965">We just...officer and there was a bunch of people came with arm bands, whatever you call them.</span> <span id="s966">And they picked up all the Germans and take the guns away, and they marched them off.</span> <span id="s967">And we tell the prisoners, "You are free!"</span> <span id="s968">And a lot of them didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s969">And then a night burst started because people were used to eat.</span> <span id="s970">You see dead people in the public places like toilets.</span> <span id="s971">They were laying on the ground and there was dysentery.</span> <span id="s972">Oh, those first moments after the war, they were horrible!</span> <span id="s973">I was in a kaserne, you know, Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s974">And we had dead people piling every morning, and wagons were picking them up, picking them up, and that was after the war was over.</span> <span id="s975">And that was terrible.</span> <span id="s976">People were dying because of the after affects of the war.</span> <span id="s977">And then we went through different kind of things like... I tell you a incident, and I keep my hand out.</span> <span id="s978">We went to a..</span> <span id="s979">.</span> <span id="s980">you know they got public baths.</span> <span id="s981">I never been to one in the United States.</span> <span id="s982">Public bath houses.</span> <span id="s983">I think they have...I was in Minneapolis, I see one.</span> <span id="s984">And they took us to those places to get us cleaned up and dressed.</span> <span id="s985">And, of course, all the clothes--I don't know where they came from--you never got anything to fit you.</span> <span id="s986">And there was a number of women.</span> <span id="s987">And we all had to take the clothes off, but was nothing to look at.</span> <span id="s988">Everybody looked like...I was 80 pounds.</span> <span id="s989">And uh...uh well, there was a certain process.</span> <span id="s990">They were going under a magnifying glass; because some people got different bugs.</span> <span id="s991">I don't know what they call it.</span> <span id="s992">They were checking your body.</span> <span id="s993">But the washing machines or whatever...who was washing the clothes, they couldn't keep up with it.</span> <span id="s994">So they put us in an empty room, like 100 at a time.</span> <span id="s995">And all of a sudden, like women dressed like nurses come and tell us to turn the face to the wall.</span> <span id="s996">You know, a hundred of us, naked.</span> <span id="s997">All of a sudden they come out; and a hundred naked women on the other side.</span> <span id="s998">Well, in today's times, that would make a nice X-rated movie that, wouldn't it?</span> <span id="s999">But nobody had any thought in that direction.</span> <span id="s1000">One boy turn around and recognized somebody.</span> <span id="s1001">So everybody got curious.</span> <span id="s1002">You say, "Where you from?"</span> <span id="s1003">People were running around naked.</span> <span id="s1004">Nobody know naked, you just see up to here.</span> <span id="s1005">"Where you from?"</span> <span id="s1006">"What happened to my mother?"</span> <span id="s1007">"Are you from my city?"</span> <span id="s1008">"Are you from my town?"</span> <span id="s1009">And the women were shaved.</span> <span id="s1010">And the whole place got all mixed up, and all you heard: "Where you from?"</span> <span id="s1011">"Is my mother alive?"</span> <span id="s1012">"Are you from my city?"</span> <span id="s1013">"Are you from my town?"</span> <span id="s1014">"Did you...are you been with my father?"</span> <span id="s1015">"I think you...are you from Slonim?"</span> <span id="s1016">"Are you from here?"</span> <span id="s1017">People forgot they were naked.</span> <span id="s1018">And those nurses come up and said, "Oh, my God!</span> <span id="s1019">Would you all get back in your places?"</span> <span id="s1020">(Laughing) You know, people were running around like that; and... and nobody even noticed that people were naked, you know.</span> <span id="s1021">They were so overcome, looking for relatives, and...and something from home that just...
