something about your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: Well, my parents – of course, to me they were the best parents in the world.</span> <span id="s23">My mother was a housewife.</span> <span id="s24">My father made a living for her.</span> <span id="s25">And we were a happy family with two other children.</span> <span id="s26">There was three of us, a brother, we were two sisters.</span> <span id="s27">And we had a beautiful family.</span> <span id="s28">We had a large family, uncles and aunts, grandparents, niece and nephews, nieces, cousins.</span> <span id="s29">Unfortunately, all of them were killed by the Germans, by the Nazis actually.</span> <span id="s30">And there's very little, very few of us left at the present time.</span> <span id="s31">And what is there to talk about?</span> <span id="s32">We had a wonderful home.</span> <span id="s33">We had a beautiful home.</span> <span id="s34">We had a beautiful life until World War II came around and this is when our problems started and our life was destroyed.</span> <span id="s35">But we survived, minus my father, my aunts, my uncles, my cousins, my grandparents.</span> <span id="s36">It's just the four of us who survived.</span> <span id="s37">And where do we start talking about our lives?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">01:02:21</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Tell me what happened when the Nazis came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: When they came in we tried to escape.</span> <span id="s41">We thought perhaps we would go to White Russia which supposedly, you could be safe there, but it was too late.</span> <span id="s42">After two days of traveling, we had to turn back and we came back to our town.</span> <span id="s43">At that time the Nazis had already fencing in about 20 blocks or so – and all the Jewish people had to move out of their homes and go to live in that area.</span> <span id="s44">And had some distant cousins living there, so we moved in with them and we lived with them.</span> <span id="s45">My father since he spoke many languages, he was taken by the Nazis as an interpreter.</span> <span id="s46">And so he would work during the day and come home at night to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s47">The rest of us – I would – I stayed home.</span> <span id="s48">My mother and my sister were taken to work to labor camps every day and brought back in the evening.</span> <span id="s49">While living there, of course, life was very harsh, very hard.</span> <span id="s50">We could not go out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s51">You were supposed to stay inside.</span> <span id="s52">The minute we moved into the ghetto we had – they put up the yellow stars on each one of us.</span> <span id="s53">We always had to walk around in the streets with a yellow star, one in the back and one up front.</span> <span id="s54">Frightening it was, but that was part of our lives and we existed like this for a few months until one morning very early we heard knocking on the doors and the windows and yelling, you know, “Get out!</span> <span id="s55">Get out!</span> <span id="s56">Get out!”</span> <span id="s57">So quickly we got dressed and we walked out of the house that we were staying in.</span> <span id="s58">The Gestapo was there and they told us all to go in a certain direction.</span> <span id="s59">My mother put on me my beautiful rabbit coat that I had, a rabbit coat and a hat.</span> <span id="s60">And we started following the other people, and they took us to a large building.</span> <span id="s61">It must have been a factory and they told us to get undressed.</span> <span id="s62">And they would make you take off the jewelry and everything, any valuables that you had on you.</span> <span id="s63">They undressed – they told us to get undressed.</span> <span id="s64">We all did.</span> <span id="s65">The women remained with the underwear only, and the men in their shorts.</span> <span id="s66">And my mother wasn't fast enough to take off her gold earrings, so she was hit by a Gestapo with the handle of a rifle and she fell down.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">We picked her up.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">01:05:52 And all of us – there were a few hundred of us – we were all already undressed, and we had to form lines outside.</span> <span id="s69">It was a cloudy day, very cloudy, and a very fine drizzle was going down.</span> <span id="s70">And all the women were so embarrassed that they were without anything on top that they all covered their breasts with their hands.</span> <span id="s71">And they made groups and we started walking the street following the other people.</span> <span id="s72">As we were passing some of those streets and there were some Ukrainians who were cheering as we were walking by.</span> <span id="s73">They were applauding and cheering.</span> <span id="s74">But this, this what was done to us.</span> <span id="s75">We kept on walking silently without saying anything until we were out of the city.</span> <span id="s76">And on the roads going towards where they were taking us, there were rows on both sides of Gestapo and German Shepherds.</span> <span id="s77">And we kept walking and the drizzle was coming down and I was so scared.</span> <span id="s78">I was so afraid that I developed diarrhea.</span> <span id="s79">But you are not allowed to talk so I didn't tell my mother anything.</span> <span id="s80">We just kept on walking and walking.</span> <span id="s81">And then my mother said, "Children, you have to pray to God."</span> <span id="s82">And we did.</span> <span id="s83">And as we were walking a black cat crossed the street and somehow somebody said, "Okay, now you know where we are going.</span> <span id="s84">We are going to be killed."</span> <span id="s85">But my mother said to us, "Don't think that way.</span> <span id="s86">Don't think that way."</span> <span id="s87">And we kept on walking.</span> <span id="s88">When we got to the field and that was an abandoned slaughter house, there were mountains of clothing from the people before that were killed and their clothing was taken off there.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">They told us to stand in line to wait to be killed and at that time the sun came out and the day was beautiful.</span> <span id="s90">The sun was shining.</span> <span id="s91">The skies were blue.</span> <span id="s92">And so many people standing naked in that line waiting to be killed.</span> <span id="s93">And my mother was looking around and she saw this tall Gestapo man.</span> <span id="s94">Very, very tall.</span> <span id="s95">And she took a chance by walking out of the line and walking towards him and asked him, "Do they kill non-Jews here."</span> <span id="s96">And he looks at her and he says, "You're not Jewish?"</span> <span id="s97">And she says, "No, I'm not."</span> <span id="s98">And he said, "Well, what are you doing here?"</span> <span id="s99">She said, "Well, my husband was taken to prison.</span> <span id="s100">He is someplace in one of these cities," she said, "and I decided with my children to come and find him to visit him."</span> <span id="s101">So we were walking on this road and as they were bringing down the Jews, they took us along and nobody would listen to us."</span> <span id="s102">With that, with one of his hands, he took my mother's hand, my hand, and my sister's hand and he took us out of the line and he said, "Come with me."</span> <span id="s103">He took us into that abandoned little slaughter house and he told us to sit and wait.</span> <span id="s104">In the meantime he told my sister that she should bring some clothing.</span> <span id="s105">So he took her to one of those mountains, and she just picked up whatever clothing she was able to get for my mother, for myself and herself.</span> <span id="s106">And she brought it in and we started putting on the clothing.</span> <span id="s107">There was some other people in that place, and one of them was a lady with a baby in her arms, and she recognized us.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">01:10:34 And when the Gestapo came in with a Ukrainian, because the Ukrainians were collaborators, and they spoke Ukrainian and Russian and Polish.</span> <span id="s109">They spoke – and they spoke German.</span> <span id="s110">So in order for the Gestapo to understand, you know, what we were saying because we're talking to him in Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s111">My mother was talking Ukrainian to him.</span> <span id="s112">So this lady turns around and says to him, "They are Jews.</span> <span id="s113">Why aren't they killed."</span> <span id="s114">And so he hit her, and we just sat there frightened.</span> <span id="s115">We didn't know what to say.</span> <span id="s116">We couldn't say anything.</span> <span id="s117">And he took us out.</span> <span id="s118">We were already dressed.</span> <span id="s119">And he said to us – he said to the Ukrainian, "You take them to town.</span> <span id="s120">You will escort them to town."</span> <span id="s121">Because you could not possibly walk on the road back when this was – when they were walking all the Jews to be killed.</span> <span id="s122">So the Ukrainian told us to follow him and we did.</span> <span id="s123">As we were walking back, on the side of the street, of the road my mother saw many of our neighbors who were walking towards the slaughter house to be killed.</span> <span id="s124">And all she did was sigh because it was very painful to see them go.</span> <span id="s125">So the Ukrainian didn't say anything and when we got to the city to town and my mother said to him, "Thank you for bringing us back to town," he said to us, "No.</span> <span id="s126">We're not letting you go because you are Jewish.</span> <span id="s127">You are Jews."</span> <span id="s128">And my mother says, "No.</span> <span id="s129">I'm not."</span> <span id="s130">He says, "Yes, you are.</span> <span id="s131">I saw you, how you sighed when you saw them, the Jews walking that road.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">And we have to interr….</span> <span id="s133">“ My mother started, of course, lying and saying, “no” and tells him the same story that she told the, the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s134">And he says, "No, we have to take you in for interrogation and, and then we'll see what happens and then we'll let you go."</span> <span id="s135">So my mother said, "Perhaps I can, you know, give you something.</span> <span id="s136">I have some…” you know, some things she had saved whatever.</span> <span id="s137">“I'll pay you.</span> <span id="s138">Just let us go."</span> <span id="s139">And he said, "No."</span> <span id="s140">He took us to a little jail which was in the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">01:13:29 And we were put in a room maybe was 10 by 10 with other criminals and other robbers and thieves and everything like that.</span> <span id="s142">They put us in there.</span> <span id="s143">And every day, they would take us a few blocks from that area to a Gestapo office for interrogation.</span> <span id="s144">And so they were, you know, asking my mother questions and my sister and, of course, we kept telling them the same story.</span> <span id="s145">Nothing – me they didn't touch.</span> <span id="s146">It was just my mother and my sister interrogating to see if they lied or if they were telling the truth.</span> <span id="s147">And they just couldn't find anything out and this was already like three, four days.</span> <span id="s148">One day they decided that the only way they will be sure to find out if we are Jews are not is if they interrogate me.</span> <span id="s149">And I was about five and a half at that time.</span> <span id="s150">So they came to jail and I remember this Gestapo put me on his lap and said to me – asking me my name which, of course, we changed our names.</span> <span id="s151">We changed our identity.</span> <span id="s152">We changed everything.</span> <span id="s153">And he started telling me what a beautiful little Jewish girl I am.</span> <span id="s154">And I sort of jumped at him.</span> <span id="s155">I says, "How can you compare me to a Jewish little girl.</span> <span id="s156">I am Christian and I am – we have nothing to do – I have nothing to do with Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s157">I don't even want to look like them."</span> <span id="s158">Well, he kept interrogating me for about an hour and he kept on every second, you know, second word or third word “Jewish little girl, Jewish little girl,” and I kept saying you know, "That's not me and we're not and we're just Christians and that's all."</span> <span id="s159">Well, after that they realized that you know, they're wrong.</span> <span id="s160">That for sure we are from where we told them we were and we were going where we were going, the whole, the whole bit.</span> <span id="s161">But then they decided after checking out the town that my mother gave them, there was no one under such a name and the address.</span> <span id="s162">There was no such address and so on and so forth – there was no such people.</span> <span id="s163">They realized that there was something not right.</span> <span id="s164">So they decided to have us interrogated again.</span> <span id="s165">So the next day, we were, all of us, walking on the street going towards the Gestapo office.</span> <span id="s166">And of course, there was always a Ukrainian who would be our guard because my mother spoke Ukrainian and one of my sister's friends from school saw her and she said to her, "You are still alive?"</span> <span id="s167">With that, the Ukrainian realized that we have to be Jews.</span> <span id="s168">And so after he took us – he didn't say anything, but after he took us for the next interrogation they decided that we have to be killed.</span> <span id="s169">We have to be executed.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">01:17:11 So they brought us back to our room in jail.</span> <span id="s171">And the way the jail was situated was one room and then the next room were our guards.</span> <span id="s172">So if you want – had to go to the restroom, you would have to walk into their room, ask for permission and then, you know, either they would go with you because the restroom was outside the building or they would, you know, or they would keep one of us like if I wanted to go to the restroom my mother would go with me, but my sister would remain in the jail.</span> <span id="s173">Or vice versa whichever way.</span> <span id="s174">There was always one of us had to stay in that room because they were always, I guess, afraid that we'll escape.</span> <span id="s175">Well, after hearing between the other inmates that we are going to be killed my mother quickly thought of escaping.</span> <span id="s176">And so that evening that we decided to escape we watched the guard that was sitting in the room next to ours.</span> <span id="s177">He fell asleep so we couldn't out walk all of us together because we didn't want our inmates to be suspicious of us.</span> <span id="s178">So my mother and I started walking out thinking that if he wakes up and asks us where we're going, we going to the restroom and my sister remains in the room.</span> <span id="s179">But he did not wake up, and we just walked out and as we were going down the stairs and you're supposed to turn in to go to the backyard to the bathroom the front door was open.</span> <span id="s180">And so my mother said, "We go."</span> <span id="s181">Now there was somebody standing in front of that door, but as we came closer to leaving it the man just walked away and we ran away.</span> <span id="s182">Now, my mother did tell my sister where we're going to be so when she escapes the same way as we did then we will meet in the area where some of our people – not our people, our neighbors lived and we decided that's where we're going to meet.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">01:19:52 And it so happened that as my sister started walking out after we had left – my mother and I had left.</span> <span id="s184">She started walking and he woke up and he said to her, "Where are you going?"</span> <span id="s185">And she says, "I'm going to the bathroom."</span> <span id="s186">And he says, "Aw, go ahead, your mother's there with your sister."</span> <span id="s187">Except he didn't know that we're gone already.</span> <span id="s188">And so my sister escaped too.</span> <span id="s189">We did meet in the place by the neighbors.</span> <span id="s190">And they were hiding us until we decided that the best way to hide will be in our back yard where we had a barn.</span> <span id="s191">And so we told one of our neighbors that we'll be in the attic of the barn and so she would once a day bring us something to eat.</span> <span id="s192">And the barn was like two stories high.</span> <span id="s193">And we didn't know, of course, where my father was because he was going to work as an interpreter.</span> <span id="s194">We hadn't heard from him and he didn't know where we were.</span> <span id="s195">So here we were in our barn and this neighbor was nice enough to bring us food once a day.</span> <span id="s196">But obviously somebody noticed that she was carrying food to the barn, and so one day after about three or four days that we were up there sleeping in the – you know, in the barn on the what we call it – the wood and everything – we just stayed there.</span> <span id="s197">Somebody called the SS and they started following the lady.</span> <span id="s198">And she realized that, so she started screaming, "Save yourselves.</span> <span id="s199">Save yourselves."</span> <span id="s200">She never made it to the barn but she was just screaming loud enough for us to hear.</span> <span id="s201">So my mother and my sister quickly ran to the other end of the barn of the attic and with their bare hands they broke two panels of heavy wood and we jumped, we jumped.</span> <span id="s202">From the two floors we jumped down and we started running away.</span> <span id="s203">So by the time the Germans broke into the barn, we were already gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">01:22:41 Now we really hadn't no place where to go so we went back to the ghetto and in the ghetto, there was, of course, the other Jewish people and my father was there.</span> <span id="s205">So we were reunited and we were there again about – let's see, that was in '41.</span> <span id="s206">We were together until the second pogrom.</span> <span id="s207">Now when they started talking about killing us again, my mother and, of course, with my father, they decided that we have to try and escape from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s208">Now the ghetto was always surrounded.</span> <span id="s209">It was actually with wires, barbed wires.</span> <span id="s210">It was barbed wired and you had guards by the entrances.</span> <span id="s211">So my mother and my father decided that we have to escape.</span> <span id="s212">We cannot stay for the second pogrom which was a few months later.</span> <span id="s213">So we could not escape together.</span> <span id="s214">We had to separate.</span> <span id="s215">So my mother took me.</span> <span id="s216">We were first to escape at night.</span> <span id="s217">We just climbed out between the barbed wire and we went to one of our neighbors – not neighbors, to some friends that we had, Gentiles, which were very nice.</span> <span id="s218">Thanks to them, I guess, we're still alive.</span> <span id="s219">And then next – like an hour later, my sister and then we were reunited, my sister and my mother and myself.</span> <span id="s220">We waited for my father and he never showed.</span> <span id="s221">We didn't know what happened to him, and we couldn't go back to the ghetto either because the following day there was another pogrom.</span> <span id="s222">So after that we were always hopeful that we will find our father.</span> <span id="s223">In the meantime, we had to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">01:24:59 We had to run away from the city because the second pogrom was already meant to clean out the city – to clean the city out of Jews.</span> <span id="s225">So my mother knew someone.</span> <span id="s226">Of course, my mother – my father also knew this gentlemen who was a motorman on one of the trains.</span> <span id="s227">And she paid him off, he should smuggle her and my sister out of the city.</span> <span id="s228">Now, like I said before, we didn't know where my father was.</span> <span id="s229">Now she could not take me along because “A” I was too little and it was very, very cold.</span> <span id="s230">It was in the wintertime.</span> <span id="s231">And it was very cold and the clothes that we had really wasn't warm enough.</span> <span id="s232">So she made arrangements with a Gentile lady that she should hold, you know, keep me in her house until the spring.</span> <span id="s233">And then in the springtime this gentlemen who smuggled my sister and my mother out of – to Romania that he will come and he will take me, too, and bring me to my mother.</span> <span id="s234">The lady agreed, and my mother gave her whatever we had, you know, just to make sure that I'm safe.</span> <span id="s235">She lived – she had two of her grandchildren living with her.</span> <span id="s236">They did not know that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s237">And I don't look Jewish either.</span> <span id="s238">And so she kept me in back of her house.</span> <span id="s239">She had like a little room, a pantry and that – this is where I used to stay and I used to sleep.</span> <span id="s240">In fact that pantry was so infested with, with mice that at night, I used to cover myself with a, with a blanket that she gave me and feel those mice crawling all over me.</span> <span id="s241">My mother had left before.</span> <span id="s242">But before she left she told me that she has to go away with my sister and she gave me a hundred rubles and she told me that in the springtime this gentlemen whom I knew will come and he'll bring me back to my mother.</span> <span id="s243">That it's only going to be a little while and I'm safer staying with this lady and her grandchildren here.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">01:27:42 My mother left, but before she did I cried.</span> <span id="s245">And I said, "I have a headache.</span> <span id="s246">Don't leave me."</span> <span id="s247">But she said she has to go.</span> <span id="s248">I guess I understood.</span> <span id="s249">And so she gave me the hundred rubles and I remained in the lady's house.</span> <span id="s250">With her grandchildren, I used to play.</span> <span id="s251">After two weeks the lady became a little panicky and she was really afraid to keep a Jewish child in the house because the Germans notify everyone that if a Jew is found in their house that their house will be burned and the family will be killed.</span> <span id="s252">You know, the whole thing.</span> <span id="s253">So she was really afraid.</span> <span id="s254">And so she told me I had to leave her house two weeks later.</span> <span id="s255">Well, at that time I was infested already with lice because nobody gave me a bath and I slept in the same clothes and I lived in the same clothes and I lived in that pantry with the mice.</span> <span id="s256">And so I walked out of the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">01:29:04 And the first thing I did was go into a – to a store – a religious article store and I bought a big cross and I spend my hundred rubles.</span> <span id="s258">And then I was so infested with the lice that my head, my skin was all rashes and bloody from scratching it so much.</span> <span id="s259">And so I felt that I really needed help and I remembered this lady whom my parents were friendly with and I remembered that we used to visit them every so often.</span> <span id="s260">That it's quite a bit outside the city.</span> <span id="s261">I didn't remember the address and I didn't remember the name.</span> <span id="s262">But I just remember how we used to walk.</span> <span id="s263">And I – that's how I walked.</span> <span id="s264">And I made it to the house.</span> <span id="s265">And it was winter and cold and the snow was snow maybe five, six inches of snow.</span> <span id="s266">And I made it to her house and as I got to her gate her dog started barking so she came out to see who was at the gate and she sees me and she says, "My God, Come in quick.</span> <span id="s267">Come in quick."</span> <span id="s268">And she takes me to her barn because obviously she must have noticed that I have lice crawling all over me.</span> <span id="s269">So she wouldn't take me into her house but she took me into the barn and she – quickly she took off my clothes and put on other clothes and she said to me, "Where are your parents?"</span> <span id="s270">I said, "Everybody is killed.</span> <span id="s271">Everybody is dead."</span> <span id="s272">Because I wanted her to have pity on me.</span> <span id="s273">And so she did.</span> <span id="s274">She took me to her bathroom.</span> <span id="s275">She shaved off my head.</span> <span id="s276">She gave me a bath.</span> <span id="s277">She gave me a glass of hot milk and a piece of black bread.</span> <span id="s278">And I ate it so fast that I got so sick that she thought I was dying.</span> <span id="s279">And she couldn't call a doctor and she had to pull all her shades down.</span> <span id="s280">Nobody should see that she has any strangers in her house.</span> <span id="s281">And she had a son who was at school and she didn't want the son to know either because the son did know me and he knew that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s282">So she gave me a bath and, and she put on one her – of her white gowns on me and it really felt good because I felt clean.</span> <span id="s283">And she put some Vaseline on my head and she kept me in her bedroom for a week, a whole week.</span> <span id="s284">Now her son didn't know that until one day about three, four days later he said, "Why is your bedroom door locked and the shades are down?"</span> <span id="s285">And so she felt that she had to tell him, otherwise he might, you know, he might talk about it on the outside and then they'll send the SS and this is what's going to happen to them.</span> <span id="s286">So one evening she sort of surprised him.</span> <span id="s287">She said to me, "Come in, I want you to see my son and I want him to see you."</span> <span id="s288">And when I walked in, he almost died because I was wearing her white gown and my head was shaven.</span> <span id="s289">And he just became so wild, but she said to him, "Don't you ever tell anyone that you’ve seen Frima."</span> <span id="s290">And he said, "I promise, I never will."</span> <span id="s291">And so I stayed with her for another week.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">01:33:24 In the meantime, like I told you when she gave me that milk and the bread and I got so sick, she didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s293">So her husband and the lady whom I'm very grateful to, she was giving me enemas because I was already blue in my face.</span> <span id="s294">I couldn't talk and I was stopping – I was slowing down with my breathing.</span> <span id="s295">That's how sick I got.</span> <span id="s296">Well, after the war she told my mother that as she was trying to save my life she said, "At the same time I was thinking where am I going to bury your child.</span> <span id="s297">I mean nobody supposed to know that there's a Jewish kid in my house."</span> <span id="s298">But anyway, I guess, God was very good to her and was good to me.</span> <span id="s299">After a few enemas, I'm finally – I woke up and I was stronger and I was able to talk.</span> <span id="s300">And after staying a week with her, she said, you know, she can't keep me any longer because she was also afraid that people might become suspicious – her neighbors.</span> <span id="s301">And so here I am without a place to stay, without a home to go to.</span> <span id="s302">And I knew I couldn't go back to that lady who told me to leave the first place.</span> <span id="s303">So I decided that since she had under her house, she had a little – like a little opening with a door, where her dog used to sleep that that's where I'm going to sleep too together with her dog, without her knowing it.</span> <span id="s304">And so what I used to do is walk around during the day.</span> <span id="s305">Just walk during the day and go to some of the people that I knew and they would give me a piece of bread or give me a potato and I would continue walking and walking and walking.</span> <span id="s306">And then at night when it was already dark in the lady's house and it was quiet, I would sneak in.</span> <span id="s307">And the dog knew me and he loved me and he didn't even bark.</span> <span id="s308">So he used to lie on my legs, keep me warm, and that's how I slept through the night until also very, very early in the morning, I used to get up and pray to God, of course, and put on my kerchief and start walk out from the – from the – under the house and just walk the streets again.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">01:36:16 And one day as I was walking through the same streets that I walked before I heard a couple of young boys saying, "Gee, she might be a Jew because I've seen her walking here once before."</span> <span id="s310">Well after I heard this, I never walked in that area again.</span> <span id="s311">I just continued walking to different places and different places.</span> <span id="s312">And one day I decided to go back in the area where we lived.</span> <span id="s313">And we had a cat.</span> <span id="s314">It was a Persian cat, beautiful gray, dark gray cat.</span> <span id="s315">And I wasn't even near the house, and the cat recognized me and he started following me.</span> <span id="s316">Now the Nazis didn't like cats.</span> <span id="s317">And as I was walking and the cat was walking after me meowing and meowing, I couldn't pick him up because they knew that most of the Jewish people had cats.</span> <span id="s318">And so I wouldn't pick up my cat.</span> <span id="s319">And I just kept walking and he followed me until I was passing the building from the kindergarten.</span> <span id="s320">And there were two guards sitting outside and they saw my cat following me and they killed him.</span> <span id="s321">They killed my beautiful cat.</span> <span id="s322">And I just kept walking as if I didn't know anything and as if I – the cat did not belong to me.</span> <span id="s323">And so I continued walking for about six months.</span> <span id="s324">And that was my daily life, sleeping with the dog, walking during the day.</span> <span id="s325">And one day when I came back to sleep with the dog, I saw a light on in the lady's house and so I imagined they might be awake and therefore I should not go in, you know, go under the house.</span> <span id="s326">So next to her there was a bombarded house.</span> <span id="s327">There was only four walls.</span> <span id="s328">Nothing in it.</span> <span id="s329">Full of rubbles and wood and stones and everything.</span> <span id="s330">That's where I lay down, between the rubbles and I – in order to keep warm because it was winter I would blow in my breathing the hot air into my jacket – in that little jacket.</span> <span id="s331">I wore a little jacket, a little skirt, and I had somebody's stockings and that's how I stayed through the night there.</span> <span id="s332">And, of course, the next morning I did the same thing.</span> <span id="s333">I walked out.</span> <span id="s334">And I walked again.</span> <span id="s335">Then the way that my mother told me that sometimes in the springtime that this gentlemen will come and pick me up and bring me to her, so I knew that when he'll come and ask the lady for me, she'll tell him she doesn't know where I am because she did not know where I am.</span> <span id="s336">She did not know that I was sleeping under her house with her dog.</span> <span id="s337">So when April came around, I would just circle the area in the neighborhood so when I see him I would, you know, get in touch with him and he'll be able to take me to my mother.</span> <span id="s338">And that's exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s339">He came once and she said she doesn't know where I was, but then somehow he decided to come again because my mother told him that this is where I'm going to be, that she is going to keep me until he will, you know, he will come to pick me up.</span> <span id="s340">And so one day as soon as I was in that area, I saw him and that's how we met.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">01:40:39 Now he made arrangements and late at night the following day he took me to a train station and he hid me in one of those cars full of coils.</span> <span id="s342">And then in the middle of the night, he transferred me to a different train and he just told me to lie on one of the cars, which were transported.</span> <span id="s343">There were German jeeps transported to Romania.</span> <span id="s344">I met another girl.</span> <span id="s345">She was about 10 years my senior and he was smuggling her also.</span> <span id="s346">So the two of us were lying on this open car full of jeeps and without knowing that in one of the Jeeps there was a German sitting.</span> <span id="s347">He was the watchman.</span> <span id="s348">And, of course, the gentlemen didn't know either that, you know, the, the car that we were on that there was danger.</span> <span id="s349">And so we're traveling through the night towards Romania.</span> <span id="s350">Now Romania, although it was occupied by the Germans, they had some kind of agreement that the Jews will not be killed.</span> <span id="s351">They will live in the ghettos and work, but they will not be killed unless they're on the outside of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s352">Alright?</span> <span id="s353">So it was sort of a little safer for the Jewish people to, to be.</span> <span id="s354">We traveled through the night and then at dawn, I hear a door open.</span> <span id="s355">And the two of us are lying there.</span> <span id="s356">Now she had a Jewish accent.</span> <span id="s357">So although I was a little younger, I told her not to speak.</span> <span id="s358">She has to be quiet and they really wouldn't know anything.</span> <span id="s359">And we'll just make believe we're sleeping.</span> <span id="s360">And we hear, you know, the Germans with those boots, those high boots, just stamping.</span> <span id="s361">He was – came over to us and we just made believe that we don't, we don't know anything.</span> <span id="s362">But we were sleeping.</span> <span id="s363">But, of course, he kicks me in my back and I made believe I just woke up and he kicks her and he starts yelling in German and I do not speak German.</span> <span id="s364">But since I spoke Yiddish I could understand a little bit, but, of course, I wasn't going to speak to him in Yiddish so I just kept saying to him in Russian that we, we lost my – we lost our mother, and we're looking for my mother and whatever.</span> <span id="s365">Anyway, he was furious.</span> <span id="s366">He kept yelling in German, and I kept talking to him in Russian and crying, you know, "My mother.</span> <span id="s367">My mother.</span> <span id="s368">My mother."</span> <span id="s369">Well that was early in the morning and then about an hour later or so we were coming closer to the town to the city where we were supposed to get off.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">01:43:54 Well, he was so furious.</span> <span id="s371">The train stopped and he made us walk down from the train into the fields.</span> <span id="s372">So although I was begging and I was crying and both of us were crying, he wouldn't hear of it.</span> <span id="s373">He just told us to get off and he kicked us off, and there we are.</span> <span id="s374">And we're standing there and crying and crying and I kept on begging him and begging him and finally I changed his mind.</span> <span id="s375">He told us to come up again.</span> <span id="s376">And so it didn't take too long.</span> <span id="s377">After that we arrived at our destination, and my mother wasn't there.</span> <span id="s378">Nobody was there.</span> <span id="s379">But some people with whom my mother was were there, and this gentlemen who was smuggling us, he brought us to the house where he was supposed to meet my mother so she can pay him.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Except the head of the ghetto threw my mother out and my sister because he knew that my mother had some gold pieces which she had saved to pay the gentlemen who smuggled me.</span> <span id="s381">And the head of the ghetto wanted that money, of course, for the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s382">So he threw them out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s383">And so when I came there my mother wasn't there any longer.</span> <span id="s384">My sister wasn't there.</span> <span id="s385">And the people told me, you know, that my mother went to another ghetto which was a couple of hours from that area.</span> <span id="s386">So they took me to the head of the ghetto and he was Jewish and his wife – they had no children and I was crying and asking him, "Where's my mother.</span> <span id="s387">I want to be with my mother.</span> <span id="s388">Take me to my mother."</span> <span id="s389">And he said – and he was trying to convince me that my life will be so much better if I stayed with them and I won't be missing anything and I'll have dolls and I'll have toys and I'll have everything.</span> <span id="s390">And I kept saying, "I want my mother.</span> <span id="s391">I want my mother.</span> <span id="s392">Please get me back to my mother."</span> <span id="s393">So finally he said, "Okay."</span></p> <p><span id="s394">01:46:18 And they – there was what do you call it?</span> <span id="s395">Horse and buggy going every – once a day to different little towns where, you know, some of the people lived there.</span> <span id="s396">So he got me on one of those little, little coaches with a horse.</span> <span id="s397">There were few men, and I was the only child with them.</span> <span id="s398">And as we were traveling through the fields, there were always, always like groups of – I don't know if you call them bandits or whatever.</span> <span id="s399">They were always used to look for Jewish people and beat them up and take everything away from them cause that's – I guess, that's how they made a living.</span> <span id="s400">I don't really know.</span> <span id="s401">Well, they stopped our carriage and they started taking all the men off, because they knew we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s402">When I saw this, I jumped off the carriage and I kept running, running toward the fields.</span> <span id="s403">Now this was springtime.</span> <span id="s404">And at that time the harvest, they build those what do you call them?</span> <span id="s405">You know, they bunched up the harvest so there was a little – like little tents and I hid in one of those, and I was sitting there and thinking, "Where do I go from here?"</span> <span id="s406">And I was praying and then hours – a couple of hours later I heard horses coming in my direction.</span> <span id="s407">And I was sure that they were looking for me, and that they were going to get me.</span> <span id="s408">So I decided before I run to different haystacks – exactly haystacks – I should look out and see, you know, what is happening.</span> <span id="s409">Well, when I looked out I saw the carriage, the wagon with the horse, and the men on it.</span> <span id="s410">And so I ran towards the wagon, and they were, of course, very happy to see me and they kept saying how those bandits were looking for me because they noticed a little girl and I had escaped.</span> <span id="s411">So they were very angry because those men were beaten.</span> <span id="s412">Everything was taken away from them.</span> <span id="s413">And they were all injured, all beaten, but anyway they took me up and they hugged me and they kissed me.</span> <span id="s414">And we finally made it to a little town where my mother was – were assembled a couple hundred of Jewish people there.</span> <span id="s415">And that was before Passover.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">01:49:32 And when the word passed around that a wagon came with some men and a little girl, my mother and my sister knew that it had to be me so, of course, they ran out to greet me.</span> <span id="s417">And that little town, they was – it was so little that actually the Germans knew where the Jews lived so they didn't have to surround it or, you know, put up barbed wire or anything like that.</span> <span id="s418">We lived in one room with this Gentile man.</span> <span id="s419">We had one cot and all three of us slept on it.</span> <span id="s420">And there was – then there was another mother and a daughter that slept on another cot.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">We worked in his fields to pay him for sort of rent so my mother and my sister worked on the field and I worked on the field.</span> <span id="s422">My job was digging out potatoes and carrying them to his warehouse, and for this I would get a loaf of bread a day.</span> <span id="s423">That was very good.</span> <span id="s424">We are very lucky.</span> <span id="s425">We remained living there for about a year, at least a year – I'd say ’40 – ’42 – for about a year.</span> <span id="s426">And we kept working and then the day before we were liberated, the Germans had dug another grave, a mass grave to kill all of us, like the Final Solution.</span> <span id="s427">And the day before their plan, the Russians were bombarding the city – the little town and there was street fighting going on and we were saved except for those Jewish people who either got killed because their homes were, you know, where they stayed.</span> <span id="s428">It wasn't their homes, but wherever they lived, either the house was bombarded or because of the street fighting or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Well, we were lucky to survive.</span> <span id="s430">And we went back to look for our father.</span> <span id="s431">And all we, the news we had is that he was seen with two Gestapos walking the street, down the street and we never heard from him.</span> <span id="s432">And we didn't know that you know, all my aunts and uncles and grandparents and cousins, they're all killed.</span> <span id="s433">And we started to build up a new life.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">01:52:53 My mother was the widow who tried to put our lives together.</span> <span id="s435">And so she was selling and buying and selling and trying to make a go of it.</span> <span id="s436">The shoes that I was wearing – we couldn't afford to buy anything, so I would go between the destroyed buildings and rubbles and pick up rope and with a crochet needle I would crochet slippers and then put a piece of cardboard.</span> <span id="s437">And these were the shoes I wore.</span> <span id="s438">And, God, that's how we lived until we decided that everyone else is dead, no one is left, that we have to start a new life, and just leave Europe.</span> <span id="s439">And so we joined other Jewish people who hoped that we can escape to Germany.</span> <span id="s440">That was the end of the war.</span> <span id="s441">We can go to Germany, and from Germany perhaps we can go to different countries.</span> <span id="s442">And so we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s444">This is a good time for us to break.</span> <span id="s445">We're getting ready to change the tape now.</span> <span id="s446">01:59:56 End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s448">02:00:05</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Okay, we're rolling.</span> <span id="s450">Why don't you tell me about leaving your father at the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: When my mother and father decided that we should escape before the second pogrom, I did not want to leave.</span> <span id="s452">I wanted to stay with my father or whenever he'll escape I'll go with him.</span> <span id="s453">And so I was crying and I said, "Papa, I don't want to go without you."</span> <span id="s454">But he insisted.</span> <span id="s455">He said, "You must go.</span> <span id="s456">You go with Mama."</span> <span id="s457">He says, "I'll follow you.</span> <span id="s458">Don't worry.</span> <span id="s459">I'll follow you."</span> <span id="s460">"I swear," he said, "We'll meet again."</span> <span id="s461">And so I listened to what he had to say and I believed him.</span> <span id="s462">And so I, I went with my mother and we escaped.</span> <span id="s463">We made it out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s464">And my father was, was left behind and we just don't know what happened to him except for the fact that people said they saw him walking down the street with the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s465">So, so we never heard from him and nobody ever saw him alive.</span> <span id="s466">That was the end of my father's life.</span> <span id="s467">And that was bad.</span> <span id="s468">Anyway, we have to get back to where we left off.</span> <span id="s469">I wanted – when my mother came to pick me up when I arrived in the little town, they were all preparing – baking Matzos for Passover at that time.</span> <span id="s470">And my sister went and, you know, took me from that wagon and walked me to the house where my mother was with the other people baking the Matzos, and my mother, of course, took me in her arms, put me on her lap, and started looking on me, checking me out, if I was okay.</span> <span id="s471">And suddenly she sees a big cross and she says to me, "My child, mayn kind.What is that?"</span> <span id="s472">And I says, "Mama, I wanted to live so I can tell you what I went through and I wanted to make sure that nobody is suspicious of me, so I had to buy the cross and make believe that I'm Christian.</span> <span id="s473">She took it off and she gave it to one of the priest in that town where we lived and that was the same cross that I used to take off at night when I went to sleep or when I prayed to God and then put it on in the morning.</span> <span id="s474">It was really big.</span> <span id="s475">It was a very big cross.</span> <span id="s476">And then walk around the streets so everyone can see that I have it so nobody would be suspicious of me or have any doubts that I'm anything else but a non-Jew.</span> <span id="s477">And this was my life for about six months until the day that I came to see my mother and my fa– and my sister.</span> <span id="s478">And after the liberation – after we were liberated, we went back and–</span></p> <p><span id="s479">02:04:20</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: How did you get from Romania back to the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: Again, we were going from town to town, from city to city, with wagons, with trains, with whatever was available and we just made it back.</span> <span id="s482">But we were very lucky that the day before the execution of all the few Jews that lived in that town, that we were liberated.</span> <span id="s483">And it was a terrible experience seeing the fighting in the streets and the wounded soldiers.</span> <span id="s484">We used to pull them into the houses and, you know, wash them and then change their socks and then and bandage their, their wounds.</span> <span id="s485">And these were the ones who, who, thanks to them, we 1 My child (Yiddish) survived.</span> <span id="s486">And then when we got home, most of our home – house was destroyed, so my mother worked very, very hard selling, dealing, making dollars, and with her own hands, she put together the home again.</span> <span id="s487">You know, like she painted it and she plastered it and she did everything.</span> <span id="s488">And then we decided that we have to leave, that we weren't safe any longer.</span> <span id="s489">So through different, you know, different papers and different channels, my mother got us out of Russia to Poland.</span> <span id="s490">And then from Poland we took a train.</span> <span id="s491">We took a train to Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s492">Yeah, Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s493">And we traveled for a few days.</span> <span id="s494">There were other – yeah, some Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">And we made it there.</span> <span id="s496">And then we were supposed to be smuggled from that area from Poland towards Germany in a truck.</span> <span id="s497">So, gosh, that truck was full of people.</span> <span id="s498">So many!</span> <span id="s499">Some was sitting.</span> <span id="s500">Some were lying on the floor.</span> <span id="s501">When we got to the border and the guards wanted to inspect the truck to see, you know, what was in the truck.</span> <span id="s502">Of course, certainly, they did not think of people, the driver – he stopped and as the guards were coming to open up and see what was doing, he took off.</span> <span id="s503">And they started, of course, shooting, but he kept going zigzag, so he was not hit, and we, we made it to Germany.</span> <span id="s504">And then there, of course, they had already the displaced person camps and they gave us a place.</span> <span id="s505">We stood in Berlin for a little while, and then from Berlin they would send people to different cities.</span> <span id="s506">So we stayed for maybe a couple of weeks in Berlin cause during that period I got sick there also.</span> <span id="s507">That's a different story.</span> <span id="s508">And when I got better they sent us to Bavaria, which had the DP camps, displaced person camps.</span> <span id="s509">And there, there we lived, you know, in one room, but we were liberated and we just went on with our lives.</span> <span id="s510">There were schools set up, and I went to the school where I learned Hebrew.</span> <span id="s511">And the rest of the family, everyone was working and making a couple of dollars.</span> <span id="s512">And then, this is a long story short, but I said I'm making a long story short and then we went to – from Germany.</span> <span id="s513">We stayed in Germany for about two and a half years.</span> <span id="s514">Then we went to France.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">02:09:23</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: How did you get from Germany to France?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: We went by train.</span> <span id="s518">We took a train in Munich, and we went to France, to Paris.</span> <span id="s519">We stayed in Paris for about six months.</span> <span id="s520">During that period I used to we weren't working, so during that period, I used to go collect food and clothing for the Moroccan Jews who were very poor and they lived in Paris in a very isolated area.</span> <span id="s521">And every week I used to bring clothing and food.</span> <span id="s522">And since I was young and I was able to get around Paris and whoever needed anything or a place, you know, to go someplace and didn't know, I would, you know, I would sort of take them around.</span> <span id="s523">I was their guide.</span> <span id="s524">And then while there, they were talking about another war.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">That was really frightening to us.</span> <span id="s526">So, we decided that instead of coming to the United States where we had to wait for a visa and it was a waiting period and we were so scared that we decided to go to Cuba.</span> <span id="s527">And there I had an aunt.</span> <span id="s528">She quickly made out the papers for us – the necessary papers and did whatever was necessary and we went there.</span> <span id="s529">And lived there until I decided to come to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">02:11:14</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: How long was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: That's nine years later.</span> <span id="s533">And I came to the United States and, of course, always thinking about the past and always worry about the future.</span> <span id="s534">Never really feeling liberated, although alive, but never really liberated.</span> <span id="s535">And then, of course, met my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: It was a blind date.</span> <span id="s538">I was going to Teacher’s Institute for Women.</span> <span id="s539">And I met a young lady there and we became good friends.</span> <span id="s540">And she said to me she wanted me to meet a nice Jewish fellow.</span> <span id="s541">And that's how we met.</span> <span id="s542">We got married.</span> <span id="s543">And we have three lovely children.</span> <span id="s544">And we do think about the past.</span> <span id="s545">We do think about the horrors.</span> <span id="s546">My husband was in China during World War II, and he was – they were starving.</span> <span id="s547">They did not have ghettos or sort of, you know, like we did.</span> <span id="s548">They did not have pogroms.</span> <span id="s549">They had a ghetto, but they did not have pogroms.</span> <span id="s550">But they were starving.</span> <span id="s551">There was no food.</span> <span id="s552">And we had the pogroms and we had starvation.</span> <span id="s553">We had everything.</span> <span id="s554">It was a lot of atrocities going on.</span> <span id="s555">Horrible experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Always frightened, always feeling you're being followed.</span> <span id="s557">In fact the nights when I used to walk the streets and I used to hear the German shepherds bark, to this date I dislike these dogs.</span> <span id="s558">I really do.</span> <span id="s559">And I always used to feel that any minute, you know, they will attack or something, attack me although it was at night and I used to walk like you against, against building between, between trees nobody should see me, nobody should hear me.</span> <span id="s560">And everything brings memories.</span> <span id="s561">When it drizzles and it's cloudy, it brings memories of the day when they took us to be killed, the first pogrom.</span> <span id="s562">When I hear a German shepherd, it brings memories.</span> <span id="s563">When I walk the streets, everything seems to bring memories.</span> <span id="s564">It's quite frightening.</span> <span id="s565">Let's see.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">02:14:26</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: How else did the war affect your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Everything that I look at brings memories.</span> <span id="s569">Everything that I do brings memories.</span> <span id="s570">For many years I had nightmares.</span> <span id="s571">I used to wake up screaming and screaming.</span> <span id="s572">For a while, I used to dream about my father.</span> <span id="s573">Just everything.</span> <span id="s574">If I pass a barn, it brings memories of the escape, of when we jumped out of the barn and we ran to hide.</span> <span id="s575">It just – there isn't a thing that doesn't….</span> <span id="s576">When I see barbed wire, it's memories of how, how really we lived in that enclosed area not being allowed to walk, and when I walked in the streets within that area I had, you know, I had the stars, the yellow stars, the Star of David, one in the back and one up front.</span> <span id="s577">And it didn't matter how old you were or how young you were, you still had to wear them.</span> <span id="s578">Even in pictures, when I see a German uniform brings memories of how they beat us.</span> <span id="s579">I mean I was lucky, but in front of me, grown-ups if they didn't move fast enough, they were beaten with sticks and they were hit with guns.</span> <span id="s580">Such horrors.</span> <span id="s581">Just horrible things.</span> <span id="s582">And just as they affect an older person, it certainly affects a child.</span> <span id="s583">It's just that we grow up a little stronger perhaps than the elderly people do.</span> <span id="s584">And my mother suffered with that ear that, that she was hit.</span> <span id="s585">She suffered for until the day she died she wasn't able to hear too well.</span> <span id="s586">And it was also memories, awful memories.</span> <span id="s587">And more memories when there's – when you lose your father.</span> <span id="s588">You lost so many dear ones.</span> <span id="s589">Part of your life you lost.</span> <span id="s590">It was just a lot of anger.</span> <span id="s591">Anger to the world for doing such things, and not to feel when all of us had to stand naked – such inhumanity.</span> <span id="s592">We were just made to feel like animals.</span> <span id="s593">And the beatings that one constantly had to go through there, all the people.</span> <span id="s594">Then I was, I was from the lucky ones yet.</span> <span id="s595">Well, now when we look back we hope that the past is remembered so the future will be much better future for every human being.</span> <span id="s596">Really for every human being cause I don't think that the world could possibly survive with such horrors like we did in the ‘30s and ‘40s.</span> <span id="s597">And we hope there's gonna be a better tomorrow, which I always prayed every day while alone until I came together – reunited with my mother and my sister.</span> <span id="s598">And then when we finally made it to the United States of America, I still don't feel free.</span> <span id="s599">I don't think that a survivor will ever feel free.</span> <span id="s600">It's something that was done to his life, to his way of feeling, thinking.</span> <span id="s601">Something that nobody can understand, only the survivor himself somehow will have to sort of adjust himself to the world and do his part as a human being.</span> <span id="s602">Oh, gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">02:19:49</span></p> <p><span id="s604">[Displaying photograph]</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: This was home.</span> <span id="s606">This was in ’45.</span> <span id="s607">That is me, in 1945, at home after I had gained a little weight.</span> <span id="s608">My mother was able to get me a sweater and a little hat.</span> <span id="s609">It felt good.</span> <span id="s610">So she called a photographer.</span> <span id="s611">She said, “You look so great, I must take a picture.”</span> <span id="s612">And this picture was taken in the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">[Displaying photograph]</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: That’s me in the DP camp.</span> <span id="s615">The camp was called the Schlupfing in Bavaria.</span> <span id="s616">That was in 1947.</span> <span id="s617">These are the barracks that we lived in.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">02:21:10</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: Tell us where you were.</span> <span id="s620">At what point did this occur?</span> <span id="s621">Okay.</span> <span id="s622">Please tell us your story.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Well, during the period when I was walking the street, there were days that I couldn't get any food cause I was afraid to go in certain areas in case somebody will see me.</span> <span id="s624">So I was walking on the streets and I saw this restaurant with a big glass window.</span> <span id="s625">I looked it.</span> <span id="s626">There were a lot of people sitting there and eating and I was standing – I was so hungry and there was one empty seat next to a gentleman so I figured may as well go in and perhaps somebody will feel sorry for me and pay for, for my soup.</span> <span id="s627">So I walked in.</span> <span id="s628">I sat next to this gentleman and I ordered the potato soup.</span> <span id="s629">And as I finished eating it and the waitress came to ask me for the money to pay, I started crying and I told her I had lost my money.</span> <span id="s630">So the gentleman next to me, I guess, felt sorry and he said to me, "Don't cry, little girl," and he paid for my soup.</span> <span id="s631">And I just ran out very quickly.</span> <span id="s632">I didn't say a word, I just thanked him.</span> <span id="s633">I ran out and continued walking and walking and walking until the night came and I went back to my little dog under the house to sleep.</span> <span id="s634">As far as how people, people that wanted to help us out and they wanted to offer us food some of them would offer what they had and that was pork and other meats, but coming from a background like we did, we refused the type of food that they offered us since it's not kosher.</span> <span id="s635">So we always kept in mind who we were.</span> <span id="s636">We could not show it.</span> <span id="s637">We could not tell anyone about it.</span> <span id="s638">But we felt this is what we are and no matter what happens we have to remain with our way of being who we are.</span> <span id="s639">We are Jewish.</span> <span id="s640">There was no two ways about it.</span> <span id="s641">And so every night when I used to go to sleep with my dog, I would take my cross off and pray to God, and then in the morning before I put the cross on, I would pray to God again.</span> <span id="s642">Put it on.</span> <span id="s643">Shake off the straw because when I got up from the straw and with my dog, I started walking again.</span> <span id="s644">And that was the story for six months until the gentleman came and smuggled us to my mother.</span> <span id="s645">This is just some of the stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s647">Thank you.</span> <span id="s648">02:24:47</span></p> <p><span id="s649">[Conclusion of
