<span id="s13">This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Answer: Paul Wolff.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Conducted by Alda Velatis (ph) on the 16th of October 2010 at the Kindertransport Association Conference in Arlington, VirginiA: Let's begin.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: I'd like to first start off by asking you to state, again, your full name, if it's different now than your name of birth, date of birth, parents' names, siblings, family, place, all of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: All?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s20">My name is Paul Mark John Wolff.</span> <span id="s21">For some strange reason or other my parents gave me the name of three saints.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: I have no idea why that is.</span> <span id="s24">I was born Hamburg, Germany on the 27th of December 1929.</span> <span id="s25">My father and mother are deceased.</span> <span id="s26">My father was Carl Wolff or referred to in this country as Charles Wolff.</span> <span id="s27">My mother was Erica Wolff, born Abeles.</span> <span id="s28">The maiden name was A b e l e s, Abeles.</span> <span id="s29">My -- I have two -- two sisters; Susan Barbara Wolff living today still in New York, and Eva Berta Wolff who died of -- of multiple sclerosis in San Francisco many years ago.</span> <span id="s30">My sister in New York's name is Fogelstein, by the way.</span> <span id="s31">It's not Wolff anymore.</span> <span id="s32">She's married to Henry Fogelstein.</span> <span id="s33">My sister in San Francisco was Hertzfeld.</span> <span id="s34">Both married, incidentally.</span> <span id="s35">We were just talking about that in the conference.</span> <span id="s36">Somehow there is a connection of survivors.</span> <span id="s37">They both married survivors.</span> <span id="s38">What else can I tell you?</span> <span id="s39">My children, do you want that too?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: That be great.</span> <span id="s41">Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s43">I have three children, all of which are, I think, are registered as K2s.</span> <span id="s44">Karen Wolff Kirschenbaum in New York, the oldest; Linda Wolff Dorjee, married a fellow from Boughton and therefore the name Dorjee; and my son, Charles Wolff, in Berkley -- in Berkley.</span> <span id="s45">I was going to -- oh, interesting aside.</span> <span id="s46">Interesting aside that all three just recently in the last couple months became German citizens.</span> <span id="s47">Germany has offered Holocaust -- children of Holocaust survivors citizenship if they want.</span> <span id="s48">Sort of -- it was very weird for me to have them become German citizens, but they did it for specific reasons.</span> <span id="s49">They thought if -- if education gets too expensive in this country -- they all have country -- that they want to be members of the European union in order to be able to attend any university within Europe --</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Great ideA:</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: -- which is -- you know, they have no intention of going to Germany but this is an open door to the EU --</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: -- which makes sense, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Wonderful.</span> <span id="s55">That's a really good ideA: Great.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Let's talk, if you will, about your earliest memories in Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s59">I lived in Hamburg for the first nine years of my life.</span> <span id="s60">I clearly remember a few things about school.</span> <span id="s61">I can remember being stoned, finally, on the way home from school one day by children that I played with just the previous week.</span> <span id="s62">They were, obviously, put up to this by their parents, but that was sort of our -- my message to me and to my sisters to not return to school.</span> <span id="s63">So that was my end of my schooling in Germany.</span> <span id="s64">I was nine years old.</span> <span id="s65">I was, I remember, being angry at my father for not allowing me to join the Hitler youth, which you got to go on outings, camping trips, and hikes and like the Boy Scouts.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: But of course as a Jew they wouldn't have taken me anyway.</span> <span id="s68">But I really didn't understand too much of that at that time.</span> <span id="s69">It didn't become really obvious to me as a nine year old until Kristanant (ph) when I can clearly remember them, the Gestapo, knocking at the gates of our house in Hamburg to arrest my father as it was common on the night of November 9th, 1938 to arrest all male Jews above 13 or 14 years old.</span> <span id="s70">I was too young, but they were after my father.</span> <span id="s71">My father knew he would be arrested, but wanted to go together with his brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s72">So he went over to his brother-in-law's house and thought they would be arrested together.</span> <span id="s73">My mother greeted them at the door as they came in, in her housecoat.</span> <span id="s74">It was about Midnight, full of -- the housecoat, I remember, was full of my -- the metals that my father had earned fighting for the Germans in the first world war.</span> <span id="s75">He was a much decorated major in the artillery, in the mounted artillery, actually, and was heavily wounded.</span> <span id="s76">And she thought somehow that that would exclude him from being arrested, but of course it didn't.</span> <span id="s77">They didn't really -- weren't interested in the metals.</span> <span id="s78">And they wanted to know where he was and they went and got him.</span> <span id="s79">Luckily enough, he was released about a week later, because one of the arresting officers actually had fought under him in the first world war and knew him personally from that.</span> <span id="s80">And many people were kept for months some were never released.</span> <span id="s81">But that finally opened his eyes that, gee, maybe we should really do something, try to get out of here.</span> <span id="s82">He has two brothers, incidentally, who are married and had families.</span> <span id="s83">One went three years earlier to France and one went two years earlier to London.</span> <span id="s84">But my father -- I discussed this with him many times -- thought like so many German Jews that this guy -- this upstar Hitler would blow over.</span> <span id="s85">It's a passing thing.</span> <span id="s86">We've just got to tough it out.</span> <span id="s87">Things will get back to normal again.</span> <span id="s88">And a lot of -- a lot of Jews, German Jews, felt almost more German than Jewish in that respect.</span> <span id="s89">You've probably heard that before.</span> <span id="s90">So he made -- he made moves to -- after Gustalac -- opened his eyes and he made moves to try to get out.</span> <span id="s91">We had a very distant uncle in New York.</span> <span id="s92">You had to have -- America had no Open Door Policy and you had to have somebody vouch for you over here that you would not become a burden to the States or -- to the state or go on the welfare rolls.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: So we finally did get an exit visa to England.</span> <span id="s95">And we -- and on April 20th -- I remember April 20th, 1939, happened to be a -- that's the date of Hitler's birthday.</span> <span id="s96">We left for England.</span> <span id="s97">Stayed two months -- two months in England waiting for some kind of transportation to the States.</span> <span id="s98">We only had a transit visa in England so it wasn't -- wasn't a -- couldn't be a final destination.</span> <span id="s99">He stayed -- my father and mother stayed with his brother in London.</span> <span id="s100">I was -- there wasn't enough room, so I was put on a farm somewhere in Devonshire where I remember being very, very lonely.</span> <span id="s101">Couldn't speak a word of language -- couldn't speak a word of English at the time.</span> <span id="s102">Had to point to food and things like that and had to -- never really lived on a farm before.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">My sisters, incidentally, went on the Kindertransport a few months before we left; about six months before.</span> <span id="s104">They both were adopted by British families and they were on the Kindertransport.</span> <span id="s105">Both sisters.</span> <span id="s106">Okay.</span> <span id="s107">Then we finally got the -- on the SS Dinzeldike (ph) Dutch freighter with -- had room for 30 passengers going from London to San Francisco through the Panama Canal.</span> <span id="s108">Thirty days on the ocean.</span> <span id="s109">Very exciting for a boy of 9.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Get lost on the ship and go to places where you're not allowed.</span> <span id="s112">And -- and I remember it as a very exciting -- exciting voyage, except we were told we were going to San Francisco and the only thing I ever heard about San Francisco was the earthquake of 1906.</span> <span id="s113">So I figured, well, probably going to live in a cardboard shack there because they can't have any permanent houses.</span> <span id="s114">It must be all black lava sand.</span> <span id="s115">I had this weird idea of what a -- what an earthquake country would be like --</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: -- until the day we sailed under the Golden Gate Bridge.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: You know, and then of course, it was -- it was quite -- quite different.</span> <span id="s120">But it was a very weird expectation of where we would go.</span> <span id="s121">At this time, my father was the only one of our family of five that spoke English.</span> <span id="s122">He had been to England as a young man.</span> <span id="s123">And my sisters had picked up a little in their couple of -- in their six months in England.</span> <span id="s124">I spoke practically none at all, because during my time in England I wasn't there long enough to go to any kind of school.</span> <span id="s125">Schooling or anything.</span> <span id="s126">So basically I grew up in San Francisco.</span> <span id="s127">And we arrived during summer, so by the time school started, I pick up a lot of English on the streets already.</span> <span id="s128">For a nine year old it's very quick.</span> <span id="s129">I was supposed to be, by my age, in fifth grade.</span> <span id="s130">So they put me in fourth grade because I didn't speak enough English.</span> <span id="s131">And then they let me jump from fourth to sixth later on to catch on with my -- to catch up with my age group.</span> <span id="s132">But, what else can I tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Well -- so, this is wonderful, because, you know, it gives an overview --</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: -- of the time.</span> <span id="s136">So if it's okay, if we just go back then and then maybe highlight some of the moments, you know, and talk --</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: -- about any -- any other memories --</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: -- related to that.</span> <span id="s141">So, again, in Hamburg and then before the stoning incident, had you experienced anything else, had you seen anything else?</span> <span id="s142">What was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s144">Well, this reminds me of, as you know, Germany has a policy of inviting Holocaust survivors back to their original birth city.</span> <span id="s145">Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: So several years ago -- that's been about eight or nine years ago now -- we were both invited back; my wife to Berlin and I was invited to Hamburg.</span> <span id="s148">And they show you the -- the city.</span> <span id="s149">But during that time while I was in Hamburg at the hotel, someone from the archives, much like you, came by to interview -- have a personal interview, get the story of each one.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s152">So I did that interview.</span> <span id="s153">And then several years later I was called by a movie producer in Germany, Nina Koshofer -- who was Nina Koshofer, who was in the process of doing a very, very ambitious project of a documentary on the Jews sponsored by German television and French televisions stations.</span> <span id="s154">That's called -- do you speak German at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: I don't speak German.</span> <span id="s156">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: It's called -- in English it's The Jews, History Of A People.</span> <span id="s158">In German it's (speaks in German).</span> <span id="s159">And it was running for -- it's a five-hour documentary.</span> <span id="s160">It was running for five consecutive days on television, an hour each.</span> <span id="s161">It was sort of -- it ended up sort of a little bit like Roots was in this country, which was the history of black slavery.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Here you may have seen it.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Which also ran about four or five days in a row.</span> <span id="s166">And it was a very thorough documentary.</span> <span id="s167">She spent three and a half years traveling to Israel, Lithuania, France, Germany, everywhere to film this thing.</span> <span id="s168">So she had some good funding from these television stations.</span> <span id="s169">And believe it or not, she brought her whole -- whole camera crew over to San Luis Obispo, California and filmed us, and filmed the Shabbat, the evening meal which we had to stage on a Sunday night, instead of Friday, because she happened to be here on Sunday --</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: -- you know.</span> <span id="s172">And did quite an extensive interview.</span> <span id="s173">So this -- this documentary ran.</span> <span id="s174">I have a DVD of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: It ran both in Europe and it has not run on PBS yet but it's scheduled.</span> <span id="s177">It's scheduled to run on PBS.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: Wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: So it really starts sort of with Moses and ends with our family in San Luis Obispo.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: So it's really long.</span> <span id="s182">It's interesting.</span> <span id="s183">But she -- the reason I was picked for this is because of this interview that I did in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s184">She ran -- she read through all these archives, all these interviews --</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: -- and said, I need somebody who has been kicked out of Germany who was a hero in the first world war.</span> <span id="s187">They really wanted to interview my father, but because he wasn't alive anymore, so they settled with me.</span> <span id="s188">And one of the -- one of the episodes of my life that they -- they staged in this film with somebody portraying the young kid -- nine year old kid portraying me, which might be interesting here, was because -- you asked me to go back to remember things.</span> <span id="s189">I remembered very clearly the Gestapo coming in and surveying all our belongings, which they did.</span> <span id="s190">I still have a list of -- a very, very detailed list.</span> <span id="s191">So many handkerchiefs, so much linen, so many knives, forks, and spoons; all the inventory.</span> <span id="s192">Most of which was confiscated.</span> <span id="s193">Ones -- we were allowed to take one knife, fork, and spoon per person.</span> <span id="s194">For a family of five we could take five things with us.</span> <span id="s195">And anything of value that they wanted too, any ornamentation that we had around.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">And we had a large vase, vase, a carved glass vase with a gold rim on the top.</span> <span id="s197">And I noticed they were going through getting anything -- any metals of any value, silver or gold, or anything that they were confiscating.</span> <span id="s198">So while they were rummaging through the house -- I was watching this -- I took this vase and held it under the kitchen faucet under hot water and wanted to see if the rim would come off.</span> <span id="s199">And tapped it, and believe it or not, the rim came right off.</span> <span id="s200">So they took the rim and they left us the vase.</span> <span id="s201">We still have the vase in our living room at home now.</span> <span id="s202">They were only interested in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: -- in the metal part.</span> <span id="s205">Not the vase.</span> <span id="s206">It's a large carved glass vase.</span> <span id="s207">I thought it was quite handsome.</span> <span id="s208">Anyway, that part they staged in this -- in this little film, the history of the Jews there, and -- and a lot of my father's exploits in the first world war as a major.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">I'm not sure what else I can tell you except the thought of this has never -- the thought of our background is somehow never very far from -- from my -- I've been a Professor of Architecture at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and I've concentrated on minority populations.</span> <span id="s210">I guess -- I'm guess it's related to the background of minorities.</span> <span id="s211">And we do talk to high school groups and college groups and various groups in -- in CaliforniA: I would like to do that.</span> <span id="s212">I haven't done that yet in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: It would be interesting to do that in Germany.</span> <span id="s215">Go ahead.</span> <span id="s216">Now ask me something else.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: No, no.</span> <span id="s218">That's wonderful.</span> <span id="s219">Thanks for sharing.</span> <span id="s220">If it's okay, can we talk about your sisters and the family's decision, you know, the process of making the decision, what happened, how it happened, to get on the Kindertransport?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s222">I've never quite figured out.</span> <span id="s223">And you know, it's -- it's interesting that after your parents die you think of all the millions of questions that you wish you would have asked them, which of course, they are not ask-able anymore.</span> <span id="s224">But I was relatively frail, underweight and very skinny.</span> <span id="s225">And for some reason or another, my parents decided to keep me with them and put them on the Kindertransport rather.</span> <span id="s226">Maybe they felt I was too young.</span> <span id="s227">My wife was six months younger than I am when she was put on the Kindertransport by her mother, you know.</span> <span id="s228">It's also very, very hard for me to conceive, as a parent, to conceive of what you must feel like to give your child up into the unknown, because you generally prefer the devil that you know that may be existing with you than the devil that you don't know and you have no idea what you're giving your child to this... In the -- in the film, what is it?</span> <span id="s229">The -- "Into The Arms of Strangers" there is this one very emotional scene where a father just simply pitches his baby through the train window and a teenager catches the baby and saved its life.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: But for a parent to give up a child into the unknown like that is very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">But anyway, my sisters both went out, I think about four months before we did.</span> <span id="s233">Actually, on separate Kindertransports.</span> <span id="s234">And my oldest sister, Susan, stayed with my -- stayed with my father's brother.</span> <span id="s235">My younger sister Eva was adopted by a Jewish cab driver in London with whom she corresponded with for many years after she came back here, and was treated very well.</span> <span id="s236">Some of the children had much worse experience, as you probably heard.</span> <span id="s237">Some were taken advantage of, some were used as domestic servants.</span> <span id="s238">But my wife's -- my wife was adopted by a Quaker family and grew up as a Quaker and also was treated very well.</span> <span id="s239">A lot of Quakers came forward to adopt children.</span> <span id="s240">Okay.</span> <span id="s241">My sister in New York, for example, I've tried to get her into the Kindertransport organization or such.</span> <span id="s242">Well, she's listed in it, but she really is a denier.</span> <span id="s243">She never would want to step foot on Germany.</span> <span id="s244">She would never -- she hasn't told her kids much about this.</span> <span id="s245">She doesn't -- she really -- and she's -- she was the oldest.</span> <span id="s246">She was actually -- I was -- yeah.</span> <span id="s247">She was 16 at the time, so she would have a better memory than anything and she's forgotten everything.</span> <span id="s248">She's forgotten everything.</span> <span id="s249">She's remembers nothing about the voyage, the trip, or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: So, it's very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">My wife just recently published a book about her experience.</span> <span id="s253">Shedding Skins.</span> <span id="s254">I don't know if she mentioned to you, but she had -- she worked very closely with a Jewish editor in our -- in our city that proofread the book and would give her pointers on it.</span> <span id="s255">And shortly after that -- her publication -- this editor died.</span> <span id="s256">And we went to the funeral service and learned through the editor's daughter that she was also a "Kind" and she never mentioned it.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Really.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: She never mentioned it at all.</span> <span id="s259">And you know, they worked together for a couple of years.</span> <span id="s260">And my wife was just blown away that somebody would just totally --</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: -- you know, deny that.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s265">What else?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Is everything okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: No.</span> <span id="s268">I wanted to show you something.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s270">Great.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: But -- well, go ahead.</span> <span id="s272">You have some more questions probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s274">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s275">So maybe we can talk a little bit about your time in England, about adjusting a little bit to life there.</span> <span id="s276">Any friends, any --</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: No.</span> <span id="s278">I wasn't -- I was there two months.</span> <span id="s279">I was living on a farm.</span> <span id="s280">I thought I had been abandoned, sort of thing, because I -- I couldn't speak the language, and I was -- I remember being very, very lonely.</span> <span id="s281">And not speak -- and people didn't speak any German.</span> <span id="s282">I have no idea how this family was ever picked.</span> <span id="s283">But finally, when we met at the dockside that was my first reunion with my sisters also where -- in England so that we all -- we all finally did get on the boat together.</span> <span id="s284">But otherwise, I -- I remember relatively little, little of that time in England.</span> <span id="s285">I remember in San Francisco also nearly being kicked out of school because I got in a fight with a guy that called me a dirty Jew.</span> <span id="s286">Teacher sort of picked us up by our scruffs of our necks and was going to kick us out.</span> <span id="s287">But I realized that -- that you know, the prejudice wasn't just limited to Germany.</span> <span id="s288">Why would -- it happened here too.</span> <span id="s289">I am the keeper of our family passports so I still have my -- my Nazi passport.</span> <span id="s290">We were all given the middle name of Israel, as you probably know.</span> <span id="s291">I had hair once too.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Just so that -- your posterity's sake, I am being shown a passport.</span> <span id="s293">People listening wouldn't be able to see it.</span> <span id="s294">Oh.</span> <span id="s295">And here's your photo.</span> <span id="s296">Wonderful --</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s298">Actually --</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: -- that you have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: -- all except Susan's photo.</span> <span id="s301">I have even my parents' Nazi passports.</span> <span id="s302">When we went to Germany and -- recently --</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: -- you have to show you passport as you enter the country.</span> <span id="s305">I showed them my -- my Nazi passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: And the guy did not have much of a sense of humor.</span> <span id="s308">He said, "You know, sir, I can have you arrested.</span> <span id="s309">I have to confiscate this because it has a swastika on it.</span> <span id="s310">Any documents with a swastika on it are illegal in Germany."</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s312">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: "And so you could be arrested.</span> <span id="s314">And this can be confiscated."</span> <span id="s315">I said, "Okay.</span> <span id="s316">Forget it.</span> <span id="s317">Here's my American passport."</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s319">Right.</span> <span id="s320">Thank you for showing those to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: And thanks for, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: I don't know what else.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: We can talk about other -- you know what?</span> <span id="s325">Maybe about your parents, if you wanted to talk about them.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: That would be wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s329">Okay.</span> <span id="s330">My father was a -- started a coffee firm in Hamburg, importing coffee and processing it from Guatemala, so that's all he really knew was coffee.</span> <span id="s331">So when we came to this country he started peddling coffee house -- until he found a firm here, he started peddling coffee house to house, selling coffee by the pound from house to house, by foot, because he never learned to drive in Germany.</span> <span id="s332">He had a chauffeur.</span> <span id="s333">Over here he just never learned to drive, even all the years he was here.</span> <span id="s334">But after about, oh, I'd say six months approximately of peddling coffee he realized he could not support a family of five by selling coffee, and yet that was about the extent of what he knew.</span> <span id="s335">So he found a job on the San Francisco waterfront and became a stevedore.</span> <span id="s336">And for the first time in his life really did -- did physical eight to five.</span> <span id="s337">He was a union member and working on the waterfront.</span> <span id="s338">And told me, I remember, that in many ways he preferred that because at 5:00 he could no longer -- he would no longer have to worry about his -- his business.</span> <span id="s339">He was -- his time was his own.</span> <span id="s340">He worked strictly from eight to five.</span> <span id="s341">It was tough physical work, but he was free of any -- any kind of other concerns and obligations.</span> <span id="s342">And my mother started being a saleswoman in a department store.</span> <span id="s343">No.</span> <span id="s344">She started -- first of all, she started cleaning people's houses.</span> <span id="s345">She was a domestic house cleaner cleaning people's house for many years and then she became a sales clerk in a department store.</span> <span id="s346">And so we all -- we had pitched in.</span> <span id="s347">We all had some kind of jobs.</span> <span id="s348">There was a Jewish Council of 1933 which helped us get an apartment in San Francisco.</span> <span id="s349">It helps you get settled a little bit.</span> <span id="s350">I still spoke, always, German when I came home, and English in school.</span> <span id="s351">So my sisters also had jobs.</span> <span id="s352">I started sweeping out -- I remember my first job sweeping out a plumbing store and a grocery store for eleven cents an hour.</span> <span id="s353">I remember that.</span> <span id="s354">When I finally figured out how much I was making an hour, I quit and got the job at 20 cents an hour somewhere else.</span> <span id="s355">But that was -- yeah, that was in San Francisco.</span> <span id="s356">So I never really had a much -- through junior high and high school, I never had any much social life at all because I had a job after school almost all the time.</span> <span id="s357">So we all sort of -- we all sort of pitched in.</span> <span id="s358">I was the only one of the -- I was the only one in my family fortunate enough to go to a university.</span> <span id="s359">I went to U C Berkley and studied architecture.</span> <span id="s360">And got drafted into the U.S. Army during the Korean War, which was -- they sent me to Germany, which was a good place to be during the Korean War.</span> <span id="s361">And it was very interesting for me, because I would -- this was 1955, ten years after the end of the war.</span> <span id="s362">And I could very easily put on civies and go into a bar and sit down and have a beer and listen to everybody refighting the Second World War which was fascinating for me, you know.</span> <span id="s363">And an awful lot of denial going on.</span> <span id="s364">Hitler, who was he?</span> <span id="s365">And you know -- sort of thing.</span> <span id="s366">Or I -- I was not a Nazi.</span> <span id="s367">And I always would ask what time -- what point they joined the Nazi party, because if they joined in the late -- in the -- '44, early '45, '43, then they probably weren't convinced Nazis because by that time they had to join in order to survive.</span> <span id="s368">But those who joined in the early forties, and even the late thirties were pretty -- pretty convinced of that, you know.</span> <span id="s369">So anti-semitism was not that -- I had no desire to -- to live there.</span> <span id="s370">I was glad, glad to be part of the US Army.</span> <span id="s371">That was --</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: (Inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s374">It was very interesting.</span> <span id="s375">In fact, I was there during the time when the Germans were being asked by NATO to rearm and develop their own Army.</span> <span id="s376">And I was a corporal.</span> <span id="s377">And we had -- we started getting orders that when we meet German officers we were to salute.</span> <span id="s378">I could never bring myself to do that.</span> <span id="s379">So I'd go down the street and a German officer would start approaching me.</span> <span id="s380">And of course, the -- the lower rank is supposed to salute first.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: And the upper rank then returns the salute, but with me it was -- I was -- I teased them to call me, but they never really did.</span> <span id="s383">But I would never, never salute.</span> <span id="s384">Finally, when the officer gets up to me, he salutes --</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: -- you know, and then I would return the salute.</span> <span id="s387">Or I would not -- no.</span> <span id="s388">Actually, I did not return the salute.</span> <span id="s389">But as far as expecting to be called out on this, and never did.</span> <span id="s390">Never did.</span> <span id="s391">They probably suspected, oh, this guy's Jewish.</span> <span id="s392">He's not going to salute me.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: And it was interesting at that time.</span> <span id="s395">I did a little research on my own and found out that in schools nothing was -- at that time, nothing was being taught at all about the Nazi erA: They did -- they do now.</span> <span id="s396">They have picked it up a lot, but at that time, ten years after the war it was just total denial.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s398">Right.</span> <span id="s399">Great.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: If you'd like, we can definitely keep talking and I could probably you know keep you here for hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Well, no.</span> <span id="s403">You might want to check out this -- this video.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: This -- that is very interesting.</span> <span id="s406">And I think the Holocaust -- you guys either would have one -- have it already.</span> <span id="s407">I don't know how you -- if you research other -- what other countries do.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s409">Yes.</span> <span id="s410">We absolutely do.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Or I have some extra copies.</span> <span id="s412">I can send you one.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: We will -- I will definitely talk to somebody about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: It's available in English now and in German, and I think in French too --</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: -- now.</span> <span id="s417">So it's a -- it's a good thing to have.</span> <span id="s418">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: And maybe if we could talk about your children.</span> <span id="s420">And you talked to them about -- I mean, obviously, you're the keeper of family histories and --</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s422">We're trying not do the same mistake that I did with my parents by not asking enough questions.</span> <span id="s423">And now as our children are -- are getting older, you know, they're what, 46, 44, and 42, so they're -- and they have children of their own.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: So particularly my son is very, very -- I took -- I took him along when we were invited to Germany.</span> <span id="s426">Did I -- Oh.</span> <span id="s427">I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: -- really quick.</span> <span id="s429">No.</span> <span id="s430">Actually, we can just...</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Put this back on me.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Well, that's -- get my handkerchief out.</span> <span id="s434">I undid that.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Put it on a little tighter.</span> <span id="s436">Great.</span> <span id="s437">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: What do you want -- you want me to repeat something?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Just, if we could just go back a little bit about --</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: You were speaking about your son.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s443">My son is probably the most, I'd say the most Jewish of the three of us -- three of my children.</span> <span id="s444">And we took him with us to Germany for this visit to Hamburg and Berlin.</span> <span id="s445">And he's also a member of Kin 2.</span> <span id="s446">He did a stint in Israel.</span> <span id="s447">He speaks fluent Hebrew.</span> <span id="s448">He joined the Israeli defense forces for a short time to free -- to free natives for fighting -- for fighting.</span> <span id="s449">They train foreigners to be sort of domestic part of the IDF.</span> <span id="s450">He teaches Spanish in Berkley.</span> <span id="s451">Interestingly enough, it's part of, I think, our effect on our children that they have all gone into professions, non-entrepreneurial professions, but they are more -- much more interested in working with and helping people.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">My daughter is a physical therapist.</span> <span id="s453">My other daughter in New York works for the Innocence Project with Berry Scheck.</span> <span id="s454">She's a lawyer by training.</span> <span id="s455">Works with the Innocence Project.</span> <span id="s456">And Charles teaches Spanish.</span> <span id="s457">And I've been teaching, primarily trying to sensitize architects, architecture students to designing for disabilities, working with disabled people.</span> <span id="s458">And most 20 year old architecture students feel they're totally indestructible so they don't really think about accessibility within a building.</span> <span id="s459">So that's more or less what I'm concentrating on, and dealing a lot with just diverse populations, designing for diversity.</span> <span id="s460">So I think it's had an influence on teaching and on our value system and in general.</span> <span id="s461">I think, you know, most of the people there have gone -- in the conference I noticed too have gone into some kind of -- of a field in the humanities rather than business, which is very interesting sort of a side effect on it --</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: -- on what's been happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Otherwise, we've tried to share things with our children, tried to answer their questions as much as possible as what we remember.</span> <span id="s466">We wish we remember more precisely.</span> <span id="s467">That's about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Wonderful.</span> <span id="s469">Well, thank you, thank you, thank you so much for --</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: -- for the interview and for sharing with us today.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: I'll probably think of a lot of things that I didn't -- I didn't mention, but -- in fact, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Actually -- yeah, actually, maybe that would be a good idea if we can take a minute.</span> <span id="s474">I can just pause it and then if you want to just sit.</span> <span id="s475">I have the time if you have the time and we can -- if you have --</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: 12:30, I guess.</span> <span id="s477">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: If there's anything that, you know, you want to just think about and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s480">We can go ahead --</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Let's just do that.</span> <span id="s482">So I'm going to just pause it and then... Great.</span> <span id="s483">So we are recording again after a pause with Paul to collect our thoughts.</span> <span id="s484">And once again, we discussed you would like to tell us about your grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s486">I was unfortunate to know -- only one of my grandparents was alive when -- when I was born.</span> <span id="s487">And that was my mother's mother; my grandmother, Rosa Abeles, or Omas (ph) as we called her.</span> <span id="s488">She -- we tried very hard through the Red Cross to try to get her out afterwards because she refused to come out with us.</span> <span id="s489">She was old, elderly, overweight and -- and devoted only to Germany, really.</span> <span id="s490">Didn't have -- didn't -- would not leave Germany under any circumstances.</span> <span id="s491">And we tried very hard through the Geneva Red Cross and finally learned at the end of the war that she had died in Theresienstadt in the concentration camps in Theresienstadt where a lot of older people were taken.</span> <span id="s492">After doing some research at Yad Vashem when we went to Israel years later, we looked up the date -- the dates that she was there, which Germany is of course incredible at recordkeeping.</span> <span id="s493">They keep records of everything.</span> <span id="s494">And we found that she was at Theresienstadt for about six months period until she died, probably of starvation, at the -- at the same time that my wife's grandmother was also at Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s495">They could have possibly known each other years and years before we ever met.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: You know, I didn't meet my wife until 1960.</span> <span id="s498">So it's very possible that they might have known each other, as it is just one of those very strange coincidences.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">I'm often asked in talks in school what affect this has had on -- on my faith.</span> <span id="s500">And I have to admit that the whole experience probably made me more Jewish than I would have been in Germany, because we are relatively secular Jews and am still -- I do -- we do belong to a synagogue here as we did in Hamburg, but it's reformed.</span> <span id="s501">As you know, Jews have reformed conservative and orthodox.</span> <span id="s502">So it's very much on the liberal or reformed side here.</span> <span id="s503">But certainly, I felt more Jewish because of what's happened there.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">It was interesting when we first came to America -- this was almost a couple years before Pearl Harbor, but only -- we arrived here 30 days, directly 30 days after the war in Europe broke out.</span> <span id="s505">We arrived on August 1st.</span> <span id="s506">The war started September 1, 1939.</span> <span id="s507">And we were treated as enemy aliens here.</span> <span id="s508">We were considered German.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">When the Japanese were deported from the west coast after Pearl Harbor, there was serious talk about doing the same thing with the Germans.</span> <span id="s510">They never did it because our skin color was not so obviously different from everybody else's skin color, but there was serious talk about also doing that.</span> <span id="s511">I remember the FBI coming into our apartment in San Francisco, confiscating a Grundig radio that we had brought over because they thought it might receive shortwave.</span> <span id="s512">It didn't receive shortwave of course, but they confiscated it anyway.</span> <span id="s513">So at this time the Deutsch of Bund, the German Bund was marching up and down the streets of New York holding demonstrations.</span> <span id="s514">So America really had not a clue as to what was really happening there at all.</span> <span id="s515">And I was very instrumental in our little community here.</span> <span id="s516">We just finished building the very first LEED certified synagogue in the world.</span> <span id="s517">A LEED is an international standard for rating energy efficient buildings.</span> <span id="s518">It simply means Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design.</span> <span id="s519">And so I was quite instrumental in getting that designed and built and LEED certified.</span> <span id="s520">So I am active in that respect.</span> <span id="s521">I think the effect that this whole thing has had on me more is to -- is to really be very, very conscious of any type -- any types of discrimination.</span> <span id="s522">Right now I'm working closely with a Moslem group which is getting a lot of prejudice in our area, and in many areas.</span> <span id="s523">Kids are being picked on in school.</span> <span id="s524">There's -- there's just a lot of -- a lot of the same kind of ignorant prejudice.</span> <span id="s525">It comes really out of ignorance more than anything else, of not understanding and not even wanting to understand.</span> <span id="s526">You know, when I went back in the military to Germany I was the first Jew that many Germans had ever met, or had any contact with whatsoever, you know.</span> <span id="s527">But when they said, we had no idea of what was really going on, that was very questionable, because they -- well, maybe they knew enough not to ask the right questions.</span> <span id="s528">That was -- but they did see their neighbors disappearing and -- and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s529">One thing I left out is that after I got out of the US Army, I took what was known at the time as a GI Bill of Rights which allows you to study.</span> <span id="s530">They give you a small stipend.</span> <span id="s531">I think it was $150 a month, which would make it very difficult to study in the U.S. at a university, but I could do graduate work in architecture in Germany.</span> <span id="s532">So against my father's best wishes, I enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich and spent a couple of years there doing graduate work in architecture.</span> <span id="s533">Had a very, very international class, a master's program in architecture.</span> <span id="s534">And a professor, who had fought on the front in the -- Sep Ruf, a well known architect in Germany, who had fought on the front.</span> <span id="s535">And one weekend decided to put us all in cars and take us to Dachau, which is just outside of Munich, you know.</span> <span id="s536">And he insisted that I ride with him in his car.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">And he tried to make a strong case for the fact that he was a soldier on the front, an officer on the front, and not really knowing what was happening back home, as far as the Jewish problem.</span> <span id="s538">I still -- I still have suspicions that if they wanted to find out what was happening, not only to the Jews at home but to the Jews of the countries that were -- that they were occupying during the war, they could easily find out.</span> <span id="s539">Even an -- even an artillery officer could find that out, what was really going on.</span> <span id="s540">But he took us to the memorial.</span> <span id="s541">And explained to us all -- the memorial at Dachau had just been built.</span> <span id="s542">It was a very -- it was a very emotional trip.</span> <span id="s543">I was the only Jew in that architecture group, but the group was -- only included two Germans.</span> <span id="s544">The rest were from, really, all over the world.</span> <span id="s545">They had students from everywhere that came together and had a chance to experience that very, very powerful visit.</span> <span id="s546">And they seemed to -- beginning to really understand what -- what kind of mass hysteria had taken place there, even though this was just ten years after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: As far as getting back to the faith issue, there is a -- there is a -- a Jewish saying of attempting to heal the world, of acting in such a way, behaving throughout your life in such a way, it's tikkun olam, which means to heal the world.</span> <span id="s549">And in some small ways you're supposed -- ideally, it's to lead a life that would help to do that.</span> <span id="s550">So I've gotten very involved in, at home, working with the homeless issue, which is prevalent in our town also, and in creating a sustainable synagogue that does a little bit maybe to heal the environment.</span> <span id="s551">And it was -- by the way, it was the first LEED certified synagogue in the world.</span> <span id="s552">And hopefully -- and since then -- this was three years ago it was -- it was certified.</span> <span id="s553">And since then there have been many others that have also been certified.</span> <span id="s554">So if any affect it had on me, it's made me conscious of individual prejudices.</span> <span id="s555">When my wife and I talk to schools we try to get this across to kids as to picking on.</span> <span id="s556">Right now there's a big thing all over the news about bullying and what -- what harm that can do.</span> <span id="s557">Bullying because of -- you're gay, or because they're Moslem or because you're different from -- from the -- so the idea of differences and how we -- how we treat differences and how we only seem to gravitate to our own kind all the time needs to be addressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">And I think very slowly it is, but you know, it's very dangerous what's happening in this country right now because when they say that the hysteria of Naziism was only because the Germans are so focused on the fuhrer, on a leader, that they will follow the leader over any precipice.</span> <span id="s559">Some of the things we're seeing now, some of the prejudices we see with the mosque being proposed in New York and what have you, it could happen here just as easily I think as -- as having anything happen in Germany in the 1930s.</span> <span id="s560">So we're not -- we're not above that.</span> <span
