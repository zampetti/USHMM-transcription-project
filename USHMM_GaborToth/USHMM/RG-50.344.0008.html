with Ellen Bonnie Marchese.</span> <span id="s4">This is July 15th, 1995.</span> <span id="s5">We’re in West Park, New York and my name is Nina Ellis.</span> <span id="s6">Tell me if you would, when and where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Answer: I was born in Brooklyn, 1917, on Thanksgiving day.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Q: Where did you grow up?</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A: I grew up partly in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s10">No, I guess I didn’t grow up in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s11">God, you’re going back 70 some odd years and -- what else.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: Tell me a little bit about your family life.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: My father and my mother had an arranged marriage.</span> <span id="s14">She was years younger than he was.</span> <span id="s15">He was -- they came from Italy as immigrants.</span> <span id="s16">I don’t know whether she loved him, but they accommodated to each other.</span> <span id="s17">He died when he was fairly young and I was 13.</span> <span id="s18">She had six children and she was a lovely, brave woman.</span> <span id="s19">She raised us all with a great deal of love.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: When did you graduate from high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: And did you go --</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: 1934, a-and I went into training in 1935, I was too young to go in when I graduated.</span> <span id="s24">And that was three years, King’s County, it was very famous in Brooklyn, at the time.</span> <span id="s25">It was a very tough training, we had affiliations at Bellevue Hospital, at Willard Parker.</span> <span id="s26">It was tough.</span> <span id="s27">I really chose training because it was during the depression.</span> <span id="s28">My family wanted to do something so that I’d get some education and they could afford the 300 dollars.</span> <span id="s29">And that’s why I ch -- I would never have chosen nursing, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: But it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: But it was a profession and it was available to us and that’s what I did, went into nursing.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s35">And when you graduated, what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: When I graduated I did psychiatry at Bellevue.</span> <span id="s37">From Bellevue -- at the start of the war I went into -- USPHS wanted nurses for their maritime and Coast Guard station down in Manhattan Beach in Brooklyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Public Health Service?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Public Health.</span> <span id="s40">I worked there for awhile.</span> <span id="s41">Then I was a bad girl, I started a petition so that married nurses could get Sundays off.</span> <span id="s42">And they didn’t like that, they sent me across the street to the dental clinic, where I had a ball, since I was the only woman there.</span> <span id="s43">Then, from there I went to 42 Broadway, Spar sick bay.</span> <span id="s44">I was in charge of the sick bay.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: What is Spar?</span> <span id="s46">A: Spar was the Coast Guard.</span> <span id="s47">Oh no, wait a minute, before that I went to the -- oh, the USPHS, I told you that, that was US Coast Guard and Merchant Mariners.</span> <span id="s48">Then the Spar sick bay and then I decided to join the army and see the world.</span> <span id="s49">Went to basic training in Atlantic City, where we went on a 50 mile hike with brand new field bo -- 25 miles -- field boots.</span> <span id="s50">Everybody got blisters.</span> <span id="s51">They told us to walk in the ocean and that would soften the leather.</span> <span id="s52">And they took girls home in ambulances by the droves.</span> <span id="s53">But I made it.</span> <span id="s54">I made it.</span> <span id="s55">From there we went --</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: They took them home in ambulances from that hike, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: From the hike.</span> <span id="s58">It was gruesome.</span> <span id="s59">It was really gruesome because we had the new shoes on.</span> <span id="s60">Everybody got blisters.</span> <span id="s61">So -- but we did everything else, I -- I -- basic training was okay.</span> <span id="s62">We were young, we were fit and we got through even climbing up the sides of the ship, where a few of us froze on the ladder.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Oh, those rope ladders?</span> <span id="s64">Those big cargo ropes?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: It was fun.</span> <span id="s66">Yeah, I liked that.</span> <span id="s67">I was athletic, I liked that.</span> <span id="s68">What else?</span> <span id="s69">Then I went to -- where the hell did I go then?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: When did you go into the service?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: ‘44</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Remember what time of year?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: I think that it was before Christmas, because we had a miserable Christmas in England, miserable.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: We went to s -- o-on the Queen --</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Elizabeth.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Elizabeth.</span> <span id="s78">Zigzagged all the way across.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Do you remember very much of the crossing?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Yeah, I did.</span> <span id="s81">Played a lot of poker, had a wonderful time, lot of men around.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: They let you mingle with the men?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: No, it was the officer’s mess, whatever -- the lounge.</span> <span id="s84">Not with the enlisted men, just the officers.</span> <span id="s85">And there was a lot of poker playing, cause there wasn’t much else to do and I’m sure there was drinking, I can’t really remember.</span> <span id="s86">But the crossing was -- many of the kids in my group got really seasick, because it was rough.</span> <span id="s87">So a lot of them spent time in their bunks, feeling green.</span> <span id="s88">And we landed in Scotland and then they took us to England and I remember bunches of prostitutes walking down the streets and yelling at us.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Where was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: And we lan -- in England.</span> <span id="s91">I can’t remember where in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: What were the prostitutes --</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: But we landed in the middle of the night and they weren’t ready for us.</span> <span id="s94">Oh, yelling, “Hi, yank,” and all that stuff.</span> <span id="s95">The men were with us, too, you know, the enlisted men.</span> <span id="s96">We’re marching down the street in the middle of the night til they found us billets and that was the coldest I’ve ever been in my life.</span> <span id="s97">Some of the girls got st-straw from the first floor.</span> <span id="s98">Me and my two roommates -- my two roommates and I wound up at the attic, with fireplaces that didn’t work.</span> <span id="s99">And nobody slept, we were so cold.</span> <span id="s100">We slept on the floor in our bedrolls.</span> <span id="s101">So cold, bitter.</span> <span id="s102">Then we walked miles to the mess to eat.</span> <span id="s103">I got lost one night in the fog.</span> <span id="s104">The fogs were awesome, they were really pea soup.</span> <span id="s105">England was nice.</span> <span id="s106">We also went on detach service, which means that they weren’t ready for us to -- we were an evacuation unit and they didn’t have anything for us to do in England til we crossed.</span> <span id="s107">And we went to a hospital in the south of England and took care of our boys.</span> <span id="s108">And that was nice, because that was the first actual nursing that we did.</span> <span id="s109">And it was interesting, we been doing what we were there to do and we liked that.</span> <span id="s110">We were sent to different hospitals in England.</span> <span id="s111">And when we came back, we crossed the channel.</span> <span id="s112">I remember meeting Garson Canaan crossing that channel and going up to him and saying my sister was an actress.</span> <span id="s113">Well, his wife was Ruth Gordon and he said, “My wife is a famous actress.”</span> <span id="s114">What else?</span> <span id="s115">We landed in France.</span> <span id="s116">From then on trucks -- hurry and wait, lines -- hurry and wait.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: And then you -- they set up the hospital in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: In -- in France, they set up our tents in Sudan I think it was.</span> <span id="s119">Bavaria, somewhere in Bavaria.</span> <span id="s120">We lived in tents and that was fun.</span> <span id="s121">I lost a very expensive lighter in the grass.</span> <span id="s122">We slept on our bedrolls, on army cots and you could feel any -- every lump of the mess kits.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Under the cot?</span> <span id="s124">You kept your mess kits under your cots?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: No, we kept the bedroll on top of the cot so that the cold would not come up under.</span> <span id="s126">It was sort of an insulation.</span> <span id="s127">And it was kind of, you know, uncomfortable, but at least it was warmer than just sleeping on a cot.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s129">And what was your particular job in the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: I was the psychiatric nurse.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: I don’t remember if I told you that I -- from King’s County, where I was a pediatric nurse, my -- my love was psychiatry.</span> <span id="s133">So I worked in Bellevue for a few years, til somebody hit one of the nurses on the head with a faucet, and scooted.</span> <span id="s134">New York’s bad boys.</span> <span id="s135">And the nurse that was on duty that night, happened to be a big, hefty girl and she was working for me and I said, “Enough of this, I quit.”</span> <span id="s136">I did.</span> <span id="s137">But psychiatry, I guess I had m -- that’s why the army chose me for that facet, that was my area of expertise.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: I’ve read that for the GI’s who were at the Battle of the Bulge, that there was a lot of psychiatric trauma there.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s140">I didn’t experience that because we were there after the Bulge.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s143">But they were just children -- they were just children.</span> <span id="s144">How can you cope with death and dying and your buddy being blown up?</span> <span id="s145">You can’t.</span> <span id="s146">You --</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: How did you help them?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Actually, we didn’t -- we didn’t get to do that much nursing til we -- we were set up in the tents and mostly the surgical girls did the wounded.</span> <span id="s149">There was one tent of the neuro-psychiatric.</span> <span id="s150">And I was on night duty, so they were mostly asleep.</span> <span id="s151">They had medication.</span> <span id="s152">The corpsmen did all of the -- the physical stuff.</span> <span id="s153">So there was just tender loving care, that’s all you could do.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: What -- what was the common symptoms of what they were [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: I guess you’d call it -- let’s see, battle shock -- what would you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: PTSD?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Post -- Post Traumatic Stress?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Yeah, but that wasn’t known then.</span> <span id="s160">They didn’t call it then.</span> <span id="s161">And -- now in World War One it was called shell shock.</span> <span id="s162">And people came out of that with tics and tremors and all the rest of it.</span> <span id="s163">But these boys were mostly in shock -- in shock.</span> <span id="s164">And we didn’t get -- since we were an evac -- we were moving all the time, we didn’t really get to follow up anybody that we took care of.</span> <span id="s165">The only time we were able to do that was in England, because we were there for quite awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: But what could you do for them if they were brought there?</span> <span id="s167">What -- what was the standard kind of --</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Well, it wasn’t -- they didn’t have the sort of tools at hand as you would have in a psychiatric hospital.</span> <span id="s169">That’s right, I did the basic training.</span> <span id="s170">I also worked in a psychiatric hospital where they had German prisoners.</span> <span id="s171">But most of the tools in psychiatry then, were either medication -- and it wasn’t as kind as tranquilizers or what -- anything they have today.</span> <span id="s172">They used -- for violent people they used hot tubs -- this was at Bellevue -- where the patient was immersed in a tub of warm water with a canvas sheet covering it.</span> <span id="s173">And that was supposed to be soothing.</span> <span id="s174">But it wasn’t.</span> <span id="s175">It wasn’t soothing at all.</span> <span id="s176">Either that or a cold pack.</span> <span id="s177">They would wrap them in cold sheets and do that for hours.</span> <span id="s178">But -- it was very interesting.</span> <span id="s179">I mean, the things that people say -- I used to keep a journal of everything -- the things said.</span> <span id="s180">Now, one young man committed suicide by burning up everything he had ever written.</span> <span id="s181">He was a writer and that was his way of committing suicide.</span> <span id="s182">So he was in there.</span> <span id="s183">The kids I took care of at Bellevue were adolescents in trouble who were sent there by the court for 30 days to be evaluated -- to see if they were going to go to a reform school or being sent home or being sent to another mental institution.</span> <span id="s184">They were just there temporarily.</span> <span id="s185">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: And what about the ones in the field, though?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: The ones in the field, I don’t know what happened to them, because eventually they were either sent home with a section eight.</span> <span id="s188">I don’t think that too many of them recovered, I really don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: But you didn’t have those hot baths there?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s191">They had no facilities, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Just medication?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Just medication.</span> <span id="s194">And a psychiatrist I guess would talk to them, Daniel Freedman.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: That was the name of the psychiatrist?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s197">But I didn’t know him til -- when?</span> <span id="s198">It all merges in -- it all flows in together so that there’s no sequence to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Was it -- were there a lot of these men?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: A whole tent full.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: At any give time?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Well, that time in Germany, you know, that was the height.</span> <span id="s203">It was right after the Bulge, so that was the height of dreadful experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: And how many would be a tent full?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: I’d say 10 on each side.</span> <span id="s206">10 cots on each side.</span> <span id="s207">I don’t know if all of them were occupied, though, I can’t really remember that, I just remember I was on night duty and they were not -- they didn’t have demands, as somebody physically wounded would have.</span> <span id="s208">They didn’t have demands.</span> <span id="s209">They were in their own world.</span> <span id="s210">It was really sad, because physical trauma, at least you can mend at times -- not always, but mental trauma is kind of more difficult.</span> <span id="s211">Really, your very psyche.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: And that’s about all I can remember of that.</span> <span id="s214">Now, when we were at Gusen, they didn’t have a psychiatric ward, they didn’t have that.</span> <span id="s215">There were all these little huts, with tiers of cots and all these living skeletons.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Let me ask you, before that, about how did you go -- get to Gusen and what were the situa -- what was the situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Got orders to go and the colonel spoke to us and when we got -- we didn’t know where we were going, except we were following our medi -- our medics from Germany, we went into Austria and when we got there -- beautiful little village, little Alpine village like this.</span> <span id="s218">And the hills, the Alps were simply breathtaking.</span> <span id="s219">I understand the danu is always filled with -- Danube was always filled with bodies.</span> <span id="s220">And the colonel got us in a group and he told us that none of us were going to be forced to go and work in this camp.</span> <span id="s221">That if we wanted to opt out, we could.</span> <span id="s222">But of course, nobody did.</span> <span id="s223">We all were gung-ho to go and help.</span> <span id="s224">So we all went to work and -- horror --</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: What -- do you remember the first time you went into the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Well, you sort of remember, yeah, all those people lying on those bunks.</span> <span id="s227">They were like living dead.</span> <span id="s228">Nothing but eyes and bones.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: And what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: I really can’t remember it.</span> <span id="s231">I -- I -- I do try to block it out.</span> <span id="s232">I don’t want to remember.</span> <span id="s233">Don’t want to.</span> <span id="s234">Cause somebody did that to them.</span> <span id="s235">A human being responsible for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s237">When -- did you -- were you told who those people were?</span> <span id="s238">Did you know who they were?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: They were all -- there were Poles, there were Gypsies, there were political prisoners, all sorts of people there that -- you know, undesirable.</span> <span id="s240">Jews, everybody mixed in.</span> <span id="s241">I know that Mauthausen got -- was much more crowded and was supposed to have been much worse than Gusen.</span> <span id="s242">But Gusen was bad enough.</span> <span id="s243">It was -- you know, the same thing on a smaller scale.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Gusen was a sub-camp of Mauthausen --</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: They were close by each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Did you go to Mauthausen at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: No, I didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s250">No, didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s251">And then I was traipsing around with my future husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: I didn’t even go to Hitler’s bunker, when the whole group went, because I had a date with Mike.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: You met there?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: Yup.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: At Gusen?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Yup.</span></p> <p><span

At that moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Well, I wrote home that night to my mother and I said, “I finally met the man I’m going to marry.”</span> <span id="s262">I just knew.</span> <span id="s263">Just knew.</span> <span id="s264">We had a lot in common.</span> <span id="s265">We both were familiar with Brooklyn, we both had Italian parents.</span> <span id="s266">We knew the same neighborhoods.</span> <span id="s267">Just clicked, just clicked.</span> <span id="s268">And that’s what I said, I fell in love, so Gusen was a little blunted for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Yeah, cause you were in a state.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Yup.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: But, can you remember what -- what you did every day?</span> <span id="s272">The -- were you in a ward, were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Yes, we were assigned a ward and we went and gave medications and did dressings.</span> <span id="s274">We never actually bathed anyone I don’t think.</span> <span id="s275">I don’t remember bathing anyone.</span> <span id="s276">The usual things that nurses do, comfort, backrubs, that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s277">And we went every day, we walked down when we didn’t take the bus.</span> <span id="s278">There was a little village that you walk through the streets where they kept the animals and the [indecipherable] and you had to hold your nose going through those villages, they smelled so.</span> <span id="s279">We also had an Austrian maid and we kept deviling her.</span> <span id="s280">“But didn’t you know that anything was going on down there?</span> <span id="s281">How could you not know?”</span> <span id="s282">No, they didn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s283">They couldn’t smell it, they couldn’t -- unaware -- they never knew anything that was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗A: No.</span> <span id="s285">I don’t.</span> <span id="s286">I think they were probably -- if they
