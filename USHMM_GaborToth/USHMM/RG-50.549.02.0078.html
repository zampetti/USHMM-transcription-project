Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection.</span> <span id="s13">This is an interview with Lucie Rosenberg, conducted by Neenah Ellis on April 16th, 2004, in Washington, D.C..</span> <span id="s14">This interview is part of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum’s post Holocaust interview project, and it’s a follow up interview to a USHMM videotaped interview conducted with Lucie Rosenberg within the last five years.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Answer: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Not sure of the date.</span> <span id="s17">The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible.</span> <span id="s18">This is tape number one, side A.</span> <span id="s19">When your video interview ended, you summarized a little bit about what happened to you after your family came to New York.</span> <span id="s20">But I’d like to go back and talk a little bit more specifically about some of the things that happened to you and your parents and -- when you first arrived there.</span> <span id="s21">And y-you mentioned in the -- in your interview that your father went into the mustard business in Brooklyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: And tell me a little more about that, how did that come about?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Well, he and two other people, one, a man from Belgrade who was actually an electrical engineer, and a man by the name of Rolf, who was a Polish refugee, decided that they had to do something and this was apparently available.</span> <span id="s25">At one time my father had a -- wa-was in something -- I won’t say -- s-say [indecipherable] but in the alcohol business --</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: -- and in a vineg -- he had a vinegar factory in Liubljana.</span> <span id="s28">So, he had some notion of -- of this -- of a very little.</span> <span id="s29">And so they were there, I think my father -- I’m not quite sure what year my father sold it out, but it was very traumatic for him, I must say.</span> <span id="s30">And particularly negotiations with the union was quite funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: So these three men pooled their money and bought an existing business?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: They bought an existing business, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: What did they call the mustard?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: They actually made mustard for various well-known mustard firms, I -- I -- I can’t tell you -- I mean, there were various brands and so on.</span> <span id="s35">The thing was called Old Dutch mustard company.</span> <span id="s36">And as I said, they -- they -- th-they -- I guess they got the labels and the -- and the -- the -- the -- what would you call them, the containers and so on and they did it for various companies that I don’t remember the name of, but they were certainly better known than the Old Dutch mustard, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s38">And they did that for roughly how many years?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Sic -- I’m trying to think.</span> <span id="s40">Maybe five, maybe s-six, and -- I mean, my father bailed out very soon afterward, he couldn’t stand it.</span> <span id="s41">He couldn’t stand it, he also couldn’t stand driving to Brooklyn daily, and so it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Did he go into another business after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: No, I think he mostly invested in real estate and by that time we had already gotten -- he -- he’d started working on -- on this project of getting -- getting the compensation from the Yugoslav government and so on, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: -- no.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Can you explain that a little bit, the compensation?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s48">The royal Yugoslav government had deposited in the United States a serious sum -- I mean a serious amount of gold, I guess it must have been ingots, or whatever you called gold.</span> <span id="s49">And after awhile the Tito government wanted to -- wanted to get this gold back to Yugoslavia and United States said yes, after you have compensated United States businesses that were there pre-war, and s-some of our -- an-and our citizens, American citizens whose -- whose property was nationalized.</span> <span id="s50">And, as they had nationalized a number of things, number of buildings, number of factories and so on [indecipherable] Yugoslavia after the war.</span> <span id="s51">We -- we were within this particular group of people.</span> <span id="s52">And this went on for several years and finally -- finally a lump sum came, and then I guess mostly he -- he -- he traveled a great deal, he -- actually he did the trip around the world with some friends, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: And you were in this group of people because of the businesses that he had?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Also my -- no --</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: -- no.</span> <span id="s57">Simply because, for instance my -- my -- my mother’s house, which is right in the center of Zagreb, supposedly very historic, it was built by her great-grandfather.</span> <span id="s58">In fact, this was built -- when this house was being built, Jews were still not allowed to have property, real estate property in Zagreb.</span> <span id="s59">But by the time it was finished -- so it star -- it was built under the name of the architect, was a very famous architect by the name of Felbinger.</span> <span id="s60">And by the time it had been -- so this was known for years it was a Felbinger house.</span> <span id="s61">But by the time the house was completed, this law had been passed in Austria-Hungary an-and they could, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: -- own the property.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: So this was extremely valuable property because it’s in the very center of the main square in Zagreb, and there’s a great deal of -- of -- of -- I mean, this is a small, this is a two story, very old pa -- I mean, house.</span> <span id="s66">But the back is very valuable, let’s say like something on Times Square, it -- just the main square in town and so --</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: -- just the land itself is extremely valuable and there was another house in the back and so -- so that was one of the things and also my father had -- had some -- ano -- some more real estate property in Zagreb and other odds and ends, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: So he got involved in this compensation negotiation?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: Yes, ye -- well, not really.</span> <span id="s71">I mean, yes, he -- he did, I mean, he and a lawyer and so on, it took a great deal of time and cu -- and he had to travel to Washington a great deal and so on.</span> <span id="s72">But this was done through a lawyer here who -- who -- whose name I don’t re-recall right now, but was an American lawyer who dealt with this and with numerous oth -- not too many, but other people who had arrived about the same time we did, and some a little earlier.</span> <span id="s73">Not many who arrived later, because first of all there was this cut-up -- cut off date and secondly we arrived just -- we crossed the border from --from Austria to Switzerland on the day that the -- the -- the -- Belgrade was bombed, so you know, if we had been caught we would have been obviously in bad shape.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: An-And was your father successful in that?</span> <span id="s75">Did he get his money?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: It was serious money at the time.</span> <span id="s79">I don’t -- I -- I don’t remember what -- what the amount was, but it was a lot of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s81">And when -- when you were first in New York, you mentioned that you were doing some translating and some research at the library --</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: -- when you met someone who was affiliated with broadcasting.</span> <span id="s84">It was the precursor to the VOA.</span> <span id="s85">But can you talk a little bit about your life when you first came as a young person and -- and who were your friends and what did you do and -- and were you happy to be there, were you -- you know, what -- what were your prospects?</span> <span id="s86">What did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Yes -- yes -- yes, I was very happy to be there because -- in a way, of course I was sad, because as soon as we started getting news of what was going on, it was very painful.</span> <span id="s88">But -- but there was a lot of hope still going on.</span> <span id="s89">There was a government in exile which was [indecipherable] that was in -- in -- in London and then came back into the United States.</span> <span id="s90">We th -- both my brother and I thought this was really fun.</span> <span id="s91">We arrived in New York and we stayed in a -- in a -- a what do you call it, an apartment hotel, it was da -- it was on 57th and Sixth.</span> <span id="s92">It was called The Salisbury, it was like two or three rooms and a little kitchen in a closet, and a -- and of course, you know, they cleaned up and gave you the -- and gave you fresh laundry and so on and there were pa -- I think there were two bedrooms and some kind of a living room and so on.</span> <span id="s93">And I remember going to a five and 10 cents store and we bought all of this crazy china, very cheap stuff, and like four plates and four spoons and so on.</span> <span id="s94">And it was sort of like playacting almost.</span> <span id="s95">Nobody was aware of really what was going on and how it was going to happen.</span> <span id="s96">There was -- we knew, of course, that there were Jews being taken to concentration camps in Austria and Germany, but there was no talk of death camps, and there were none at that time, I don’t believe.</span> <span id="s97">And so, we were there.</span> <span id="s98">Also, at the same time, this gentleman who was in the mustard business with my father, who was from Belgrade, he -- they came -- no, they may have arrived just a little earlier than we did.</span> <span id="s99">There was a girl who was about, I don’t know, two, three ye -- two years younger than I am, and a boy who was maybe a year or two younger than my brother.</span> <span id="s100">And it was fun.</span> <span id="s101">My mother didn’t have the faintest notion about cooking.</span> <span id="s102">This very nice Mrs. Shanser taught her to cook.</span> <span id="s103">By that time we had moved to a nice furnished place in river -- in Riverdale in New York.</span> <span id="s104">Do you know where that is, across from [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: No, I -- mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: -- but anyhow, it’s -- it’s almost on the border of Scarsdale and well, Westchester county, or whatever.</span> <span id="s107">And they had this very nice apartment building that had a bus taking you to the -- to the subway if you wanted it, several times a day, and to the little grocery, to -- to shopping [indecipherable] was where my mother used to go with this friend who was teaching her how to cook.</span> <span id="s108">And however, when we got there, we discovered that there really -- we didn’t have enough knives and forks and we couldn’t function very well with whatever we had, these four spoons and so on.</span> <span id="s109">And that place did not have any tablecloth or any -- it -- it -- it -- it was the -- it -- actually, the furniture was quite nice, and it was large and quite pleasant.</span> <span id="s110">So then my father went to an auction in New York.</span> <span id="s111">And this was a extremely sad thing that I’m still -- that is still terribly painful to me.</span> <span id="s112">He went to the New York docks, wi -- where there were numerous cra -- not crates, what you call the -- what do you call these things that you send large amounts of furniture, household goods?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Containers?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Contains.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s117">And for non-payment of fees at the dock, these things were auctioned off.</span> <span id="s118">So he didn’t really know what -- what was in it, but they would say, I don’t know, china and silverware and odds and ends and so on.</span> <span id="s119">And he bought this almost sight unseen -- in fact, sight unseen stuff, which then was brought home and I still have it, but this -- now it’s going to go [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s120">Very, very elaborate -- if you want I’ll show you the thing because it’s kind of amusing -- china, which was obviously bought by a family that was moving to the States with you know, what can we buy that -- that -- of German goods that I -- we’re permitted to take out and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: So this is just a lot of gold and a lot -- I’ll show it to you -- thing, which we used for everyday use.</span> <span id="s123">I think we were cutting things and so on.</span> <span id="s124">I mean, our -- our china at home was very nice china, but it wasn’t elaborate, I mean was -- it was okay, it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: -- it was a -- we -- we thought this was really fun, both my brother and I. And then one day -- there’s all sorts of stories about it -- one day somebody said, do you know how much this stuff is worth?</span> <span id="s127">I said, absolutely no idea, I mean, this is what -- yeah, this is what we use.</span> <span id="s128">Although we thought it was quite funny that it was as -- as -- as elaborate as it was.</span> <span id="s129">So finally we decided okay, we need to do -- put this aside.</span> <span id="s130">However, later on we did use for slightly better stuff, slightly better occasions, this china.</span> <span id="s131">And one day -- by that time the government in exile had -- from Yugoslavia, had left London or some parts of it and were in London -- were in New York.</span> <span id="s132">And as ours was really just about the only family --</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Intact.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: -- intact, and you know, we didn’t live in a -- in a hotel, all of these guys whose wives were left either in Zagreb or in Belgrade and whatever, would congregate and come and have coffee with us and -- and kugelhupf and things like that.</span> <span id="s135">And by -- I don’t know, this wasn’t at the time, yet maybe it was, that Albina Padovan had come from -- no, I’d -- I’m -- I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s136">Anyhow, we were having, I remember as today, there were about five or six various ministers of one kind or another.</span> <span id="s137">One of them was the minister of -- of the post office, who was a -- who -- who -- who had gone to the -- to a -- to a Franciscan seminary, but who became the minister of, as I said, of the post -- of post offices in th -- and was a friend, very close friend of my father’s from childhood days.</span> <span id="s138">So he was there, and then there was a guy by the name of Gavrilovic who was a -- who was the Minister of Finance.</span> <span id="s139">He hadn’t a been, but I’m -- I think he was pre-war, pre -- pre-war, I think he was the -- a congressman in Belgrade.</span> <span id="s140">That was Gavrilovic.</span> <span id="s141">And there were several others.</span> <span id="s142">And then there were some people, some refugees who had meanwhile come from Belgrade and -- via Cuba, which was another way that people were coming in.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: And they got into -- and I had -- this was at the time when there was a particularly horrible story going on with Draža Mihailović and -- and -- and -- and -- and Tito.</span> <span id="s145">And it was at the time when the Germans were killing every 10th child or every 10th male in one of the cities.</span> <span id="s146">And I remember coming back from work and they’re s-standing there and suddenly they got into a horrible fight.</span> <span id="s147">One was with a cake knife and the other had his -- had the -- a chair, trying to ward off -- I -- I don’t remember who was doing what.</span> <span id="s148">One of them fainted, and my mother and I just disappeared into the maid’s room and locked ourselves up because we didn’t want to be part of this whole story.</span> <span id="s149">And in the process one -- one of the cups got broken.</span> <span id="s150">So it’s not an absolute --</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Perfect set.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: -- [indecipherable] set.</span> <span id="s153">So -- so, you know, we must have been -- this wasn’t an unusual thing, they were there a lot of the time and so that necklace, one of the things.</span> <span id="s154">And then when we opened this -- this case with the set -- with -- with -- they had between it, and I may still have some, little flannel dividers with embroidery, hand embroidery around it.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: You know, it -- it was just --</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Heartbreaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: -- heartbreaking.</span> <span id="s159">It was awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: But I don’t even think -- this became heartbreaking later to me, th-this -- this was still all in the process, okay --</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: -- so you know, maybe they’re somewhere else.</span> <span id="s164">We didn’t know yet what really was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Yeah, and did -- these men were coming -- you knew what was going on, because you were in touch with these people whose lives and livelihoods were very tied up with what was happening there.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: So you were on the edge of --</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: -- knowledge.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: Was it the assumption at that moment in time that you were gonna go back?</span> <span id="s172">Was this a temporary situation for you?</span> <span id="s173">A: It was a temporary situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: It was so much a temporary situation that I actually thought when I was -- married Morris, that he was going back on his job and I was going with him.</span> <span id="s176">And then he had to resign and [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Well, you’re jumping ahead a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: So your -- your -- your mother and father were assuming that we will maybe stay here --</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: -- til things blew over and --</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: -- maybe -- maybe a fe -- years, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: -- we’re going to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s188">Tell me about your job, this job that you got.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: The job was the -- the organization at that time was called coordinator of information, and Elmer Davis was the head, the director and whatever you would call it.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: And at that time I guess there was some broadcasting going on, but I had very little to do with it.</span> <span id="s192">What I did was, I was in something called the media analysis section and with me it mostly consisted of sitting in the public library in New York doing research on the number of speakers of [indecipherable] or -- or -- or -- or Serbian or whatever.</span> <span id="s193">But I remember mostly it was African and -- and -- and -- and Asian languages.</span> <span id="s194">I wasn't terribly good at it, but anyhow I did do it.</span> <span id="s195">And then this mo -- merfed -- morphed, is the word, morphed into a -- into the -- first it was called -- this was only called va -- as I said, coordinator -- coordinator of information and then it became -- it wasn’t still Voice of America, forget what it was called.</span> <span id="s196">It was -- that was an in between thing.</span> <span id="s197">My husband was in the same building and I didn’t know him at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: And this was in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: This was in New York, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: There wa -- there -- there was broadcasting going on mostly from London, and there was a man who was a Serb who had lived -- a Yugoslav, but he was a Serb, who had lived in Paris and had been doing broadcasting in a very interesting way.</span> <span id="s202">We always listened to him in Zagreb, pro-allies and so on.</span> <span id="s203">And as the French -- he finally got evacuated and left -- and ended up in New York and continued broadcasting from -- not Voice of America, but what was the pla -- I’m trying to think of what it was called, it wasn’t -- it was - it was not yet Voice of America, it was coordinator of information.</span> <span id="s204">Office of War Information --</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Uh-huh, of course, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: -- was what it was called, yeah, okay.</span> <span id="s207">So within the Office of War Information, then we got Voice of America.</span> <span id="s208">Morris was in a totally different thing and I didn’t even know he -- he existed.</span> <span id="s209">So this Serbian broadcaster ended up in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Was this Petrovich?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Yes, it was Peter Petrovich.</span> <span id="s212">How did you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: From your other interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Aha.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: You me -- you mentioned his name, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s217">So s -- Peter Petrovich, who was quite -- I mean, he was very royalist and so on, but at that time there was nothing else.</span> <span id="s218">I mean, they a -- we just had started hearing slowly that there were two movements going on in Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s219">So anyhow, I at -- I was -- my job was translating -- I think he -- I don’t know whether it was a 15 minute broadcast or longer, half hour, it seemed endless, I’ll tell you that.</span> <span id="s220">I was given -- he would -- he would provide a script.</span> <span id="s221">And I had to translate that script and this all went into broadcast control or whatever it was called.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: From Croatian to English?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: From Serbian to English, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: He didn’t speak English, or he didn’t -- he would read it --</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: First of all he didn’t speak English, but certainly he wouldn’t have bothered translating.</span> <span id="s226">I mean he was -- he was something of a -- of a star.</span> <span id="s227">And he probably would have been bad anyhow.</span> <span id="s228">I was -- I was employed there, okay, what are we going to let her do?</span> <span id="s229">At that time I think I was working for something called the Balkan section that was being run by a -- first by an Albanian, and then by a Greek, there were no Yugoslavs in left or right, except for me.</span> <span id="s230">And I translate at -- at the -- get this material and -- and in -- I would get it maybe the night before, I’m not quite sure.</span> <span id="s231">Come in in the morning, I would trans -- I would read it and then I’d translate it and I would -- this was then submitted and then he would do his thing.</span> <span id="s232">So one day he got very sick, he got pneumonia, but they didn’t want to stop the broadcasts and he didn’t want to stop the broadcasts.</span> <span id="s233">And he wrote the fine scripts and I translated them and I voiced them, saying that I was doing this, you know, in the name of, and it always ended with long live his highness, kin -- King Peter of Yugoslavia, along with the -- Draža Mihailović, I mean, that whole event.</span> <span id="s234">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: I’m going to see how we’re doing.</span> <span id="s236">Okay, we have a couple more minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: So this -- this -- this was it.</span> <span id="s238">So then finally a section, a Serbo-Croatian section was se-set up and a very nice person by the name of Milan Hatzuk, who was a -- originally from Zagreb, but who had worked as a journalist in Belgrade for awhile.</span> <span id="s239">And I don’t know when he came to the States, I think before we did -- who was there and got the job.</span> <span id="s240">He was not an American citizen yet, but almost.</span> <span id="s241">All of us were, you know, sort of -- nobody knew what was going to go, we were we -- some of us were -- of course, I mean, I -- I was about to become an American citizen, I had, you know, first papers and the works --</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: -- and so on, so I had very little problems, but we had to be supervised by an American and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: And there were -- yeah, yeah, which I thought was fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s247">Was it -- w-was it fun work?</span> <span id="s248">Did i -- did you really -- did you like it?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Did you feel a sense of --</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: -- importance in -- in it?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s254">Then they had a women’s program finally.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Which was kind of fun, which I th -- which I actually heard from friends who had heard that I was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s257">I always felt that it was pretty stupid stuff because -- because, you know, people really did expose themselves.</span> <span id="s258">They could have been killed for listening.</span> <span id="s259">This -- this was -- this was a very funny thing.</span> <span id="s260">This was done -- some of them I did, but they weren’t very interesting.</span> <span id="s261">I mean, some suggestions they had, fairly boring.</span> <span id="s262">[indecipherable] I used supposedly for interest for women.</span> <span id="s263">It was very hard to find any -- whoever was at that time I think was a secretary of -- of labor, a woman in the States [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Perkins.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Perkins.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: And a number of things of that kind.</span> <span id="s268">You know, you tried to do something that wasn’t really just stupid, and did it.</span> <span id="s269">And this was -- this was beamed to BBC.</span> <span id="s270">And then BBC several hours later would -- would beam it --</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: -- to Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s273">And as I said I heard from friends who had heard me and so on, although I didn’t go by my name.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: What name did you use?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Sorell.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: S-o-r-e-l-l.</span> <span id="s280">So then -- which is the name that my brother then --</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: -- [indecipherable] And this was kind of fun.</span> <span id="s283">It was am-amusing because I would come to me -- I would come home and then I would turn on the BBC, I could hear myself several hours later, but at that ti -- you know, and then we had these things of -- of -- of dictation speed because of sunspots.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: You couldn’t broadcast --</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: -- at a normal speed.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Very slow, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: [indecipherable] very slowly and then there were things that had to be in -- there were some things that were worthwhile.</span> <span id="s290">You would -- you would broadcast, you would hear, for instance, when there was some kind of important action back, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: And you would have reference to it so that they would know that one knows here that this is going on [indecipherable] business.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s294">Let me turn this tape over.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: So the na -- the nature of these broadcasts that you were doing, even though they were women’s programs --</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: -- you would somehow weave into them war news?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Because you weren't allowed to directly broadcast war news?</span> <span id="s302">Can you explain that situation, or what --</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Not really, because I -- I think it was mostly intimations of -- you would say the -- the brave fighters in such and such a place, that so on, so on, one is aware of it, or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Th-There were intima -- there wa -- there was no direct stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: So finally tha -- I mean, this was part of the stuff that I was doing.</span> <span id="s308">Meanwhile there was a very nice Yugoslav desk that was set up that had a Slovene, a -- the -- the head of the desk, who was this very nice guy from Bel -- originally from Zagreb, but then later in -- who was a journalist in Belgrade, his name was Hatzuk.</span> <span id="s309">And then there was a very old lady and she seemed even much older than that.</span> <span id="s310">She was the mother of a very famous ballerina here, by the name of Pasha Mira.</span> <span id="s311">And -- a Yugoslav, bu -- good, I mean, well-known.</span> <span id="s312">And she had been the wife of what originally was the [speaks foreign language here] which would be the director of the main Zagreb theater -- well [indecipherable] let’s say th-the equivalent of the director of -- of the Kennedy Center, because everything took place there, drama and comedy and -- and everything.</span> <span id="s313">So, very old lady, who had been in the States for awhile, and she was supposed to be translating and she was not very good.</span> <span id="s314">And then we did future stories of unbelievable boredom to me.</span> <span id="s315">And then other things and y-you used to have -- of course you -- you had a headline thing, and then you had a feature and then you had another feature and so on.</span> <span id="s316">So for awhile I was -- I was the announcer of, you know, I was the in-between person, you know, you have ju -- you have heard Voice of America, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Okay, that kind of business.</span> <span id="s319">And -- and I was translating.</span> <span id="s320">I was doing a little bit of writing and I was doing a lot of translating because whatever we did -- this was on ditto paper, have you ever seen ditto paper?</span> <span id="s321">It was ab -- obnoxious stuff that was blue, here.</span> <span id="s322">And you would type on that and then this was taken to some kind of a machine and that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Oh right, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s326">Copy paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: And all my pants and everything that I wore was blue.</span> <span id="s328">Underwear, everything was -- you couldn’t get -- nails.</span> <span id="s329">Terrible.</span> <span id="s330">Then a very nice woman -- okay, excuse me.</span> <span id="s331">[tape break] What can I tell you?</span> <span id="s332">[indecipherable] Okay, so then a very nice woman by the name of Mary Vucedic came in.</span> <span id="s333">Mary Vucedic had been working for whom I had met in Zagreb, who was a few years older than me -- not quite a few years older than me, who died recently in New York, who was married to a Croat, who worked as [indecipherable] a Croat aristocrat, Lemaniti Vucedic, who [indecipherable] her to the nth degree and finally she got divorced.</span> <span id="s334">And then we -- you know, we went through all of these terrible things.</span> <span id="s335">Her father was killed in a -- in Rome in one of the prisons in Rome, in [indecipherable] was that big -- can you imagine giving that name to a -- to -- to a prison?</span> <span id="s336">Okay.</span> <span id="s337">So that’s where he was killed.</span> <span id="s338">He’s an older gentleman.</span> <span id="s339">Her mother survived and I don’t know how, she was a very unpleasant and very demanding German Jewish person.</span> <span id="s340">Then there was -- finally we got somebody by -- by the name of Robert Rosenberg, who had been in the U.S. Army.</span> <span id="s341">How he got there, from Tusili in Bosnia, he ended up in the United States Army and was -- I think he got TB or whatever, he was demobilized.</span> <span id="s342">And he appeared in our midst and we were told, this is a veteran, you give him a job whatever he does.</span> <span id="s343">And I will not say that he was -- he was illiterate, but he wasn’t very good either.</span> <span id="s344">He was no intellectual.</span> <span id="s345">And he -- but, he spoke absolutely classical, beautiful Croatian, which he spoke [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: All of those nice places in Bosnia, I mean, gorgeous.</span> <span id="s348">And all of us sort of had -- Zagreb does not have a very nice dialect.</span> <span id="s349">And although you spoke standard Serbo-Croatian, it comes through, you can tell where people are from.</span> <span id="s350">Then there was a th -- this -- our boss spoke Serbian, although he wasn’t a Serb, but he had lived in Belgrade for many times.</span> <span id="s351">Then there was a Slovene who had his own broadcast and he tried to keep as far away from us as he could, and -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: S-Some things never change.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Some things never change.</span> <span id="s354">And -- but he -- he was okay.</span> <span id="s355">But as I said, wa -- then there was somebody, a middle aged Croat, he seemed very old to me at that time, by the name of Gospodin Katosic.</span> <span id="s356">And he later became the head of the desk because Herzog decided to join Encyclopedia Britannica films, and did that.</span> <span id="s357">Which was very smart.</span> <span id="s358">And this went on for awhile, and always the same stuff and so on.</span> <span id="s359">Very -- not interesting at all, but very hard.</span> <span id="s360">And then later there were various young men that took me out.</span> <span id="s361">One, you know -- and I’m just thinking of what -- there was somebody by the name of Duncan McDougal junior from the -- from way up in the mountains of North Carolina, whose a great, great -- actually, he was th -- my first boss when -- in the media analysis section.</span> <span id="s362">And he knew a great deal about jazz, so he would take me to the village [indecipherable] and all of these nice things and taught me a lot of stuff like that.</span> <span id="s363">And I’m just thinking now, two o’clock in the morning he would put me -- and I never thought anything about it, nor did my parents, on the subway in New York, I would go all the way to almost the Bronx there, and then I would take a shuttle bus to the house and it would be three o’clock in the morning when I came to work, and i -- nobody even thought that this might not be very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s365">Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: That’s how safe New York was.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s368">Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: And then I had a very wonderful friend there whose husband -- whose second husband ma -- later became the Polish ambassador to the United States, and he was in the U.N. with a very high job, and he was am-ambassador in London and so on.</span> <span id="s370">And she and I would walk through Central Park West at 11 o’clock at -- I mean, through Central Park at the -- in the middle of the night, from 47 -- I mean from -- what was the address on Broadway and a -- and -- and 57th Street to her place, she was somewhere near, I don’t know, 72nd Street and who knows where on the West Side.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Is that where the OWI offices were?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: 57th and Broadway.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: And you met your husband there?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Yes, in a strange way.</span> <span id="s379">He had come on leave and he came to tell us he was working for -- well, it wasn’t e -- it wasn’t Voice of America, and wasn’t -- well, i-it was OWI in a way, but it -- they were attached to OSS, I believe, and so they were in uniform, these guys.</span> <span id="s380">And he --</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: OSS, a precursor to CIA.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: They were doing Intelligence work in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s387">I don’t think he wa -- at least he never told me, maybe he was.</span> <span id="s388">I’m not asking.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Anyhow, and he --</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Don’t ask him, don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s393">And he came to tell us how w -- how our broadcast works -- were -- were -- were deemed by the Serbs, by the locals one way or another, what we should do one way or another and so on.</span> <span id="s394">By that time I was engaged to somebody very funny by the name of Raven McDavid, junior, whose father at the time was the -- what was he -- was -- he was -- he wasn’t the governor of South Carolina, but the first one under, what was the name of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Lieutenant governor?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Yeah, Lieutenant governor.</span> <span id="s397">And I had gone there to visit and -- and I was taken to [indecipherable] to meet the governor and so on, I was very embarrassed [indecipherable] was terrible.</span> <span id="s398">Anyhow, I was enga -- I was -- I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: You were engaged.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: I was engaged.</span> <span id="s401">I had gone there with my uncle, officially, to Greenville, South Carolina and so on and I didn’t even [indecipherable] the assembled guests at this -- it wasn’t a banquet, it was serious dinner with the na -- with the guys ex-nanny serving with white gloves still, around, and then after the dinner he drove her home to her place.</span> <span id="s402">It was a very strange thing.</span> <span id="s403">He was a very good scholar, he was an excellent scholar and he married somebody at the University of Chicago and I’m sure this was much better than anything he could have had with me.</span> <span id="s404">Plus, my mother couldn’t stand him.</span> <span id="s405">Okay, and anyhow I was -- I was going to marry this guy, and then, you know, Morris turned up and we -- we were both thinking we were going to go back together to Belgrade, he knew a bunch of people, you know, he kept mentioning, that I had known there.</span> <span id="s406">And told us what we did right, what we did wrong and then we started going out and we thought we were going back, and then of course it was impossible.</span> <span id="s407">I couldn’t and he -- he quit because I couldn’t go back and then he started working -- or no -- or -- or -- or trying to find jobs in various other places.</span> <span id="s408">But he was there -- he -- he had gone to Bari, that’s where he was mostly -- no, that’s where he-he was in Bar -- fi-first he was in Algiers.</span> <span id="s409">He had flown to Algiers and then they bought up these various broadcast stations and did leaflets and stuff [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s410">And God, when you think how young they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: What year did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: 1946, I believe it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: ’46.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: And -- and what -- wha-what did he settle on?</span> <span id="s416">What work did he finally take up?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: He couldn’t find a job.</span> <span id="s418">It was very, very difficult to find a job.</span> <span id="s419">He was told by several people to change his name.</span> <span id="s420">This was a very difficult time for -- there was a lot of social discrimination.</span> <span id="s421">We had one of the most awful things that he kept blaming himself and [indecipherable] just awful.</span> <span id="s422">About a year or so, I mean a year and a half, my mother was still in mourning and so [indecipherable] had been sick and friends of ours, non-Jews had told us why don’t you go t -- so and so in Tennessee, there was a very nice country hotel in the -- and by that time I was married already -- go up there.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: In mourning for your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Then we got there and when we signed in they said they didn’t have any room.</span> <span id="s427">And I -- we had to restrain Morris, he wanted to go and, you know, strangle this poor pe -- person at the desk.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: But we didn’t, and finally, you know we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: But that was that and then you know, there were -- there were -- there were ads in the papers for -- that weren’t o-o -- I mean, they were obvious to who wanted to know, people that -- we at first didn't understand what this was about and if it -- it would say, I don’t know, apartment for rent, so and so, close to Protestant church or close to such and such a place, or close -- you know, that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s432">And some were more obvious, you know, Christians only, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Even in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s435">But I -- you know, it wasn’t very hard to find a place in New York where -- where it was okay to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: And -- but this is something I had never, never, never in my life experienced, ever, ever --</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: I know, it’s so amazing, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: -- ever.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: It was so interesting to me in your last interview --</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: -- Joan asked you time and time again --</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: -- had you felt discrimination.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: It’s so interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: Never.</span> <span id="s450">This was completely integrated, school, social life, whatever you want.</span> <span id="s451">There was always -- the odd thing, the only person that I had ever heard of anything happening like that was a cousin of ma -- not a cousin, a second cousin of mine, we -- you know, I guess one heard there were things going on, possibly because this was such an old family, totally integrated, both on my mother’s and my father’s side and -- and maybe I don’t like the -- the -- the word, you know, it’s none -- the word is not important, but the powerful.</span> <span id="s452">I hate to say it but these were people who could probably -- no-nobody would have dared to do it directly to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Maybe that’s the reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: I -- I -- I don’t know, I -- I -- but it wasn’t, I mean I have other friends and -- and th-these are people, non-Jewish friends whom I’ve had from the word from when I was three years old, and never occurred to them, to me, to anybody that anything might be different.</span> <span id="s457">That -- also I had been to -- and -- and my parents also, so it’s not my generation.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: So this was very, very unusual --</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: -- to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: And when -- when you and Morris first got married and your parents were still living in New York, what was your -- did you know -- did you socialize with a lot of Jewish people, did you go to synagogue?</span> <span id="s463">Was it -- was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: No, never?</span> <span id="s466">Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: No, never, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: I think it was important -- I’m sure it was important to Morris’s family that he married a Jewish person, but they didn't quite know.</span> <span id="s472">They -- they -- they didn’t understand really, who we were.</span> <span id="s473">I mean, we lived in very integrated society.</span> <span id="s474">And I -- there was recently at the museum a very nice guy from Israel who had -- he must have had a very, very high position in Israel now because everybody was running around him like he was really somebody important.</span> <span id="s475">And he -- we found out that he had been in Zagreb the -- this is another thing that has very little to do with me, but in a way maybe it’s interesting.</span> <span id="s476">He came from a place called Gradisca originally, which is in the Burgenland, which is on the border of Slovenia and Austria.</span> <span id="s477">And it is populated mostly by people who were -- who came, I don’t know in which century, probably in the 17th or 18th century from a very poor part of Croatia to this area.</span> <span id="s478">It’s on the border, sort of Austria, Slovenia, Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s481">And they’re always -- they kept their national costume and they kept their songs and they used to go around all over the -- all over cro -- Yugoslavia and in other places to sing.</span> <span id="s482">These were well known minorities who, after I don’t know how many centuries still kept their language and everything else.</span> <span id="s483">So this gentleman from Israel tells me that he originally came from there.</span> <span id="s484">His father had a factory in this Burgenland and he told me the name of the town, I think is Firestaat, I’m not quite sure what it was.</span> <span id="s485">And he was a refugee with his family in Zagreb and they were very Orthodox and he told me about -- they had a separate synagogue, they had the separate -- it wasn’t a synagogue, it was a separate place where they went to pray or they had that -- I had no idea these people existed.</span> <span id="s486">I had absolutely no idea.</span> <span id="s487">In the Jewish school where I went, my grade school was the Jewish school in Zagreb, there were a few Sephardim, very few.</span> <span id="s488">And there were -- I suspect from the same family --</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: From Bosnia?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: The Sephardim were from Bosnia --</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: Yeah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: -- originally, I’m sure.</span> <span id="s493">I can’t imagine any other place.</span> <span id="s494">But some Orthodox Jews, because I know that the boys were -- wore pants and I think they wore a hat, or a -- or a -- or a [indecipherable] or whatever.</span> <span id="s495">They were very, very poor.</span> <span id="s496">These were from around Zagreb somewhere and they were dressed -- I will not say that they -- they weren't -- you know, they were wearing jackets, what kids would wear, lederhosen, God forbid.</span> <span id="s497">They would wear some jackets and so on and now when I look at these pictures I see how they’re really quite distinct.</span> <span id="s498">And apparently these people had a -- had a -- not a synagogue, certainly a place where they gathered and so on.</span> <span id="s499">So this gentleman now from -- from -- who came from Israel was telling me about that.</span> <span id="s500">By the way, the museum was fantastically helpful to him.</span> <span id="s501">They found some books that -- about stuff that his father had told him originally, and he never could check it out and he saw it, tears were going down his face, I mean, it was just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s502">But this gentleman told me that he had class and that they were very religious, although not wearing any kind of garb, and that he -- he had the different rabbi.</span> <span id="s503">I mean, he didn't know about our rabbis, and so -- he was a child there and so on.</span> <span id="s504">Now what I found out later about these peoples -- about this -- this place, Gradisca, which now is Austria, is that they had parallel city governments, they had a parallel Jewish and non-Jewish police, a parallel Jewish and non-Jewish fire brigade and various other things like that.</span> <span id="s505">So during various holidays they would spell each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: So an -- I had no idea about that --</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: I’ve not heard of such a thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: -- he told me that.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s513">Now, this is --</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: I also didn’t even know that there were that many Jews there.</span> <span id="s515">I remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: -- you know, I can think of Croats and singing and folk costumes, but apparently there was a very, very large Jewish community in that place.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: Strange.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s521">It’s interesting that you were in New York at that time, where so many Jews had come from eastern Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: And you know, starting life all over.</span> <span id="s524">And -- and you didn't know that many Jews, and you didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: It’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: On the other hand, there was a very nice auth -- actually, I -- I did know, I mean, this guy, this Polish person who -- who was a -- who -- who was a partner of my father, they had come -- but I think they had come earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: And they were not -- they were not Orthodox or anything like that.</span> <span id="s530">In fact, the daughter married somebody, a very, very Conservative person, whose name I can’t remember now, who I think is either at Harvard or Princeton who -- who you hear every once in awhile, I -- I’ll think of the name.</span> <span id="s531">But no, they -- yeah, then in New York there was a wonderful pastry shop called Elite.</span> <span id="s532">Th -- I think it -- yeah, Elite.</span> <span id="s533">The -- Elite was on 72nd Street between, I think Broadway and whatever the next street was, and that’s where everybody got together from various parts of -- these were central Europeans, they were not eastern Europeans.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: They were Germans, Austrians, Yugoslavs, maybe Czechs.</span> <span id="s536">And that Austro-Hungarian pastry was what was --</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Attracted them.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: -- trac -- was there, and I guess maybe the owners were there and large coffees with heaps of whipped cream and so on.</span> <span id="s539">They have disappeared.</span> <span id="s540">And they all read, including my father and so on, was a -- an -- a newspaper called The Aufbau.</span> <span id="s541">Have you heard about that?</span> <span id="s542">It’s a very interesting -- it was a paper people were looking -- first of all it was political, it was very interesting politically.</span> <span id="s543">And secondly you would find ads.</span> <span id="s544">People looking and looking for so and so from such and such a place, anybody know whether this person survived or not.</span> <span id="s545">This went on for years --</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: -- years.</span> <span id="s548">And lots of very liberal editorials and so on.</span> <span id="s549">I don’t know whether it still exists, but it was called The Aufbau.</span> <span id="s550">And as I said, they all sat around waiting for better times, yeah.</span> <span id="s551">I’m not quite sure when we started hearing about -- about -- really.</span> <span id="s552">We knew about concentration camps, but we didn’t know about killing camps until fairly late.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Later than we should.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: ’45 -- ’44 --</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: -- ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s559">And there weren’t any, as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s560">I mean, maybe there were, but they were -- they were -- it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s562">You got married in ’46?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: And what [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Do you?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: No, I don’t, mm-mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: One of my daughters doesn’t want.</span> <span id="s568">Didn’t want and doesn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: The other one has two.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s572">So what was your early -- the early years of your marriage?</span> <span id="s573">What did your husband end up doing and where did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: We first lived with my parents for a very short time.</span> <span id="s575">Then we moved one house fur -- one apartment building further on, in a studio on Riverside Drive.</span> <span id="s576">We were there, I’m not quite sure h-how long.</span> <span id="s577">My husband was trying to find a job, didn’t find a job, he -- my father was, I think, hoping that he would be maybe a businessman, which was the -- the -- the mo -- two times that he -- he tried, it was disastrous, and he was very unhappy, and so that never -- one of them, unbelievably, was with a guy who -- who made Desenex, if you know what that is.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Oh [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Okay, you can imagine what fun that was.</span> <span id="s580">But at that time it was just beginning, they’re probably making millions now.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s583">That wasn’t quite his thing.</span> <span id="s584">Then my uncle got involved -- do you remember L’il Abner?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Do you remember the shmoos?</span> <span id="s587">Shmoos were little fat things that would -- that would swoon and fall on the st -- on -- on -- just to please you and you could eat them, and that made them very happy, or whatever.</span> <span id="s588">So my uncle started -- I don’t know how he got -- I think he got connected with Al Capp somehow, and Al C -- my uncle who was a lawyer, who by that time had come from Cuba -- via Cuba, let’s put it.</span> <span id="s589">He started the shmoo business and they had little boxes with shmoos on it and a tiny little, you know, s -- s -- candy in the little boxes, and I don’t know, you know, these little rings, or little -- little charms, or whatever, were stuck in there.</span> <span id="s590">And this went for awhile, and they didn’t do very well, can you well -- you can well imagine it.</span> <span id="s591">Then this fell apart and one of the people who had meanwhile come from Yugoslavia, via I’m not sure how, not easily, had come -- who -- who was an extremely well-off person.</span> <span id="s592">If I tell you that he owned the salt monopoly in Yugoslavia --</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: -- and various other odds and ends like that.</span> <span id="s595">And he had two sons, one of them was a year, maybe two -- no, two years older than me, who -- one time I think the families may have thought we’d get married, but neither he ever wanted to, or I -- I mean wa -- not even.</span> <span id="s596">And we were constantly having -- we were -- we were always trying to outdo each other in one thing or another and th-this started when we were quite small and we were both riding, and we were supposed to -- to have a -- have a -- I don’t know, a trial for a -- for a horse show.</span> <span id="s597">And, I think I was maybe 11 then and we had -- my mother was in Vienna at the time and I had gone with a man na -- not with a man, he was the governors by that time, to this place where -- where we -- we were supposed -- supposed to practice by jump -- not jumping, but various other odds and ends.</span> <span id="s598">And there was this very beautiful horse that was very unpleasant, very obstreperous and very -- not very good.</span> <span id="s599">And this -- he said he wouldn’t -- he wasn’t even thinking of riding this horse, and I was -- and I was going to do some up -- one-upsmanship, I said I would.</span> <span id="s600">And I did, and I had an absolutely horrible fall, they thought I would have had broken everything, I had a -- I had a problem.</span> <span id="s601">In -- in fact, I think I ha -- since that time I have problems with my -- not with memory, but with other things.</span> <span id="s602">It took -- nothing was broken.</span> <span id="s603">It was an unbelievable thing, but nothing did.</span> <span id="s604">And then this -- his father, the salt monopoly person, who I think by that time had changed his religion, decided to -- to go to the synagogue because it hadn’t -- it was me and not his son who had gotten that fall.</span> <span id="s605">And -- and -- and what else did he do?</span> <span id="s606">Yeah, and he didn’t eat on Saturday until noon, or some other kind of thing like that.</span> <span id="s607">But we’ve always been friends.</span> <span id="s608">So anyhow, this guy arrived with a lot of money and he eventually got a -- not a lot, well, back some money.</span> <span id="s609">Not quite as well as we did, because he -- they were much, much better off than we were.</span> <span id="s610">In fact, their house in Zagreb now is the German embassy residence.</span> <span id="s611">No, Austrian, Austrian.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: Austrian.</span> <span id="s614">And the guy lives in New York and is in not very good shape.</span> <span id="s615">But anyhow, my father s -- decided this is such a wonderful businessman, that Morris, who is such a miserable businessman, but does speak English and does have connections and so on, and certainly knows the south, we went to Athens, Georgia, and they bought -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lucie Rosenberg.</span> <span id="s617">This is tape number two, side A. Okay, so you -- you went with this fellow who came --</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: -- to Athens --</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: -- his name was [indecipherable] and there were -- there were quotas that were available for -- I think it was peanut oil, mostly peanut oil.</span> <span id="s621">There were great shortages in the States and these people had this oil at -- what you would call it?</span> <span id="s622">Not a factory, it was -- it was a plant.</span> <span id="s623">And then they would homogenize some and then he would buy futures, you know, like -- like huge con -- railroad containers worth of stuff.</span> <span id="s624">And then if you were smart you made a lot of money, but they lost a lot of money.</span> <span id="s625">Drove my husband up the wall and my father was absolutely convinced that this very smart businessman would do it and this very nice person who could, you know, talk to other people, could do anything, fell apart.</span> <span id="s626">Morris felt awful.</span> <span id="s627">We lived in Atlanta for about a year and a half, I believe, at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s629">Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: I believe then we came back to New York and I became pregnant.</span> <span id="s631">Were -- we were -- we lived in a -- a project -- my mother said it was a project, it’s supposedly very sheik, you know, it was a -- was something called Fresh Meadows, somewhere in a -- not too far, let’s say, from LaGuardia airport, I would think that [indecipherable] and so on.</span> <span id="s632">And still he couldn’t find a job and so on.</span> <span id="s633">And then we -- by that time my family in Venezuela said to Morris -- oh, and then there were several, again, suggestions, want you to change your name.</span> <span id="s634">And he refused to do that and my -- up -- people at various places made this suggestion.</span> <span id="s635">Well meaning, you know, nobody unpleasant.</span> <span id="s636">He said no, he wouldn’t, his father had come with his -- this name and, no.</span> <span id="s637">And he didn't want to find himself in a position where he would, you know, not represent himself [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: He is -- he is so scrupulously honest it’s unbelievable, my husband.</span> <span id="s640">I -- I -- I can sometimes tell a lie if it’s necessary.</span> <span id="s641">Not a lie, but a, you know, a social lie, so -- but he can’t, he is straight arrow.</span> <span id="s642">And -- as, by the way, are both my daughters.</span> <span id="s643">I don’t know that I’m devious, but under circumstances I guess I could tell a lie.</span> <span id="s644">You know, not -- not -- not for everyday use --</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: -- but I could.</span> <span id="s647">So then -- my cousins by that time were in Venezuela.</span> <span id="s648">They had come via concentration camps in Italy, and for about a year or so.</span> <span id="s649">I don’t know how long they were in Spain and my father got them visas.</span> <span id="s650">They were going to go on further, I think, I’m not quite sure where in South America, but they stayed there and they did very, very well, extremely well.</span> <span id="s651">And at the time the place was really starting to move, and they asked my husband to come and see if there’s anything he would like to do there.</span> <span id="s652">He did and we -- I came over and then he -- the AP person was kicked out because he wrote something about the -- the person who was the dictator then.</span> <span id="s653">And then they asked my husband to take his place, which he did and then later he turned, he -- he was running a -- he and another guy, whose husband was -- whose son was just recently with Bremer, asked for him and he was in -- in [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s654">A very nice guy by the name of Horand.</span> <span id="s655">He and Morris then were running an English language page in one of the local papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: And then a -- he was doing, he was working for a fee and --</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Was this Caracas?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: It was in Caracas.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s661">And you had a baby by then?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: By -- we -- I had gone with a baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: With a, I think, nine months old baby, with Jane.</span> <span id="s665">And my aunt was there and my cousin who is the nearest relative I now have, she’s two and a half years younger than I am, who had married a guy from Belgrade.</span> <span id="s666">A sephard -- Sephardi -- but, oddly enough he was told by at -- it’s a very interesting thing with -- his name is Pinkas and when we -- when he got -- you know, when -- when his sons started -- went to the Jewish schooling -- where, by the way, my Jane also went for awhile, was a very good school.</span> <span id="s667">He -- the director of the school said, listen, nobody called Pinkas is a s -- originally a Sephardi, how did this happen?</span> <span id="s668">So what probably happened was that the mother was Sephardic and the father married into the family so all the --</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: Kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: -- not all the ki -- all the -- all the customs and the food and everything was Sephardic and he considered himself Sephardic.</span> <span id="s671">I mean, he had [indecipherable] I guess.</span> <span id="s672">But he also said that when he came from the concentration camp to Madrid -- I think they came [indecipherable] to Madrid, that it was incredible.</span> <span id="s673">That it smelled like in his mother’s kitchen, that the food had the same names as in his mother’s kitchen, that it all tasted like that, it was totally familiar.</span> <span id="s674">They did very well, and he is su -- they’re very charitable, they’ve given money left and right and he has now paid for the publication of an extremely interesting [indecipherable] now it’s the second volume, a book -- a book called “Mismo Prezimali,” “We Survived.”</span> <span id="s675">And it’s a -- it’s a collection of stories of people from all over, from Croatia, from serv -- Serbia, from everywhere, who survived various camps and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: And what’s their family name?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: Pinkas.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Pinkas.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: P-i-n-k-a-s.</span> <span id="s680">His name is -- his -- his real name is Haim, but he was never known as anything but Milat.</span> <span id="s681">And her name is Mia, Maria.</span> <span id="s682">So -- and her -- her maiden name was Mueller.</span> <span id="s683">And -- which, by the way was the name of one of our archbishops in Zagreb.</span> <span id="s684">And she -- so they -- they had first once and then the second son and I -- my -- my second daughter was born while we were in Caracas, Mary.</span> <span id="s685">Partly in -- called Mary for Maria my cousin, Mia and my brother, who was Mario, and a very good friend, a Serbian friend who was there, who was Mara Sajonski, was also Maria, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: What year was the second one born?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: ’56.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: In Caracas.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: And I love her birth certificate, which is in Spanish.</span> <span id="s692">And it starts off by saying, this day of so and so presented himself before me Morris Rosenberg, a -- a citizen of the United States who claims to be the father of --</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Claims to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s695">[reads Spanish] and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: Right, right, who says he is the father.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Great.</span> <span id="s699">How long did you stay then, in -- in Venezuela?</span> <span id="s700">He was working as a journalist.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: He was working -- I’m trying to think exactly how many years we were there, quite a few.</span> <span id="s702">By that time my mother had died.</span> <span id="s703">You know, I don’t know exactly the date, I wil -- forget.</span> <span id="s704">We were in New York when there was some -- oh, then what I didn’t say was that my husband then -- there w -- there was a weekly English language paper, a weekly, called the “Caracas Daily Journal,” which he turned into a daily.</span> <span id="s705">And it’s not the paper th-that -- page that I told you the English page, that was in a place called [indecipherable] I believe.</span> <span id="s706">And we were in New York and there was -- on vacation visiting my father, to -- getting ready to go to New York, to -- to Europe, I believe, when there was some kind of business manipulation and he found out that it wa -- he didn’t want to stay there any more.</span> <span id="s707">They didn’t really oust him, but practically.</span> <span id="s708">There was a reason.</span> <span id="s709">I’m f -- I’m not quite sure how -- how it went, but anyhow, he never went back.</span> <span id="s710">He didn’t ba -- go back for various other reasons, and so on.</span> <span id="s711">And meanwhile, a very good friend of ours who had previously worked for Standard Oil of New Jersey, I believer it was, had been working -- I think he was already in the Ford Foundation and he -- he asked him to join as a director for east we -- east -- for -- it wasn’t east west [indecipherable] I’m not quite sure how.</span> <span id="s712">They started at the -- the Institute of International Education, and he was just started and they started exchanges with the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and they were bringing in scholars and students and so on.</span> <span id="s713">And then he took a group of U.S. governors through a very extensive trip through the Soviet Union, and there was a lot of, you know, brotherhood and such going on.</span> <span id="s714">And then he found that this really bored him terribly because of the director of -- of -- of the Institute of International Education said Morris, why don’t you present -- you know, do a paper on that or give a suggestion on that and he would do it within 48 hours, and the man said you’re supposed to take two months to do that.</span> <span id="s715">You -- you’re making life very hard for the rest of us.</span> <span id="s716">And this went on and on and on like that til finally he -- he wasn’t very happy about that.</span> <span id="s717">I mean, it was extremely interesting, but -- and by that time students were coming in and graduate students mostly from -- from Yugoslavia to Russian, so I was -- I thought it was interesting, but it wasn’t fast enough for him.</span> <span id="s718">So meanwhile, a friend of his at the Associated Press said, wouldn’t you please join our [indecipherable] services?</span> <span id="s719">[indecipherable] time and he said yes.</span> <span id="s720">And then we were in New York til -- again, I can’t tell you everything, we were there for about two years, two and a half years.</span> <span id="s721">They -- and then he had all sorts of, you know, reporting trips all over the world, you know, mostly Latin America.</span> <span id="s722">And after that -- let me quickly think how that would -- okay, they asked him to go to Mexico as bureau chief.</span> <span id="s723">And again, don’t ask me for dates.</span> <span id="s724">Where we were on and off for, I think six or eight years, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: So, sounds like early 60’s you were in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: Yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: In Mexico.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: -- yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s730">Mm.</span> <span id="s731">Your mother’s -- when -- before you -- when you were going out with this English fellow --</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: Your mother was afraid that you were going to go off to the colonies and she was going to lose you.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: I think maybe England more than anything.</span> <span id="s735">The poor guy was, you know [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: But you -- but you ended up traveling all over the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: Yeah, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: But the thing was -- no, no, she thought -- she thought I would be happy in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: My -- all my things that I had left -- I had been in school in England, I had left there wearing that disguise, Mother’s house.</span> <span id="s742">And I got them after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: But he was killed, poor soul --</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: -- in Burma, and it was -- it was pretty sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: I’m sure it wouldn’t have been successful in any way [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s750">So we’re up to the early 60’s, let’s take a break, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Let’s do that.</span> <span id="s753">[tape break] Okay, we’re back.</span> <span id="s754">We’re going to make a little correction here to some of the dates that we’ve been talking about, so go ahead, Lucie.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s756">We arrived in Venezuela in 1950 because Morris couldn’t find any kind of job in New York and I had family there that had just, a few years earlier re -- gotten to Venezuela via camps in Italy, via Spain and then arrived there, I think their destination was somewhere else, but they stopped there and it seemed to have been a very good environment for them in every way.</span> <span id="s757">And Venezuela was really thriving at the time in spite of a very unpleasant dictatorship and -- okay.</span> <span id="s758">It -- it worked.</span> <span id="s759">And as I say, I -- I was some -- not some, but I was quite depressed.</span> <span id="s760">I di -- didn’t speak Spanish.</span> <span id="s761">I helped myself with a little bit of Italian, but there we were and Morris then found a job with -- with Associated Press eventually, and we stayed in Venezuela until 1958.</span> <span id="s762">This was the time when I was teaching English in various places.</span> <span id="s763">It started out the suggestion of a friend of ours who worked for the U.S. government, was at the embassy.</span> <span id="s764">At that time United States was setting up so called bi-national centers throughout Latin America [speaks foreign language here] this [indecipherable] that.</span> <span id="s765">And this particular one at the time was in downtown Caracas in an old, very beautiful colonial house, but obviously not meant for a school.</span> <span id="s766">There was a huge patio with a lovely huge tree in which there was a sloth that would turn up every so often.</span> <span id="s767">And also a Hungarian émigré opened a barba -- opened a steakhouse there.</span> <span id="s768">It was very nice, on one end of it.</span> <span id="s769">And the rest of it around this patio were classes.</span> <span id="s770">And I started giving classes to all Venezuelans of one kind or another.</span> <span id="s771">Also Spaniards who came, who worked, it was very strange, you would have -- for instance you would have Venezuelans who were -- who hardly had an education at all who were very, very talented and learned the language very fast, whereas you had Spaniards who were -- with -- with university degrees who were really having problems in --</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: Hm, with English.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: -- with English.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: And this was going on for awhile among -- there were various American companies that sent their -- their -- their employees that needed to learn the language --</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: -- over to the center.</span> <span id="s778">So after awhile, a large hotel opened up, a -- belonging to an American company, I believe it was Pan American who owned it, but there was a hotel called Tamana -- the hotel was called Tamana Cuentos, the large new hotel in Venezuela.</span> <span id="s779">So these people were coming from the site to this center, which was in the center of town.</span> <span id="s780">And then they decided that this was not good for them and they offered me a contract to simply go to the hotel and sit there and ask the employees, got enough time, they would come and get a class.</span> <span id="s781">So then I invented some kind of very unscientific way of teaching them hotel English.</span> <span id="s782">Because you had to teach a chambermaid something else than you would have to teach a -- I don’t know, a bellboy or something like that, or a waiter, etcetera.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: So I made up a lil -- little -- little classes and little phrasebooks for each one of them and they would come, and was wonderful, in the middle of a patio with lovely flowers around and so on and they just wait for them.</span> <span id="s785">And we found, you know, that if they needed to work, they worked, if they could come, they could come and I kept -- and I had a flat salary and it was really very nice doing it.</span> <span id="s786">This went on for quite awhile, I don’t really remember exactly how -- for how long.</span> <span id="s787">And the rest of the time I had a very nice time with -- my cousins were there, there was a large Yugoslav community of one kind or another there.</span> <span id="s788">Mostly refugees, mostly Jews, but not exclusive -- actually, not at all exclusively, there was a very successful Dalmatian entrepreneur who was building bridges and who was importing cement and so on.</span> <span id="s789">They’re -- they’re still there, they’re very successful still.</span> <span id="s790">He’s in his 80’s, but he still travels back and forth to Yugoslavia [indecipherable] to Croatia, let’s say, probably -- I --I -- he is from southern Dalmatia, I’m almost certain.</span> <span id="s791">And then his sister came, an absolutely gorgeous woman.</span> <span id="s792">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Let me -- let me interrupt you, you had this community, some of whom had a -- so-some of them were relatives, and -- and this is now, we’re talking 10 years or so, after the end of World War II.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: You know, a lot of people that I talk to say that they -- they didn’t talk much about what they’d been through during the war, that these were years when people were just making every effort to starting over and building a new life and that what was past was past and there really wasn’t much talk about it.</span> <span id="s796">Was that your experience?</span> <span id="s797">I mean, you --</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: To a certain extent, not -- not 100 percent.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: I think they talked among each other quite a bit.</span> <span id="s801">This was a very heterogeneous group.</span> <span id="s802">I’m just thinking, for instance, my -- my aunt’s very closest relative was a woman, a Serbian woman from Novi Sad, who lost her son, actually, who drowned in Lake Geneva when there were refugees there.</span> <span id="s803">And then her husband died very fast, so you know, she was absorbed into the community.</span> <span id="s804">Some of them had been in the same camps in Italy.</span> <span id="s805">There -- there was only one woman that I know who had actually been to a very unpleasant, very -- I mean, in the actual killing camp in -- in Germany.</span> <span id="s806">No, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s807">I -- I think they talked.</span> <span id="s808">They didn’t talk -- yeah, th-they -- they -- they talked among each other the most of.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s810">But your experience was quite different from most of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: Yes, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: Because you’d gotten out.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: Yes, I -- I didn’t experience any of that, and I -- truly I -- I -- there was a guilt feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: Did your parents have that feeling too?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s822">I think they thought [indecipherable] may -- maybe to an extent, you know, because my brother was killed, and he was a U.S. soldier, but I -- I -- I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: Talk about that Lucie, how?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: Well, he -- he --</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: No, I mean, talk about your feeling, about guilt.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: You know that you have so many of your friends, huge numbers on all sides, I mean, Jews, Catholics, communists, Croatian Nationalists of one kind or another, even Ustašas, that you know th-th-they were -- they -- they there were very ambivalent feelings there.</span> <span id="s827">But I don’t think I was ever embittered.</span> <span id="s828">I don’t think even my -- my parents were.</span> <span id="s829">I’ve heard a lot of people who were, I don’t want to hear about these people any more, don’t talk to me about it, I don’t care.</span> <span id="s830">But I -- I -- I -- I never had that feeling.</span> <span id="s831">I was always very much connected to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: Possibly because I wasn’t there, possibly because there was -- you know, whatever I remembered was very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s835">Were you in, during those years after the war, a-after you came to the U.S., were you in touch with people who stayed?</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: Oh yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s837">People who sort of started trickling back.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: What do you mean, going back?</span> <span id="s839">Going back in --</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: No, people -- well, some -- some went back, and jus -- in a very -- well, this was -- some very sad things happened.</span> <span id="s841">For instance, my -- not my -- my -- my cousin, Mia Bauer Pinkas, she had the large family on her father’s side, th-the Bauers.</span> <span id="s842">And among them was Hanitsa Bauer, who -- whose father was a -- not a member of the communist party, but very left leaning and -- and actually had all kinds of trouble with -- he -- he had to be very careful about it.</span> <span id="s843">One member of that family, a nephew, this was a guy who was a communist who was actually in jail at the age of, I don’t know, maybe 18 - 19, pre-war Yugoslavia and who was killed in -- it was a national hero and was killed in -- in the jail.</span> <span id="s844">His name was [indecipherable] Friedman.</span> <span id="s845">So, okay, this was a left leaning family.</span> <span id="s846">Dr. Bauer and Anitsa, after being an -- in ital -- in an Italian camp went to London and spent the blitz in England.</span> <span id="s847">They were the first ones to go back.</span> <span id="s848">Not with the government in exile, but with -- I don’t know, [indecipherable] was liberated and there was a government.</span> <span id="s849">I don’t know whether it was really a government, but yeah, it was, formed, he went back.</span> <span id="s850">He was a -- he was a x-ray specialist, a radiologist.</span> <span id="s851">And he, I think he was [indecipherable] in uniform as a colonel to the Yugoslav army, Tito’s army and so on and he was on the on the [indecipherable] for awhile.</span> <span id="s852">And his daughter Anitsa also went, I don’t know what happened to the wife, I think -- I guess she must have gone, too.</span> <span id="s853">And after awhile they went to Zagreb.</span> <span id="s854">This was not a good thing.</span> <span id="s855">They were, after awhile very disappointed that -- what was going on.</span> <span id="s856">I believe one of the sayings were -- were -- were you -- you were conveniently in London during the war while we were in the mountains.</span> <span id="s857">And I think there may have even been some intimations of anti-Semitism, but I will not swear, I will not say that.</span> <span id="s858">They ended up by going to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: And then from Israel to Venezuela.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s862">Did a lot of Jews from Croatia go to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: Not immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: Not immediately, but after awhile many did.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: And there had been a group already there of -- of real Zionists before -- you know, before there was actually an Israel [indecipherable] during the mandate, there was a -- a kibbutz of Jews from -- from Yugoslavia, from that -- maybe early 30’s, maybe --</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: In Croatia someplace?</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: No, no, in Israel they went --</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: Oh, in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: Yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: They -- that was one of the most horrible things that I re -- read now when I was working in the museum, in the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s876">There was an attempt [phone rings] during -- maybe in 1941 -- ’40 -- ’41 or ’42 to bring a -- the group of Jewish children to Israel via Turkey -- via -- from hung -- yeah, via Hungary and to Turkey, and then from Turkey to Palestine.</span> <span id="s877">[tape break] I was talking about this group of Jewish children that were being evacuated, supposedly, via Turkey --</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: -- to Israel.</span> <span id="s880">And I saw, in the museum now, lists -- and I don’t know how this came, this was probably st -- came with all th -- all -- all the papers, all the -- all the documents that were photographed in -- I mean, not photographed, whatever you do, copied in -- in Zagreb from -- from the archives.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: Endless lists of what these children have to bring along as clothing, and I mean, most of them are -- were killed.</span> <span id="s883">But the list consisted of two pair of pajamas, gym clothes, shoes --that means special slippers for gym.</span> <span id="s884">For a little girl such and such, so many pair of socks, for little boys that many underwear.</span> <span id="s885">This was absolutely -- you know, and that they were changing them, they were not the same.</span> <span id="s886">And the terrible story about this is that one of the woman, who by the way is part of that Bauer family.</span> <span id="s887">A woman -- a woman who was an entrepreneur by herself in Istanbul in the lumber business.</span> <span id="s888">I think she was a widow and she was -- she was in the lumber business in Istanbul.</span> <span id="s889">And one of the people who was supposed to come was her grandson, whose name was Fayja, I forget the surname.</span> <span id="s890">He’s a boy of maybe eight, 10, not sure how -- and -- and I saw him on the list, by the way.</span> <span id="s891">And -- and the list kept changing, too, you know.</span> <span id="s892">I don’t know whether these children have been -- since then some were -- been taken away, some -- th-there -- there was all kinds of [indecipherable] going on there.</span> <span id="s893">And finally this group arrived in Istanbul, and -- which was known by the way, Croatia society [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: Oh, I didn’t know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s896">And it was met, among other people, by this lady.</span> <span id="s897">And this lady was running around and calling this Fayjus’ name.</span> <span id="s898">And the local boy presented himself, but it was not Fayja.</span> <span id="s899">And you can imagine what kind of a scene that -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lucie Rosenberg.</span> <span id="s901">This is tape number two, side B.</span> <span id="s902">But you were saying that when this group of children arrived in Istanbul --</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: -- this woman met the group and this -- a boy answered to her grandson’s name --</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: A boy son -- a boy ans --</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: -- but it wasn’t him.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: -- but it wasn’t him.</span> <span id="s908">But what had happened, this boy died in Zagreb of an infectious disease while these lists were, you know, still [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s909">And the -- inserted into the group of I don’t know, there had to be that many that were permitted to go, was a child from Hungary, who was told to say he was Fayja so and so.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: And you can imagine that grandmother who thought this child had been saved.</span> <span id="s912">And i -- it --</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: Jeez, she must have been frantic.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: She was totally frantic.</span> <span id="s915">By the way, there’s a relative of this person in New York who’s a -- who came on a totally different -- who came with some kind of child transport from France, and boy -- and -- and to some foster parents in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s916">And he is a very well-known scientist at NYU, and he’s working on that famous accelerator in -- in -- in Geneva, or in -- on the -- on the border with France.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: And this was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: And he was on one of those trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: But not this transport, this was a totally different, this was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: You know what -- roughly what year this would have been?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: I think this must have been ’41 - ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s924">And were there many groups of children that went out of Croatia like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: I only know of this one, there may have been others.</span> <span id="s926">I’m -- there were various ways of kids being pulled out, but this was an official group and this was going through -- through the -- I guess the Germans and the -- the Croatian authorities and their -- I’m telling you, there was more paperwork on -- on -- on what they were allowed to bring with them, including gym clothes.</span> <span id="s927">This was very important.</span> <span id="s928">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: And did they make it to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: They made it to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s933">From Istanbul.</span> <span id="s934">Amazingly, one person who actually I -- I don’t -- he -- he is not rela -- related to them.</span> <span id="s935">There’s a man here who was working at the Institute of Peace, who is married to this -- let’s see, she’s not a relative of mine, but she is -- sh-sh-she is a -- a close relative of a -- of -- of my cousins, I mean, she’s -- she’s a -- my cousin -- they have the same grandmother, let’s put it that way, or great-grandmother, some -- anyhow, she -- she’s a blood relative.</span> <span id="s936">She’s not my blood relative, she’s a relative who went to -- who spent the war -- I know I -- probably in Italy.</span> <span id="s937">Her -- her mother was the sister of this guy, Browning that I told you who was the -- the famous leftist and -- and -- and a national hero and -- in -- in -- in Croatia.</span> <span id="s938">This m-ma -- this person whose name is Tuval, who was this professor and -- lately, but he was at Harvard and he’s also at -- at the university in Jerusalem and who worked here at the Institute of Peace, and this is -- is -- is a very wonderful scholar.</span> <span id="s939">His father -- they -- they had emi -- immigrated very much earlier from Novi Sad.</span> <span id="s940">They were well known Zionists and his father went to Israel.</span> <span id="s941">I think they lived -- they lived in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s942">And he went through grade school and unive -- and then -- and high school and university in -- in Israel or m -- and then came to the States and studied and then went back.</span> <span id="s943">There’s a big tragedy in that family, too, but I won’t tell you about.</span> <span id="s944">He was working with a Jewish a -- Jewish agency, I believe, the father.</span> <span id="s945">This person was w-working with a Jewish agency in Istanbul.</span> <span id="s946">And the Papal Nuncio in Jerusalem was the wonderful pope, you know, the -- John the whatever, the -- the -- the super pope.</span> <span id="s947">He was nice, wonderful pope was --</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: What -- hang on a second.</span> <span id="s949">[tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: Yeah, well by then already -- but he was Pope John.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: Yeah, 24th.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: Who helped out with -- wi-wi -- with all kinds of -- of immigration things and helped out with the Germans and so on, was absolutely wonderful in every way.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: So, you know, th-ther -- there was stuff going on, there were undergrounds, there were -- there were official ways, there -- and, you know, there’s that -- this was the time of the mandate, there was no Israel [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s958">Do -- was there any -- did your father ever consider going to Israel instead of the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: I -- I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s960">He was very touched when he first came to Israel, when he visited, he -- he actually felt at home.</span> <span id="s961">I -- I -- I did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: I did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: In those years after you all came to New York and -- and then when you went to Venezuela, were you -- did you keep an active involvement in a synagogue, were you -- did you consider yourself active Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: Yes, I -- you know, you are what you are.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: This -- this was never a re -- a religious community, but for instance, my daughter Jane went to Jewish grade school in -- in Caracas.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: It was a very excellent school and ya -- she -- actually she learned to write Hebrew and -- and -- and Spanish at the same time, because this was bilingual and this -- it was span -- it was called -- what was it called?</span> <span id="s970">Escuela [indecipherable] my God, how is this, how am I forgetting that?</span> <span id="s971">[speaks foreign language here] it was called.</span> <span id="s972">And one of her first teachers [indecipherable] was a -- brought from Israel and she was of Bosnian descent.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s975">A very nice woman.</span> <span id="s976">The other one was, I guess, either Russian Jewish or Polish Jewish or whatever.</span> <span id="s977">It was a very, very good school, and it had the regular curriculum of the Venezuelan government, you know, whatever the Ministry of Education had, plus a Jewish curriculum.</span> <span id="s978">So, you know, there wa -- there was never any -- any doubt in any of that.</span> <span id="s979">All --</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: What do you -- what do you mean, any doubt about what?</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: I mean, you know, I was Jewish, I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s982">It was --</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: -- it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: You weren't going to turn away from it for any reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: Many people did.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: No, I didn’t</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: I mean, how could I when -- no.</span> <span id="s991">Also, when we got back to New York, about which we will speak later, my father insisted that Jane go to a Sunday school in New York, a Jewish Sunday school.</span> <span id="s992">And num -- and -- and when we were in -- in Mexico, I had -- Mary went off to a Jewish Sunday school.</span> <span id="s993">Not for long, but she did go.</span> <span id="s994">And Jane did, and so on.</span> <span id="s995">But neither of them are religious in any way.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: That was not a very religious family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: Your -- your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1002">No, no.</span> <span id="s1003">I mean, there were certain customs that were kept and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: I mean if -- it was like you had dark hair or light hair or whatever, it was part of your -- your being and that was it.</span> <span id="s1006">And that had a feeling, you know, that it didn’t really require any -- any -- any nurturing.</span> <span id="s1007">I -- maybe that was a mistake, I mean, they -- they’re well aware of everything and then, in fact, Jane married a non-Jewish person who then, at his own behest became a -- a -- converted to Judaism and in his second marria -- marriage, married another Jewish woman.</span> <span id="s1008">I thought that was quite interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: And the other one, I mean, considers himself -- he was born a Protestant, but -- but he’s totally irreligious and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: When your daughters -- your daughters both knew your father and mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: And I’m wondering how it was explained to them how your -- they came to be in the United States, how you came to be.</span> <span id="s1014">Did -- did they know the whole story about --</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: Yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: -- your leaving and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: -- and the Holocaust in general --</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: -- from the beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: From the very beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: It’s been an -- it’s an issue with a lot of people --</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: -- how to tell the young people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: No, we -- this -- this was very straightforward.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: And they were among people i -- i -- i -- who -- who talked about it one way or another.</span> <span id="s1028">I mean th-this was very fresh in my cousin’s memory, for instance in -- in -- in Caracas.</span> <span id="s1029">She was surrounded by people who had been in this camp and that camp and it was -- it was daily conversations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: And some of it was even fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: How so?</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: For instance, my cousin met her husband in -- in -- in -- actually, near Dubrovnik, but they were -- they were all -- both sent to a camp in Albania and the romance developed then -- then, and then they were sent to a camp in -- in Italy and it continued.</span> <span id="s1034">And when they finally -- this -- this is another thing that very few people talk about and has -- has nothing to do with my families, but I do want to come back to that.</span> <span id="s1035">You know, they -- they -- they had their own social life and they tried to cook and so on together.</span> <span id="s1036">There was memories that they talked about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1038">The camps that your cousin were in were more like detention camps than [indecipherable] what we think of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: They were concentration camps, but they were not -- they were not killing camps of any kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1041">They were forced labor camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: No.</span> <span id="s1045">Maybe detention is more that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1048">One of them I for -- one of them was in -- in -- under Italian -- this was obviously by -- at that time Albania was under Italian occupation, had been for some time and they were brought from the Dalmatian coast to -- to Albania and I don’t know exactly how long they were there, but they -- they were then taken to -- by the Italian army, or Italian authorities to another camp which was called ferra -- Ferramonti di Tarsia in -- I forget where -- where exactly in Italy it was.</span> <span id="s1049">[tape break] Think we was talking about the groups and -- no, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1050">[tape break] -- went over that they -- they -- they came to Spain and from -- and Spain, they sent this telegram to us and then my father was going around to find out who would give them visas and affidavits and -- and obviously deposits at the consulates for money and then that’s how it -- how they got there, they’re all doing very well now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: And they were -- Dr. Bauer actually was a Zionist, was an active Zionist.</span> <span id="s1053">My aunt’s husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: My cousin Mia’s husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1057">But that’s the only one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: There -- there were some who were maybe more -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1059">But on the other hand, my cousin didn’t go to Jewish school in Zagreb and I did.</span> <span id="s1060">I did go to the Jewish school where obviously you had the regular Yugoslav curriculum for -- for grade school, it went from one to four.</span> <span id="s1061">And -- plus Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: And actu -- and Biblical history.</span> <span id="s1064">And at that time already, there w -- and I’m talking in the early 30’s -- late 20’s, early 30’s, there were, in Croatian, Zionist children’s magazines with beautiful woodblocks in it.</span> <span id="s1065">And I still remember the name of one of them -- an -- of the main one, it was ca-called [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1066">And I think it -- they were monthlies.</span> <span id="s1067">Had stories about children, about Israel.</span> <span id="s1068">About Palestine, not about Israel, about Palestine.</span> <span id="s1069">And there -- there were people who were leaving.</span> <span id="s1070">There was, in my class in grade school, the son of the big Zionist leader, whose name was Dr. Alexander Leite, who -- whose son was in my class and sadly the -- he died at the -- I think the age of nine, maybe even 10, from scarlet fever.</span> <span id="s1071">And that was a horrible loss.</span> <span id="s1072">And Dr. Leite then went and -- and -- and was very, very active in -- in Israel.</span> <span id="s1073">I think he -- I th -- I think he survived.</span> <span id="s1074">Yeah, I think he did.</span> <span id="s1075">He went over there.</span> <span id="s1076">And there was a younger daughter by the name of Tamara who may still be alive in -- in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: Let me ask you about the 50’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: Mm-hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: It was -- so Tito had taken power and there was so much repression there --</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: -- in the 50’s and people were jailed and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: -- still terrible things going on there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: Did you have -- were you in touch with people who were there, who had survived in Zagreb and -- Jews or relatives who had survived and stayed on, and did you have any correspondence or connection with them during those first 10 years or so after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: Yes, we did, but those that survived were mostly leftists and those were people who would have been -- who would have been partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: And come to power.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: And come to power.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: Uh-huh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: And then somewhere, of course, I mean, as I said, Dr. Richard Bauer decided this was not for him and he went --he went to Israel.</span> <span id="s1091">I know a lot of people who finally did.</span> <span id="s1092">The person that I mentioned to you before, aga -- who -- who lives here now, she was a little girl, her uncle -- and she -- she -- most of her -- the war she spent with her grandmother, she tried to go -- they tried to get visas to go to Israel and they could not get a visa and they could not get a visa.</span> <span id="s1093">And finally they appealed the -- the -- the grandmother appealed to one of the politburo members who had been in the same -- I don’t know whether cell, but certainly in the same jail as her husband -- I mean as her -- as her son, Branimir.</span> <span id="s1094">And there was no letter, but they suddenly got a permission to leave for Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: So.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1098">Let’s go back to you and Morris are, in the late 50’s, you are in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: We are in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: -- Venezuela.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: -- Venezuela.</span> <span id="s1102">We’re still in Venezuela.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: You go back to New York in 1958.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: For a couple more years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1107">This -- this was sort of unexpected, we were supposed to be on vacation and then something happened with Morris’s job, which I don’t want to go into right now, it just got to be complicated, and -- and -- and Jane developed the measles, I believe, or something and we could -- we were supposed to have gone to Europe and we did not.</span> <span id="s1108">And so he started working for first -- the Institute for International Education for east west exchange.</span> <span id="s1109">But he found that it was going mu -- it was very slow.</span> <span id="s1110">I mean, he was given a project that was a -- that he finished within, I don’t know, three, four days and this was supposed to take several weeks.</span> <span id="s1111">And he just couldn’t stand it and then he quit.</span> <span id="s1112">And meanwhile, at the same time, the Associated Press asked him to please come back and he did.</span> <span id="s1113">There was -- he was on a night shift or on -- on -- on -- on an awful shift and at we -- that was pretty stressful I must say.</span> <span id="s1114">He hardly ever saw the children and so on.</span> <span id="s1115">And -- but he had some very interesting [indecipherable] etcetera.</span> <span id="s1116">And we were there from ’58 to ’61.</span> <span id="s1117">The amusing thing was I, having gone to -- going to a private high school in Yugoslavia pre-war, there must have been something wrong with you.</span> <span id="s1118">This was, you know, you -- th-that was -- it was looked down upon in a very serious manner.</span> <span id="s1119">And I remember my poor brother who had been in England and had lost a year’s worth of national history in the croa -- and the national language.</span> <span id="s1120">He, in order not to lose a year in high school, went to a private school and it -- that was the most dramat -- I mean the most horrible thing for him, he absolutely hated it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: I think that -- yeah, you told this story before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A: So, you know, you went to a public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: And as we came -- as I said, as we ca -- as -- as -- when we came to New York I insisted that Jane go to a public school.</span> <span id="s1127">And we bought this -- and what was supposed to be a very good public school was P.S. six and P.S. six was in an extremely expensive neighborhood and the only wa-way she could have gone, we had to buy a con -- no, not condo, what you call, the -- these other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: Co-op?</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: Co-op.</span> <span id="s1130">And finally as we, you know, after a year we saw that she was way ahead, and so she was taken out and she went to the United Nations school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: Which was very good at that time.</span> <span id="s1133">The amazing thing was, you know, she would go there, changing buses twice with a friend.</span> <span id="s1134">And there was, you know, she was about 10.</span> <span id="s1135">It was very nice, that wa -- that was good.</span> <span id="s1136">The same time I ran into somebody who had been a very intimate friend of mine for years of -- when we were both at Voice of America, and her name was Mira Mihalofska and her husband was the Polish U.N. ambassador there.</span> <span id="s1137">We ran into -- into each other at the cocktail party.</span> <span id="s1138">I had no idea that’s where she was.</span> <span id="s1139">And we’d been in touch ever since.</span> <span id="s1140">So one of the boys was in Jane’s class at the U.N. school, the ol-older one was also at the U.N., but -- so that was good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: So you had three nice years there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: Very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: And also my father was there and there were -- and -- and an aunt of my mother’s who was still alive, who had survived in the most horrifying manner.</span> <span id="s1145">She was in Italy with her husband, who was a -- she was born in Hungary and she was -- she grew up in Osiek, her mar -- her -- her mother married a second time, a widower.</span> <span id="s1146">And they were in something that was known as the con -- a confino libero.</span> <span id="s1147">Confino libero consisted of you were in a small town in Italy and you reported to the police, I guess once a w -- day that you were there.</span> <span id="s1148">And they were staying in a room or two rooms or whatever, in -- in some pensionne or wherever they were billeted.</span> <span id="s1149">And that was it.</span> <span id="s1150">And her husband apparently was -- had gotten some gold pieces that he must have been counting, or somebody was aware of the fact that he had them, and they -- some -- th-this had nothing to do with the Holocaust or anything, these were plain old robbers, had killed him and hit her on the head and buried them both.</span> <span id="s1151">And she woke up when she came to and she was buried on top of her husband, and she crawled out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: And saw the dead husband there.</span> <span id="s1154">And there was a big -- do I have, and I promised the museum that I would get all of these newspaper clippings in Italian and give it to them.</span> <span id="s1155">Things like beautiful Jewess, you know, resurrected from the grave, so to speak.</span> <span id="s1156">She wasn’t beautiful at all, bu-but she was a younger person, so anyhow Italians were being very complimentary.</span> <span id="s1157">And she stayed there and finally was permitted to go to Switzerland where she worked as a maid.</span> <span id="s1158">The Swiss were, you know, the Swiss were the way they were.</span> <span id="s1159">And they permitted her to stay there.</span> <span id="s1160">Again, she had to go, I think once a week or so or maybe even more often with a -- with a little I.D. with her picture on it to present herself to the police that she was there and she worked as a maid, or cleaning woman, I’m not quite sure what.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: And finally we were able to get her visa and she came to New York and she stayed with us for awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: Your father brought her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: My mother.</span> <span id="s1165">This was on my mother’s side.</span> <span id="s1166">Her name was Clara Frankel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1168">You mentioned here in the late 50’s that your father was still alive.</span> <span id="s1169">Had your mother passed away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: My mother passed away yes, in her fi -- and we were still in Venezuela, somewhere like ’57 or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: Yup, but my father was fir -- he came to us and then he went wi -- he went on a trip around the world.</span> <span id="s1173">And of course he’d been going back and forth to Yugoslavia a great deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: Oh, he had?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: In the 50’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: What was he -- was he doing business?</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: No, he was seeing friends.</span> <span id="s1182">He was working on -- on this restitution that we were supposed to get and getting papers together and so on.</span> <span id="s1183">I still keep finding bits and pieces of paper that he was working on.</span> <span id="s1184">And seeing friends.</span> <span id="s1185">He would go on vacation in the north, on -- do you know where Opatija is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: Okay, to Opatija for weeks at a time.</span> <span id="s1188">And seeing friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: When did you finally go back for the first time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: I’m trying to think -- have -- I went -- I truly -- I do -- I’m trying to remember whether I went with Morris and my uncle or whether I went with my father.</span> <span id="s1191">I think I went with my father.</span> <span id="s1192">Somewhere in the 50’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: In the 50’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: You had been gone ma -- no, 10 years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1197">Even less maybe, I’m -- you know, probably 10 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1199">And what was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: It was sad.</span> <span id="s1201">It was sad but it was nice too, because I saw friends.</span> <span id="s1202">I went so see the house in the country, which was -- which was a ruin then, which didn’t, you know, was a ruin, it was a ruin, I me -- I -- I started getting sad and nostalgic when they started rebuilding it, unnecessarily.</span> <span id="s1203">But that -- it was -- it was just the way I had been sent photographs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: I saw various friends, some who had gotten married.</span> <span id="s1206">Male friends, boy friends, whatever, people like that who I’d been in correspondence with all the time, and -- and a few girlfriends.</span> <span id="s1207">Then -- and -- and my father st -- oddly enough, quite a few people that he knew were still alive, he was seeing them and so on.</span> <span id="s1208">And by that t-time -- by that time I think quite a few of the -- whoever was Jewish had left, unless that had been really very rabid leftists.</span> <span id="s1209">My father’s very intimate friend for years pre-war was the Yugoslav or Croatian, whatever you want to call it, sculptor, Antun Augustinčić.</span> <span id="s1210">And they had been in contact pretty much the -- forever, and he was a very close friend of Tito’s and he was very high up in the government.</span> <span id="s1211">And I think when they were -- Yugoslavia gave as a present to the United Nations this equestrian statue which is still standing there.</span> <span id="s1212">When that was being put up my -- I don’t know whether Augustinčić stayed with -- I was not, I was in probably -- I am -- I am not sure where I was, probably in Caracas at the time.</span> <span id="s1213">He saw my father and then when the statue was actually brought, he also brought the st -- this statue which was given to us, which was -- which is part of a -- one of those partisan monuments that are all over Yugoslavia and which -- which stood in our garden in -- in Caracas and to which Mary referred to as la niña boomboom, because she has a -- she has a -- a -- a gun in her hand, a -- a -- what is known as a [indecipherable] in Croatian, but it’s -- it’s a submachine gun, as you can see.</span> <span id="s1214">And there are many photographs of Mary standing holding on to the niña boomboom in the garden.</span> <span id="s1215">And that’s going to her, now I mean I’ve been dragging her arou -- around the world long enough, so -- End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p>

id="s1222">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: -- who were going back --</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: -- to see friends and -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: -- what a unique experience for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: It was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q: Among survivors anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">A: The sad part of course was that you kept getting details of who did what to whom, and that was very prevalent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: And one of the strangest -- I don’t know whether I told this story at all, maybe I did, if it’s -- came back and I started visiting people around the place and among oth -- and then, you know, Zagreb is a very small town and was a much smaller town and suddenly the word was aha, she’s here.</span> <span id="s1235">And people started inviting me back and forth.</span> <span id="s1236">So one of the peop -- two people remain in my memory, that was first time I went back.</span> <span id="s1237">One was -- were the parents of a childhood friend of mine by the name of Zlatan Blinavich.</span> <span id="s1238">Zlatan Blinavich I knew when he was 10 years -- when I was 10 years old and he was 11 years old and we were sort of -- not childhood sweethearts, but anyhow, an interest.</span> <span id="s1239">And we were -- the family was very Croatian nationalist, although I would have never thought of them as Ustaša by any means.</span> <span id="s1240">The mother, I believe, was Austrian, but I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s1241">Maybe German.</span> <span id="s1242">Austrian, I believe.</span> <span id="s1243">And he and I -- I mean, he went all to -- to, say the equivalent of my school, the [indecipherable] gymnasia, which was in another part of town.</span> <span id="s1244">But we played tennis together and we -- we were very close friends.</span> <span id="s1245">That sort of -- held hands maybe, stuff like that.</span> <span id="s1246">And he apparently collaborated like crazy.</span> <span id="s1247">If not more than collaborated and immediately after the war, took off for Argentina.</span> <span id="s1248">And I had heard that.</span> <span id="s1249">You heard all sorts of things because there was -- in particul -- I -- you know, it was a very key generation.</span> <span id="s1250">People who were between say 18 and 22 - 25 when the war started.</span> <span id="s1251">[coughs] Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1252">So this lady heard that [indecipherable] and her husband that I was back and she asked me to come and visit her.</span> <span id="s1253">It was a big story about you know, he hasn’t been -- he really never collaborated, he was called into the army and he was part of the -- he was -- he was not an Ustaša, he was just a foot soldier and so on.</span> <span id="s1254">But that’s not true because if he had been he would have stayed and he went to Argentina and never came back.</span> <span id="s1255">And I really don’t know why -- why they called me, but maybe -- you know, they knew me from childhood on and I felt they probably wanted to -- they weren’t -- were they apologizing?</span> <span id="s1256">Maybe.</span> <span id="s1257">Maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1259">Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1260">In their gesture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: In their gesture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: And, you know, they -- they knew me from when I was nine years old, so maybe that was -- they wanted to see who was a -- they were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: -- maybe pleased to see that somebody had survived.</span> <span id="s1268">And I never heard from him, but I heard via others that he was in Argentina and died fairly young, as far as I know.</span> <span id="s1269">The other person I visited was the mother of a friend of mine who became a great -- he wasn’t a friend of mine, he -- he was a friend of my brother’s, he went to school with my brother.</span> <span id="s1270">Her -- his father was a -- one of the few psychiatrists in the country and he ran a psychiatric hospital near Zagreb and then after the war he was accused of some malfeasance by the communists and he committed suicide.</span> <span id="s1271">That was a horrible story.</span> <span id="s1272">He was completely innocent, but they kept pushing and pushing and finally -- and his son was a very, very prominent newspaperman in Belgrade later on.</span> <span id="s1273">He’s a friend of ours.</span> <span id="s1274">And this lady heard that I was in Zagreb and insisted that I come and see her, which I did.</span> <span id="s1275">And this -- this is a si -- this is one of those things that I never will get over with, how are you -- how are you, and you know, about the son, who at that time was in Belgrade, married for the second time.</span> <span id="s1276">And by the way, we were friends in Mexico, he -- he ba -- he ba [indecipherable] the corresponding [indecipherable] in Mexico.</span> <span id="s1277">The lady -- I-I walk in and she’s oh, how nice to see you, keeps looking at my clothes, and this, that and the other, and says, you know, I remember exactly what you wore to the opera and tel -- to Pacival.</span> <span id="s1278">And describes this dress to me, I had completely forgotten.</span> <span id="s1279">I mean, here her son had gone through partisanship, her husband was -- committed suicide because of -- because of pressures.</span> <span id="s1280">Her life is nothing.</span> <span id="s1281">By the way, one son is a very prominent physician somewhere in -- in -- I don’t know, in the -- in the s -- you know, the United States, in -- in the middle west, I believe.</span> <span id="s1282">And she’s describing my -- the dress I wore, for Pete’s sakes.</span> <span id="s1283">You know, wha-what remain -- what goes on in people’s minds?</span> <span id="s1284">I couldn’t te -- I don’t know, maybe this is some kind of a defense mechanism because th -- fa -- you know, I remembered eventually, I mean, this was -- as it was I hated all of this getting dressed and dressed up and so on, and I hated it.</span> <span id="s1285">But apparently this was what you did, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s1287">Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: And why was I forced to si-sit through Pacival at age maybe 17 or 18, whatever, I can’t imagine either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: You mentioned that your father was friends with a famous sculptor, Au-Augustinčić.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: And that Augustinčić was close with Tito in the mountains.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: Very close.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: Did your father ever meet Tito?</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1296">Did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: Yes, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s1302">He came on a state visit to Mexico and I met him there and I met Jovanka there and it was -- I was actually -- and you know, he was a big hunter and he was really a tough person.</span> <span id="s1303">But I saw something that was extremely interesting at the time.</span> <span id="s1304">They put up a bullfight for Tito.</span> <span id="s1305">Tito was a very good shot and a very good hunter and so on.</span> <span id="s1306">And in fact there was a lot of stuff go -- you know, that -- there’s -- there was a -- a state owned -- large estate where there were -- there -- there were -- I don’t even know what -- or how I would go th -- I -- I think there were -- an agricultural estate called Bainya, and they had [indecipherable] went there for a hunting, and he did too, and he killed a bunch of things, and there were remarks about how this was brought there for him to be able to cab -- it’s not true, he was a good shot, and a good hunter, anyhow.</span> <span id="s1307">But he went to this -- I saw this -- to this bullfight in Mexico, and there was a very unusual incident where the bull jumped and got caught, you know, where this -- this blind where the -- where -- where -- where the bullfighter hides?</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: Comes out?</span> <span id="s1309">Yes, mm-hm, there’s like a wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: It’s like a wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: And he can hide behind it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1313">Well, this bull got caught between the wall and was sort of straddling this and -- and he -- Tito walked away, he couldn’t look at that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: I mean, I wasn’t that close to him to have -- to have known the remarks, but I was told later on by the ambassador, who was a very nice Macedonian, at the time married to a Viennese woman, and also this person that I just mentioned before, who became a well-known American jour -- I mean, Yugoslav journalist, that -- that he got so shocked by the brutality of it, he collected himself and left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: Hm, that’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: It was very unusual to me, I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: -- I was, you know, this happens.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1321">And he was there for a bullfight, after all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: He was there for a bullfight.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1324">Huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A: That was a a very strange thing, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: So you met him at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">A: I met him at that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">Q: You said hello?</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">A: -- at that -- some kind of a reception --</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">A: -- that the ma -- the Mexican government gave and -- and Jovanka was there and this was a very sad thing because Ambassador Vlahov’s wife, who was this Viennese lady -- it’s a funny combination of th-the Macedonian and the -- and the Viennese.</span> <span id="s1332">She had a hard time ad -- adjusting to Mexico, I remember very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A: She developed that week, a terrible urinary tract infection, and she had to go by car with Jovanka.</span> <span id="s1335">The men went fr -- went -- I don’t know whether they went by plane or whether they went by a special [indecipherable] group, but she was attached up to Mrs. Tito.</span> <span id="s1336">And they stopped halfway, I think maybe even overnight, I’m not sure, in a town between Mexico and Acapulco.</span> <span id="s1337">And, poor woman, not only did this happen to her, but then they were presented by the governor of this state with a beautiful carved box.</span> <span id="s1338">And in the box was a very fine rebosa.</span> <span id="s1339">But it was such a fine silk rebosa that it was -- it was folded into this box, which I saw, which was no bigger than this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: Say what that is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: A rebosa is one of those shawls that Mexican women wear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A: But there are -- of course there are plain ones that are used every day and this was a super gala one, but it was Mexican, it was not liba -- I’m not quite sure.</span> <span id="s1344">This was a -- a specific place where this came from, a very famous, very beautiful, terribly thin.</span> <span id="s1345">Almost like -- like -- like an Indian shawl, it was.</span> <span id="s1346">I mean Indian from India.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: And Mrs. Vlohov, the ambassador’s wife goes to pick up hers, luckily it was she and not Jovanka, and she gets bitten by a scorpion.</span> <span id="s1349">Oh my.</span> <span id="s1350">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: Poor thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: -- it was not only poor thing with this urinary tract infection --</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q: And she’s trying to entertain --</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: -- and -- and she’s trying to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: -- as the head of state.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">A: -- entertain that s -- head of s -- I mean, this -- this was really awful.</span> <span id="s1357">So then they went -- finally then went to -- then there was a huge state reception, with lots of music and lots of singing and he -- Tito didn’t like -- there was a -- there’s a very famous Mexican female singer of folk songs and there’s a song called Cu cu ru cu cu Paloma.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">Q: I know that song.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1360">There’s a great deal of Cu cu ru cu cu Paloma going on and Tito liked that very well, and there were a lot of speeches and so on, so okay, we were all part of this business, not because, you know, Lucie Rosenberg of Yugoslavia, but because of Morris Rosenberg, the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: So -- or maybe not.</span> <span id="s1363">Maybe a little bit of both, because we were -- we were fairly close with the Mahoffs, and they lived very near us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1365">Lucie, would you have considered yourself a Tito supporter at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: Yeah, mm-hm, yeah.</span> <span id="s1367">I mean, at the beginning -- at -- at -- at-at that time it was starting to look a little less terrific, but I -- we all knew what was going on, more or less.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A: But maybe by that time no longer.</span> <span id="s1370">But I -- we’re -- who were you looking for?</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: There was nobody on the horizon.</span> <span id="s1373">You could get some very unpleasant Serb nationalists or very unpleasant Croatian nationalists.</span> <span id="s1374">And were very few moderates that you could even think about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1378">So you’re in Mexico in the -- this is the early 60’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: Early 60’s.</span> <span id="s1380">I think we got there in ’61.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1382">And -- and where would -- where did you go after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: We went to Paris in ’66.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A: And stayed til ’77.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q: Oh my.</span> <span id="s1387">11 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">A: All together.</span> <span id="s1389">No, but we returned to Mexico -- no, we returned to Mexico in ’77 and then ’77 to ’79 we were in Mexico again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q: But those were pretty volatile years in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">A: They were very volatile.</span> <span id="s1392">We were there during the ’68 revolution.</span> <span id="s1393">It was terribly exciting.</span> <span id="s1394">My older daughter got -- well, I think Mary got gassed, too, coming from school.</span> <span id="s1395">Jane was in -- during this year abroad, doing the [indecipherable] Française.</span> <span id="s1396">It’s the year abroad.</span> <span id="s1397">This was called, yeah, it was called the year abroad, but what was it?</span> <span id="s1398">Sen -- not senior, was it fa -- it was a particular year abroad that universities counted actually as a -- as a class -- as -- as a -- you -- you got credit for it.</span> <span id="s1399">And it was -- she stayed -- I mean, she lived at home, but she went to the Sorbonne and various other places for classes, French classes and I hardly saw Morris at all because he was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1400">For awhile my father was with us, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">Q: What was Morris covering at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">A: He was covering that and then the -- the -- and -- and the Peace talks, the -- the Vietnam Peace talks were on --</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: In Paris.</span> <span id="s1404">Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">A: -- at the same time in Paris.</span> <span id="s1406">But he was bureau chief.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A: So he was bureau chief for all of Francophone Africa and from -- for France and Belgium and Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1409">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: I mean, the Francophone part.</span> <span id="s1412">And I was unfortunate -- I don’t know whether I should say unfortunately -- yes, unfortunately, I was the bureau chief’s wife and we had V.I.P.s coming in from all of Latin America, from the States and so on and I was the taker around and [indecipherable] the old-fashioned show, six times of the same show.</span> <span id="s1413">And taking people shopping and all sorts of unpleasant things like that, it went on forever, and everything I don’t want to have.</span> <span id="s1414">I was happy when I could sit at home and have a meal to -- by myself with the kids, it was very, very demanding.</span> <span id="s1415">After awhile I got a little tired of all of that and I took an -- it -- I -- I -- I took several courses.</span> <span id="s1416">I too -- first I took a course at the -- at -- in anthropology, but what kind of anthropology?</span> <span id="s1417">I did one with Lévi-Strauss who was doing stuff about that time at the -- oh, what is it called, that -- they call it the [indecipherable] which was you didn’t get any kind of degrees or any kind of anything for it, but you sat there and this was anthropology and what this was mostly on was -- was northwest Canadian Indians, and was wonderful, about the Inuits, and I had always been interested in that.</span> <span id="s1418">It was a super class, except in a -- when you think how classes are taught nowadays and the way this was taught it was just incredible.</span> <span id="s1419">Thank [indecipherable] was -- the building was, I don’t know, probably 17th century and nothing functioned at all.</span> <span id="s1420">We started out by seeing nobody is permitted to use any kind of -- of recording device and someone actually went around to see what was going on.</span> <span id="s1421">Then, as it was open and free, all sorts of hobos would come in and just sleep in the back there, because -- because you know, it was free, it was warm.</span> <span id="s1422">And then they had strange old windows that they always had problems getting the blinds down and he had a assistant and they would do projections on the screen.</span> <span id="s1423">And they were invariably upside down.</span> <span id="s1424">I mean, I don’t know one time when this was straight.</span> <span id="s1425">I mean, this is the leading anthropologist at that time, Claude Lévi-Strauss and it w -- it w -- had a -- can’t remember exactly how long the course started, who -- I was terribly interested in the material, I actually had Morris take me to -- to where -- where this was take -- taking place.</span> <span id="s1426">I mean, where these Indians were, and so on that’s [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: The northwest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: -- Canadian me -- Canadian northwest was fairly fantastic.</span> <span id="s1429">I was doing that.</span> <span id="s1430">Then I took a course that was being given by an -- that was some kind of branch of -- I don’t whether it was NYU, I’m not quite sure -- that was given by the very famous, and this is shameful on me, cultural anthropologist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Q: Lewis?</span> <span id="s1432">Lewis?</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: It’s American, I should know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: Shame on me.</span> <span id="s1436">He did a wonderful thing on five Mexican families or maybe three Mexican families at this point.</span> <span id="s1437">I took that with a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s1438">Then I decided to do a class to teach -- to teach French.</span> <span id="s1439">And this was mostly given by fre -- four French secondary school teachers from Les Colonie deut la mer.</span> <span id="s1440">Colonies from across th -- I mean, from the other side -- from across the oceans, let’s say.</span> <span id="s1441">And they consisted fi -- of a number of high school teachers from Martinique, from very -- from African high schools and so on.</span> <span id="s1442">And you know, their -- their curriculum is exactly, exactly the same in all of those countries as it is in France, and you can count on it that on the same day the same thing, I -- I think it’s still that way.</span> <span id="s1443">The same thing is being taught in -- in -- in Guadalupe, and who knows where in Africa, as it is in France.</span> <span id="s1444">And the beginning of these classes when th -- st -- I mean the history classes, the history books start out by [indecipherable] our ancestors [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1445">And I mean, you see these black ladies teaching this to these black children over there, it’s quite funny.</span> <span id="s1446">But it’s a very rigorous program and -- and this was taught as the special sk -- a special course for -- I guess maybe they got a little more money for th -- from -- from the Ministry of Education, and they came for this specialization in English.</span> <span id="s1447">And it was -- this was really fun, and I actually got a -- a certificate of that.</span> <span id="s1448">It was super.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">Q: Did you end up teaching?</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">A: I taught, but privately.</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">A: Not -- not -- no.</span> <span id="s1453">By that time the problem became that if you were not European, and the union just started, if you were English you could get permission to teach, but not in -- in big schools.</span> <span id="s1454">I mean, in actual classes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1456">Was there much -- you’re in Europe now in the -- in the 70’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">Q: At this time -- in the late 70’s in the United States anyway was kind of a -- in the very late 70’s there was a kind of a -- a reawakening --</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">Q: -- in this country about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1461">It was -- you know, there started to be television programs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Q: Among that young generation -- I know I was in college at that time, a lot of my Jewish friends were learning about the Holocaust for the first time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">A: It’s amazing to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">Q: There had been, you know, 25 years there --</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">Q: -- when it wasn’t much discussed publicly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">A: That’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: Even the most learned academics weren’t always given a -- a -- a warm reception in many places in this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: People who were studying the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q: -- the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1474">What was the situation where you were?</span> <span id="s1475">I mean, it was a much different cultural environment there, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">A: In -- in -- in France, there were two wonderful little museums.</span> <span id="s1477">It -- in -- one was in a townhouse, really touching.</span> <span id="s1478">Little bits and pieces of artifacts.</span> <span id="s1479">A book.</span> <span id="s1480">I don’t think there was an entrance fee, but -- but one was expected.</span> <span id="s1481">A few notebooks, a few photographs, a few books, this, that and the other.</span> <span id="s1482">Than there was an extremely interesting --</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Q: You mean memorabilia from the Jewish community there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">A: Ah -- y-yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: Is that what it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">A: We did go.</span> <span id="s1489">The Marais at that time was an actual Jewish district in Paris.</span> <span id="s1490">And I -- I don’t like the idea of -- of saying it was a -- it was a ghetto, it was not a ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">A: But there was a wonderful Jewish delicatessen, so that was the only place where you could get rye bread.</span> <span id="s1493">And we would go get rye bread and pickles and stuff like that every once in awhile.</span> <span id="s1494">And in the back of these various medieval houses were Jewish butchers and people were going around with -- with -- in -- in sort of Jewish garb, with hats on and so on.</span> <span id="s1495">And the famous one is this golden bird where there was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1496">By this time we were already in the States, but sa -- it was bombed one day, and I don’t know who was hurt, but there were a few people hurt and it was very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s1498">A terrorist kind of thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">A: A terrorist type of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">A: Meanwhile, this was becoming terribly gentrified.</span> <span id="s1502">Mary actually did a paper on it that’s quite interesting in somewhere that she -- probably in the 70’s, I remember.</span> <span id="s1503">I don’t know what she used it for but it was a paper she had to do.</span> <span id="s1504">And people were buying a -- these houses and renovating them, the apartments.</span> <span id="s1505">There were some absolutely wonderful, wonderful palaces there from early French history.</span> <span id="s1506">But I mean, super-elegant places.</span> <span id="s1507">One of them has since become the Jewish museum to which I had never -- have never been.</span> <span id="s1508">And the place is totally gentrified and I just -- well, when I saw it I was quite shocked.</span> <span id="s1509">There’s a nice Picasso museum there.</span> <span id="s1510">There was a wonderful museum which is still there in -- in the same way as it was, of the city of Paris which -- with, you know, signs, butcher stores and so on, various guilds and everything.</span> <span id="s1511">Beautifully done.</span> <span id="s1512">That -- that’s still there.</span> <span id="s1513">But they now have all kinds of super luxury stores and this is a medieval, you know, district.</span> <span id="s1514">And I -- just as I said I saw a story where people absolutely shocked and horrified and as I st -- as they started buying up these -- these places and turning them into condos and turning in -- into fancy s -- modern stores, these people were being pushed out.</span> <span id="s1515">So you saw much less of that in -- in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1517">And what about a -- were you members of a Jewish community there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1520">Because you just never got around to it, or you didn’t want to be, or there wasn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">A: I really didn’t want to be because you know, I had very little in common with French people, that experience wasn’t the same.</span> <span id="s1522">They’re very exclusive.</span> <span id="s1523">The French are very exclusive people whether -- whether they’re Jewish or not.</span> <span id="s1524">We knew of a couple of Jewish families.</span> <span id="s1525">One of them was a family that Morris had met, a French family who had interests in north Africa and he knew them from Algiers, I believe.</span> <span id="s1526">They were very upper upper middle class.</span> <span id="s1527">Nice people, that died since, both of them.</span> <span id="s1528">And -- I-I -- I’m trying to think.</span> <span id="s1529">Yes, my -- one of -- I found out that for instance, our physician who we got by recommendation of somebody was -- I think he was a Moroccan Jew.</span> <span id="s1530">My ophthalmologist was a woman and from what I can see her name is something something bennyshu, I think she was probably Algerian or Moroccan Jew, so-somebody like that, so some part of that part of the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">A: But really not.</span> <span id="s1533">We -- we -- we were not members of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">A: -- of the Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1537">And did the war -- did World War II seem closer in time to you there than it did --</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">A: Yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: -- when you were here --</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: -- much closer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: -- in eastern --</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: Much closer --</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: -- in the States --</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: -- much closer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: -- or Mexico, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A: First of all, I would go to -- to -- t-to Yugoslavia, I mean, you’d hop on the train and you were there, there was no problem.</span> <span id="s1547">Also, I had a very good friend from Yugoslavia, an interesting thing, from Zagreb, she used to be practically a beauty queen, and she was from a mixed marriage.</span> <span id="s1548">And I don’t know exactly when she came to Paris, but she did and she -- her name was Baccichin, but I don’t know whether this was a -- a name that had been changed at one time or another, but she is a hugely tall blonde woma -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lucie Rosenberg.</span> <span id="s1550">This is tape number three, side B.</span> <span id="s1551">She was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: She was from Zagreb.</span> <span id="s1553">She was -- I knew her family pre-war, my father -- she was that much older that she wasn’t a friend of mine in Zagreb, she’s just a -- well, she was maybe three years older, maybe even four, and she was th -- one of the glamour girls.</span> <span id="s1554">And she was working -- this is another interesting thing -- she was working for a manufacturer, clothing manufacturer who produced knock-offs of Chanel clothes.</span> <span id="s1555">And she would buy the ma-material and she would, you know, get this kind of extra trimming on it and that kind of short or long or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s1556">Beautiful stuff.</span> <span id="s1557">This was then sent -- this -- they had lots of American buyers, among others, for Sachs Fifth Avenue, where the -- at that time the things were sold for 700 - 900 bucks, stuff like that.</span> <span id="s1558">And they were produced in one of -- were in -- in where I saw the workshop in -- in the center of Paris, but not in a -- some kind of elegant district.</span> <span id="s1559">How this was done was incredible.</span> <span id="s1560">They would bring -- she would go every once in awhile to Yugoslavia and she would recruit one or two tailors and they would bring half the village along.</span> <span id="s1561">Now this was -- they were all working, you know, illegally, and every so often the f -- the -- the -- the French government would -- would simply raid these places, and they would go -- they would go back.</span> <span id="s1562">And then after awhile another village</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">A: -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1565">They were somewhere, they were actually like sweatshops, I think, they were put up in -- and yet they were very anxious to come.</span> <span id="s1566">This was beautiful stuff, you know, silk lined with -- fantastically finished and so on.</span> <span id="s1567">I mean, I can’t imagine that there were that many wonderful Serbian tailors, most of them were Serbs.</span> <span id="s1568">Whole villages would come, and in connection with this there was a very funny -- funny, sad incident, what can I say?</span> <span id="s1569">There were very many Roma at the time, many Gypsies in -- in Paris, and they had an extremely bad reputation because what really happened was a number of Yugoslav or other Gypsies la -- ended up in Rome or in Italy, and they -- they were trained by -- I gu -- guys who turned them into, you know, pickpockets and this, that and the other.</span> <span id="s1570">They lived at the end of the town and they really were pretty obvious everywhere, on every street.</span> <span id="s1571">And wi -- the French police is not terribly kind so they, you know, everybody felt sorry for them until they were -- somebody stole something from them, lots of kids that were pulling at your clothes and so on, and they was -- actually trained to do it.</span> <span id="s1572">They would be in Italy and that -- they -- obviously it was so easy to get somebody on a train, either from Yugoslavia or Italy or whatever and they’d end up in -- in Paris and they were on the streets and they slept anywhere, you know, like that.</span> <span id="s1573">And one day, very close to my house is this person, this Roma woman with a small child in her arms, and she hands me a piece of paper written on the letterhead of a convent on the outskirts of Paris, saying so and so has been -- has a very sick husband, or has been abandoned by -- by her -- by her husband and we beg of you, whoever sees this to please help her and so on.</span> <span id="s1574">This was -- you know, a little suspicious, anyhow, looking, although the tone was right and the -- this was tha -- so I read this in French and she says the husband -- that she came, that she was a refugee from Yugoslavia and so on.</span> <span id="s1575">But I read that, I start talking Croatian to her, and she practically faints on the street.</span> <span id="s1576">And I said, look, I’m not going to give you any kind of money, I don’t like the way this is going on, I mean, normally I would, but I really felt badly about this whole thing.</span> <span id="s1577">So -- as this was just across the street from my house, I went and I got her clothes for her, I got masses of food, I -- you know, thank you, thank you very much, this is fine.</span> <span id="s1578">So then two weeks later I get a call from my friend whose husband was, I think the ABC or CBS correspondent, guy by the name of Bernard Redmont, who lived at another part of Paris, totally different.</span> <span id="s1579">And h-he -- they -- you know, they were -- Redmont was in a very bad situation and actually had to leave the -- the States because he was implicated -- I don’t know whether implicated, but he was in those McCarthy trials --</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">Q: Mm-hm, in the 50’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">A: -- in the 50’s and they left and they lived in France, and so on.</span> <span id="s1582">And we were very good friends with both of them, they’re in Boston now.</span> <span id="s1583">In fact, he was -- he was the dean of the journalism school, and -- at B.U. for awhile.</span> <span id="s1584">So Joan, who is the naïveté personified and very kind says to me, Lucie, there i -- there’s a compatriot of yours on my doorst -- and I said yeah.</span> <span id="s1585">She [indecipherable] her husband, and she reads me this letter from a French nun.</span> <span id="s1586">I se -- I said, this is very nice, give her whatever you want.</span> <span id="s1587">She was inviting her in.</span> <span id="s1588">Then another day this same friend calls me and she said she had a wonderful bargain.</span> <span id="s1589">There was three ladies, Romas, but they were called Gypsies at that time still, who had come from Czechoslovakia and they had these most wonderful silks.</span> <span id="s1590">Joan had -- used to have her clothes made still, and she bought these I don’t know how many cuts for suits and dresses and so on, all of which, you know, had been smuggled in to -- it’s fine, I don’t care, it’s just not a problem for me.</span> <span id="s1591">But this -- thi-this she was -- she was very naïve about stuff like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">A: So the -- this was still around there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: Listen, stop we -- stop me when I start digressing like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1597">No more talking about Paris and those days.</span> <span id="s1598">So you were in Paris until -- I see by your notes --</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">Q: You were in until -- you went back to Mexico --</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">A: We went back to Mexico --</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: -- in the late 70’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: In ’77, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">A: And this was the time when Morris was named, very [indecipherable] Director General, or -- for Latin America, for the AP.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A: Which meant that he was supposed to run the Mexico City bureau, more or less.</span> <span id="s1608">It was a lot of work.</span> <span id="s1609">And travel a great deal to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: Still reporting?</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">A: If he had --</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">A: Yeah, if he had -- it had been all at -- you -- you always report when you’re with the AP whether you do or not, but I mean, if there had been anything very important he would have.</span> <span id="s1616">But collecting money and doing all sorts of -- you know, work like that, meeting with publishers, getting new contracts, that kind of stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1618">So you were back in Mexico.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">A: So I was back in Mexico.</span> <span id="s1620">By that time my granddaughter was born, they came to visit.</span> <span id="s1621">Mary was still in school, I guess, I mean at -- at Yale, and we still had a lot of good friends in Mexico at the time.</span> <span id="s1622">One of my very intimate friends was a woman from Zagreb who -- who is a refugee.</span> <span id="s1623">She had gone again, via Italy to Cuba, to Mexico.</span> <span id="s1624">And her husband, her ex-husband had been in the watch business in Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s1625">And she had opened a boutique for women’s clothes, and had stayed in Mexico, she’s still there.</span> <span id="s1626">She’s a few years older than I am.</span> <span id="s1627">Her name is Sophia Condon.</span> <span id="s1628">And she got divorced from her Yugoslav husband and I think he died just very recently in Geneva.</span> <span id="s1629">Remarried, and I saw her pretty much daily, because -- well maybe not daily, but certainly twice a week, maybe twice a week, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">Q: So with -- you went back and you -- just the two of you then, your girls were both -- one was married --</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">A: One was married with a small child and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">Q: -- and one was in college.</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">A: -- one was in college, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">A: The person who was with us was Celia Sadna, who was the housekeeper who’d been with us since the children were very small, and she went to Paris with us, she was with us all this time and she came to Mexico with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s1637">She Yugoslav?</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">A: Basque.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q: Basque?</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">A: Basque.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1642">Celia, I thought maybe --</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s1645">Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">A: Basque.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">Q: It’s so interesting to me to hear you -- to put together this picture that from the time you left Zagreb, you lived in so many different places, but you kept your connections.</span> <span id="s1648">And I -- and your identity as a Yugoslav --</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">Q: -- all throughout that time --</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q: -- which so many people did not do.</span> <span id="s1653">And, you know, people -- others -- Holocaust survivors that I’ve talked to, they -- they didn’t more around as much as you did.</span> <span id="s1654">And you also were brought up in kind of a cosmopolitan atmosphere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">Q: So that was some -- second nature to you in a way to be moving around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">A: That’s true too, but I -- there was another great plus and that was that Morris was connected to Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s1658">He had been there during World War II.</span> <span id="s1659">He opened the -- what was known as the American library in Belgrade and in Zagreb and he had many Yugoslav friends.</span> <span id="s1660">Very many.</span> <span id="s1661">And that was part of it.</span> <span id="s1662">He was interested in that culture.</span> <span id="s1663">He -- he was very fond of -- of -- of these Yugslav that he had met.</span> <span id="s1664">And he never really learned to speak, but he understands quite well and h-he -- h-he can get along there.</span> <span id="s1665">Not grammatically very caref -- ver-ver-very, let’s say correctly, but he can make himself understood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">A: And he’s very attached to the whole place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">A: It’s a strange thing, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">Q: That’s nice for you, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1672">So it wasn’t, you know, keep away from these old stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1674">So it never really disappeared from your life, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">Q: -- that world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q: You were in touch with it all along.</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">A: No.</span> <span id="s1680">And there are people, including my cou -- my cousin, who thinks that I’m too heavily immersed in it.</span> <span id="s1681">And for awhile, you know, there are -- there are periods when -- I mean, obviously I’ll visit my friends that I was in touch with and whom I called in Zagreb, and some were schoolmates and some were friends and so on.</span> <span id="s1682">But I never, never lost th -- and my cousin says that I’m over involved.</span> <span id="s1683">And I think I got specially involved when I started working in the museum --</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">A: -- because all of the stuff started sort of floating to the surface, and -- and -- and I felt as long as I can contribute at least the language and some background to this, that I wanted to.</span> <span id="s1686">And that’s when I started reading more and more of the stuff, and that’s -- I won’t say I speak contemporary Croatian.</span> <span id="s1687">I mean, I -- I do, but they -- they’ve been changing things around unnecessarily lately, I mean they -- there’s a very interesting book that Morris just read, a-about the manipulation of language in Yugoslavia, and -- as politics.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">A: They suddenly, for instance in -- in -- in -- during the Ustaša regime and then during Tudjman, they were inventing words from that yid -- not even inventing, let’s say adapting medieval words to the m-modern language, so you know, this -- this was a forced thing --</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">Q: To make a political point --</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">A: -- to make a political point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">Q: And the point was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">A: And the point was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">A: -- we have a thousand now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">Q: Now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">A: Now.</span> <span id="s1698">Croats have a very exclusive culture that goes back [speaks Croatian here] a thousand years culture, and -- which was to say, you know, forget the others, we had it.</span> <span id="s1699">That is [indecipherable] in a way.</span> <span id="s1700">Or -- or -- or as a cousin of mine, as an uncle of mine once said, what are you talking about?</span> <span id="s1701">Everybody had an ancestor, you kn -- when somebody was bragging about something like that.</span> <span id="s1702">But there is a di -- th-there -- there is again -- they’re coming back to this, I mean, after Tudjman immediately there was -- there was a little bit of a -- of a lull, but they’re doing it again.</span> <span id="s1703">They’re -- they’re -- they’re inventing words, ad -- you know, adapting medieval words to the modern language.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s1705">Let me -- let’s talk about how you -- you came back to Washington in 1979 I see?</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">Q: And you’ve been here ever since?</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">A: I’ve been here ever since.</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">Q: At that time, 1979 - 1980, as I mentioned before, there was this very, you know, what I call a reawakening of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">Q: -- growth, of interest and knowledge about the Holocaust in this country --</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">Q: -- among Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">Q: And did you -- did you notice that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1717">In fact, I was at some sort of meeting when it was -- when -- when there were -- was talk of will this Holocaust museum be built or not.</span> <span id="s1718">Elie Wiesel spoke.</span> <span id="s1719">I didn’t know whether I liked the idea or not.</span> <span id="s1720">I think there probably was something in me still that said low profile is better.</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">Q: As a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">A: As a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">Q: Self defense, then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">Q: Instinct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1727">Is it necessary to put up a huge museum like that?</span> <span id="s1728">Hoo, you know, we all know what it is, let’s write books about it.</span> <span id="s1729">Is this necessary?</span> <span id="s1730">I think it was extremely necessary.</span> <span id="s1731">I think it’s very good.</span> <span id="s1732">It’s very good not -- not so much the presence, but the -- the scholarship that’s going on, which would not exist without it.</span> <span id="s1733">I mean, there would be people doing little bits and pieces without rhyme or reason, I th -- I’m no -- rhyme or reason is not the word, but I mean it would be --</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">Q: Without focus, wi -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">A: -- without focus.</span> <span id="s1736">I think it’s extremely important.</span> <span id="s1737">And I d -- I didn’t think so at the beginning, but I think it’s really evolved very beautifully.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">A: Yeah, that -- that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">Q: So at what point did -- do you remember when the museum opened?</span> <span id="s1741">Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">A: I remember when the museum opened.</span> <span id="s1743">Yes, very soon afterwards, I went to -- to -- to see it.</span> <span id="s1744">I went with my cousin and I remember using the computers upstairs and I mean, whatever it was that we -- we dredged up, Jasenovac, which I believe was either misspelled or something was wrong, and we were kind of put off.</span> <span id="s1745">And then I went, obviously through them -- through the permanent exhibit and everything else, and it was horrifying.</span> <span id="s1746">I was also, at that time very much upset that there was hardly anything on Yugoslavia, very little.</span> <span id="s1747">But then, it really isn’t surprising because, you know, how many Yugoslav Jews, or how many Yugoslavs really survived who went through it, and there was very little left.</span> <span id="s1748">Now, I did not mention that at the very beginning, when -- when Yugoslav Jews started coming to New York er -- in the 40’s, they bought a plot in the -- in -- in -- in New Jersey where they formed a ci -- a cemetery, which is now quite full.</span> <span id="s1749">And this apparently is very much what happens, because there were groups from Germany, from Austria, from who knows, the Bukovina and so on, who had plots of their own.</span> <span id="s1750">And that’s where it is, in New Jersey, in fair -- fair -- Fairview mew -- New Jersey.</span> <span id="s1751">And there was an association of Yugoslav Jews in the United States, which worked on A, helping people who -- who were totally, you know, bereft of everything and try -- got visas, worked with the State department, worked with various other governments, helped with this restitution business that I told you about.</span> <span id="s1752">And then there was this terrible incident of Oswego, which I don’t know whether you know anything about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">Q: I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1755">It was a group of people who were saved in Italy, mostly Yugoslav Jews who were brought here.</span> <span id="s1756">Roosevelt promised, I don’t know, a thousand people to be able to come in and they came and they were put behind barbed wire in Oswego.</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">Q: New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">A: New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">Q: Detained for what reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">A: They weren’t detained, they were brought here and -- but they were, I guess, enemy aliens or whatever they were, and they all -- thi-this was one of the my -- one of the most traumatic experiences of my life.</span> <span id="s1761">I don’t know whether I spoke about that, or I ca --</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">Q: Mm-mm, mm-mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">A: -- not to you, but maybe in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">Q: Not in the video interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">A: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1767">I don’t -- I saw that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">Q: -- I -- I don’t remember this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">A: Well, this was a terrible story.</span> <span id="s1771">One day we were told by Voice of America that I should go with a -- with a -- somebody with a recorder to the docks in New York because a ship was arriving with --</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">Q: What year was this, roughly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">A: ’47, maybe?</span> <span id="s1774">’46 - ’47 -- bringing refugees who were being given shelter in the United States and most of them were Yugoslavs.</span> <span id="s1775">So I was sent by Voice of America with some, as I said -- was about to say cameramen.</span> <span id="s1776">There were some cameramen as a matter of fact, too, but mostly sound people.</span> <span id="s1777">And we got there and this group of people started coming out and they recognized me, a bunch of them, and they started asking about my brother, who -- so this was very shortly after the end of war, maybe the war was still on.</span> <span id="s1778">Yeah, the war was still -- and -- and I had to yell over, you know, hundreds of people to tell them there was no Mario any more.</span> <span id="s1779">And then another somebody came and so on.</span> <span id="s1780">And they looked like absolute hell.</span> <span id="s1781">These were people who had been living in Italy and doing quite well.</span> <span id="s1782">Had already, you know, gotten things from the various Jewish organizations and had sort of pulled themselves together, but here was the possibility of going to the United States, so wow, great.</span> <span id="s1783">And it was great, in the end.</span> <span id="s1784">But they came and they were not allowed -- we were behind -- we had barricades, this was yelling through barricades.</span> <span id="s1785">First thing that happened when they arrived, they made -- before they arrived, they made them give all the clothes, which these people had bought with whatever was left over, let’s, you know, do a bella figura when you arrive here.</span> <span id="s1786">And they were thrown into i -- i -- it’s -- i-it to be a -- deloused and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1787">So you got rags.</span> <span id="s1788">Everything lost its color.</span> <span id="s1789">They sprayed them with DDT, all these people, I don’t know whether it -- probably DDT, it was awful, they were delousing them and so on.</span> <span id="s1790">So these were people who had been living a more or less normal life in Italy, who suddenly came.</span> <span id="s1791">So then it was this big committee, they took them to Oswego into an ex-army camp and put them behind wires -- I mean, behind -- behind -- I think there was even, if I’m not mistaken a -- a -- you know, wire.</span> <span id="s1792">And was a big scandal.</span> <span id="s1793">And I remember my father, who at that time I think was the vice-president or whatever, secretary of this association of Yugoslav Jews that were going there to try to calm these people down, who were ju -- a great many were Yugoslav Jews, not all, but a great many as this -- you know, they -- they picked them up in Italy, these -- these people had already been saved, I mean, you know.</span> <span id="s1794">They were in no danger.</span> <span id="s1795">And so first, you know, this -- this was a whole [indecipherable] and I don’t know exactly how -- well, they fe -- it got to be where the point where Mrs. Roosevelt went there to intervene and one day one of these people turned themselves up -- turned up at our door, one of the women who knew where I was, about maybe two or three years younger than I am.</span> <span id="s1796">Friend of my brothers.</span> <span id="s1797">Suddenly she was at our front door in New York on Riverside Drive, and she spent the night we -- my father and sister, she had to go back because otherwise she would have been, I don’t know, I guess a criminal or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">A: And finally with -- I don’t know exactly how long they stayed there -- but there was a film about them, about this ship coming over.</span> <span id="s1800">Maybe Ruth Grube or someone like that worked on it and they -- as I said quo -- many many of -- there -- there’s some of them still here, one of them is a woman who lives in -- in Baltimore, who -- who was a -- a child then, a little girl and so on.</span> <span id="s1801">I don’t remember how long it took.</span> <span id="s1802">So that kind of stuff the Yugoslav di -- association did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">Q: And I’d -- I would think that would be so traumatic for you, only because here these were people you knew, who knew you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">Q: -- and you were on the other side of the fence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">A: Yes, completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">Q: Metaphorically speaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">A: I was, I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">Q: And literally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">A: I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">Q: You -- you could have been them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">A: Oh, absolutely --</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">Q: It must have --</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">A: -- absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">Q: -- must have been very clear to you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">A: Abso --</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">Q: -- at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">A: It was.</span> <span id="s1819">I mean, this was th-the -- the people who were practically -- some my age, some a little younger.</span> <span id="s1820">Maybe a little younger than me.</span> <span id="s1821">I don’t know what -- I told you this was the -- my generation that just went.</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">Q: You know, since I’ve seen your interview, the first interview when you told the story about how your father got you out and -- and how he must have been planning this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">Q: And you must have given a lot of thought over the years to what a remarkable thing that was, and [indecipherable] --</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">Q: -- and you know, wondering if you would have survived if you hadn’t got out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">A: I knew I wouldn’t have.</span> <span id="s1828">I -- obviously I was sturdier than I am now and I would have probably tried to get into the mountains and so on.</span> <span id="s1829">But, you know, I -- I was well known.</span> <span id="s1830">No-Not well, I mean this is ridiculous.</span> <span id="s1831">If anybody had been after me, they would have known how to get me.</span> <span id="s1832">I mean, I -- I was not anonymous.</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">Q: You would have been on lists.</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">Q: [indecipherable] the whole family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">Q: So, how do -- after all these years, how do you think about that, how do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">A: I think that my father was extremely determined and courageous, and I think of him, you know, as a man in the best years of his life, I guess, just deciding so, okay, wi -- nevermind, if things work out, we’ll come back.</span> <span id="s1839">And I think this was really behind his thinking most of the time.</span> <span id="s1840">And if not -- and you know, he was terribly hurt -- I can’t [indecipherable] I can’t describe the trauma of a father losing an only son, although I was extremely close to my father, it wasn’t that I felt, you know, in any way because I was a girl that -- that I counted for any less.</span> <span id="s1841">But there da -- I guess there was planning what was going to be with -- with -- with a -- a son and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">Q: And a business and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">A: And the businesses and so on.</span> <span id="s1844">They must have been.</span> <span id="s1845">And he was -- he never carried on, he -- possibly because he had been in a war, possibly because so many of -- others of our friends on all sides were killed.</span> <span id="s1846">I -- I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">Q: What do you mean he never carried on?</span> <span id="s1848">He never --</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">A: He -- he was -- he -- he was consoling us.</span> <span id="s1850">He wasn’t sitting there, you know, shedding tears constantly, constantly, constantly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">Q: And not bitter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">A: He was not bitter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">Q: That’s pretty amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">A: He was not bitter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">Q: Given what he left behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">Q: And the life he left behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1859">No, I don’t think he ever really worried about that too much.</span> <span id="s1860">It -- it was a -- you know, it was a paternalistic st -- society altogether, and I felt strange echoes of this much later.</span> <span id="s1861">I came, for instance, to Belgrade and we saw Morris’s secretary, who was an old lady, and who recently died -- I think she may have been a hun -- just under a hundred.</span> <span id="s1862">She was the oldest person born in Belgrade who died.</span> <span id="s1863">So she was probably 98 or so.</span> <span id="s1864">She had been evacuated during World War I, to England.</span> <span id="s1865">So anyhow, he go -- he -- Morris, when they opened this reading room there, this lady Vera Wynik was one of the secretaries and they -- she had a terrible time because of the communists wanted -- were -- were threatening her in a horrible way.</span> <span id="s1866">They -- they wanted whatever secrets, there were no secrets, but they wanted all kinds of information, which she refused to give.</span> <span id="s1867">And they were harassing her to an awful -- in an awful way, and Morris -- Morris felt -- heard about it later, and he didn’t know, I mean, she was about to commit suicide, and it’s a very sad story.</span> <span id="s1868">So he was very close to her and he -- he was constantly in touch here and we -- she gave me some of those icons that were there, and -- so, a wonderful woman, whom we visited in Belgrade all -- the first time we went back.</span> <span id="s1869">And she said to me, do -- I-I’m going back to the paternalistic societies that were going on then -- she said to me, you know, when your father came to visit me, he -- because my father went back to Yugoslavia way before we did and Morris said, would you please visit Vera Wynik, giver her my love, see what she needs and so on.</span> <span id="s1870">Do that.</span> <span id="s1871">Fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lucie Rosenberg.</span> <span id="s1874">This is tape number four, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">A: Apparently, before my father came to visit, they already knew -- somebody from the secret service came to see her and said -- or maybe -- maybe he had just either phoned her or they got together at the very beginning, and said I understand that Manfred Sternberg has come to visit you.</span> <span id="s1876">What have you got with Manfred Sternberg?</span> <span id="s1877">And apparently she said, he is the broth -- he is the -- the father-in-law of an old friend of ours and so on, who was so and so.</span> <span id="s1878">They knew anyhow.</span> <span id="s1879">And this ke -- person kept insisting and insisting and insisting, a very high up person in the -- in -- in the Secret Service, the OZNA, which was the scary thing, I mean that was the secret police in spades.</span> <span id="s1880">Turns out that this was a boy who my father had given scholarships to.</span> <span id="s1881">He was -- I knew nothing about this, absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s1882">He was the son of the workman in -- outside, where the factory was, outside Zagreb, and he was apparently a talented kid, whom his parents, I think after, I mean, four years or fi -- of -- of -- or whatever it was, I think maybe it was six years of -- of -- of elementary school, pulled out of school and he would have probably been, you know, working on the fi -- in the fields or whatever.</span> <span id="s1883">And my father knew that this was a very smart kid, and he apparently gave him a scholar -- gave -- gave the parents, I don’t know, the money for this kid to go -- go through high school.</span> <span id="s1884">And this was then some great big -- I mean, he went through the partisans and so on.</span> <span id="s1885">And he kept asking Vera Wynik about me, and that if ever I ca -- and the next time, when we came, he knew exactly when that we were coming and he asked Vera to -- for me to get in tou -- I -- I had no idea who this was.</span> <span id="s1886">I mean, when I heard the name I knew he was somebody from -- from -- from the village.</span> <span id="s1887">I mean, where would I be interested for a little boy who was three or four years younger than I was, you know?</span> <span id="s1888">He knew about my brother.</span> <span id="s1889">He knew absolutely everything.</span> <span id="s1890">And I found out that my father had sent him through school, you know, forever.</span> <span id="s1891">And I know we were never permitted to be near anything like that with the -- the -- you know, they had these Christmas things where kids got dressed for winter and you know, and clothes and books, and this, that and the other, which we weren’t -- had no idea about them.</span> <span id="s1892">We were totally excluded because these were kids, you know, some of them were in school with us at the same time, some were younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">A: These were kids that I knew around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">A: Never a word about that.</span> <span id="s1897">So I’m saying this -- this paternalism had two sides to it, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1899">And he was -- he was just questioning her, or interrogating her for some --</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">A: I thi -- she was terrified --</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">A: -- because this was the secret police.</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">Q: Well, but she --</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">A: Why do they know that Manfred Sternberg is visiting her --</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">A: -- and who is this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">Q: But he really had --</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">A: -- and he was interrogating me, and then finally I met him.</span> <span id="s1909">Finally I met him, the second time I came back and she was saying something to me that, you know, I was a very young woman then.</span> <span id="s1910">She said -- Vera said, you know he’s got some kind of a notion about you and he is sure to be disappointed.</span> <span id="s1911">I don’t know whether you need to see him.</span> <span id="s1912">He is not -- I don’t know, I guess maybe he’s still alive.</span> <span id="s1913">He finally -- when I came back the first time to the village, one of the village women told me that, you know so and so?</span> <span id="s1914">He’s got a big estate up in -- she showed me up the road and that’s when I -- when I realized that, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1916">What was it like -- I want to ask you a couple things, I -- I have left here.</span> <span id="s1917">What was it like for you in the early 90’s when war started again in Yugoslavia, when Yugoslavia started to break up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">A: I was heartbroken.</span> <span id="s1919">I thought it was terrible.</span> <span id="s1920">First of all the violence that, you know, the thought that you can’t go through two generations without having a war.</span> <span id="s1921">I knew it was going to be awful for everybody around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">Q: Were you surprised?</span> <span id="s1923">You -- you couldn’t have been too surprised at --</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">Q: You’d been going back and forth --</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">Q: -- and you had a sense of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">Q: -- the tension there after Tito died, especially.</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1933">No, I -- I wasn’t surprised.</span> <span id="s1934">What I was surprised at was the horrible violence, all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">Q: Yeah, the political breaking apart wasn’t a surprise.</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">A: N-No, because -- yeah, I -- I was reading papers, I w -- I was in touch with people.</span> <span id="s1937">Every once in awhile I would -- I would hear from friends and there would be snide remarks, wherever I was there were snide remarks about Croats.</span> <span id="s1938">In Belgrade there were more than snide remarks, in Zagreb about people in Belgrade.</span> <span id="s1939">Not to mention that I guess whatever was a communist party that at one time may have been very idealistic or certainly, you know, that had deteriorated into all sorts of unpleasant things.</span> <span id="s1940">And there was some really unpleasant consumption goi -- you gop -- you know, there -- there was money being spent on -- on -- on these huge hotels that were being built in -- in -- in -- say in Dubrovnik was importing bathroom fixtures instead of trying to, you know, bring your own.</span> <span id="s1941">I mean he -- they were spending millions of dinars or whatev -- yeah, dinars by importing stuff from -- from Italy and so on and it -- well, you could see that it was going to start falling apart and there were constantly intrigues left and right.</span> <span id="s1942">It had --</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">A: What I was doing here though, for awhile, was teaching English to various people who were going for the State department, for the Commerce department and so on.</span> <span id="s1945">No, the Commerce didn’t, most of them were State department people.</span> <span id="s1946">There were these various language schools, commercial language schools which had -- it was a [indecipherable] thing.</span> <span id="s1947">You would be hired, and you would go there for six weeks or -- or -- or three months or whatever and then somebody said you don’t need to come tomorrow any more.</span> <span id="s1948">And you know, I -- I could survive, but there were people who were doing this who could not survive, and they were all over the place.</span> <span id="s1949">And I taught maybe in three or four of them anywhere in Arlington, some were even further out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">Q: You were teaching English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">A: It was taught -- teaching English to people who were going to go for it, mostly the State department to Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s1952">And there were a couple of [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">Q: You were teaching it to -- English to who --</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">A: I mean I was teaching Croatian to English --</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">A: -- speakers, obviously.</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">A: And that was very interesting.</span> <span id="s1959">Then there were a couple of women from -- and there the -- the Croatian Serbian, they also exploded very often in a very strange way, because [indecipherable] people who were teaching who wa -- who was teaching along with me was this -- they were teaching Croatian and they were teaching Serbian, you had both things.</span> <span id="s1960">Everybody was politically involved one way or another and there was a young Serbian priest who harassed some smart American women who were working in the Defense department.</span> <span id="s1961">He harassed them to the point where they were weeping, and -- and then went to somebody and said wasn’t work -- couldn’t quite work out what -- what I was, I mean, you’re not a Croatian, you’re not na -- you know, like that.</span> <span id="s1962">And very unpleasant things were -- were going on.</span> <span id="s1963">But for awhile I -- I didn’t feel like, you know, bothering with this.</span> <span id="s1964">And then I worked for Voice of America again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">Q: Oh you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">Q: Here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">Q: During what years, roughly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">A: Might be 80’s, early 80’s?</span> <span id="s1971">Started off a very nice guy who became head of the -- when it was still a Yugoslav desk, but then it became divided into Croatian, and the Slovenian desk was always apart, but suddenly we had a -- a Croatian desk and a Serbian desk and a this and a that and speakers from all over.</span> <span id="s1972">And I was doing translations there.</span> <span id="s1973">No, it started out as follows, one [indecipherable] this guy, this friend of ours had just retired and turned over -- he’s a Serb from Belgrade who Morris also gave his first job.</span> <span id="s1974">He was a prisoner of war in Germany and Morris gave him a first job.</span> <span id="s1975">And then it turned out he was one of the best friends of my cousin’s husband.</span> <span id="s1976">He -- he was, for quite awhile handled the Yugoslav desk.</span> <span id="s1977">And he retired and then I started working --</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">Q: Do you remember his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">A: Yes, Slavko Tutorovich.</span> <span id="s1980">He’s alive, he’s -- he’s in -- here.</span> <span id="s1981">His wife was my best friend for a long time here, she died unfortunately of cancer and I miss her terribly.</span> <span id="s1982">He -- very conservative person, but nevermind, was -- both of them, and now has turned out to be really a Serb Nationalist who -- I won’t go into that, we don’t talk about that because when we go talk about that, that’s the end.</span> <span id="s1983">But -- and -- and there’s a lot of conspi -- conspiracy theory about America really, I mean, is in cahoots with everybody against the Serbs.</span> <span id="s1984">So, that’s -- I -- I -- I don’t want to -- but, we said, the problem is, you know, talking about something else.</span> <span id="s1985">But he’s very nice otherwise.</span> <span id="s1986">Anyhow, at first I was doing -- I was given the scripts and I was doing translations here and just turning them over to the [indecipherable] just -- I hate to say what kind of garbage lot -- I mean, what kind of -- of -- of -- you know, waste of time, money, whatever you want, these things were.</span> <span id="s1987">It was just awful, especially the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1988">They’re filled with nothing.</span> <span id="s1989">Like for instance -- trying to think.</span> <span id="s1990">A feature [coughs] excuse me -- about that movie “Old Yeller.”</span> <span id="s1991">[coughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">Q: Do you want to get a drink?</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1994">[tape break].</span> <span id="s1995">You know, 10 minute, 15 -- 10 -- 10 minute feature, I think.</span> <span id="s1996">Very boring.</span> <span id="s1997">But they were in Croatian and I was the Croatian voice, okay?</span> <span id="s1998">So then after awhile some of the women, and I think they -- they were right, one of the Serbian woman decided that my voice was too old.</span> <span id="s1999">I can’t agree more.</span> <span id="s2000">A -- you -- you can tell.</span> <span id="s2001">Although this was maybe 10 years ago.</span> <span id="s2002">But yes, if you listen to it you can tell this is not a young person.</span> <span id="s2003">Okay, doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s2004">It wasn’t -- it wasn’t anything that was -- you know, about rock and roll.</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">A: And -- although probably that should have been done.</span> <span id="s2007">Then -- then I did a -- a -- a few newscasts and so on.</span> <span id="s2008">And then the whole thing started exploding and one day the guy who -- who succeeded Slavka Tutoravich, who’s still alive now and so on, in fact, we’re about the same age, said again from one day to the next, you know we don’t have a budget, you don’t have to come tomorrow.</span> <span id="s2009">Was hugely furious because I think I was -- you know, at least should have had, you know, two days notice or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">Q: And this was during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">A: This -- no, I do-don’t know --</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">A: -- when, no, not necessarily.</span> <span id="s2014">But during very tense times, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">A: Very, very tense times.</span> <span id="s2017">You could tell that Yugoslavia was falling apart, and this was very evident on that desk, I mean, they were in each other’s hair in the most awful way.</span> <span id="s2018">Although the head of, I guess what’s known as the Yugoslav desk, is a woman by the name of Mya, I forget the surname now, who was a Croat.</span> <span id="s2019">And she still is.</span> <span id="s2020">But obviously with an American citizenship [indecipherable] and so on.</span> <span id="s2021">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2023">I want to ask you also a little bit in more detail about your work at the museum and when did you -- when did you start -- it’s volunteering that you were doing down there, translating and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">Q: Tell me about how yo -- how did you get involved, why did you get involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">A: Well, I received one of the bulletins and I saw that they had a grant for a year for a young man -- a young scholar, Canadian scholar who had just come -- who -- who was just doing translations and make -- no, not doing translations, sorting and arranging and trying to get under this huge material that they had gotten from Zagreb, from the archives of Zagreb, and this -- I don’t know exactly how this worked, but they had sent over somebody who -- who had microfilmed or whatever all of this material which was then there and it was there and nobody did anything with it.</span> <span id="s2027">I don’t know how long this had been going on.</span> <span id="s2028">And this young man was in the process of publishing a book on the Croatian peasant party, which he eventually did in English, and was very good.</span> <span id="s2029">I think it was very good.</span> <span id="s2030">And who then went back for the museum, I [indecipherable] but I’m no -- yeah, I guess for the museum to partly -- to Zagreb, three years ago [indecipherable] three years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s2031">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">A: And was trying to get more stuff and so on from the archives.</span> <span id="s2033">I -- this is a scholar and he really doesn’t know how to push and penetrate.</span> <span id="s2034">And when he came back to Zagreb the second time they suddenly, the -- the -- the [indecipherable] whoever was in charge of -- of -- of permitting you to have paper, to have -- to microwave, or -- not microwave, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">Q: Microfilm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">A: -- microfilm, or -- or make copies or -- of any kind of m-material that you found, only permitted them, I don’t know, like eight a day or something crazy like that.</span> <span id="s2037">And he is a ver -- not shy, but he is a retiring young man, and he didn't know how to say listen, I am doing so and so, this is the book I have written now, and so on, I want this.</span> <span id="s2038">He just didn’t do it.</span> <span id="s2039">And I met him on a couple of occasions, I think there were other distractions there, but I don’t know what they were.</span> <span id="s2040">And he -- he didn’t finish everything that needed to be done there, I don’t think, for his --</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">Q: Research.</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">A: -- for hi -- for -- for -- for -- not for the museum, but for his own sake.</span> <span id="s2043">And he had met both Goldsteins, and Ivo Goldstein is also a historian and he told them, listen, you just simply have to go there and -- and push and say and get in touch with so and so.</span> <span id="s2044">He didn't do it.</span> <span id="s2045">He is working for the Canadian government now and trying to get another academic job and I hope he gets it.</span> <span id="s2046">This is a nice young man but -- but -- but not sufficiently, let’s say aggressive in that way.</span> <span id="s2047">Also, he asked me several times did I know Dr. Mirjana Gross.</span> <span id="s2048">A-And Mirjana Gross is my friend Faya’s childhood friend.</span> <span id="s2049">I didn’t know her, but I knew who she was.</span> <span id="s2050">She is the professor of history and I think mostly 18th and 19th cr -- century Croatian history.</span> <span id="s2051">So exactly the -- the -- the -- that era that he was writing on and so on, and a great expert on the Croatian peasant party and so on.</span> <span id="s2052">And I got them together and I practically -- and Mirjana Gross had to pull it out of him, she wanted a book, both for the -- for the department -- or for the -- for the library, and for herself.</span> <span id="s2053">I mean, he had been asking me for -- and he kept, you know, oh, I don’t know, do I have enough, [indecipherable] you know, and sh -- did -- he did.</span> <span id="s2054">And then she said, well I hope you’re going to ini -- to initiate it -- yeah, to -- to initial it for me and he did, finally.</span> <span id="s2055">He’s just not aggressive enough, but he’s a good scholar.</span> <span id="s2056">He says he’s an excellent scholar of Croatian stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">A: Anyhow, I saw that he was here and that the stuff was there and I called him because I saw he was Canadian and I had my doubts about cron -- Canadian Croatian scholars, I didn’t know what this was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">Q: Can you say his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">A: Ah, wait a minute.</span> <span id="s2061">This is -- really should be [indecipherable], I’ll get it in a second.</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">A: Can you -- can you -- [tape break] his book here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">A: His name was Mark Biondich.</span> <span id="s2066">He’s a very talented young man and did really excellent scholarly work on the -- on -- on this particular part of Croatian history.</span> <span id="s2067">And he was a scholar in residence for a year there, and -- although this -- this really wasn’t -- wasn’t his -- his -- his -- let’s say his branch of -- he knew very little about Jewish history.</span> <span id="s2068">He knew a lot about -- about what the Ustaša did and so on, that he was well informed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">A: But on the other hand, he couldn’t put a face to any of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">A: And he and I together went through these documents, through these microfiches and ran into absolutely the most unbelievable stuff.</span> <span id="s2073">I mean the -- whole classes of people I knew and friends and schoolmates of my brother’s.</span> <span id="s2074">And people -- I mean, the most unbelievable things.</span> <span id="s2075">This was done mostly alphabetically.</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">Q: These were records of Jews that had been rounded up?</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">A: Were killed.</span> <span id="s2080">And in connection with this, for instance, later on, we -- [indecipherable] who was working on the project kept getting these -- these requests from people to see whether they knew what happened to their brothers, to their parents and so on.</span> <span id="s2081">And we got a request from a woman in California looking for her father and her uncles and so on.</span> <span id="s2082">And we immediately found the various uncles and so on.</span> <span id="s2083">And then we found her name listed as perished at the [indecipherable] place, which we sent her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">A: [indecipherable] person.</span> <span id="s2086">And she had been -- she had come to Austria, sh -- her mother had smuggled her out with the help of a German officer and so on.</span> <span id="s2087">I mean, she was -- she came finally to the museum and it was -- she gave all sorts of mater -- of pictures and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s2088">She grew up in Vienna without knowing what her background was, although her mother was there and she went through -- she was in a Catholic school and she went through communion and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2090">It must have been --</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">A: The mother recently died.</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s2093">It must have been quite a bittersweet kind of experience for you to go through this material --</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">A: Yes, it was, yes it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2095">Q: -- to relive those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s2096">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">Q: And yet, to be able to contribute something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">A: It was extremely -- I really, I tell you, honored is not quite the word to say, but I felt it was -- I could contribute some way.</span> <span id="s2099">I mean, there are not that many Serbo -- Serbo-Croat speakers in -- in -- who have the time to do it in -- in Washington.</span> <span id="s2100">So I was extremely happy.</span> <span id="s2101">And of course, the material had just arrived.</span> <span id="s2102">I mean, this -- not just arrived, just been sorted out up to a certain point.</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">Q: And for you personally too, I would think it filled in a picture --</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">A: Oh [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">Q: -- you know, around the edges, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">A: -- extremely so.</span> <span id="s2107">There were a number of things that I didn’t know about.</span> <span id="s2108">I also found, through some of the recordings, which I don’t know who paid for, I believe the museum must have paid for it -- for this.</span> <span id="s2109">There were some eyewitness stories and so on done by a guy who lives in London who’s a Sephardic Jew.</span> <span id="s2110">And I can’t remember his name right now, but he did it for the museum.</span> <span id="s2111">And he told the story of a young man who was my boyfriend, so to speak.</span> <span id="s2112">I mean, he -- he wasn’t, but he was, okay [indecipherable] a very nice young man who was a law student, who perished in the most incredible, dreadful, complicated way that one can only imagine.</span> <span id="s2113">He was a law student, he had been in the Yugoslav army, yo- you know, you had to do your year.</span> <span id="s2114">Sometimes it was postponed by a year if you happened to be a student, but no, in fact, when we left he had just finished his one year, he -- swaggering around in a very elegant uniform, with boots and so on.</span> <span id="s2115">Very, very good looking.</span> <span id="s2116">And -- although, I really wa -- you know, he was decorative, I wasn’t in love or anything like that, but maybe he was, I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s2117">I don’t know, but you know, he -- we went out a few -- we went out, you know, f -- we went out from here to there together.</span> <span id="s2118">It’s the going out that was going on and -- and he accompanied me under the guidance of everybody else to balls and there’s a thing when you were 18.</span> <span id="s2119">Until you were 18 you didn’t count as a human being.</span> <span id="s2120">And when you were 18 you went to the journalists ball, and then you were launched.</span> <span id="s2121">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">Q: Yeah, you mentioned that in your other interview, then you hated that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">A: -- it’s a parade, oh, I hated that.</span> <span id="s2124">Absolutely hated it.</span> <span id="s2125">But anyhow, he -- this young man was a law student, just finishing, I guess, not even that.</span> <span id="s2126">And he was caught with the first group of people, the first group of young Jewish -- and then I guess whatever pro [indecipherable] boys who were there, but mostly Jewish, I believe.</span> <span id="s2127">And they were taken to a -- to two camps.</span> <span id="s2128">But anyhow, he was -- finally he ended up in a camp in the Velebit mountains.</span> <span id="s2129">And he came -- and this was told to somebody who was -- who wa -- who was there, he -- this is told by a guy who --</span></p> <p><span id="s2130">Q: Saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s2131">A: -- saw it.</span> <span id="s2132">Who, by the way was a big -- became a career Yugoslav officer, he was a colonel.</span> <span id="s2133">And he was a sports person in Zagreb, I think he was a skiing champion or whatever, something like that.</span> <span id="s2134">So, this group was taken to this camp.</span> <span id="s2135">And as he had just pre -- previously been in the Yugoslav army, he knew that area and he was telling these guys, oh I know where this is, this is not bad, lik -- we’ll -- we’ll -- we’ll try and get, you know, get together and all of these things, and maybe it will work out and so on.</span> <span id="s2136">And as he was taken to this prison, a fr -- somebody from the same year of law school, not a friend but somebody he knew, who became a Ustaša officer, I believe, or maybe n -- anyhow, he was there and saw him.</span> <span id="s2137">And being a nice person, he wrote his parents say -- saying I saw Dragon today at such and such a place.</span> <span id="s2138">He didn’t say he’s alive, but that was obvious.</span> <span id="s2139">They were a fairly prominent family and -- and the parents took a postcard and wrote him a postcard saying, we’re in Zagreb, hope you’re okay, that’s it.</span> <span id="s2140">The commander of the camp saw this, this was intercepted and brought to the commander of the camp, the Ustaša, who said, how come your parents know where you are?</span> <span id="s2141">This guy had absolutely --</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">Q: No idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">A: -- I mean this had been -- this had been intercepted.</span> <span id="s2144">He never got the card from the parents.</span> <span id="s2145">He said, what are you talking about?</span> <span id="s2146">He says, you told your parents, you wrote your parents to say where you were.</span> <span id="s2147">He said, no I did not [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2148">And -- and -- and he executed him right there on the spot, he cut his head off.</span> <span id="s2149">I mean, this guy knows, who told this story.</span> <span id="s2150">This kind of material I was running into.</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">A: I mean, this -- this is somebody with -- I was photographed with, you know, standing behind me and I guess doing waltzes and stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">Q: Geez.</span></p> <p><span id="s2154">A: It -- it was just, you know.</span> <span id="s2155">And some of it -- y -- all of it was pretty devastating, but when this was some -- and the horrible part about this guy was that he begged my father the way we -- the day before we left, why don’t you take [indecipherable] we all going to get messed up, you are bu -- you know who you are, you -- you -- you know, you -- I can’t.</span> <span id="s2156">I would love to, I can’t do it, out of the question.</span> <span id="s2157">My mother was very fond of him, and I -- I was totally uninterested.</span> <span id="s2158">But I -- obviously, if I -- we -- we could have --</span></p> <p><span id="s2159">Q: Saved his life, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">A: -- helped him and saved, I mean, every -- everything would have done.</span> <span id="s2161">And it looked menacing, but it didn’t look quite as menacing as all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">Q: As that, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2165">A: And another friend like that, the German friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2167">So here you are, you know, 50 years later --</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">Q: -- re -- 60 years later, reading all these -- finding out things --</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">Q: -- about people you knew and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">Q: -- putting together this picture, more -- in more detail, because you already knew a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">A: I knew a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">Q: Because you’d been going back and forth all those years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">A: Yes, I knew a lot, but I certainly didn’t know what I found out in the museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">A: And not even vaguely.</span> <span id="s2179">Not even vaguely.</span> <span id="s2180">We knew that people were starving, but we didn’t know to what extent this went.</span> <span id="s2181">We knew that people were rounded up.</span> <span id="s2182">One of the touching stories that -- that came from the museum was a woman from a village -- End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lucie Rosenberg.</span> <span id="s2184">This is tape four, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">A: This woman tells the story.</span> <span id="s2186">She was -- I don’t know whether she was -- she -- she mu -- she was probably a peasant.</span> <span id="s2187">She says, we were standing there, and women -- and then later I think she wa -- she says Jewish women, but I don’t think she -- this was her first thought.</span> <span id="s2188">This must have been what [indecipherable] I mean suggested to her, maybe.</span> <span id="s2189">She said these women were coming in and they were obviously from town because they were walking with their pocket -- they had pocketbooks.</span> <span id="s2190">They had never s -- you know, this was not common in [indecipherable] where you had things in pockets, hidden pockets, or in -- in bandanas or whatever, like that.</span> <span id="s2191">But she said these were women from town and they were -- they were dressed with hats and -- and some had -- this came up later in the story, they -- some came with -- with children in -- in prams, you know, in -- what do you call those, strollers?</span> <span id="s2192">No, they didn’t have strollers, but whatever.</span> <span id="s2193">They wer -- had babies in th -- in baby carriages.</span> <span id="s2194">And -- and dressed with hats, maybe even gloves, who knows?</span> <span id="s2195">It’s just -- it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">Q: She had never seen that.</span> <span id="s2197">Or sh -- or that’s how she identif --</span></p> <p><span id="s2198">A: This -- this is how she identified these were people from town.</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2200">A: The [indecipherable] not at all.</span> <span id="s2201">I mean, she would have been --</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">A: -- she may not have been wearing a -- a full costume, but she was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2205">And what was the story she was telling about?</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">A: She was staring -- telling the story about women being rounded -- had been --</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">A: -- that had been rounded up, being marched into a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2209">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2210">A: Or maybe were already in a camp and she saw them marching them off to a -- to wherever the -- you know, whatever their quarters would have been.</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">A: And they would have, you know, people didn’t know, they got dressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2213">Q: They didn’t know where they were going.</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">A: No.</span> <span id="s2215">Pe-People had very little imagination at that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2216">Q: You know, it’s so interesting, I keep coming back to this, about your father having this foresight --</span></p> <p><span id="s2217">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2218">Q: -- to get out and in some ways that, you know, it’s because of the circles that he moved in.</span> <span id="s2219">He knew things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2220">A: Yes, he knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">Q: But these other people couldn’t have known, or -- or would not have known first hand and perhaps wouldn’t have been as ready to believe as he was, since he knew these people and he --</span></p> <p><span id="s2222">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2223">Q: -- sort of --</span></p> <p><span id="s2224">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">Q: -- probably had information that other people --</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">A: Yes, he -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2227">Q: -- wouldn’t be as likely to believe as he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2228">A: And would not have been -- and you know, one of his very close friends, and this is a very strange story, for years, was the Count Joseph Bombale.</span> <span id="s2229">And Joseph Bombale was his hunting com -- they were hunting companions.</span> <span id="s2230">And Bombale was a much better shot than my father, but they kind of --</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">Q: A count from where?</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">A: From Croatia.</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">Q: Oh, there were counts there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">A: There were counts --</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2236">A: -- galore.</span></p> <p><span id="s2237">Q: It was a kingdom, I g -- I for --</span></p> <p><span id="s2238">A: No, no, but this was -- they -- they -- th-this is a Napoleonic one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2239">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">A: And -- and -- and there were counts -- Austro-Hungarian, Hungarian, Croatian, I mean, counts, barons, plemeniti, what, I mean, there was -- there was a hierarchy of -- of --</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">Q: How do you say count in Croatian?</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">A: Grof.</span></p> <p><span id="s2243">Q: Grof.</span></p> <p><span id="s2244">A: Grof.</span> <span id="s2245">So this was Grof Joseph Bombale, who was a very close friend of my father’s.</span> <span id="s2246">And one of the things, of course, was that he was part of that consti -- it wasn’t a concern, it wa -- th -- this group of -- of agricultural manufacturers of alcohol that were -- that -- that was a -- what should I say, I -- it was a thi -- wi -- I -- I will say a -- you know, an organization that got together and so on.</span> <span id="s2247">And he -- he was part of it and he was absolutely a miserable businessman and my father tried to teach him what business was and so on.</span> <span id="s2248">And he had a particular significance for me because I’d known him from, you know, childhood on.</span> <span id="s2249">That point I was maybe 15 and came in and we shook hands and he kissed my hand and I knew I’d grown up.</span> <span id="s2250">I -- I -- maybe I had just come back from England, maybe I was 16.</span> <span id="s2251">Boy, I really had it.</span> <span id="s2252">And I thought he was a bachelor the rest -- for all my life, I was very -- we were close, I mean, Father was with him all the time.</span> <span id="s2253">Not all the time, but often.</span> <span id="s2254">When I’m here at a Slovistics conference, sitting and listening to something, and I had my tooth pulled just a couple of days earlier and I was still under all kinds of -- had been taking all kinds of -- of -- of -- of painkillers and I thought I wasn’t in my right mind.</span> <span id="s2255">I come to this one room and presenting is a Slovistics professor called Joseph Bombale.</span> <span id="s2256">So I said, have I gone out of my mind?</span> <span id="s2257">This was a bachelor when I left.</span> <span id="s2258">He was -- he was killed in Jasenovac also, by the way.</span> <span id="s2259">And rightly so.</span> <span id="s2260">And I went to him, I said, what’s going on?</span> <span id="s2261">And I said, is your aunt so and so?</span> <span id="s2262">Countess Nun-Nundine?</span> <span id="s2263">Married a swi -- a -- a Dutch what would you call it, a dut -- a Dutch diplomat.</span> <span id="s2264">He said yes.</span> <span id="s2265">I said, is your aunt so and so, Josephine?</span> <span id="s2266">He said yes.</span> <span id="s2267">I said, my God, I thought Joseph Bombale was a bachelor.</span> <span id="s2268">And he said, that does not mean anything.</span> <span id="s2269">And then I talked some more to him.</span> <span id="s2270">He knew exactly where, what and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2271">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2272">A: And there’s a very nice picture of the place where they lived, it was the most beautiful park in all of Croatia, is a nav -- a natura -- a park with fantastic things that had been done by his -- planted by his grandfather, great grandfather, and so -- so anyhow, this man, first of all he was taken to jail because he was a Freemason, and he was killed.</span> <span id="s2273">But also, I think, in fact I’m sure, he was being extra smart and the Ustaša were smarter.</span> <span id="s2274">He had been a hunting companion of Count Charno, who was Mussolini’s brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s2275">And -- which my father knew, that they’d been there.</span> <span id="s2276">But what my father didn’t know is that they had sort of worked it out that -- and in fact this went on for a little while, that some Italian prince was going to be declared the king of Croatia -- and this went on for a very short while and then this was somehow eliminated.</span> <span id="s2277">I would have to look it up exactly how to say -- how it worked out.</span> <span id="s2278">And this good friend of ours was playing two sides.</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2280">A: And maybe less than a week before we were to leave, he said to my father, you have nothing to fear, I’m here to protect you from everything there is.</span> <span id="s2281">He ended up dead.</span> <span id="s2282">But he was playing two sides.</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2284">A: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2286">A: -- he was one of the Croats who -- who was killed in Jasenovac.</span></p> <p><span id="s2287">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2288">A: And put in because he was a Freemason, was the story --</span></p> <p><span id="s2289">Q: Yeah, but obviously there was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s2290">A: -- but them not looking at anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">Q: -- [indecipherable] other stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">A: But there was a lot more.</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">A: There was much more to it than that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">A: And, you know, this was maybe I don’t know, two weeks, a week before.</span> <span id="s2297">And my father said listen --</span></p> <p><span id="s2298">Q: Before you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s2299">A: Before we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s2300">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2301">A: My father I know said to him at the time, so if everything is fine, we’ll return.</span></p> <p><span id="s2302">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">A: And he meant it --</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2305">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2306">A: -- that -- you know, that wasn’t a -- he meant it, he thought that he was going to outsmart somebody and he was going to be doing this and doing that.</span> <span id="s2307">And later on, maybe -- maybe -- I don’t know, six months ago, I read a story in one of the -- somebody was doing a reminiscence in one of the things p-put out by the Croatian --by the -- by the -- what is it called, by the -- by the Jewish Community Center in Zagreb, where this man’s sister, who was married by that -- that [indecipherable] Count Ansenberg -- was it Ansenberg?</span> <span id="s2308">I believe so -- had been shielding some Jewish women somewhere in the house in Zagreb.</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">Q: There -- I guess there was never any thought that you would go into hiding, since you had a chance to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">A: At that moment there was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s2311">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2312">A: At that moment.</span> <span id="s2313">But, you know, I -- people did go out and I -- the first thought for everybody that I know of who could and who had the imagination to know what was going to happen is to go down to Dalmatia.</span> <span id="s2314">First of all it was under Italian occupation and it was a different population.</span></p> <p><span id="s2315">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2316">A: Well, in first place you would not have been known.</span></p> <p><span id="s2317">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2318">A: I mean, in Zagreb everybody knew who you were.</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2320">A: Probably we would have gone down to the south.</span> <span id="s2321">Probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">Q: If you’d done something sooner, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">A: No, if we’d done something late, if we had been caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">Q: Later, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">A: If we had been caught there --</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2327">A: -- but -- but I don’t think that would -- would have --</span></p> <p><span id="s2328">Q: Mm-hm, uh-huh --</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">A: -- been able to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">Q: Uh-huh, I see what you’re saying.</span> <span id="s2331">Let me -- let me -- the -- you have grandchildren now?</span></p> <p><span id="s2332">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">Q: And how will, when the time comes, how -- what -- what about -- what is there about your story that you would want them to understand and -- and remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">A: Tolerance is what I would like them to know and I think they probably are quite tolerant, both of them.</span> <span id="s2335">I -- I don’t -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2336">The boy is a engineer -- you know, I keep talking.</span> <span id="s2337">I think they think this is -- no, they don’t think it’s an old wives’ tale.</span> <span id="s2338">He was Bar Mitzvahed and -- but I don’t think he’s particularly Jewish oriented, although he’s well aware that he is Jewish.</span> <span id="s2339">Mya was Bat Mitzvahed also, and is a very assiduous member of a -- of a synagogue in Boston with a female rabbi.</span> <span id="s2340">She goes to all services and so on.</span> <span id="s2341">Good about it.</span> <span id="s2342">Their name is Lindley.</span> <span id="s2343">They had their father’s name.</span> <span id="s2344">Jane was Lindley for awhile too, then she reverted to Rosenberg.</span> <span id="s2345">And hi -- she’s much more Jewish oriented than I am, Mya, and she knows what happened, I mean, I keep telling them and -- when I get a chance, I don’t want to overdo it.</span> <span id="s2346">I keep showing them pictures of one thing or another.</span> <span id="s2347">I was thinking of taking -- I mean, you know, taking them to Zagreb.</span> <span id="s2348">And I probably will eventually, the girl, because I think they need to see where this is from.</span> <span id="s2349">I -- I don’t know, I don’t -- I -- I -- I really don’t know what about that.</span> <span id="s2350">You know, it doesn’t pain me in any way.</span> <span id="s2351">I would like them to know -- to know their history, whichever way it is.</span> <span id="s2352">On their father’s side it’s a very interesting -- there’s part American Indian there, which I think is very nice, very interesting.</span> <span id="s2353">Part Swiss, a great -- a grandmother who came, and I believe she was with one of those she di -- the family must have been one of those sects, religious sects from around Bern who came to Pennsylvania and then went on to Ohio.</span> <span id="s2354">And the other part was Scotch, English and they’re -- for instance, bo -- I think has -- Joey has -- is a particular kind of -- of way one’s back teeth look, if you have any Indian background and his are like that and there’s some kind of a story about a great-grandmother who was an Indian princess who has been -- who had -- who wa -- who -- no, who was a settler’s child who had been taken by the -- by an Indian tribe in Ohio and ther-there where these mounds are, near -- near -- in Ohio.</span></p> <p><span id="s2355">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2356">A: And then returned as -- there’s a book about her, I don’t know what the name is.</span> <span id="s2357">And she -- she ret -- she was finally brought back to her family, I guess.</span> <span id="s2358">I -- I -- I like these stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s2359">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2360">A: And I -- I -- I don’t know -- I d -- I don’t know when they will be aware of, you know, who I really am.</span> <span id="s2361">I’m Granny.</span> <span id="s2362">I do have to say that -- that -- that I used to sing wonderf -- in a very bad voice, but some wonderful Croatian songs to both of them as -- as -- you know, lullabies.</span> <span id="s2363">And my favorite one is [speaks Croatian here], did you see my sli -- son Janko?</span> <span id="s2364">And it’s a wonderful story about this mother asks people in the village or on the road or whatever, did you see my son, Janko?</span> <span id="s2365">And everybody said no, we haven’t seen him, but we have heard rumors that he was accosted by three young Turks.</span> <span id="s2366">And he said -- one of Turks said to him, Janko, if -- an-an-anyhow, it ends up by -- by -- by saying how courageous Janko is and so on.</span> <span id="s2367">This is -- this is -- this -- these were their nursery rhymes, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2368">Q: Mm-hm, but I mean, they’re still pretty young, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s2369">A: Not that young, no.</span> <span id="s2370">Joe is --</span></p> <p><span id="s2371">Q: Mi -- teenagers?</span></p> <p><span id="s2372">A: Oh, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2373">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s2374">A: No, Joey just graduated, he’s an engineer, he’s what, 24.</span></p> <p><span id="s2375">Q: Oh, graduated from college?</span></p> <p><span id="s2376">A: And Mya is 27.</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">Q: Oh, oh, they’re -- they’re adults.</span></p> <p><span id="s2378">A: They’re adults.</span></p> <p><span id="s2379">Q: But do you feel satisfied that you have done your part to tell them your story and to impart whatever lessons you’ve -- you would like them to have from -- from your experience and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2380">A: Yes, I collar them every once in awhile, and -- and try to tell them.</span> <span id="s2381">And when, for instance, when a picture comes around, you know, I -- I try to say listen, this is so and so, this is a -- yeah, I do -- I don’t want to overdo it.</span> <span id="s2382">It’s not that I’m reluctant by any means.</span></p> <p><span id="s2383">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2384">A: But usually the-they’re not la -- not around long enough.</span> <span id="s2385">I have to find the right moment to do it.</span> <span id="s2386">But I do it.</span> <span id="s2387">I mean, they know exactly who was what in the family and how I grew up and -- and how we left and about my brother and all of that, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">A: They know, they know.</span> <span id="s2390">She is -- I mean, not only is she politically correct, I mean, to an extent, you can imagine.</span> <span id="s2391">She’s very much so.</span> <span id="s2392">And -- and he’s -- he’s a nice boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">Q: Good.</span> <span id="s2394">Obviously, you had such an amazing variety of experiences and -- is there anything you want to bring up and talk about that I haven’t touched on?</span></p> <p><span id="s2395">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s2396">I think we’re -- you’ve been fantastically good at eliciting whatever there was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2397">Q: Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2398">A: -- and really not --</span></p> <p><span id="s2399">Q: There’s a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2400">A: -- and very, very patient.</span></p> <p><span id="s2401">Q: There’s a lot --</span></p> <p><span id="s2402">A: Thanks a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">Q: -- and it’s hard to -- you know, I don’t know what I don’t know, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s2404">A: Ah, you know very much.</span> <span id="s2405">I do want to say that Morris has been somebody extraordinarily wonderful and very patient.</span> <span id="s2406">I -- this wasn’t very easy for him, I was -- he was constantly surrounded by -- by my family.</span> <span id="s2407">And you know, we stayed with his family and all -- that -- that was all wonderful and -- and -- and great, but I think we were more with my part of the family and I think I’ve always felt like they were -- they were -- they were surrounding him and telling him and so on.</span> <span id="s2408">He knew exactly what was going on, I mean, he was there, among the very first people who came to Yugoslavia after the war, because he was in Bari and he was waiting to go, I believe to Germany and -- and -- and a friend came by and said, why don’t you go to Yugoslavia?</span> <span id="s2409">We don’t know what’s going to happen there, so first he went to Albania and then he went to Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s2410">So, he went to Belgrade right away, so -- he wa -- he was taken by the people in that country, and everything else, and -- and so, he was -- but I -- you know, I d -- I do live in the past to a certain extent.</span> <span id="s2411">I try not to, but I do.</span> <span id="s2412">And specially now that I was so -- so -- not now, I mean, now obviously, where you had the patience to listen to me, but in the museum --</span></p> <p><span id="s2413">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2414">A: -- when all of the stuff started coming by --</span></p> <p><span id="s2415">Q: Well there’s -- so much was unresolved.</span></p> <p><span id="s2416">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2417">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2418">It’s hard to break away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2419">A: I mean, you know what so and so was killed, but you don’t know until you see it on a piece of paper where it says the date, or -- or -- or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s2420">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2421">Good.</span> <span id="s2422">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2423">A: I thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2424">Q: This has been a pleasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2425">A: It was wonderful being with you and I thank you ever so much, and what a wonderful program the museum has.</span></p> <p><span id="s2426">Q: Oh --</span></p> <p><span id="s2427">A: I really think it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2428">Q: -- I think so too, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2429">A: -- very, very good.</span>
