Jewish private school where they learned Hebrew and...uh...so on.</span> <span id="s29">We went to a private kindergarten.</span> <span id="s30">I went to...uh...uh...regular ...uh... public school which was...uh...only Jewish because this is the way the system was in Poland that...uh...the Jews had their own, ...then their own schools and the Polish people had their own school.</span> <span id="s31">And the reason for that, evidently, was that the Polish people were not going to school on Sundays and we did not go on Saturdays.</span> <span id="s32">So it was like, ...uh ... basically...uh...helping us not to be sacrilegious and so on, so it was good and we felt good about it.</span> <span id="s33">Of course, as far as antisemitism is concerned in Poland, I as a child could...uh... notice things quite a lot.</span> <span id="s34">I occasionally would notice or hear that...uh... someone...uh...Jewish was beaten up or that...uh...you know, something...uh...little schul which was, you know, a small little synagogue...uh...that was...uh...vandalized or burned or so.</span> <span id="s35">Those were little things and...uh...and my parents tried to ...uh...shelter me from it and for me not to, you know, grow up with a complex of these things but I knew of it.</span> <span id="s36">I..</span> <span id="s37">.</span> <span id="s38">uh...when I was growing up,...uh...children, Polish children my age...uh...some let me know and would say something bad, "You Damn Jew" or something like that, to me.</span> <span id="s39">But...uh...the majority did not because maybe children did not to such extent understand antisemitism or practice it as the older did, olders did.</span> <span id="s40">So, that was it and...uh...I don't know what else I can tell you.</span> <span id="s41">Life, in my opinion, was beautiful and...to me.</span> <span id="s42">Of course, I know that there were...uh...people of lower financial class that maybe did not have it so good in...in Poland, but they were also people upgraded...uh...as far as financial situation and so on is concerned and they most probably had even a better life...uh...but... uh...I don't know.</span> <span id="s43">I know it existed, but I don't really...I have not experienced it.</span> <span id="s44">We used to go every summer...we used to have a summer home.</span> <span id="s45">Uh...We used to spend our summers there.</span> <span id="s46">And a funny thing happened.</span> <span id="s47">I visited Poland two years ago, and I visited all those places.</span> <span id="s48">It was a very emotional journey for me.</span> <span id="s49">Of course, I still feel like it isn't enough.</span> <span id="s50">I would like to go back and see more of it, because I spent a short time in these places and so on.</span> <span id="s51">So maybe I will do it some day again.</span> <span id="s52">And then I..</span> <span id="s53">.</span> <span id="s54">uh...the first year, I started going to high school which was a private and only for Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s55">It was a girls' high school and, like I said, private, but unfortunately it did not last too long because the Germans entered...uh...my city in September 1939.</span> <span id="s56">Of course, we still went to school for a couple of months and...uh...but as...uh... time went on, the Germans started occupying...occupying...uh...pri...buildings that...like school buildings, offices, government offices, and so on, and they settled themselves in our school.</span> <span id="s57">They only used the third and...uh...second floor, and we had the first floor for us.</span> <span id="s58">But it became dangerous because we had to use the same bathrooms and on some occasions...uh...we have heard that...uh...some girls were abused by the soldiers so for that reason alone, the school was closed.</span> <span id="s59">It would have most probably lasted for another month or so, but it was too dangerous and it wasn't worth it.</span> <span id="s60">And...uh...so I stopped going to school.</span> <span id="s61">Uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: What was life in _ód_ like right after the German occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Well, right after... Now first of all I would like to describe the entering of the Germans and slightly prior to it.</span> <span id="s64">I have heard that the war started with Germany and, of course, all the soldiers were going toward the German borders to defend Poland.</span> <span id="s65">But it seemed like...its...they just simply turned back, and they were running.</span> <span id="s66">Uh...a day or two prior to the entrance of the Germans to _ód_, the Polish Army, without actually having, you know, without fighting, ran back and they were passing through our city.</span> <span id="s67">And they were passing through our street and they were heading somehow toward Russia, running away.</span> <span id="s68">I will never forget that day because what...what we did, ...uh...we were preparing sandwiches and food and we were giving it to the soldiers as they were going toward Russia [the Polish army was retreating eastward in an attempt to avoid encirclement by the Germans].</span> <span id="s69">The population of the city remained.</span> <span id="s70">There were some that...uh...foresaw what was coming for some reason...uh...that also ran to Russia.</span> <span id="s71">Many of those survived and they escaped concentration camp and camps.</span> <span id="s72">But for a family with children, it was difficult to run away.</span> <span id="s73">So basically who ran away is young women and young men that were unattached and many majority of them survived if they could survive the winters in Russia and later on.</span> <span id="s74">Of course, the Germans practically were near...uh... Moscow [only briefly in early December 1941] and...uh.</span> <span id="s75">.</span> <span id="s76">of course, the Jews were running away and Jews at that time, somewhat were persecuted by...by the Russians also.</span> <span id="s77">So, but it still was evidently much easier to survive than to go on to camps and concentration camps where a majority of... uh... people perished in gas chambers and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s79">The Germans have entered _ód_.</span> <span id="s80">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Uh...What happened to you and your family?</span> <span id="s82">What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s84">We stayed there until about the end of...the beginning of December, actually.</span> <span id="s85">And at that point my father thought that it was too dangerous to stay in _ód_, that there were talks about making a ghetto in one part of the city where the poorer people...where the poorer Jewish population lived, and they were going to push everybody in there...uh...and since my Mother's home town was a small town called Wierzbnik-Starachowice, and my Mother still had relatives living over there, we...we thought that it would be easier for us to get there and, you know, we were hoping that the Germans would not be able to follow us.</span> <span id="s86">I mean it was just a dream that, but it...uh...they followed us, but a lot later and in the meantime, we were still able to exist as normal people without being thrown into a camp and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: How did you exist?</span> <span id="s88">How did you live in this town?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: During that time?</span> <span id="s90">Well, we...we did not take much with us.</span> <span id="s91">Whatever we could pack on a wagon!</span> <span id="s92">And, of course, the...the journey on the wagon from...uh..._ód_ to Wierzbnik was very unusual too because we were...we had to hide and we had to...uh...sort of...uh... pretend that we were not Jewish and the way we were doing it is, my father used to live during World War I in Germany for some reason I don't understand why.</span> <span id="s93">He was born in Poland, but he lived for some time in Germany, near Hamburg.</span> <span id="s94">He spoke a perfect German.</span> <span id="s95">As a matter of fact, a German with a dialect, which is very unusual because if a foreigner speaks...uh...German he will not speak with a dialect, because it is very difficult.</span> <span id="s96">So he spoke with a dialect and I learned German in school, and I also was able to speak with Father some German.</span> <span id="s97">So we were able to sort of make believe that we are either of German descent or mixed Germans which they sort of, kind of, you know, were lenient with them.</span> <span id="s98">And we arrived to one city where a German family ....</span> <span id="s99">Well, actually not all, also mixed-German ...</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Germans hid us for a day or two until we were able to continue by wagon to...uh...Wierzbnik.</span> <span id="s101">And since it was winter time it was a very difficult journey because the roads were not cleared of snow, and the wagon was slipping and sliding, and the horse were...was...uh... tripping and it was a very bumpy, bumpy and bad trip, very cold and so on.</span> <span id="s102">But finally we arrived to Wierzbnik, and...uh...after a little while....</span> <span id="s103">We lived for sometimes with relatives,...uh.</span> <span id="s104">.</span> <span id="s105">but later on, we were able to rent an apartment for ourself and we lived, so....</span> <span id="s106">We had a sewing machine on the wagon and my father was a designer.</span> <span id="s107">I don't know if I mentioned that to you, but he was designing military clothes for the army before the war.</span> <span id="s108">He was also designing sportswear.</span> <span id="s109">Also...uh...boy scouts uniform and... and...for preparatory school uniforms.</span> <span id="s110">So...uh...since he had the knowledge of...of making patterns and...and able to understand how to do things and so on, and I somehow always liked to sew, so we were doing some sewing.</span> <span id="s111">Father used to make the patterns and doing things like that; and I, under his instruction, would sew the garments and we were able to make some money to sustain ourselves.</span> <span id="s112">Because all we needed at that time was just to buy potatoes and...and bread.</span> <span id="s113">That was our daily...uh...food, whatever we could make with it, because meat was very scarce and if there was any meat, the Polish people would get it.</span> <span id="s114">Somebody that had influence.</span> <span id="s115">In order words, people that grew up in the city and so on, knew the natives, the Polish people, and in the city, they were able to sort of obtain other staples of food...of food and so on.</span> <span id="s116">But since we were strangers, things were a little bit more difficult for us.</span> <span id="s117">Uh...later on, I..</span> <span id="s118">.</span> <span id="s119">uh... decided that I will open up a little kindergarten, and take care of small children for still working parents because it was not a ghetto yet in this city and we were just restricted as far as the time is concerned.</span> <span id="s120">In other words, we were not able to get out of our houses before a certain time, which I imagine was 7 o'clock in the morning, and we had to be in our homes at 5 o'clock.</span> <span id="s121">But, of course, people still continued working and so on.</span> <span id="s122">There were a lot of tailors, shoemakers and...uh... merchants in the city and whatever else, just like it was before the war.</span> <span id="s123">So they continued to serve the community and so on.</span> <span id="s124">And I..</span> <span id="s125">.</span> <span id="s126">uh...the kindergarten that I opened...it was in my own home, which was consisting of one large room and a kitchen.</span> <span id="s127">(cough) Excuse me.</span> <span id="s128">But usually, we would clear the room and push the furniture back, and then accept the children at 9 o'clock and I would take care of them til 1 o'clock; and that helped the family survive because...uh... the kind of parents of the children would occasionally bring some articles of clothing, or extra food that they were able to get, you know, like meat and things like that, and they were paying me a certain amount of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">And I was doing it with another friend of mine who was the same age.</span> <span id="s130">We were about 16 at that time.</span> <span id="s131">Unfortunately, this young lady was killed by the Germans later on.</span> <span id="s132">So, this is how we tried to sustain ourselves during the time until...until the ghetto was formed and until they took us into a work camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: How was the ghetto formed?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Well, the ghetto was still...uh...not terrible, by comparison to.</span> <span id="s135">.</span> <span id="s136">to a work camp or a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s137">In other words, we were still sort of free, but we have to abide by the rules of the Germans and..., but we were moving around freely in the area of our confinement; and we were still together, which was the most important thing, my parents and my brother and I. And we...our lives were still sort of normal because we were able to get together with friends, with relatives, and amazing thing that all through our confinements in the ghetto or in a work camp or even in concentration camp is the fact that... uh...we were..., the Jewish population always had a sense of...of wanting to learn...of wanting...of...you know, wanting to have knowledge, so we did not stop.</span> <span id="s138">So, in...in the ghetto, we were...like for example, I continued...I was teaching young children in kindergarten.</span> <span id="s139">Someone else, who had a little higher education than I, was teaching me.</span> <span id="s140">Of course, we all had to pay.</span> <span id="s141">And I remember I..</span> <span id="s142">.</span> <span id="s143">I was taking algebra and continued with my German, although I spoke German well, but I..</span> <span id="s144">.</span> <span id="s145">I needed to improve it, in...in writing and so on.</span> <span id="s146">And we were...I even took Latin.</span> <span id="s147">I took French, and we were able to...to get together and sing Hebrew songs.</span> <span id="s148">So it was important because we were still together.</span> <span id="s149">We were not torn apart, and therefore...uh...life seemed to be normal.</span> <span id="s150">It was very...uh...very special, too, because we...we valued each other much more than...than... It made us think, altho... although I cannot say that we valued each other more.</span> <span id="s151">We just understood it better because family ties were very close among Jewish family...families in Europe and...uh...ties with friends and relatives were also extremely important.</span> <span id="s152">And that was what was sustaining us and making our life bearable, that we did not have the comfort, we did not have...uh...the opportunities; we did not have a million things that we had before, but it did not seem to matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s154">Under what circumstances and when were you taken from the ghetto into a work camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s156">Uh...I will never forget that morning.</span> <span id="s157">Usually they...there were no announcements...announcements from the Germans of their plans.</span> <span id="s158">They usually did everything totally unexpected.</span> <span id="s159">If anything ever leaked out, it was either a gossip or...or it might have been some truth, or the times did not correspond.</span> <span id="s160">So...uh...but we knew of...we heard of other people being...uh...transferred to different cities; and there were many people that were transferred from small little towns near Wierzbnik-Starachowice into our town, and they were all...uh...you know, put into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s161">And things were getting tighter and tighter, because we had to share our little room and kitchen with another family and another family.</span> <span id="s162">And we realized that it will not last...last like that forever, that things were getting worse.</span> <span id="s163">And, of course, the food situation was getting worse because of the incoming of so many people from other cities.</span> <span id="s164">So...uh...we prepared ourselves, like for example, we made knapsacks for...for each one separately, and had them packed with the essential clothes; and my father, whatever little money we had, distributed the money among all four, amongst all four of us.</span> <span id="s165">That way that if we were separated that we should have the money to be able to help ourself.</span> <span id="s166">(Cough) Excuse me.</span> <span id="s167">(Cough) Anyhow, so basically we were prepared.</span> <span id="s168">We were not able to take any extras because we knew we couldn't carry it.</span> <span id="s169">Uh...so we left our household goods, our silverware, even a photo album which was so...so dear to us we had to leave.</span> <span id="s170">But I managed to stash away some pictures in a bag and kept it hidden... uh... and sure enough...uh...what happened is a few days later at 4 o'clock in the morning, the Germans at the same time knocked in all the doors.</span> <span id="s171">The reason for that is that they did not want us to have the opportunity that one should find out, hear from the other and have a chance maybe to...of escaping.</span> <span id="s172">So, at the same time, they had hundreds and hundreds of Germans with dogs knocking on people's doors and screaming, "Out!</span> <span id="s173">Out!</span> <span id="s174">Raus!</span> <span id="s175">Raus!"</span> <span id="s176">So many people, if they were not prepared as we were at that time, ...uh...ran out with basically nothing.</span> <span id="s177">And then they ran us all together and gathered us on a marketplace.</span> <span id="s178">Each small city had a marketplace that was, you know, usually the cities in Europe had this point that was called the marketplace.</span> <span id="s179">So we were all rounded up there and at some point, they had Germans doing a selection: right, left, right, left.</span> <span id="s180">So what was happening (cough), they were selecting younger and stronger people to remain in the city and they were distributing them to those three camps that were located in the city.</span> <span id="s181">One camp was a woodwork camp where they were cutting wood; and before the war, I imagine they were making furniture.</span> <span id="s182">But during the war, the Germans confiscated it and they transferred it for their war purposes.</span> <span id="s183">So this particular camp was manufacturing boxes for ammunition.</span> <span id="s184">They were manufacturing...uh...um... stretchers for the soldiers, and...uh... other things that were helping them for their war ...uh...purposes.</span> <span id="s185">Then there was a camp...uh...nearby in the city, nearby city called Starachowice where they had a steel factory; and...uh...all the Jews were ordered to work in the steel factory, also manufacturing things for the war.</span> <span id="s186">And the camp was nearby the factory, and they were over there.</span> <span id="s187">And there was also one other camp.</span> <span id="s188">I don't know what specific purpose this particular camp had.</span> <span id="s189">And they started selecting.</span> <span id="s190">My father and my mother, my brother and I were standing naturally together.</span> <span id="s191">When they came to us...when one of the Germans came to us with a dog and with a big...uh...switch that they used, you know, for beating horses when they were driving carriages and he wanted to separate us, my brother and I they left in the line, and my father and my mother they pushed in the other line.</span> <span id="s192">That means they were going to go to a concentration camp, you know, instead of going to the work camp.</span> <span id="s193">Uh... someone who was...they had Polish, they had Jewish policemen ...uh...in our camp..., in our ghetto actually, to keep order amongst us, and they were evidently...uh... helping the Germans keep order during this ordeal of selecting the people.</span> <span id="s194">So, ...uh...one of the policemen...was a very good friend of my father's from school, and he realized what was happening.</span> <span id="s195">And he came running and took my father and my mother out, and put us together.</span> <span id="s196">My mother at that time must have been maybe 36, 35--something like that.</span> <span id="s197">My father was a couple of years older; so they were not old, but this is what they were doing.</span> <span id="s198">So temporarily we were staying together.</span> <span id="s199">Later on, what happened is the same policeman, ...Jewish policeman, had a son also who was my brother's age and at that time, he found out that...uh...the Germans who were stationed outside of the city, in houses that they confiscated from well-to-do Polish people, needed boys to do their cleaning, shoes and whatever else they needed them to do.</span> <span id="s200">And this policeman thought it was a good idea and safe for my brother and for his son to go over there.</span> <span id="s201">And he explained it to us and they took my brother and his son away.</span> <span id="s202">But we were not frightened because we knew that they were going to be safe, which was true.</span> <span id="s203">So my father, myself and my mother were taken to the woodwork factory, and...uh...they had...uh...set aside a big hallway that they separated by a door and one part was for women, one part was for men.</span> <span id="s204">So I stayed with mother; and, of course, we were the ones that...that made the beds, you know, the bunk beds and so on.</span> <span id="s205">And I was working, too.</span> <span id="s206">And ...uh...we were all at that time being given food that was...uh...cooked for us by a group of people that they selected and they were cooking for all of us, for the men and for the women.</span> <span id="s207">So it wasn't too bad.</span> <span id="s208">I..</span> <span id="s209">.</span> <span id="s210">when I think about it, and...and the reason I say it wasn't too bad because I am still comparing with the times to come.</span> <span id="s211">So, we were able to survive because we were receiving bread, we were receiving soup once a day; and in the beginning, I was working in the gardens.</span> <span id="s212">They had gardens over there, which there were...there were some Germans on the grounds of the camp that...uh...that we needed to supply with fresh vegetables and...and whatever fruit was growing and other things, so I was working in the garden.</span> <span id="s213">Later on, in the winter, of course, there was no work in the gardens and so on, so I was working in the factory...uh... supplying... uh...the wood to the machine and...and so on.</span> <span id="s214">And there were other skilled workers that were doing other jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">And in this, I would like to say something very special to me how I met my future husband, but I have to go back a little bit to the time of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s216">Okay.</span> <span id="s217">While we were at the ghetto, uh...they...people were coming from different cities and my husband was among the people that were shipped to Wierzbnik from Bodzentyn.</span> <span id="s218">This is his home town.</span> <span id="s219">It's spelled B-O-D- Z-E-N-T-Y-N.</span> <span id="s220">And...uh...he was always...they were well to do at home, and they evidently brought in some money and some means that they could somewhat survive.</span> <span id="s221">Uh...and one day he came to our home--which was, you know, the place where we already lived separate-- but it was on steps from the street going into our apartment.</span> <span id="s222">And he heard evidently of my father and he came to us and he asked my father if he could make a one-piece suit for him with a zipper and then he requested...uh...many pockets.</span> <span id="s223">And, you know, I will mention once again that that was before they chased us out to the marketplace, before going into the woodwork factory.</span> <span id="s224">So...and he explained to my father that he wanted pockets inside that they wouldn't show on the outside, that he wanted some pockets on the outside because he wanted to....</span> <span id="s225">He didn't explain that he wanted to hide things, but we knew; and...uh...we did that and he paid us well, and he was a very, very handsome young man.</span> <span id="s226">He was older than I.</span> <span id="s227">At that time he must have been maybe 21 and...uh...maybe 22 or so.</span> <span id="s228">I..</span> <span id="s229">.</span> <span id="s230">I don't exactly know.</span> <span id="s231">And he was very handsome and he came in and he sat on the couch and he explained to my father all this and he was sitting with a sack of apples and he was eating those apples one after the other and I looked at him in amazement.</span> <span id="s232">First of all, we didn't see apples.</span> <span id="s233">We were not able to obtain apples, and he evidently got them.</span> <span id="s234">He was very...uh...he was always able to...to manage things.</span> <span id="s235">He was very...how to say?</span> <span id="s236">... uh... innovative?</span> <span id="s237">Yes?</span> <span id="s238">And he always...always had ideas how to accomplish things or how to obtain things, and how to do things.</span> <span id="s239">So...uh... evidently he didn't understand that when we looked at him eating the apples that...uh...it was a novelty to us, but later on when he finished describing what he wanted and my father took measurements and so on, he...when he left, he left the remaining bag of apples for us.</span> <span id="s240">Well, that was the very, very first time that I saw him.</span> <span id="s241">Uh...it was...I didn't think much of him because, you know, when somebody is 15 or 16, you know, somebody that much old...he was 9 years than I am, you didn't think of it in...in any other way, just as a nice good-looking person, and so on.</span> <span id="s242">Okay.</span> <span id="s243">When we...uh... went...I am returning to that...they called it "Aussiedlung" [NB: "Resettlement"]...means to move you out from one place to another, means like to displaced person and so on.</span> <span id="s244">When they moved us to the camp...uh...after the camp...uh...after I stopped working and during the time in camp, it became obvious that we needed some medical help for people because there was always somebody that would cut their fingers.</span> <span id="s245">I remember to this day, one person, one man, had cut off two fingers but they were still hanging and he didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s246">And they asked...they asked if there was anyone who has any knowledge of first aid.</span> <span id="s247">And...uh...I did have very minimum knowledge of it, and I didn't know it was going to be like gluing two fingers together...I mean the fingers together.</span> <span id="s248">I expected maybe a cut, a bruise that I could just use the basics and when this person came to me, I almost fainted.</span> <span id="s249">But what I could understand myself...I mean I put the fingers together and...and put the...whatever medication we had and taped it together.</span> <span id="s250">Well, would you believe that the fingers grew together.</span> <span id="s251">I am not sure to this day if the bones grew together.</span> <span id="s252">He had the fingers, but he was not able to move them from the first joint.</span> <span id="s253">He moved them in the second joint where he it was not severed, you know, injured, but he couldn't move... but he had fingers.</span> <span id="s254">Well, at that point when they realized that I knew something of it, they had supplied me with first aid articles; and I was doing it not all day, because they could not afford for me to...to get away from the work, so like for a couple of hours a day people that had some problems that I some idea to...to help...uh...that I was doing that.</span> <span id="s255">In the meantime, why I am getting into it because there is a story going to be connected with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Uh...next to our camp, was a camp called Zeork.</span> <span id="s257">It's spelled Z-E-O-R-K.</span> <span id="s258">Uh...it was a electrical plant.</span> <span id="s259">Well, this plant evidently...um...occupied a very small number of Jewish people.</span> <span id="s260">Uh...they didn't need such great...uh...work force that they needed in our camp.</span> <span id="s261">Among the people in Zeork was my husband, and a elderly doctor.</span> <span id="s262">Why I say elderly, he must have been in his 40s, but he was elderly to me.</span> <span id="s263">Uh...Well, he was a friend of my husband's and...and he evidently said he was his assistant.</span> <span id="s264">My husband had fantastic ideas of trying to survive.</span> <span id="s265">So as a assistant, they did not part him with the doctor and it was asset to have the doctor in this camp over there.</span> <span id="s266">Well...uh...a few weeks later, for some reason, they liquidated this camp and they evidently knew about it.</span> <span id="s267">Uh...But within the time that they were in the camp and we heard of them, we tried for the doctor and his assistant to come to our camp because we needed him more than what he was doing over there.</span> <span id="s268">So twice a week the doctor and his assistant, Leon Weintraub was his name,...uh...would come to our camp and they were assisting people that needed more professional help than I could give them.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">And, of course, I was present since I was in charge of the first aid, you know,...uh...box and so on, so I was assisting the doctor and the original assistant of the doctor was not assisting.</span> <span id="s270">He was just running all over the camp and trying to meet up with the people that he knew because there were some people that were from his home town.</span> <span id="s271">And also, his father and his brother were in my camp.</span> <span id="s272">So naturally he was always bringing things and this and that.</span> <span id="s273">And then at the first meeting, of course, he had to come, so he met me, again.</span> <span id="s274">And since he knew me, he was telling us...he was telling me, "Oh, you did my suit; you see, I am wearing it."</span> <span id="s275">And this and that.</span> <span id="s276">Of course he never told me what he had hidden in the pockets and...and so on.</span> <span id="s277">And he would see me on occasions until the time that they were going to evacuate his camp.</span> <span id="s278">Well, the night before the evacuation, evidently the...the...guard... the German that was...uh...administering, or you know being over...overseeing our camp, knew about the liquidation of the other camp and he wanted the doctor to come and be with us.</span> <span id="s279">He made them come the day before.</span> <span id="s280">So he came to our camp and he was with his father and his brother and...uh...I would like to mention that his father survived.</span> <span id="s281">His brother survived, too.</span> <span id="s282">Of course, by now his father is not living anymore because he would be maybe about a hundred years old.</span> <span id="s283">Uh...But they survived the war, and we were together in the camp.</span> <span id="s284">Uh... well, and I got to know him.</span> <span id="s285">On occasions here and there, and we...we kind of became very fond of each other; and he was also very instrumental in helping my family, 'cause since he had evidently money, he was able to obtain some goods from out of camp, and always got something extra like a bread or maybe other things and would give it to my mother and father and they...they had to promise him that he would not tell me, they would not tell me, because he did not want our relationship be affected.</span> <span id="s286">In other words, that I should not like him or whatever it is, should not influence my feelings toward him by the fact that he was helping us.</span> <span id="s287">And I didn't know any of it at all.</span> <span id="s288">Uh...After a few months... uh...we heard of...uh...the liquidation...no, not the liquidation yet!</span> <span id="s289">But the mistreatment of the people in the camp where...uh ... they were working in the...uh...steel factory, and also at that...before then...uh...they for some...there was a typhus that broke out in the camp itself and the Germans felt like...uh... I don't know if it was their concern that they were going to lose enough...too many workers by the typhus...breakout of typhus or so, so they decided to do a selection.</span> <span id="s290">And...uh...see the ones who looked sick or old or whatever it is, they were shooting.</span> <span id="s291">Uh...By that time, my brother was already transferred to the camp because evidently they had no use, the Germans who employed these two young boys had no use for them, so they put them in the camp.</span> <span id="s292">Uh...well...</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s294">Which camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: In the camp...in the same city, but this is the camp where they were going to work for the...uh...steel factory.</span> <span id="s296">And that's where the typhus broke out, and this is where they did the selec...selection, and killed off many Jewish people.</span> <span id="s297">My brother survived somewhat, because...and he had typhus at that time...but evidently he was young and he was able to control himself and he was dressed well in a coat that was twice the size and...uh...it was rather well-to-do looking coat, with a hat and so on.</span> <span id="s298">And maybe it was his luck that they did not shoot him.</span> <span id="s299">Well, they shot a whole pile of...a whole number.</span> <span id="s300">Why I say pile?</span> <span id="s301">Because they piled them up on [and they threw them] in a corner, and I don't know what they did with them, whether they buried them or burned them or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s302">So we heard...heard already of the mistreatment and the atrocities that were going on in the camp, and we tried to bring..., and people in our...uh...factory tried to bring--because many of them had relatives and friends--and tried to bring them to our camp.</span> <span id="s303">Well, through our...uh... German on the camp, we were able to get many people from there, and among them my brother.</span> <span id="s304">Well, it seemed like it was...things were....</span> <span id="s305">Since we were together, we didn't understand the pain of other people separated or other people...uh...having lost their lives in...in concentration camp and so on.</span> <span id="s306">Uh...It's human nature that you only worry about your circle.</span> <span id="s307">So we were content.</span> <span id="s308">Uh...It was difficult, but with a little help from Leon, who became my husband later, with a little help of a..</span> <span id="s309">.</span> <span id="s310">a kind person in the camp that originated from Wierzbnik and was able to obtain some food and so on, we were able to not go around hungry.</span> <span id="s311">Uh...There was...uh...also a incident and I still have those shoes actually.</span> <span id="s312">My husband noticed that I had very bad shoes on...uh...and the most important thing--since we were being transferred to unknown places--the most important thing was to have a warm coat, good clothes and shoes that did not leak water.</span> <span id="s313">So he...uh ... ordered.</span> <span id="s314">We had a little shoemaker that was able to do wonders, and the shoemaker made shoes for me.</span> <span id="s315">Little shoes like the kind you use for horse back riding out of all leather and everything, and I had those shoes.</span> <span id="s316">Uh...Then came the time where we heard that we were going to be evacuated again somewhere.</span> <span id="s317">We had no idea where.</span> <span id="s318">Uh...And of course we all sensed...there was so much talk by that time already...</span></p> <p><span id="s319">People were coming into our camps, running away from different places and so on, and they always had some news, believable or unbelievable news cause we tried not to believe the horrors.</span> <span id="s320">We only wanted to believe the good things like...uh...for example there were some incidents, while in this camp still, that all of a sudden some Germans would come and say...uh ... "Is there anyone who has relatives in Israel?</span> <span id="s321">We have openings for...uh...these people to be able to transported to Israel that their relatives are paying for it."</span> <span id="s322">So it sounded logical.</span> <span id="s323">And...uh...we remembered that two people from the camp that evidently had no connection with anybody in the camp like relatives, evidently they were alone, that they mentioned that had they had a sister or whatever and those people were taken out with all their belongings and everything and they were shot.</span> <span id="s324">So...uh...we were always reluctant in volunteering to...to do something when...whenever it sounded too good.</span> <span id="s325">Because we didn't trust them.</span> <span id="s326">Uh...Then...uh...also there was a horrible incident during my time in this camp and there was a group of people that was really very sick and delirious with fever of the typhus.</span> <span id="s327">And my mother was among them.</span> <span id="s328">I..</span> <span id="s329">.</span> <span id="s330">uh... had no knowledge of the fact, and I had no understanding of the fear of being infected with the...with the illness; because of my mother, because I wanted to be with her and I wanted to help her.</span> <span id="s331">Therefore, I didn't even think of it.</span> <span id="s332">And I was the only one that was assisting all these sick people.</span> <span id="s333">Unfortunately, the doctor himself got ill and he was among them and...uh...there was also a brother-in-law of my future sister-in-law that was there.</span> <span id="s334">And...I mean, I knew all these people and without thinking I offered that I was going to take care of them.</span> <span id="s335">I took care of them.</span> <span id="s336">My mother came out of it.</span> <span id="s337">Many other people survived.</span> <span id="s338">What I was basically doing is...uh...helping them...uh... to sponge when they were hot and...and perspired and feverish and I was also trying to feed them, which was helpful.</span> <span id="s339">And, of course, all of them most probably would have survived, but after releasing my mother and some others there was small group left; and this German was terribly impatient and he didn't want to wait any longer and he said, "These people are going to be taken away to a hospital outside the camp."</span> <span id="s340">Well, there was no hospital that I knew of, but we believed him.</span> <span id="s341">He said it was a temporary shelter or a hospital that we were going to that they are going to be taken care of.</span> <span id="s342">Well, we were ordered to make stretchers.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">We had to carry the stretchers.</span> <span id="s344">I myself with other party carried the stretchers of one person.</span> <span id="s345">And...uh...but we did not go to a hospital.</span> <span id="s346">They took us straight to the grave yard...Jewish grave yard, where there was a big ditch dug and...uh...they told us.</span> <span id="s347">You know, the people could not walk.</span> <span id="s348">They couldn't stand up.</span> <span id="s349">And they told us to place the people, you know, like at the edge of the ditch...ditch where they could simply shoot them and kick them in, and this is what they did.</span> <span id="s350">And we witnessed that.</span> <span id="s351">Later on I will tell you of the fact that I went to Germany to be a witness and I..</span> <span id="s352">.</span> <span id="s353">I apprehended the German who was instrumental in shooting all these people.</span> <span id="s354">But any...this what happened in the camp.</span> <span id="s355">What else significant happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Let us hold it at this point.</span> <span id="s357">We need to change tapes.</span> <span id="s358">Okay.</span> <span id="s359">Perfect timing.</span> <span id="s360">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">End of tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s362">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s364">The camera is back on.</span> <span id="s365">What happened next?</span> <span id="s366">The people had been shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Yah.</span> <span id="s368">We came... Unfortunately, it was a tragedy for everybody because they were relatives of people who were still in camp with us.</span> <span id="s369">And...uh...we...we were deceived, because we did not...uh...believe that they were going to do something like that.</span> <span id="s370">We trusted that they were going to...to take them to...uh...uh...place where they would treat them.</span> <span id="s371">Uh...And when we knew that we could trust them, whatever they were ever saying...uh...it was never so.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Uh...but...uh later when I..</span> <span id="s373">.</span> <span id="s374">I must return...return to the point where I came to the other camp to help...uh...the sick people over there with typhus.</span> <span id="s375">Since we were doing it in our camp, I went to help the people with typhus over there.</span> <span id="s376">I couldn't do very much, but it was that I did.</span> <span id="s377">And at that time, I made sure that I took my brother out and so on.</span> <span id="s378">During that time when we had to stay...spend a night over there because it was a long ways to walk.</span> <span id="s379">We were...had not, no transportation.</span> <span id="s380">We had to do it by foot.</span> <span id="s381">So we returned the next day.</span> <span id="s382">And during my stay there I came across this German...uh...he was actually a Ukrainian, from Ukraine, but...uh...the Germans employed them and...uh...they were even worse than Germans or as bad as Germans.</span> <span id="s383">And...uh...suddenly this guy for some reason took some liking to me.</span> <span id="s384">I had no evidence of it.</span> <span id="s385">I didn't know, and didn't think nothing of it.</span> <span id="s386">I didn't even know.</span> <span id="s387">Well, one day he comes...uh...to our camp for some reason.</span> <span id="s388">It must have been...uh...a reason, either he transported somebody into our camp or...or vice versa, but he came and came running through the barrack.</span> <span id="s389">Uh...And I mention it to you how it was done.</span> <span id="s390">It was a long....uh...hall that was separated by a wall and door where one side was for men, one for women; and he came running through the...uh...area and started shouting my name and screaming, "Where is the beast?"</span> <span id="s391">In German he spoke, he said, "Wo ist die Bestia?"</span> <span id="s392">Well, he had...uh... immoral intentions and we all knew it.</span> <span id="s393">And he said, "If she does not come, I will shoot everybody."</span> <span id="s394">Well, of course, he must have been drunk...uh...because it was...his behavior was...uh... totally out of place even for a German or...or so.</span> <span id="s395">Uh... But I knew that I must do something because he would not hesitate to shoot somebody.</span> <span id="s396">So I came up to him, and I started speaking to him.</span> <span id="s397">I says...he understood my Polish and, of course, we couldn't correspond in German cause his German was worse than mine.</span> <span id="s398">But we spoke Polish and I started kind of minimizing...uh...what he was...uh... showing, what... what...what impression he made on us and what he was planning to do.</span> <span id="s399">And...uh...and I talked to him very kindly, and this and that, and I told him how glad I am to see him again since I saw him and I, you know, fenagled the whole story.</span> <span id="s400">Uh...and he was trying to kiss me.</span> <span id="s401">But he didn't even do that because I kind of...and it went by.</span> <span id="s402">It went by.</span> <span id="s403">And he left.</span> <span id="s404">And everybody at that time was hidden, because they were sure he was going to shoot.</span> <span id="s405">So that...uh...is gone.</span> <span id="s406">.</span> <span id="s407">so.</span> <span id="s408">And, of course, later on like a week or two weeks later, ...uh... came the...uh...evacuation from this camp.</span> <span id="s409">The reason I mentioned, I want to say it because that way you can connect it later on with a situation later on with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: What is his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Schrot.</span> <span id="s412">His name is Schrot.</span> <span id="s413">S H..</span> <span id="s414">.</span> <span id="s415">No.</span> <span id="s416">S-C-H-R-O-T.</span> <span id="s417">And there's going to be quite a incident with him later on, that therefore I mentioned him.</span> <span id="s418">Uh...they evacuated us, but in a different manner.</span> <span id="s419">They came...we had...uh...like about 300 people in...in our camp and they brought trucks covered with a canopy, and they put us on the trucks.</span> <span id="s420">Our...we did not know where they were going to take us.</span> <span id="s421">When they took us to a camp called Majowka.</span> <span id="s422">It's spelled M-A- J-O-W-K-A.</span> <span id="s423">Uh... When we got there we could see from there...uh...the fires going from the factory...steel factory which impressed us terribly because since we did not know exactly or maybe I was the only one that didn't know, but this is my impression that still stays with me to this day, that this was a concentration camp and that they had ovens where they were burning people.</span> <span id="s424">That was my feeling.</span> <span id="s425">I did not share it with anybody.</span> <span id="s426">Everybody saw it.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Maybe some other people were also thinking the same way, but I don't know.</span> <span id="s428">Uh... when we got there, there were barracks on the camp and the people that were already there...uh...from the other camp--we were the last one to come in--were in the barracks so everything was closed up.</span> <span id="s429">Uh...But at the entrance, there were two very long...uh... graves dug and when we got there, it was the same Schrot that was in charge of this transportation from...uh...the "Sägewerker"... or in Polish, it's called "Tartak," T-A-R-T-A- K.</span> <span id="s430">That means wood factory.</span> <span id="s431">[NB: Actually, the correct translation of both terms is "sawmill"] Uh...He was the same one, and he was in charge of transporting us to this camp.</span> <span id="s432">When he told us to get out of the wagons and he says in German, "Women on one side, men on the other side.</span> <span id="s433">Make a line in fours."</span> <span id="s434">Then and he stood at the end of the grave and said to us, "You have one minute...." He said it in German, he said, "You have one minute to say your prayers.</span> <span id="s435">You'll be shot."</span> <span id="s436">Well, naturally we all believed it.</span> <span id="s437">I mean it was... uh...if I had to describe my feeling it would have to take hundred pages to really, one-by-one, to describe what I felt.</span> <span id="s438">But my utmost feeling and reaction was my concern first of all for my parents, for my brother, for my friends, for everybody there.</span> <span id="s439">So what do you do in a case like that?</span> <span id="s440">And he also saw that I was there.</span> <span id="s441">And I also knew that this was this animal that was capable of doing anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Uh...I was in the third row and my mother was standing near me and I realize how terribly disturbed my mother was.</span> <span id="s443">How her facial expression has changed.</span> <span id="s444">How her color has changing.</span> <span id="s445">She was looked like a ghost.</span> <span id="s446">And all could see is her heart going strong under her thin dress and it was so painful to me that I..</span> <span id="s447">.</span> <span id="s448">I didn't know what, but I knew that I had to do something.</span> <span id="s449">So I jumped out and jumped straight...he...he didn't expect it.</span> <span id="s450">And I jumped straight to him and I knew that if I approach him from the front I have no chance of doing anything.</span> <span id="s451">So I jumped on his back.</span> <span id="s452">I..</span> <span id="s453">.</span> <span id="s454">uh...put my fingers around his throat and I started choking him.</span> <span id="s455">I jumped with my legs and I put them around his mid-body.</span> <span id="s456">It's just like piggy back playing with a child and that's how I hung to him and kept on pushing my fingers into his neck.</span> <span id="s457">My finger nails were even longer than now.</span> <span id="s458">Uh...and, of course, since I..</span> <span id="s459">.</span> <span id="s460">my grip was so strong and he couldn't walk because I had my legs around his, we both fell.</span> <span id="s461">And I still didn't let go because I knew if I let go it was going to be the end of me and especially the end of everybody else there.</span> <span id="s462">So I did not for a long time.</span> <span id="s463">And...uh...finally, they...they couldn't shoot because they were afraid that if they shoot, they may shoot him, so they didn't shoot.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">But finally the stupid idiots...uh...came running and...uh...pulled us apart.</span> <span id="s465">I am talking about the Ukraine, Germans.</span> <span id="s466">They pulled us apart.</span> <span id="s467">When they pulled us apart, I knew everything is lost.</span> <span id="s468">And...uh...I was mainly concerned for the rest of the people.</span> <span id="s469">And as I was lying on the floor, my...uh...my only satisfaction at that point would be that he would not get a chance to torture me and realize that I am alive, that... that I feel that maybe I would say something to him, or plead and...uh...and this thinking followed actually a outcry from a young girl who became my sister-in-law later.</span> <span id="s470">And she cried, she says, "Please somebody help her.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Maybe...maybe she just fainted."</span> <span id="s472">Well, when I heard that, I..</span> <span id="s473">.</span> <span id="s474">it worried me, 'cause I was trying to play dead.</span> <span id="s475">Uh...when he heard that, well, if she fainted she's not gonna be alive much longer.</span> <span id="s476">And at that point...uh...he took a gun and...uh...the position of my body was evidently so that my head was to the side and evidently when he shot me it was from a angle coming here and going out this way.</span> <span id="s477">So it basically grazed my skin and part of my bone since my head was that way.</span> <span id="s478">But...nevertheless, I was bleeding a lot and he thought, well, when you get a shot right in the forehead like that, how can you live?</span> <span id="s479">So...and I did not move.</span> <span id="s480">Uh...in the meantime, all this took a long time and it was in afternoon, September, and it was getting darker and it evidently spoiled his...uh...timing because...uh... uh...they turned on the search light already, and on top of everything else they were bombing.</span> <span id="s481">The Russian planes were started flying over the area and there was bombing.</span> <span id="s482">They did not hit us, but they were evidently bombing the area that I mention to you later about the tracks being bombed and so on.</span> <span id="s483">Well, they quickly turned off the search light and (cough) they...uh...uh...chased everybody in to the barracks, together with the other ones.</span> <span id="s484">Now I was dead on the floor, so I had to remain there.</span> <span id="s485">(Cough) I am sorry.</span> <span id="s486">Well, I immediately realized that I wasn't hurt badly, that I was not near anything similar to being...uh...dead or anything like like that and since I realized that there were barracks and I didn't even know exactly because I had to keep my eyes closed not to give myself away, so I..</span> <span id="s487">.</span> <span id="s488">uh...didn't know what they did with the people.</span> <span id="s489">I thought, "Well, all is lost.</span> <span id="s490">They must have taken them to the ovens."</span> <span id="s491">This was my impression, that they were taking them straight to the ovens.</span> <span id="s492">Uh...but I saw later on when...when it was completely dark and the search lights came back on, a German...they sent out a German, the same one.</span> <span id="s493">I mean the Ukraine...uh...to make sure I was dead.</span> <span id="s494">And I was still in the same position.</span> <span id="s495">Uh...And he came to me and he wanted to play smarty.</span> <span id="s496">He wanted to see if I have pulse.</span> <span id="s497">To this day a doctor has difficulties finding pulse, so he didn't find it.</span> <span id="s498">But then he...he did another trick.</span> <span id="s499">He picked my arm up and then all of a sudden I felt a release, so I dropped it like it was a piece of wood.</span> <span id="s500">He shouldn't realize that I was alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Then he started searching me here for money and valuables.</span> <span id="s502">Well, I could not help it.</span> <span id="s503">I could not move because that would be the end of me again.</span> <span id="s504">Well, whatever he found he did, but he did not take my photographs.</span> <span id="s505">(Laughter) I had the photographs.</span> <span id="s506">Uh...And then he left, satisfied that I was dead.</span> <span id="s507">He wouldn't waste another bullet, because...uh...why waste another bullet where he could use it for somebody else.</span> <span id="s508">So...uh...between the search lights I realized that the barracks were there.</span> <span id="s509">I says, "Well, the only thing that I can do is just get under the barracks."</span> <span id="s510">Little by little, I got myself under the barracks and they were even lower than my body could part...take it, so I had to possibly squeeze myself in.</span> <span id="s511">I felt, every time I breathed, I felt that I'm raising the floor of the barrack, but I heard foot steps.</span> <span id="s512">I heard voices.</span> <span id="s513">I could make out the sounds in Polish and in Yiddish and I said, "Well, who could it be?"</span> <span id="s514">Well, I still wasn't very sure.</span> <span id="s515">I thought it was just anybody.</span> <span id="s516">When morning came, I was still not far from the stairs and as I saw people coming out and I saw they were wearing...uh...,you know, old shoes and...uh... wooden shoes and they spoke.</span> <span id="s517">They were very agitated because of the fact they...uh...witnessed shooting, my parents and relatives, my friends and so on.</span> <span id="s518">So naturally, they were all quite agitated.</span> <span id="s519">And suddenly, it dawned on me that they were the people.</span> <span id="s520">I says, "Well, God, then I have something to look forward to."</span> <span id="s521">And I came out.</span> <span id="s522">As I came out...uh...everybody got all excited.</span> <span id="s523">My parents were right near the door.</span> <span id="s524">My father became white.</span> <span id="s525">My...I mean, they were crying after me, and my brother, and then....</span> <span id="s526">We did not even have time to embrace each other... uh...that they grabbed me and they hid me under a straw ...uh..., you know, uh...sack.</span> <span id="s527">In the meantime, news travels so fast just like lightening and he found out that I am alive and I don't know if you have an idea of...uh...the...uh... arrangements of a barrack.</span> <span id="s528">It was a narrow barrack, long.</span> <span id="s529">On both sides there were...uh...uh... bunk beds with straw things and there was like a little, you know, path going from one end to the other.</span> <span id="s530">All of a sudden he comes in with a gun again, and screaming again the same line that he screamed before.</span> <span id="s531">"Wo ist die Bestia?</span> <span id="s532">[Ich werden sie schiessen ( ) sie rauskommen.</span> <span id="s533">(ph)]" And he says if I am..., "If she doesn't come out, I will start with her relatives and I'll shoot you all."</span> <span id="s534">And I heard it, so I said to myself, well, I will not allow it.</span> <span id="s535">I am ready to die.</span> <span id="s536">And I really was.</span> <span id="s537">My life at that time did not mean anything, and I wasn't even scared.</span> <span id="s538">So, but he didn't shoot me.</span> <span id="s539">He grabbed me by hand and he pulled me out of the lager behind the wire ...uh...the wired gate, and he took me into a..</span> <span id="s540">.</span> <span id="s541">uh...storage room where they had...uh...coal and wood work, wood for the ovens, not for us, but for the Germans that were overseeing the...uh...camp.</span> <span id="s542">And he left me over there and locked me.</span> <span id="s543">Well, the reason he didn't shoot me, because evidently the...uh...man who is in charge of all the operation in Wierzbnik-Starachowice....</span> <span id="s544">His name was Baumgarten.</span> <span id="s545">It is B- A-U-M-G-A-R-T-E-N, Baumgarten.</span> <span id="s546">It would be "Baumgarden" in English.</span> <span id="s547">Uh...well, since they reported to...to him what had happened that night before... uh...then he was afraid to....</span> <span id="s548">He was going to shoot us and say, "Well, I did it and that's all.</span> <span id="s549">What you gonna do?"</span> <span id="s550">But now that the Baumgarten found out about it and that was not his plan because his plan was to ship everybody to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s551">Then, of course, he would be shot, would be punished.</span> <span id="s552">So, an hour later Schrot came into...I mean Baumgarten came into the...uh...storage room and he looks at me and I am bleeding in the front of my face.</span> <span id="s553">And I..</span> <span id="s554">.</span> <span id="s555">I was also bleeding in the back because before they shot me, they hit me with the back of the rifle, so there was a hole and it was bleeding.</span> <span id="s556">Well, this Baumgarten looks at me and he says to me...he says, "Tell me what happened?"</span> <span id="s557">Well, what I told him was not what had happened.</span> <span id="s558">I said, "I was standing in a row," which was true, "and when he said he was going to shot us all, I was going to go over and plead with him he should not shoot us."</span> <span id="s559">Well, that part is not true because I wasn't going to plead with him.</span> <span id="s560">And I said, "He shot me and...and I fell and I don't remember anything."</span> <span id="s561">And I remembered every moment and I do remember every feeling and every moment of that situation.</span> <span id="s562">And then he looks in the front and he looks in the back and he says to me...uh..."Well, what do you have in the back?"</span> <span id="s563">I says, "Well, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s564">I don't know.</span> <span id="s565">I fell and I must have fallen unconscious and I don't know what happened afterward."</span> <span id="s566">Well, I knew but I didn't want to tell.</span> <span id="s567">And...uh...in the meantime, since my husband was among the people and since, like I mentioned, he evidently had money saved and in this particular case, he had a small diamond ring, so he give it to this Baumgarten.</span> <span id="s568">Well, Baumgarten took me out of the storage area, took me to the so-called "Revier."</span> <span id="s569">"Revier" is hospital.</span> <span id="s570">That is in German.</span> <span id="s571">And he took me there.</span> <span id="s572">He stood right there and waited until they bandaged, cleaned me up and everything and they let me go with the other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Uh...When I went back to the... to the barracks, there was a man, and to me he was older man cause he must have been in his 30s, and he talked to me and he wanted to know details and wanted to know my feelings and wanted to know why I did it and everything.</span> <span id="s574">And I told him.</span> <span id="s575">And I wasn't afraid because I knew he was not going to say anything.</span> <span id="s576">And as it happened ... the reason I am mentioning this...is because this man wrote a chapter in a book.</span> <span id="s577">He was a writer.</span> <span id="s578">And we found the book later on.</span> <span id="s579">Uh...That's why I am mentioning it.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Do you know the name of the man and the book?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: He was Moshe Praguer.</span> <span id="s582">You heard most probably of him, but unfortunately he died before I got to him.</span> <span id="s583">I was in...in Israel, and I tried to get in touch with him and I did not get in touch with him.</span> <span id="s584">Uh...Anyhow...uh...that afternoon, they put us all on...on the wagons.</span> <span id="s585">Men separately.</span> <span id="s586">Women separately.</span> <span id="s587">There is one scene that I must say because it stays with me forever.</span> <span id="s588">It is the moment where my father, my mother, my brother and I were standing together and nobody said anything.</span> <span id="s589">I was the only one that said something.</span> <span id="s590">I said, "Daddy, I think this is the end.</span> <span id="s591">I don't think we will see each other again."</span> <span id="s592">I don't know why I said it.</span> <span id="s593">It was like a premonition.</span> <span id="s594">And...uh...when I said that, my father did not answer, but what he...the way he looked at me, I could translate it in many ways.</span> <span id="s595">I could translate it that he would say, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s596">I know the Germans."</span> <span id="s597">Uh...'cause he knew them as being decent, intelligent, educated and kind people.</span> <span id="s598">So he couldn't understand what had happened to them in the meantime.</span> <span id="s599">So he was actually telling me in one way not to worry, but in the other way, I could sense that he believed me, that he finally believed me because all this time through the war, he was telling me not to worry, that they would not harm us because of the...of the experiences that he had with him while he was living in Germany.</span> <span id="s600">Well, they put us separate and, unfortunately, I never saw my father and brother anymore.</span> <span id="s601">I was with my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Uh...Well, actually it is not exactly true, because the next day because of the bombing by the Russians, the tracks were...uh...out of order and they could not take us and they...they didn't want to keep us for some reason in there.</span> <span id="s603">So they let us go out and that was...that one more time that I was able to see my parents and my brother, but after the fixed the tracks, they put us on the wagons the next day.</span> <span id="s604">And it was a horrifying, indescribable, terrible journey to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s605">The wagons were closed, only with small little, you know, like cracks opened for air which for 2 or 3 hundred people in one wagon was not enough.</span> <span id="s606">There was only the food that we were able to take with us, what we had, and we didn't have very much.</span> <span id="s607">We couldn't take most of our belongings cause there was no room.</span> <span id="s608">There was...uh...one bucket that was being used...uh...as a commode for everybody.</span> <span id="s609">There was one bucket of water to drink.</span> <span id="s610">I never saw it.</span> <span id="s611">I never...I never saw one or the other because it was impossible to push yourself through because we were standing like, you know, one person next to the other and evidently, in a case like that, it was already...people were already so terribly conditioned where nothing mattered, only themselves.</span> <span id="s612">So you couldn't even come close to any of the objects.</span> <span id="s613">And we traveled like that half way.</span> <span id="s614">No.</span> <span id="s615">All the way...all the way to Auschwitz, and...uh...we....uh...got off the train the usual way as everybody is explaining.</span> <span id="s616">And when I was visiting Auschwitz about two years ago, the tracks are the same.</span> <span id="s617">The building...uh...that we had to...uh...cross was the same... uh...the...there were...the big gas chamber is not there anymore.</span> <span id="s618">But they had...uh...small...small gas chambers which were for individual bodies and they basically looked....</span> <span id="s619">Of course, I am sure you saw the pictures...like ovens.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Let's...let's not deal with what is now.</span> <span id="s621">Let's take it back then.</span> <span id="s622">Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: What did you see at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: What did I see when I got there?</span> <span id="s626">I had no idea it was...uh...going to be gas chambers because we didn't see it.</span> <span id="s627">On the way to...uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: When you arrived!</span> <span id="s629">Physically when you arrived, what did you do?</span> <span id="s630">Let's do it that way.</span> <span id="s631">A: When we arrived, they took us off the train.</span> <span id="s632">They separated us again.</span> <span id="s633">Women separately.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Men separately.</span> <span id="s635">And they told us to go into a building where they say...said it was going to be a shower.</span> <span id="s636">We were allowed to take soap with us...uh.</span> <span id="s637">.</span> <span id="s638">maybe a comb and a tooth brush and maybe those are the things.</span> <span id="s639">I cannot recall.</span> <span id="s640">I cannot be sure of that.</span> <span id="s641">And...so we took... and we were allowed to take our shoes, I think.</span> <span id="s642">Uh...And... uh...many people, since we were allowed to take soap and many people already had their soap, they pushed gold pieces, American gold pieces, into this soap and...uh...they saved them.</span> <span id="s643">Uh...One lady whom I know and I meet quite often.</span> <span id="s644">She lives in Toronto, Canada.</span> <span id="s645">I just saw her recently.</span> <span id="s646">She can never forget the fact that I have saved two...uh...gold pieces in...in the soap.</span> <span id="s647">I risked my life but I..</span> <span id="s648">.</span> <span id="s649">I had no understanding of it.</span> <span id="s650">I did it for her because she asked me.</span> <span id="s651">And I used the soap for washing and as I washed naturally the place where you stuck the thing kind of got glued back and then when we got to the barracks...uh...I give it to her.</span> <span id="s652">Uh...They...uh...what they did, when we walked out the other way...uh...it was a selection.</span> <span id="s653">In other words, not all people survived.</span> <span id="s654">They were selecting...uh...one left, one right.</span> <span id="s655">There was...the guy that was doing the selection was Eichmann.</span> <span id="s656">Yes.</span> <span id="s657">He had a..</span> <span id="s658">.</span> <span id="s659">uh...he had helpers.</span> <span id="s660">Of course, the Ukrainians and there were two girls.</span> <span id="s661">I don't remember the other one, but one girl she was German.</span> <span id="s662">When I got out from there, he was standing right there.</span> <span id="s663">We were naked.</span> <span id="s664">Can you imagine how a person feels, especially a woman, in front...no matter how...how bad the situation is, whatever...I mean we practically lost our minds at...at moments like that.</span> <span id="s665">But still the fact that we were naked in front of a man whoever it may have been, it was devastating and especially for a teenager that is modest.</span> <span id="s666">And when I saw that I..</span> <span id="s667">.</span> <span id="s668">I was confused.</span> <span id="s669">I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s670">He was standing there with a..</span> <span id="s671">.</span> <span id="s672">with a dog.</span> <span id="s673">He had this horse whip which was thick and, you know, all leather to the end, very thin at the end, and he was going left, right, left, right, left, right.</span> <span id="s674">Well, I..</span> <span id="s675">.</span> <span id="s676">I don't know...I cannot say that I was brave.</span> <span id="s677">I don't know.</span> <span id="s678">Maybe I was just not experienced.</span> <span id="s679">And I simply went to him because when I saw that he took my mother on the other side, I started begging him.</span> <span id="s680">I says, "Please" I says, "This is the only person left in my life.</span> <span id="s681">I haven't got anybody anymore."</span> <span id="s682">I says, "Please.</span> <span id="s683">Put me together with my mother.</span> <span id="s684">We will work harder together.</span> <span id="s685">We will be more loyal and whatever."</span> <span id="s686">Well, he put me together with my mother.</span> <span id="s687">That means going to...to the concen...to the...to the ovens.</span> <span id="s688">Well, the girl somehow took pity on me.</span> <span id="s689">I don't...with this girl I had several other incidences too because I must say that as bad as they were and I wouldn't want to say anything special for the Germans as a whole, but I..</span> <span id="s690">.</span> <span id="s691">I must say that on occasions, you found a person with feelings and compassion and they did special things.</span> <span id="s692">Maybe it was not a great effort to them, but was a lifesaving to us.</span> <span id="s693">Well, this girl was about my age and...and I went to her and at that point I looked already like a balloon because he used the pa...the....uh...whip on me.</span> <span id="s694">And not on my body, but the upper body, on my face.</span> <span id="s695">My eyes were swollen.</span> <span id="s696">I had little slits here that I could only see, but I was so desperate that I talked and I..</span> <span id="s697">.</span> <span id="s698">in German I said to her, I says, "You are the same age as I am and I am sure and I hope that your parents are at least safe somewhere or you would want to know that they are safe.</span> <span id="s699">And if anything like that happened to you, wouldn't you want to save your mother?"</span> <span id="s700">And that's all I said to her.</span> <span id="s701">And she took my mother and I and she smuggled us to the other side.</span> <span id="s702">We survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Okay.</span> <span id="s704">They took us to...uh ...to barracks and the next morning--or was it the same day actually, because time had no...no value whatsoever--and this is where they...they put our...uh...marks.</span> <span id="s705">It was A here.</span> <span id="s706">That meant transport A, and then the number is 14028.</span> <span id="s707">That was my number.</span> <span id="s708">I went first for them to do it because I wanted to see how it felt.</span> <span id="s709">I was worrying that mother would not be able to stand it or so.</span> <span id="s710">So it...it worried me.</span> <span id="s711">I went first and mother was...mother's number was the following number A-14029.</span> <span id="s712">And we were given numbers and we stayed in the barracks.</span> <span id="s713">So we were in Auschwitz already.</span> <span id="s714">The first day before they put us into our regular barrack, they put us... they put us into a barrack which was called Death Barrack.</span> <span id="s715">Uh...they are standing.</span> <span id="s716">The barracks are preserved, and they are standing.</span> <span id="s717">They put us over there temporarily, but usually when you put people there that means they were going to...to die.</span> <span id="s718">But they had transport coming one after the other, one after the other, and they had no time to kill everybody like that because the procedure, no matter how fast they have developed it to be, ...uh...did not work as fast as they would want it to work.</span> <span id="s719">So, we were in that barrack.</span> <span id="s720">I saw it...uh ...recently.</span> <span id="s721">It had a court yard, also surrounded with bricks.</span> <span id="s722">At the end of the court yard on the brick wall, there was a big plate, steel plate attached to the wall.</span> <span id="s723">Against this, I was told that--when I was there a year and a half ago, about two years ago--I was told that this what they were doing.</span> <span id="s724">I had no idea that they were doing it while I was in the camp, but that steel block was there because they were shooting people, putting them against the steel block and shooting them.</span> <span id="s725">That way the brick wall would not fall apart and I realized that the whole yard was drenched with blood.</span> <span id="s726">And we looked at it and feelings come back.</span> <span id="s727">Expression was motionless, but the feelings were there.</span> <span id="s728">And I looked.</span> <span id="s729">Then I went to...they have a place where they have so-called archives...uh...and stuff that were of some importance, like letters or writings or pictures or something.</span> <span id="s730">Well, the pictures that I mentioned earlier in my journey to Wierzbnik and from Wierzbnik after I was shot that I saved them, I still had them because I was able to save them.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s733">Well that was not after the...the shower.</span> <span id="s734">That was still before the shower.</span> <span id="s735">I had them.</span> <span id="s736">So as we were going into the showers I was afraid that those pictures were going to be taken from me.</span> <span id="s737">And for some reason I had an idea if we are going in we will have to come out, so maybe I will find the pictures.</span> <span id="s738">But that was not the case.</span> <span id="s739">We went in and then we did shower.</span> <span id="s740">We went out the other side.</span> <span id="s741">That's where Eichmann was making a selection and the ones to go to the ovens were on one side.</span> <span id="s742">The ones, and myself and my mother on the other side after the girl saved us, were on the other side.</span> <span id="s743">They put us in the barracks and I realized that I could not find the pictures anymore.</span> <span id="s744">They were picking them up.</span> <span id="s745">They knew that we were going to do that...that people were going to throw money away, their jewelry away and, you know, important possessions (cough).</span> <span id="s746">So after...after they took us the other way out, they had a group of Germans or maybe...uh ... Jewish people that were supposed to... They were walking with...uh...uh...wagons and picking up all the things and that's why I mentioned the archive room.</span> <span id="s747">I had hopes that I would be able to find pictures.</span> <span id="s748">If not necessarily the pictures that I had with me, but the pictures...uh...maybe pictures of relatives, maybe pictures of friends and so on, and I spent quite a long time in the building.</span> <span id="s749">They were very cooperative.</span> <span id="s750">Now I am speaking of the time three years ago when I went to Au...</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s752">All right.</span> <span id="s753">You're jumping time.</span> <span id="s754">A: Well, I am...I am sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: Let me if I could.</span> <span id="s756">All right.</span> <span id="s757">You've jump time and we are at the moment running out of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">So what I need to know very simply is when you returned two years later, did you find the photos?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s761">That's all I need to know at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: No.</span> <span id="s763">I still am hoping to find them, because I didn't have enough time.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s765">I need to know.</span> <span id="s766">I really can't go into this.</span> <span id="s767">Okay.</span> <span id="s768">I need to focus solely on Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s769">You have come out of the shower room.</span> <span id="s770">I need to know about.</span> <span id="s771">.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: What happened there.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: You have come back to a barrack.</span> <span id="s774">I need to know what happened in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s776">Well, we were in the barracks.</span> <span id="s777">And...uh...life was suddenly entirely different.</span> <span id="s778">We were sleeping with 9 or 10 people in one...uh...what do you call it?</span> <span id="s779">...bunk.</span> <span id="s780">We had one thin blanket.</span> <span id="s781">Uh...We were sleeping on the straw and...uh ...we were given food once a day...uh...small little piece of bread...uh...and...uh...some kind of brew that they called coffee had no similarity in smell and taste or anything to coffee, but at least it was something to drink.</span> <span id="s782">And...uh ... uh...Life became very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: Did you work?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Uh...There was...uh...in the beginning, there was no work.</span> <span id="s785">Uh...And even though there was any work it had no meaning.</span> <span id="s786">It just had the meaning of the work was to destroy us, to make us tired, to make us exhausted because in the beginning like, for example, every morning we had to be waken up at 4 o'clock.</span> <span id="s787">They used...they called it "Appell"...uh...roll call.</span> <span id="s788">Uh...We had to get out, rain or shine, frost or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s789">We had to stand for hours, hours until they decided to bring the breakfast which consisted of this horrible brew--tasted like witches brew--that we drank in the morning, but by the time it got to us it wasn't even hot, but it was warm and it still was something.</span> <span id="s790">And...uh...Then they would organize what they called...uh...uh...like... uh...groups they had a special name for it in German but it escape me.</span> <span id="s791">Groups of people that were doing different things under supervision of a German with a gun or several Germans with a gun and so on.</span> <span id="s792">So I was assigned to a group that was supposed to be carrying stones from one place to another.</span> <span id="s793">Then the next day from that place back to this place and just keep us moving, ...uh...making us exhausted and tired.</span> <span id="s794">People were dying on the job because of malnutrition and loss of strength and so on.</span> <span id="s795">And dehydration; and basically every day, we were losing a lot of people.</span> <span id="s796">So that was easy for them without shoting, shooting...uh... uh... firing a bullet and using a gun.</span> <span id="s797">And...uh...later on I was put into a so-called factory where all the clothing particles and so on which were not...uh...going to be reusable for the Germans, because the Germans were fixing and cleaning and washing the garments that they were confiscating from us to send it to Germany because they had a shortage of goods and ...and everything.</span> <span id="s798">So anything that was usable they were sending to Germany back, but the things that were not usable were given...put in one room, maybe the size of this one or larger, and we were tearing the pieces and putting them together and braiding them into a large braids out of different materials and those braids later on, they were endless.</span> <span id="s799">Those braids later they were folding into a disk.</span> <span id="s800">In other word, the braid would be...this way they were rolling the braids and making them into discs.</span> <span id="s801">I don't know what those discs were...uh...for.</span> <span id="s802">Some said that they were being put between ammunition to...to keep them from rubbing together that that was insolation or whatever it is between whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: How did you...You were in Auschwitz how long?</span> <span id="s804">A: Well, we were in Auschwitz two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: 1942, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: When...When did you...when did they prepare you to leave Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: Well, they were...uh...they were preparing us to leave Auschwitz at the time where it was bad already, that they saw the war was being lost.</span> <span id="s809">We heard of the attempt to assassinate Hitler.</span> <span id="s810">We heard of many other things and that's when they, instead of running themselves, they had to take us because they did not want to leave any evidence, especially evidence that can talk...uh...and remember, behind them.</span> <span id="s811">So naturally they took us all.</span> <span id="s812">Uh...So what happened in Auschwitz that day...uh...uh...they poisoned most of the bread and suddenly bread became plentiful in the area.</span> <span id="s813">They put poison.</span> <span id="s814">Uh...the sick ones could not...uh...leave the camp, so they were shot; or the ones that looked like dead were left.</span> <span id="s815">Some that were able to...to eat, died of poisoning from the bread.</span> <span id="s816">Uh...We walked out and we were chased out and we were not...we didn't have enough time to get the bread so we didn't have it, which was good.</span> <span id="s817">Uh...We thought it was bad, but it saved our life.</span> <span id="s818">Everybody had a little something, and we...uh...started wal...walking out of Auschwitz cause they... everything went so fast.</span> <span id="s819">They did not have transportation for us.</span> <span id="s820">Transportation...uh...which I learned was a private concern that...uh...the Germans who were working in...uh... destroying us had to pay for the transportation.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: What happened?</span> <span id="s822">Don't you worry about what you learned later.</span> <span id="s823">I would like to know... A: But I must say why...</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: I lost my trend now.</span> <span id="s826">Okay.</span> <span id="s827">So they did not have because they were not able to pay.</span> <span id="s828">Usually they took from us whatever they ...we had left everything behind us...to pay for...uh...to the company that was in charge of transportation.</span> <span id="s829">So...And it was bombed, and transportation was impossible.</span> <span id="s830">So we were walking a road.</span> <span id="s831">It was...uh... January already, first part of January.</span> <span id="s832">And we were walking and the snow was high and, of course, by us walking...crowds like I would say 30 or 40 people in one row, the snow was pushed to the side and...and so on.</span> <span id="s833">On the sides of the streets we saw bodies of men who were evidently taking the same road before us.</span> <span id="s834">They were chased out before us and many of them, a lot of them did not survive.</span> <span id="s835">And we saw a leg or a hand or a nose sticking out from the...from the snow and we realized that this is what happens.</span> <span id="s836">So it made our journey that much worse because we wanted to see when we saw somebody if it was not anybody, my father, my brother or somebody else, whatever.</span> <span id="s837">So...uh...And it was a long, long journey to such extent that I remember we couldn't even walk.</span> <span id="s838">You know when you walk a long time something happens to you at the hips.</span> <span id="s839">It...it just doesn't work.</span> <span id="s840">So we were walking like sideways, the moving our legs.</span> <span id="s841">You know, like sliding our legs sideways.</span> <span id="s842">Uh...then we came somewhere.</span> <span id="s843">We were passing...uh...some villages and some small German cities.</span> <span id="s844">They were deserted.</span> <span id="s845">We could see...uh...smoke coming out of chimneys.</span> <span id="s846">We could see lights in the houses and everything, but not a soul would come out.</span> <span id="s847">So we were walking.</span> <span id="s848">Some people were making attempts to escape like jumping into a ditch or...or something similar.</span> <span id="s849">Some succeeded.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Some did not.</span> <span id="s851">Since I mentioned that things were bad for the German army, and it seemed like they were losing the war and it was like toward the end, so at that time some Germans...civilians might have been a little kinder and maybe they helped some because of the fright of what may happen to them for what they did.</span> <span id="s852">Uh...Finally, we came to a station where they had a platform...platforms where they put us on platforms, and part of the time we rode on open platform and it was snowing.</span> <span id="s853">It was my birthday, 22nd of January.</span> <span id="s854">And we looked like snowmen covering up with snow.</span> <span id="s855">And we were just sitting curled up over there and going to a unknown and worse...</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Where did you end up?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: We ended up... At the end of the line the trains could not take us any further and they took us to a farm house where they had many animals and evidently somebody took pity and they didn't leave us outside, and they chased us in with the animals, with the cows, with the horses, with the pigs, with the this, and you know, we were scared to death, but it was either that or try to freeze to death outside.</span> <span id="s858">And we stayed there...there overnight.</span> <span id="s859">Evidently something was not clear outside that we could not continue or maybe the Germans that were taking care of us needed the rest and then and therefore we stopped.</span> <span id="s860">The next day we starting going again, walking again until we arrived in Ravensbrück.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s862">Here we need to stop.</span> <span id="s863">Uh...Bonnie put on the short tape please.</span> <span id="s864">Let's cut this tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">That's the end of this tape.</span> <span id="s866">We have a very short....</span></p> <p><span id="s867">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s868">TAPE #3</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: We are in Ravensbrück?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: Yes, they brought us into Ravensbruck and...uh...they did not have barracks for us immediately so they put us along a road within the camp.</span> <span id="s871">It was...the barracks were on one side, a big fence was on the other side, and here around that area it looked like in the olden days they had cellars.</span> <span id="s872">They had, you know, like a [hip (ph)] up here and a door to go into a cellar.</span> <span id="s873">And we did...we had no idea what the cellars was... were...uh...but since they did not have the barracks for us, they put us in this open area.</span> <span id="s874">It was January already, 23rd or 24th and so...uh...snow was high and the snow was already hard, and it was like ice mountain and...uh...we had to wait there.</span> <span id="s875">And...uh...my mother was worn out and very tired and she just simply just lied down on the floor and fell asleep.</span> <span id="s876">And, of course, I understood it was bad for her.</span> <span id="s877">I kept on waking her up and trying to get her up but it was impossible.</span> <span id="s878">And, of course, she evidently caught pneumonia or something like and that was the beginning of her illness during the time in...in Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s879">Well, about...uh...night time they found a place for us, and they pushed a great number of people into the barrack.</span> <span id="s880">We were glad to be in there, although we couldn't move and we couldn't sit anywhere or...or so on because it was not prepared for it.</span> <span id="s881">So at least we were not freezing.</span> <span id="s882">So we stayed there until next morning and, of course, I remember a incident where people were just losing their mind.</span> <span id="s883">Exactly losing...just going berserk and fighting and screaming and killing each other.</span> <span id="s884">Uh...I mean I don't know how they could, but I mean their strength was unbelievable when you get in a state like this.</span> <span id="s885">Uh...well in the morning they separated us.</span> <span id="s886">Of course, I have no idea how many dead...uh... remained behind us and so on and they put us into barracks.</span> <span id="s887">We were in a barracks and Mother was not doing well at all anymore and she could not...one day...I mean she was forced to leave her...uh...bunk for the roll count.</span> <span id="s888">Uh... the reason I am stuttering about it is because I am used to saying it in German and therefore, I mean, to translate it is English is kind of awkward.</span> <span id="s889">Awkward.</span> <span id="s890">I mean I have to find the right name for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: The "Appell" is fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: So...uh... Uh...anyhow so Mother came one...one day she was evidently at the end of her strength and...uh...we went to the roll call and my girlfriend and I were holding her because she couldn't stand up and...uh...we felt that she...uh...became completely limp.</span> <span id="s893">You know, that her legs were not holding her anymore, that they were like detached and we were holding her up and then comes this situation again with this woman that saved me once from Eichmann.</span> <span id="s894">And she saw this and she came over and, of course, I still did not have confidence in her because I had no idea that she was going to be kind to me through several ordeals, but she was and she says...she asks what the problem was.</span> <span id="s895">And I told her, I said, "I believe Mother is sick and I would like to take her to the barrack."</span> <span id="s896">She says, "Go ahead and take her."</span> <span id="s897">Well, I was young, still strong girl.</span> <span id="s898">Believe it!</span> <span id="s899">I picked my Mother up in my arms like a baby and I walked with her into the barrack and I sat in the chair and I was just holding her, you know, like a baby.</span> <span id="s900">And she evidently had a stroke because I know that she could see me with one eye and I could tell that the way she...her eye was moving that she understood and I was holding her and kissing her like a baby and sitting there...sitting.</span> <span id="s901">There was nothing else I could do.</span> <span id="s902">Until the roll call was over and everybody...uh...came into the barrack.</span> <span id="s903">By then, the girl came...the German woman came to me again and she says, "Well, if she is sick, you have to take her to the hospital and the hospital I mentioned before was called "Revier."</span> <span id="s904">Uh...So I couldn't carry her by myself.</span> <span id="s905">My girlfriend and I were holding her and kind a dragging her to the barrack and we put her on the bed and...uh...left her there.</span> <span id="s906">I..</span> <span id="s907">.</span> <span id="s908">that was still morning...uh...in the afternoon when they were bringing soup, I did not want to eat the soup, but I wanted to take it for Mother and, of course, they would not give me a extra dish for Mother because they said she was going to be taken care of in the Revier.</span> <span id="s909">Uh...but I didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s910">When I came to the Revier with the little pot as big as this cup or smaller and I was approaching the...uh...bunk area where Mother was lying down, a girl stopped me and she said to me, "Your mother is dead."</span> <span id="s911">At that time, I don't really remember what happened.</span> <span id="s912">I know that the food spilled and I fell to the ground; I evidently fainted.</span> <span id="s913">I don't know how long I was there, but I was still there when I came to; and when I came to...I will tell you something, you most probably won't believe it, because I don't believe it myself.</span> <span id="s914">I don't believe it, 'cause I was so calm.</span> <span id="s915">I was just like a..</span> <span id="s916">.</span> <span id="s917">like a puppet doing things and the first things were I took all her belongings, her shoes, her little scarf, her garter belt, her comb and whatever else she had there, and...uh...still I knew that this was not enough of her that I wanted to take with me.</span> <span id="s918">And I asked for scissors and I cut a great part of her hair and--and I did it, amazingly, only from the left side because I said, "It is from the heart side"--and I cut her hair, and I still have it.</span> <span id="s919">And those were the things that...that I did like...like automat...like a puppet...like... there was nothing life in me at all that...that prompted me to do it.</span> <span id="s920">I..</span> <span id="s921">.</span> <span id="s922">I don't know I maybe...maybe one corner of my brain was directing me to do that.</span> <span id="s923">Other than that, I just cannot understand anything else.</span> <span id="s924">And then I..</span> <span id="s925">.</span> <span id="s926">uh...went with these things to my barrack and usually when you have anything that belongs to you, you carry it with you everywhere you go because if you leave it for a minute, it goes, disappears.</span> <span id="s927">So whatever bundle you had with you, you had to even take to the bathroom, everywhere.</span> <span id="s928">You had to sleep with your head on it and your hand attached to it.</span> <span id="s929">Well, I took the bundle and ...uh...the same evening I..</span> <span id="s930">.</span> <span id="s931">uh...began reacting a little bit more normal and I felt like I was thawing out from a deep freeze and I..</span> <span id="s932">.</span> <span id="s933">uh...somewhat was able to go to the barrack which was near by us and I wanted to see my mother.</span> <span id="s934">So I went.</span> <span id="s935">Of course, I would never do it again if I had to do it over again.</span> <span id="s936">I went and the bed was empty already.</span> <span id="s937">They had completely undressed her and they had...uh... dropped her in the wash room.</span> <span id="s938">There was one washroom where they were dropping all the dead, you know, just like a pile of wood.</span> <span id="s939">So I went in the washroom and I saw my mother.</span> <span id="s940">I touched her.</span> <span id="s941">I cried.</span> <span id="s942">And I left.</span> <span id="s943">(sobbing) The next day I still was not satisfied because I knew that.</span> <span id="s944">.</span> <span id="s945">uh...every morning they were taking all the dead and taking them either to the crematoria or they were dumping them in ditches and burning them.</span> <span id="s946">And they...every...it was like a custom.</span> <span id="s947">Every morning there was a guy that came with a wooden little wagon and he was pulling it and he was stopping to all the barracks and all the Reviers and pulling out all the dead.</span> <span id="s948">So I knew that this was going to happen and I knew it was happening around such-a-such hour, so my girl friend and I..</span> <span id="s949">.</span> <span id="s950">I..</span> <span id="s951">.</span> <span id="s952">I begged her...I..</span> <span id="s953">.</span> <span id="s954">"Please my dear.</span> <span id="s955">Come with me.</span> <span id="s956">I must see Mother once again."</span> <span id="s957">So, we went and sure enough he went by with about 10 or 12 corpses, and the reason I could recognize my mother because majority of people that entered Auschwitz and later on...uh...Ravensbrück, had no hair.</span> <span id="s958">Their hair were chopped off because they were using the hair for doing...uh...making mattresses or doing other things.</span> <span id="s959">I mean they found use for every...everything.</span> <span id="s960">So I could tell my Mother because she has such pretty brown hair and they were hanging (crying) so I saw her.</span> <span id="s961">But my pain was so terrible that I pushed a..</span> <span id="s962">.</span> <span id="s963">I still have a mark on one of my hands.</span> <span id="s964">I think it was this hand.</span> <span id="s965">It still has a mark where I pushed the whole hand in my mouth to avoid screaming because if I screamed, maybe they would shoot me or something, you know, cause there were Germans all over.</span> <span id="s966">So...uh...I could...couldn't pull out my fist for awhile.</span> <span id="s967">My...my friend had to help me.</span> <span id="s968">And that was the last I saw of my mother.</span> <span id="s969">And, of course,...uh...we stayed there for a little while and we were taken to work...uh... I would not be able to explain what I was doing because it was terrifying, horrible.</span> <span id="s970">It was like a tremendous ditch about three times the size of this room, dug.</span> <span id="s971">In...in the ditch they had human...human waste.</span> <span id="s972">Not bodies...not bodies, but human waste.</span> <span id="s973">And...uh...the waste was fermenting.</span> <span id="s974">I..</span> <span id="s975">.</span> <span id="s976">they evidently, they used it for...uh...for fertilizer or something like that.</span> <span id="s977">That was my understanding at...at that time although at first it looked liked the worst...uh... fantasy, the worst and the most horrible fantastic story and we had to....</span> <span id="s978">We had those big sticks with shovels or with something on bottom that we had to keep on...on moving this stuff to...in order it should be for preparation for something, whatever they were using it for.</span> <span id="s979">Uh...the smell was horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Uh...people sometimes fell up to their necks and nobody bothered taking them out.</span> <span id="s981">So it was...uh...unforgettable.</span> <span id="s982">It was a horrible, horrible...if you had to imagine a horror story, you couldn't.</span> <span id="s983">You couldn't!</span> <span id="s984">So...and I..</span> <span id="s985">.</span> <span id="s986">and...and the space between the... areas between the ditches were so narrow that you could easily trip and fall, and we had to try not to.</span> <span id="s987">So I was working for a short time there.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: Because of time...because of time and our time problems, can you just tell me...</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: I'll make it short because it comes to an end.</span> <span id="s990">Yes.</span> <span id="s991">Uh...Okay.</span> <span id="s992">When we got to the barracks one day, we were... uh ...notified that Swedish Red Cross was going to...uh ...uh ...rescue us.</span> <span id="s993">Well, they didn't say rescue, but they were ...because they...to them it was not rescue from what.</span> <span id="s994">So they imagined that the Red Cross was going to take us and help us.</span> <span id="s995">Now we didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s996">I mean basically nobody believed it.</span> <span id="s997">But I didn't care.</span> <span id="s998">I was at the point where I really, really wanted to die.</span> <span id="s999">I did not care to live anymore.</span> <span id="s1000">I couldn't live with the memories and I certainly could not see the future, so I put myself on the list.</span> <span id="s1001">My girl friend was on the list.</span> <span id="s1002">She was very optimistic.</span> <span id="s1003">Always I was rather the pessimist.</span> <span id="s1004">I mean pessimistic type.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">And we went and we survived.</span> <span id="s1006">We were taken to...as we went out there were wagons...not wagons, but Red Cross ambulances waiting for us and it only took enough people...I mean as many seats as they had so we could be comfortable.</span> <span id="s1007">They had food on the...uh ...buses.</span> <span id="s1008">They had first aid and medication, everything.</span> <span id="s1009">There were young Swedes, and they were trained to speak some German and Polish and they...was a whole train of...of buses...of those...uh... uh...Red Cross buses, and we were going to travel to Denmark.</span> <span id="s1010">On the way, unfortunately, there were either Americans bombing the areas of the ghetto...of the Auschwitz, ...of the Ravensbrück concentration camp, or maybe it was Russians.</span> <span id="s1011">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1012">And they thought they were doing good, but they didn't know.</span> <span id="s1013">So I think either one or two of the Red Cross buses were bombed and many people got killed and injured.</span> <span id="s1014">Well, I was again in the...at the end because I wasn't rushing to get on the bus because I didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s1015">So that was the end and, ...uh...they got us by land to...uh...Denmark.</span> <span id="s1016">In Denmark, they put us on trains because...uh...they were afraid for people to come in contact with...with us because of illnesses that we might have carried, but food and...was delivered to us.</span> <span id="s1017">We had...we were sitting in...in nice trains and...uh...with all comfort and everything.</span> <span id="s1018">And food was delivered to us hot.</span> <span id="s1019">I remember Danish goulash and...uh...they delivered...uh...clothing and blankets and everything and then we were taken to a port in Denmark and from Denmark we went by ship to Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: Guta.</span> <span id="s1021">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: You're welcome.</span> <span id="s1023">You're
