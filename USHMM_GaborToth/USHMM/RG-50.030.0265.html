Margaret Zassenhaus.</span> <span id="s14">And the "H" is an old German name, Hiltgunt.</span> <span id="s15">Almost too difficult.</span> <span id="s16">That is why I shortened off.</span> <span id="s17">And I was born in Germany, in Hamburg, quite a few years ago as you can guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: What year?</span> <span id="s19">Can you give it to me?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: (laughter) Do I have to say this?</span> <span id="s21">Yes, I was born in 1916.</span> <span id="s22">That means really during world war number one.</span> <span id="s23">And I will tell you my father was a rather known educator in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s24">I had a mother who was just a mother but a mother who I remember as probably the best mother ever could be because she really would over and over encourage us, have the courage to form your own opinion.</span> <span id="s25">This is what I remember when I think of my parents.</span> <span id="s26">I had three brothers.</span> <span id="s27">My oldest brother, Hans, was a professor, became a professor in mathematics was he in Princeton and in America.</span> <span id="s28">And my second brother, Guntra (ph) is a physician as I and he lives in California.</span> <span id="s29">And then I had a third brother, who was also a physician.</span> <span id="s30">He was killed in the war, in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: And what was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: That was Vilfreet (ph), which means in English will peace.</span> <span id="s33">And he was the one who was killed in the war.</span> <span id="s34">So, we lived in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s35">As soon as the Nazi's came, my father was . . . Three SS (ph) men came into his office and took him by the arm and led him out.</span> <span id="s36">He was the head of a very fine school in Hamburg where he really taught the liberal ideas and the classical ideas of and how people should live with each other.</span> <span id="s37">So, we were very grateful to a point that at that point he already had Parkinson's disease.</span> <span id="s38">So they, for the time being, did not arrest him because he was a rather known man in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s39">He had written several books about the history of literature, and so they tried to go light about it.</span> <span id="s40">So, I can only say almost fortunately soon after the Nazis came, he died, because his fate otherwise would have been to be in one of the prisons.</span> <span id="s41">I had three brothers.</span> <span id="s42">My eldest brother, my oldest brother, Hans, he was a professor in mathematics.</span> <span id="s43">And later as I came to America where he was both in Princeton and in other universities.</span> <span id="s44">And my second brother, was physician as I, and lives in California.</span> <span id="s45">Then I have a third brother, Vilfreet (ph) was his name, but really means to will peace.</span> <span id="s46">But he was the one who was killed in the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: What was it like as children together in your household?</span> <span id="s48">How do you remember it?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Well, one of my most wonderful memories are those days.</span> <span id="s50">And one of my saddest memories is that day when Hitler finally came to power.</span> <span id="s51">We didn't have televisions, but we had the radios.</span> <span id="s52">And everywhere, even in the streets, they blared out the Hitler music.</span> <span id="s53">And I remember very well my father.</span> <span id="s54">He assembled us that same night in 1933.</span> <span id="s55">And he said, "Look now, you see what has happened.</span> <span id="s56">And I want you to know that in our home, nothing will change.</span> <span id="s57">We will have the same values.</span> <span id="s58">We believe the same thing.</span> <span id="s59">We will be the same as we always are."</span> <span id="s60">But, he said, "We've got to be extremely careful now because we are known."</span> <span id="s61">My father was a very known educator in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s62">And he said, "You must learn to be quiet, not to shout 'Heil Hitler', but to be quiet on the outside because this is the only hope we can survive this."</span> <span id="s63">And true enough, the next morning several of his SS (ph) men came to our house early in the morning.</span> <span id="s64">They wish to come early so that they knew you were there.</span> <span id="s65">They asked for my father.</span> <span id="s66">But my father at that time already had a rather advanced case of Parkinson's disease, which really was a blessing because they couldn't transport him and they would have had all kinds of things to get him out there.</span> <span id="s67">And since my father was a rather known man, a rather known educator in Germany, they were a little bit afraid to begin this, to rock the boat too much.</span> <span id="s68">So, they left him alone.</span> <span id="s69">And I can almost say since and very soon afterwards, he died.</span> <span id="s70">So, he was spared.</span> <span id="s71">But the very same day after that happened, that the Nazis came to our house, I remember too well my father got us all togetherus four children and a mother.</span> <span id="s72">And he said, "Now you see what has happened, what is happening.</span> <span id="s73">But in our home everything will be the same.</span> <span id="s74">On the contrary, for now on we will be much more together than we ever been before.</span> <span id="s75">And I urge you not to be afraid."</span> <span id="s76">I remember that today.</span> <span id="s77">"Don't be afraid."</span> <span id="s78">We were afraid.</span> <span id="s79">Because known as my parents were in that community, we were really very much a target of being arrested.</span> <span id="s80">And the only reason that my father was not arrested because they came . . . At that time he was already so far advanced in his disease that they just let him alone and said, "Well, he's dying anyway.</span> <span id="s81">He's gone."</span> <span id="s82">So, that was the beginning.</span> <span id="s83">And I will tell you from there on, we really were about the closest knit family you ever have seen or ever have experienced.</span> <span id="s84">Because we lived in our own home.</span> <span id="s85">We had our values as we always had.</span> <span id="s86">We could be open with each other.</span> <span id="s87">And very soon we got a tiny little radio.</span> <span id="s88">You see, many, many years ago, you didn't have all these wonderful television and radios.</span> <span id="s89">You got a tiny little radio.</span> <span id="s90">We never were very interested in radio, but for now on we always start to turn.</span> <span id="s91">Do you know what we were looking for?</span> <span id="s92">Finally, one day we found it.</span> <span id="s93">The radio from London.</span> <span id="s94">That was . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: From London?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: From London, yes.</span> <span id="s97">We lived in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s98">From London.</span> <span id="s99">Finally we got a voice from freedom.</span> <span id="s100">And from there on really morning, noon and night, whenever we had a spare minute, we listened to that radio which gave us the truth.</span> <span id="s101">I never forget that because it was almost an obsession.</span> <span id="s102">Don't ask me for television because we didn't have it at that time.</span> <span id="s103">We had only very tiny little radio.</span> <span id="s104">So, it was not all terrible grief because somehow this brought us together.</span> <span id="s105">And our Jewish friendsand we had quite a few Jewish friendswe'd gather together.</span> <span id="s106">Not anymore in the daytime.</span> <span id="s107">We came to them in the dark, after night.</span> <span id="s108">Or they came to us in the dark of the night.</span> <span id="s109">And very soon, of course, things got very dangerous.</span> <span id="s110">I mean, Hitler was very smart.</span> <span id="s111">He had a way of finding the elite and try to decapitate them.</span> <span id="s112">It's an old system of any dictator.</span> <span id="s113">If you do that, of course, the rest will go.</span> <span id="s114">And, so, the arrest came at night.</span> <span id="s115">And I must tell you that my father not only was a very known educator, but he had also written the books about the literature (ph) and was really known all over Germany.</span> <span id="s116">And the Nazis knew that he was quite ill already, so they let him be.</span> <span id="s117">But I remember one day an SS (ph) man coming to us and he said, "Just remember you better be very quiet because you are observed."</span> <span id="s118">And that we felt very much.</span> <span id="s119">But now, none of us has ever been arrested.</span> <span id="s120">So, we were very fortunate that way.</span> <span id="s121">And now, so, it was very difficult so far because what they did indirectly they tried to harm us.</span> <span id="s122">We didn't have too much money.</span> <span id="s123">To study in Germany was very expensive.</span> <span id="s124">This was really a question of having money.</span> <span id="s125">And what they did is they simply cut out all the assistance, which otherwise gifted children and people who didn't have all the means to study, all this was cut away from us.</span> <span id="s126">Because they said, "Well, you are not Nazi.</span> <span id="s127">You're not in the Party.</span> <span id="s128">If you show us good will, we will help us."</span> <span id="s129">And that good will did not come forth.</span> <span id="s130">So, from there on really our house was more or less like a beehive.</span> <span id="s131">From morning to nightand that started about in '34we had children from all kind of schools whom we tutored.</span> <span id="s132">And this really could get the money for our daily living.</span> <span id="s133">Because the very same day when Hitler came to power, three SR (ph) men came through the house of my father and was to the officethe office schooland said "this is it", and led him out.</span> <span id="s134">It was a tremendous fortune that they didn't arrest him.</span> <span id="s135">We understood why they didn't do it.</span> <span id="s136">My father was a very known educator all over Germany because he had written quite a number of books.</span> <span id="s137">And to begin this, they went rather lightly on it, of the very prominent people.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Was he a known anti‑Nazi?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: He was a known Democrat.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Social Democrat?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: YeahNo, he was the Democratic Party.</span> <span id="s142">He was a very religious man.</span> <span id="s143">My mother was a very known Social Democrat.</span> <span id="s144">My father always called her his left wife, you know?</span> <span id="s145">(laughter) He was more . . . I think he was a thinker.</span> <span id="s146">He was a philosopher.</span> <span id="s147">A man who really stood for political and this kind of thing.</span> <span id="s148">He was an ethicist, I would say.</span> <span id="s149">A man we admired greatly.</span> <span id="s150">The good this was first he was invited out of school.</span> <span id="s151">That had to be expected because they all knew where he stood.</span> <span id="s152">But the good thing that he wasn't arrested was that he, at that time, already had Parkinson's disease and was really rather ill.</span> <span id="s153">So, they left him alone.</span> <span id="s154">They even came one day and they said, "Well, at this point, we will leave you alone because you are rather known in the community"over Germany, really, his name"But we warn you.</span> <span id="s155">We warn you."</span> <span id="s156">With that they left.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Dr. Zassenhaus, you had an incident in school, in high school . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: . . . when the Nazis took over.</span> <span id="s160">Could you talk about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Very soon after Hitler came to power, the new order was passed.</span> <span id="s162">For now on, whenever a teacher entered the class at the end of six times every daydifferent teacherswe had all to race and then we had to throw our right arm in the air and shout as loud as we could, "Heil Hitler".</span> <span id="s163">Now don't forget, I was at that time about 15 or 16 years old.</span> <span id="s164">I immediately said, "That I can't do."</span> <span id="s165">And I came home and told my parents about the new order.</span> <span id="s166">I was very disturbed about it.</span> <span id="s167">I'd look at the faces and hope that they would give me some advice.</span> <span id="s168">I remember so very much my father said, "What will you do?"</span> <span id="s169">I said, "I will not do it."</span> <span id="s170">And he said, "Well, are you aware of the consequences?"</span> <span id="s171">And my mother said to me: "Hiltgunt, this is something you must decide for yourself."</span> <span id="s172">I never forgot that.</span> <span id="s173">And I looked at her, because somehow I hoped she would give me some advice.</span> <span id="s174">So, the next morning before I left, they asked me both, "What have you decided?"</span> <span id="s175">And I started to cry.</span> <span id="s176">I said, "Tell me."</span> <span id="s177">My father said very quietly, "You must decide this for yourself."</span> <span id="s178">It was one of the days which were very decisive in my life.</span> <span id="s179">I remember I come into school.</span> <span id="s180">I was on the last bench in school in my classroom.</span> <span id="s181">All the girls knew about me.</span> <span id="s182">They knew because notI was not very important, but my father was rather known.</span> <span id="s183">Everybody knew where he stood.</span> <span id="s184">And know since the order had been passed.</span> <span id="s185">Whenever the teacher would enter, we would have to raise our right arm and shout, "Heil Hitler."</span> <span id="s186">And so the teacher comes in.</span> <span id="s187">I stood there, my arms glued at my sides.</span> <span id="s188">She beckoned me to her and she said, "Now as of tomorrow you will say “Heil Hitler” and you will raise your right arm.</span> <span id="s189">I give you 24 hours to think about it."</span> <span id="s190">That was one of the most upsetting days.</span> <span id="s191">I came home.</span> <span id="s192">I told my parents.</span> <span id="s193">I asked them, "What am I to do?</span> <span id="s194">What shall I do?"</span> <span id="s195">I never forgot the answer.</span> <span id="s196">My mother said, "You must decide for yourself."</span> <span id="s197">In the evening, I remember my father came to my bedside and he said, "Are you aware that whatever you do might be the end of your education?"</span> <span id="s198">I spent a sleepless night.</span> <span id="s199">I've never forgotten it.</span> <span id="s200">I still remember it as it was today.</span> <span id="s201">The next day I come to school.</span> <span id="s202">All the students in my classroom they're very eager now they all knew about it.</span> <span id="s203">My father being so known, they wanted to what is she going to do.</span> <span id="s204">I remember as today, it was a beautiful day in Spring.</span> <span id="s205">The windows were open.</span> <span id="s206">Everything was so beautiful outside and inside.</span> <span id="s207">There was not a decision to make.</span> <span id="s208">And don't forget, I was just a very young person, probably very immature.</span> <span id="s209">The teacher comes in.</span> <span id="s210">All the heads, arms up.</span> <span id="s211">The heads all turn to me, what will she do?</span> <span id="s212">In my desperation, I raised my left arm and I put it right through the open window until the glass broke.</span> <span id="s213">There was a general scream: "What has she done?"</span> <span id="s214">Blood poured from my arm.</span> <span id="s215">I was rushed to the hospital.</span> <span id="s216">That was the end of that story.</span> <span id="s217">And I must tell you, nobody ever looked into my direction.</span> <span id="s218">They just left me alone.</span> <span id="s219">Somehow, and as today after so many years, I think maybe it was very foolish.</span> <span id="s220">But somehow for me it was the beginning of the way I had to go.</span> <span id="s221">So many times now I think about it.</span> <span id="s222">Why did I do it?</span> <span id="s223">Why not just go along with that little?</span> <span id="s224">But, no, in retrospect I feel that was the decisive moment.</span> <span id="s225">I had to do what I later would do.</span> <span id="s226">The interesting thing is for now on, from then on, never anybody looked into my direction.</span> <span id="s227">They just let me do as odd ball (ph).</span> <span id="s228">They said hear no nothing, see no nothing.</span> <span id="s229">Since then, I passed my examination.</span> <span id="s230">They let me go to school so that I could study later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Why do you think they . . . Is it because of . . .?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: Certainly not for me.</span> <span id="s233">I think it was because of the reputation of my father.</span> <span id="s234">He was himself a very know educator in Germany.</span> <span id="s235">He had written books.</span> <span id="s236">Books which are still studied and learned about, learned from.</span> <span id="s237">And so I think it was really more a silent gisthear no nothing, see no nothing.</span> <span id="s238">So, they let me through.</span> <span id="s239">I passed my examinationthe only way I could to enter university.</span> <span id="s240">However, my feelings, the feelings of my family, were exactly the same.</span> <span id="s241">I had the feeling I could not live any more in Germany.</span> <span id="s242">I would not be happy there any more.</span> <span id="s243">I just couldn't wait any more.</span> <span id="s244">So, what I decided is that I one day said I have somewhere to go that is next to me.</span> <span id="s245">And next to Hamburg was really Denmark.</span> <span id="s246">Not far away.</span> <span id="s247">About five hours away.</span> <span id="s248">This is where I went.</span> <span id="s249">This is how I started to get interested in the Scandinavian languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: And that was the summer after high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: The summer after high . . . When after I had my examination, it was really finished.</span> <span id="s252">So, that began the idea why shouldn't I study Scandinavian languages.</span> <span id="s253">Yes, and that is what I did.</span> <span id="s254">And that took off.</span> <span id="s255">Of course, at the time I had all my examination, my degree.</span> <span id="s256">And the amazing thing is now in retrospective, maybe really there is somebody higher than me who leads us to what we have to do.</span> <span id="s257">Because it was an outrageous idea to study Scandinavian languages.</span> <span id="s258">It's very rare, and really not much you could do with it.</span> <span id="s259">And my parents always asked me, "Is it really what you want to do?</span> <span id="s260">What will you really do with it?"</span> <span id="s261">Somehow I felt . . . I had been there on a visit that was a visit that was a free country.</span> <span id="s262">I liked that country.</span> <span id="s263">There was no Hitler.</span> <span id="s264">So, here comes the war.</span> <span id="s265">Here come all the arrests of the Scandinavian people because Germany invaded Scandinavia, as you know.</span> <span id="s266">And, of course, the old principal of Hitler prevailed.</span> <span id="s267">He always arrested the elite of the country to decapitate the country.</span> <span id="s268">That was a very cheap little trick to do, which it somehow always paralyzed people.</span> <span id="s269">So this elite now came to . . . I'm jumping now.</span> <span id="s270">I come now from '33 to the warto '39.</span> <span id="s271">And as soon as he invaded Scandinavia, the same thing.</span> <span id="s272">He goes to the elite.</span> <span id="s273">Spiritual (ph) elite was arrested.</span> <span id="s274">Anybody who resisted Hitler, they were arrested.</span> <span id="s275">And now they had the problem.</span> <span id="s276">They got them, brought them to concentration camps where people simply were murdered.</span> <span id="s277">As you know, as we all know here.</span> <span id="s278">But they such overflow, and also there was one good thing for the Norwegian and Danish.</span> <span id="s279">They were non‑Jews.</span> <span id="s280">This idea of Hitlernorthern (ph)this idea.</span> <span id="s281">So, somehow that saved them from coming there in the concentration camp and being killed.</span> <span id="s282">They were sent to the prisons.</span> <span id="s283">The German prisons were no fun either, I can assure you.</span> <span id="s284">But yet they starved there.</span> <span id="s285">They were ill.</span> <span id="s286">But they were not murdered.</span> <span id="s287">And now these things where I come in.</span> <span id="s288">They needed now for these prisons somebody who spoke the Scandinavian languages.</span> <span id="s289">And here comes the mystery of life.</span> <span id="s290">Believe it or not I was the only person in Germany who had the necessary academic degrees for this.</span> <span id="s291">That I could work at the prisons.</span> <span id="s292">Supervise them, send out the mail (ph), send out anything, any outside connection they might have.</span> <span id="s293">Why would they be sent there in the first place?</span> <span id="s294">Why was no one killed?</span> <span id="s295">See, there was.</span> <span id="s296">In the prisons, you didn't just kill people.</span> <span id="s297">That was in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s298">So, they needed to do the academic way.</span> <span id="s299">And Hitler himself had to agree that I was the person, because I was the only one who had all the academic examinations in it.</span> <span id="s300">That was very important for that kind of position.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: And was your being a woman an issue?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: And the problem was of course the anger, deep anger of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s303">I was not only a woman, I was only a woman.</span> <span id="s304">That was very hard for them to swallow as I noticed in the years that followsthese four numb years where I know for now on traveled from one prison to the other in German whenever there was Scandinavian prisoners.</span> <span id="s305">What kind of prisoners were they?</span> <span id="s306">It was the elite of the country, because, as you know so well, Hitler's method was whenever he invaded another country, simply to arrest the elite in order to decapitate the leadership.</span> <span id="s307">It was an old trick I think that's been done for a long time.</span> <span id="s308">And he did that very skillfully.</span> <span id="s309">So, we had the prisons and the camps full of the elite of all the countries wherever he invaded.</span> <span id="s310">And people who resisted, who did anything of resistance.</span> <span id="s311">If you didn't do anything, you could probably get by pretty much.</span> <span id="s312">But you can imagine the spiritual elite this will always be in the leadership if ever it is to be offered.</span> <span id="s313">So that is how I came into this.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: What was the first job that you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: The first job was first they asked me to come into a prison camp in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s316">And then they saw, of course, affluent in Scandinavian languages.</span> <span id="s317">I had all my academia.</span> <span id="s318">I was the only one.</span> <span id="s319">That was the aggravating thing.</span> <span id="s320">There was no other person in Germany who had that degree.</span> <span id="s321">And the much worse problem was I was only a woman.</span> <span id="s322">That was very hard for Hitler and his people to accept.</span> <span id="s323">But still it was sent to Berlin and it took a couple of months.</span> <span id="s324">These things are always slow, as you know.</span> <span id="s325">Yes, take her because we have nobody else.</span> <span id="s326">Now why did they at all allow people into prisons in and out?</span> <span id="s327">See, there is again the German bureaucracy.</span> <span id="s328">You had in Germanyand people usually don't know that in this countrywe had two ways of imprisonment.</span> <span id="s329">The one was the concentration camp, which we all know about.</span> <span id="s330">That was simply, I mean, you were poisoned or you were hanged or you were killed.</span> <span id="s331">I mean, that was death by chance that somebody survived, as most of them were killed.</span> <span id="s332">But in the prisons of Germany there was still a system.</span> <span id="s333">And there was still the German authority who had done it all their lives.</span> <span id="s334">This was done this way and this way.</span> <span id="s335">And lucky those, the elite, who were shipped off to the prisons.</span> <span id="s336">Why were they shipped off there in the first place?</span> <span id="s337">Because Hitler had somehow tend to adore all Norwish Aryan (ph) types.</span> <span id="s338">I guess it is known in this country.</span> <span id="s339">And somehow it must be this.</span> <span id="s340">I mean, I cannot find any explanation.</span> <span id="s341">These people more or less were shipped off to the prisons.</span> <span id="s342">And the concentration camps were, of course, so filled already by all the countries that somehow the Norwish people lived, by this idea of Norwish are special.</span> <span id="s343">So, that's really probably saved their life.</span> <span id="s344">Now the situation in the prisons was awful.</span> <span id="s345">However, you did not have the Gestapo there.</span> <span id="s346">That's what people don't realize.</span> <span id="s347">There you still had the old functionaries, the old rules of prisons.</span> <span id="s348">The people starved, they died of illnesses, but they were not put in the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s349">And also they had the old order.</span> <span id="s350">For example, they could write letters and they could also get once in awhile a visitor.</span> <span id="s351">And see this is where I came in.</span> <span id="s352">The Scandinavian ministersthey one day applied in Berlin to Hitler.</span> <span id="s353">They wanted to visit the prisoners from time to time.</span> <span id="s354">And since again the Nazis had somehow an adoration of everything which was Norwishnon‑Jewish, you know?</span> <span id="s355">Norwish.</span> <span id="s356">He said yes, fine, they can do that, but only under strict supervision and only a person who is totally accepted and has all the examinations.</span> <span id="s357">And, believe it or not, the only person in all Germany was I who had this famous stand.</span> <span id="s358">It was a famous stand.</span> <span id="s359">And much to the horror of the Nazis, not only did I have this stand but I was only a woman, which was really an offense to them.</span> <span id="s360">But there you see again the Germanwhat should I saythe stick stick to it.</span> <span id="s361">They wanted to have done by the letters in the prison.</span> <span id="s362">From there on for the next following four years during all the war time, I traveled from one prison to the other.</span> <span id="s363">What was what I have to do?</span> <span id="s364">I had to send out all mail, which went out and in.</span> <span id="s365">Because, yes, in the prisons, the prisoners could send letters.</span> <span id="s366">But they were, of course, you should strike, strike out whatever you wanted not to be read.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: You were a censor.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s369">They told me to strike out as much as possible.</span> <span id="s370">Whatever you don't like, you strike out.</span> <span id="s371">However, I was the only sender there, so I was the sender of a sender of myself.</span> <span id="s372">So, more or less I could really do this.</span> <span id="s373">And that is how it begun.</span> <span id="s374">I, little by little, only read the letter first.</span> <span id="s375">I didn't see the people.</span> <span id="s376">I only read the letter.</span> <span id="s377">And when I saw that a letter was too impersonal, too badly written by a prisoner, too much afraid, I put some things in.</span> <span id="s378">I put some little notes by myself.</span> <span id="s379">This and this, and everything is alright, don't worry.</span> <span id="s380">I put that in.</span> <span id="s381">Of course, not in my own handwriting.</span> <span id="s382">I tried, at least, to do other hand writing.</span> <span id="s383">So, little by little.</span> <span id="s384">And then, of course, the good thing was I again had to send out also what came back.</span> <span id="s385">So that I struck out.</span> <span id="s386">So, I mean, it was very good.</span> <span id="s387">That went about almost a year.</span> <span id="s388">Then came the idea about there in the prison.</span> <span id="s389">Any prisoner is allowed to have so many visitors.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Could we go back for a moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Wasn't there, before you were doing those letters, at some point you were given a special assignment to get the letters from the ghettos that were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Can you explain what you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: That happened . . . since I had this examination, I was hired for the censorship between Germany and Scandinavia.</span> <span id="s396">Both Denmark, Norway and, not SwedenDenmark and Norway.</span> <span id="s397">And so whatever I did not like, I found objectionably, I could strike out.</span> <span id="s398">You see?</span> <span id="s399">And so what I used to draw in the course of yearsnot right a way of coursebut later on when I was feeding the Scandinavian prisoners, I'd send little notes to them and let them know what was going on.</span> <span id="s400">Because I was the only one who sent out these letters.</span> <span id="s401">And that is the letters between the prisoners and the relatives.</span> <span id="s402">So I could do this.</span> <span id="s403">For example, it was very important for me to give them one message which was very harmless but of most important, most important.</span> <span id="s404">These prisoners really were starving to death.</span> <span id="s405">But since they were in prison, there was one rule.</span> <span id="s406">They could get every six months a peso (ph).</span> <span id="s407">And in that peso (ph), they could have some chocolate, something to eat.</span> <span id="s408">What you say oh what does it mean every six months?</span> <span id="s409">Well, it was two pesos (ph) a year.</span> <span id="s410">It was some little light.</span> <span id="s411">And so what I did in my letters going to them with a thick (ph) hiding my own writing, I put to each "send pesos (ph), send pesos (ph)".</span> <span id="s412">Because the relatives didn't even know that, of course, that they could send pesos (ph).</span> <span id="s413">And very little, very fast where it goes.</span> <span id="s414">It took about three, four months.</span> <span id="s415">The first pesos (ph) arrived.</span> <span id="s416">The authorities were furious.</span> <span id="s417">They were furious because it was work to them.</span> <span id="s418">Why should we?</span> <span id="s419">But it was a rule.</span> <span id="s420">In these prisons there was rule they could have a peso (ph) twice a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: So, were you supposed to cross out . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: . . . if a prisoner asked for something, you were supposed to cross it out.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: That was the rule, idea now.</span> <span id="s425">I was asked whenever they would say send food, I should simply cross it out.</span> <span id="s426">The good thing was that I sent out the letters.</span> <span id="s427">Very soon, of course, I'm sure they were told you must not even ask for it, because it was not anywhere in it.</span> <span id="s428">But I would scribble it myself, "send food", in the letters.</span> <span id="s429">"Send food", you know, with a different handwriting of myself.</span> <span id="s430">It was reaching them and so the pesos (ph) kept on arriving.</span> <span id="s431">The authorities were furious and they came to me and complained.</span> <span id="s432">I said, well this is really unheard of, but if I were you a rule is a rule.</span> <span id="s433">Do you want to break a rule?</span> <span id="s434">That's fine by me.</span> <span id="s435">I don't mind.</span> <span id="s436">But it's your responsibility, of course.</span> <span id="s437">And, yeah, no we cannot break a rule.</span> <span id="s438">We have to give it to them.</span> <span id="s439">So, they got these pesos (ph).</span> <span id="s440">That was one good thing.</span> <span id="s441">They kept on hiding.</span> <span id="s442">Mind you, we had two systems in Germany under the Nazis.</span> <span id="s443">That's very hard for people to understand.</span> <span id="s444">One was a concentration camp where people simply were gassed or killed or starved.</span> <span id="s445">But the other was still a system with certain rules.</span> <span id="s446">This is where I had come in, fortunately, and could really do my part.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: How did you come to think of doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Well, that was very interesting.</span> <span id="s449">I had studied Scandinavian languages.</span> <span id="s450">I loved Scandinavia.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s452">I don't mean that.</span> <span id="s453">I mean you were adding things.</span> <span id="s454">This was dangerous for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Certainly it was dangerous for me.</span> <span id="s456">But you see, I was the only one who sent that . . . I was really in charge of the whole mail.</span> <span id="s457">And so the only thing I had to fear, of course, that somebody eventually would get the good idea to send the mail again.</span> <span id="s458">But they never did that.</span> <span id="s459">See, they were not all that smart as you think.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Were you in a room alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: See, no, I put the letters from the prisoners mailed directly to my home.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: To your home.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: To my home.</span> <span id="s464">And then from my home, I mailed them back to the prison, and then they were mailed by postage over to Denmark and Norway.</span> <span id="s465">But they also had to pass them the censorship.</span> <span id="s466">See, the ordinary censorship.</span> <span id="s467">But they again didn't know the rules of the prisons, you see.</span> <span id="s468">So we had two forces working against each other, and it worked marvelously.</span> <span id="s469">So, I was tremendous in hiding in different handwriting so that I had to be very careful because, you see, there were some people that might pick that up.</span> <span id="s470">But it worked.</span> <span id="s471">Amazingly, it worked.</span> <span id="s472">This went on for years.</span> <span id="s473">That was one way I could help them.</span> <span id="s474">But very soon fate came to me in the form that the counsels and the people in Scandinavia, the authorities, they started to talk with the German Nazis in Berlin.</span> <span id="s475">They said, "Look, this is a prison our people are in.</span> <span id="s476">Why can't they have visit from us?"</span> <span id="s477">And so they asked at last, "Who is us?"</span> <span id="s478">They said, "Well say, for example, two ministers could come.</span> <span id="s479">Two people who are appointed by us."</span> <span id="s480">They said, "Yes, we accept it.</span> <span id="s481">That will be alright."</span> <span id="s482">Because it was a prison.</span> <span id="s483">It was not a concentration camp, you see.</span> <span id="s484">That was a rule.</span> <span id="s485">In Germany, a rule is a rule.</span> <span id="s486">They said, "But then we will have to have somebody who supervises these visits again who is on our side."</span> <span id="s487">And this somehow, of course, had to know Scandinavian languages, had to be fluent in Norwegian and Danish.</span> <span id="s488">And, you know, in Germany, again, it was . . . that was not enough.</span> <span id="s489">There were many people who spoke Danish and Norwegian, but you had to have the academic examination, a doctorate, the whole thing.</span> <span id="s490">And here I really can only thank God interfered.</span> <span id="s491">I was the only person in Germany who had that examination.</span> <span id="s492">And I was only a woman.</span> <span id="s493">That was very difficult to swallow for the authorities, but they had no choice.</span> <span id="s494">The order had come from Berlin.</span> <span id="s495">Yes, that would be alright now.</span> <span id="s496">Because it was a prison, it was not a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s497">And from there on, for the following years and years and years, I would be the person totally in charge of the mailing, of the censorship, and of any visit they would get.</span> <span id="s498">Now they would have to find people who would visit them.</span> <span id="s499">There was a good thing that in HamburgHamburg is a seaport, of course.</span> <span id="s500">We had always had a Norwegian and Danish pastor as evident.</span> <span id="s501">Because he was there not for prisoners, but he was sent for the sailors, for the Norwegian and Danish sailors.</span> <span id="s502">So, the news idea came from Scandinavia.</span> <span id="s503">Why don't we try to get these pastors there?</span> <span id="s504">And so this happened.</span> <span id="s505">One day, I get the visit of a Norwegian and of a Danish pastor.</span> <span id="s506">They identified themselves.</span> <span id="s507">They said to me, "We have gotten our permission."</span> <span id="s508">It took them about months and months, of course.</span> <span id="s509">But we have got the permission from the prisons in Hamburg that we can visit the prisoner if you would be willing to take the censorship of the letters and of our visits.</span> <span id="s510">And I said, "This is fine.</span> <span id="s511">That can be done."</span> <span id="s512">I said, "But I have to see how far this goes in my".</span> <span id="s513">And so I contacted the authorities, the German authorities, and was very angry and said, "Now here's another work I have to do, and how would that work because I have soon had enough of it all."</span> <span id="s514">And anyway I put my words in a way that they started to beg (ph).</span> <span id="s515">They said, "Well, an order is an order, and you're the only person who can do it.</span> <span id="s516">Couldn't you please help us out?"</span> <span id="s517">I said, "Well, I don't really will so, but I will do it.</span> <span id="s518">It will be my duty."</span> <span id="s519">I said, "If that is what the authorities want, I will do it."</span> <span id="s520">That was where it started.</span> <span id="s521">From there on now, we had everything the way we wanted it.</span> <span id="s522">To begin with, it was very amusing because these two pastors . . . understand that these are two ministers very afraid of me.</span> <span id="s523">And they mistrusted me.</span> <span id="s524">I could very well understood this.</span> <span id="s525">But it took about, I would say, 35 minutes, and they began to feel (laughter) . . . they began to feel that this was alright.</span> <span id="s526">From there on we started to do our work the following four years about.</span> <span id="s527">We traveled first in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s528">We saw first in Hamburg the prisons.</span> <span id="s529">But little by little, the prisons were filled all the political prisoners from Scandinavia.</span> <span id="s530">Then we got the bombs.</span> <span id="s531">We got prisons that were bombed out.</span> <span id="s532">Little by little, they were all removed into all kinds of parts in Germany, away from where the main attacks were.</span> <span id="s533">And so there it started now that we would have to travel from one prison to the other in the following years.</span> <span id="s534">Officially, I was the supervisor of these two pastors who visited the prisoners.</span> <span id="s535">I was to, of course, make sure that nothing was said which was not allowed.</span> <span id="s536">I had to do censorship of all their mail, all their contacts between Denmark and Norway and the prisons.</span> <span id="s537">Of course, I was in total charge that nothing was done which was a..</span> <span id="s538">.</span> <span id="s539">So, this started the work which now then followed in the four years.</span> <span id="s540">I was very happy to say that I did it my way.</span> <span id="s541">I did it frankly in a way that my two pastors were sometimes very angry and felt I took too many chances.</span> <span id="s542">They said one day very angry, "We can't go along with it any more.</span> <span id="s543">You do too much.</span> <span id="s544">First you lose your head and what happens then?"</span> <span id="s545">They were, of course, I could understand, they were afraid for their life.</span> <span id="s546">I never forgot that moment.</span> <span id="s547">I looked at the two of them and I said: "You know, I must tell you.</span> <span id="s548">I would rather lose my head than my heart."</span> <span id="s549">And so that's a tune (ph) for there on.</span> <span id="s550">I'm happy to say that they will not die, that maybe soon I can say at that time I did all that was necessary and what could be done.</span> <span id="s551">It still makes me very, very happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Can you describe to us specifically, when you first went into the prison in Hamburg with the ministers, how did you begin to think about the things you could do?</span> <span id="s553">Because you begin to bring in things to the prisoners that were . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: You know it was obvious from the letters they wrote that they would instruct their wives not to write anything.</span> <span id="s555">But you begin to read between lines when you read many letters.</span> <span id="s556">You know, I read thousands and thousands of letters in the following years.</span> <span id="s557">I could see what enormous need they were in.</span> <span id="s558">They were starving.</span> <span id="s559">They were simply starving.</span> <span id="s560">I mean, they got minimal rations which washow do you describe?</span> <span id="s561">I mean, the lunch I just had would have been two full days of nourishment.</span> <span id="s562">I mean, it was justit was very hard to describe.</span> <span id="s563">They were all, of course, emaciated (ph) people who saw them and who once in awhile had maybe a commission to see them where they barely could recognize them.</span> <span id="s564">They were like muscle (ph) men, we called them.</span> <span id="s565">I mean, it's hard to describe.</span> <span id="s566">But I could see that was the first thing.</span> <span id="s567">They needed something which would keep them alive.</span> <span id="s568">To begin, I had only my bag.</span> <span id="s569">You know?</span> <span id="s570">I always made sure that I had a big bag, like this bag back here.</span> <span id="s571">I started with vitamin tablets.</span> <span id="s572">I thought that is easy to put in the bag.</span> <span id="s573">Now my two ministers could not have done anything who visited.</span> <span id="s574">You see, they were the one who had gotten the permission to visit once in awhile, because it was still prison.</span> <span id="s575">There was a still a certain order and aggravation.</span> <span id="s576">They couldn't do this, and they didn't want to do it.</span> <span id="s577">They were probably very afraid.</span> <span id="s578">I could very well understand it.</span> <span id="s579">And so what I did was really my own risk.</span> <span id="s580">I felt I needed to do this.</span> <span id="s581">So, I started with this.</span> <span id="s582">And in this bag, what could I do?</span> <span id="s583">We saw on a day maybe 30, 40 prisoners.</span> <span id="s584">Very little, very little you could have in such a bag.</span> <span id="s585">Little by little, I got a very good idea.</span> <span id="s586">Then about on the second month, my goodness, we have all these terrible air raids in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s587">I have to think for myself.</span> <span id="s588">I have to carry around all I belong.</span> <span id="s589">So, I start first with a little handbag.</span> <span id="s590">And they looked, the authorities.</span> <span id="s591">And they said, "Well, what is that?"</span> <span id="s592">I said, "That is all I have."</span> <span id="s593">"How do you mean?"</span> <span id="s594">"Because we travel now over all Germany."</span> <span id="s595">I said, "If a bomb comes, if I'm bombed out, that is the only thing I have."</span> <span id="s596">And wouldn't you think that they would have done the bright idea and said wouldn't you open it.</span> <span id="s597">Because everybody else who entered and left had to open.</span> <span id="s598">However, they came to think I was appointed by the highest authorities in Berlin.</span> <span id="s599">And I always, of course, very leisurely said I'm so and so.</span> <span id="s600">They all knew it.</span> <span id="s601">They were afraid of me.</span> <span id="s602">So, nobody ever in all these years asked me just once, "open it".</span> <span id="s603">By the grace of God.</span> <span id="s604">I think there was again the idea of authority.</span> <span id="s605">Very often they looked at me and I knew exactly what they thought.</span> <span id="s606">I would have thought the same.</span> <span id="s607">They would think how is it possible that she can do all these things.</span> <span id="s608">Come in and out, and especially I was only a woman.</span> <span id="s609">That was very hard to perceive.</span> <span id="s610">I think that was the saving grace because I could read it.</span> <span id="s611">They thought if that is really a woman only, there must be very special with her.</span> <span id="s612">She must be special.</span> <span id="s613">So, more or less, I think they thought I was over and beyond the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s614">And, believe it or not, in all these years this worked and was really I can always say by the grace of God.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: Where did you get the vitamins from?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Now, of course, I knew the first thing to do is what can you do in the luggage which is of greatest importance.</span> <span id="s617">And I felt these people were starving.</span> <span id="s618">I wish I could have afford to give them bread or anything, but the most important thing was something which was small and which could give some general strength.</span> <span id="s619">So I needed now vitamins.</span> <span id="s620">Now I went around begging for vitamins.</span> <span id="s621">There were not much vitamins because everybody needed vitamins.</span> <span id="s622">Everybody was in a very deplorable situation.</span> <span id="s623">I mean, Germany itself as the years went by, really had not much to eat.</span> <span id="s624">But nothing which could be compared with the miserable shape in the prisons.</span> <span id="s625">So, little by little, I said in the letters, who I send them myself.</span> <span id="s626">I was the authority.</span> <span id="s627">I said send parcels (ph), send vitamins.</span> <span id="s628">"Send vitamins"I put that and scribbled that in.</span> <span id="s629">And not long the settings came in.</span> <span id="s630">Came in, came in, came in.</span> <span id="s631">Then I said again, I want to be in charge of these parcels.</span> <span id="s632">And since I was in charge of the whole thing, they . . . .</span> <span id="s633">So, we had the vitamins.</span> <span id="s634">What they couldn't send, I got through my underground in Germany, which, of course, by that time also built up.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: Now is this Mr. Jenkins?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: It was Mr. Jenkins.</span> <span id="s637">You see, I left in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s638">Hamburg is a posh town, which is very good because all the Danish and Norwegian moved.</span> <span id="s639">They had to come to Hamburg and deliver the merchandise.</span> <span id="s640">And they had a man there.</span> <span id="s641">I had met a captain there by circumstances who was in charge of these boats and loading.</span> <span id="s642">And so very soon I developed a very hearty friendship with this man and I think he knew exactly what was going on, but he was a good man.</span> <span id="s643">He was a German.</span> <span id="s644">A very good man.</span> <span id="s645">So, we never spoke about what we did.</span> <span id="s646">But we did it in silence.</span> <span id="s647">He brought me the things I needed.</span> <span id="s648">He came whenever I wanted to help and he gave it to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: Did you ask him for vitamins?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: I told him that I needed vitamins for myself.</span> <span id="s651">I said, "You see, I'm only woman.</span> <span id="s652">I have a very important job."</span> <span id="s653">I told him, "I have to deal with the Scandinavian prisoners.</span> <span id="s654">I have to keep my strength up."</span> <span id="s655">He didn't say, he didn't make a comment, but at the end of our conversationI never forgot it.</span> <span id="s656">He got up and he said, "You know you're really a very tiny person.</span> <span id="s657">But I think you need a lot of them."</span> <span id="s658">I looked him straight in the face and said, "And a lot, and a lot."</span> <span id="s659">And he said, "I will remember."</span> <span id="s660">From there on, I got all the deliveries.</span> <span id="s661">It was really wonderful.</span> <span id="s662">It all was somehow . . . I must tell you, I'm not a person that goes to church.</span> <span id="s663">You know, people are different.</span> <span id="s664">But I began to believe that help is given.</span> <span id="s665">Where you really pray for help or you want to help or you really wanted this all your help.</span> <span id="s666">Because I can only say I could not have done all this work alone.</span> <span id="s667">Help was given tome.</span> <span id="s668">And there came in these vitamins by the most wonderful circumstances.</span> <span id="s669">It would take much too long here to tell you.</span> <span id="s670">I was never running out of vitamins.</span> <span id="s671">Even if I wrote my brothers, who were now as physicians in the army, sent me vitamins.</span> <span id="s672">"I need vitamins.</span> <span id="s673">I am very hungry."</span> <span id="s674">They knew, of course, what I meant (laughter).</span> <span id="s675">And so I got them from everywhere.</span> <span id="s676">Help was given.</span> <span id="s677">I never ran out of it.</span> <span id="s678">And that would somehow help these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: Did you get medicine as well from this doctor . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: Of course, little by little also the medicine.</span> <span id="s681">There was no medicine, certainly not for the prisons.</span> <span id="s682">I began to collect medicine.</span> <span id="s683">I had our own doctor.</span> <span id="s684">Our own physician was a man, a very right‑winged German, veryhow should I say –patalotic (ph), and yet he was a human being.</span> <span id="s685">I mean, I could see what the Nazis did, he felt.</span> <span id="s686">You see, there was still a little different being a patalotic(ph) German, but being a Nazi.</span> <span id="s687">There was a little bit difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: This was in Hamburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: That was in Hamburg, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Von . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: Dr. Vonburg (ph).</span> <span id="s692">And so I went one day to him and I said, "Look, I need your help."</span> <span id="s693">I remember this today.</span> <span id="s694">He said to me, "I think you need help.</span> <span id="s695">You look very pale."</span> <span id="s696">I said, "This is precisely why I come to you.</span> <span id="s697">I feel all starving."</span> <span id="s698">It was very difficult.</span> <span id="s699">I mean, all throughout the German because there really not much to eat.</span> <span id="s700">But, "I need vitamins.</span> <span id="s701">I need vitamins very much in order to keep my job up.</span> <span id="s702">I need a lot of help."</span> <span id="s703">He said, "What would help this?"</span> <span id="s704">I said, "Well, to give you some idea, I work for people who need help, who are very much in help."</span> <span id="s705">And he said, "What is it?"</span> <span id="s706">I said, "Well, very sick at work.</span> <span id="s707">I would rather not speak about it.</span> <span id="s708">So, please allow me not to speak at all.</span> <span id="s709">But I need help."</span> <span id="s710">And from there on, I will say this wonderful man gave me . . . he could do it as a physician.</span> <span id="s711">At that time, I was not a physician.</span> <span id="s712">I was the linguist.</span> <span id="s713">I got all the vitamins I needed.</span> <span id="s714">The wonderful thing was, I went with this heavy luggage in and out of prisons.</span> <span id="s715">The prevalent regional Danish from, he couldn't understand what I did.</span> <span id="s716">And the people at the prison asked my, "Why do you have all this luggage?"</span> <span id="s717">I said, "Look here.</span> <span id="s718">I come from Hamburg.</span> <span id="s719">This is all I have.</span> <span id="s720">That's all my possessions."</span> <span id="s721">They never dared to ask me to open the luggage.</span> <span id="s722">Do you know why?</span> <span id="s723">Because they were so afraid of me because I had a rather high position.</span> <span id="s724">And I also once in awhile said, "See Hitler, as he's asked me to do all these things."</span> <span id="s725">They were afraid of me.</span> <span id="s726">That was the reason that we could be alone with the prisoners.</span> <span id="s727">Usually, if you ever have been in a prison, you are never alone with the prisoner.</span> <span id="s728">I don't know how it is here, but in Germany it would be there would always be a man in there to supervisea guard.</span> <span id="s729">But I always said, "Look here.</span> <span id="s730">I don't want a guard.</span> <span id="s731">I'm the guard."</span> <span id="s732">The only thing they needed to do is one day to say open your luggage, and it all would have come out.</span> <span id="s733">But they never dared to ask the question.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Did you see the prisoners one by one, or did a group come in and see you?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: I tried to do it by groups because, see, in Hamburg I had 800 prisoners.</span> <span id="s736">In order to cover as many people as possible, I always tried to have four, five, six people at the same time.</span> <span id="s737">See, there is a miracle of the human heart.</span> <span id="s738">The miracle.</span> <span id="s739">I call it the miracle.</span> <span id="s740">None of these people ever revealed me.</span> <span id="s741">See, if only one of them had said somethingone of the prisonersthey would have had some.</span> <span id="s742">They would have gotten more bread.</span> <span id="s743">They would have gotten some things, some reward.</span> <span id="s744">None of them.</span> <span id="s745">See, and that in a time when I believed in the human heart was almost nothing anymore, that restored my belief.</span> <span id="s746">That these people in the greatest need they were, they knew exactly why I did it and they knew that this had to go on.</span> <span id="s747">Of course, don't forget these people were not criminals.</span> <span id="s748">These people were the elite of Scandinavia who had been arrested solely for the reason that they had been brave enough to try to lift Hitler's regime.</span> <span id="s749">But I will say still people who were starving, who . . . hopefully you've never starved.</span> <span id="s750">People who really starveI had learned that in my own life – it takes a tremendous ethical way of being and thinking.</span> <span id="s751">That you don't almost do anything just for a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s752">I learned that in my life how difficult it iswhat starvation really means.</span> <span id="s753">So I will say this experience with my prisoners, my 800 prisoners, which little by little I had to deal with, that nobody ever revealed on me.</span> <span id="s754">Why I'm sure that particular prisoner who would have done that would have been emptied the water (ph).</span> <span id="s755">That have really restored my belief in the human being.</span> <span id="s756">A belief which had been always distorted by the Nazis and by the things I had to fear in my life.</span> <span id="s757">And whenever I have moments where I'm still sad about the human heart and what people can do, I think of that.</span> <span id="s758">I think that was for me the greatest reward.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: Did you get to know some of these prisoners better than others?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: Oh, they became my family.</span> <span id="s761">All of them.</span> <span id="s762">All 800.</span> <span id="s763">They became my family.</span> <span id="s764">They became my friends.</span> <span id="s765">I loved them.</span> <span id="s766">I became for them, you know, I think really, it was for them, that was there home.</span> <span id="s767">That was all they had.</span> <span id="s768">Don't you see that went on over four years.</span> <span id="s769">The hardest moment was to part because there the one day in the middle of the night, and all shipped back to Scandinavia.</span> <span id="s770">The best we could hope for.</span> <span id="s771">They were not gassed.</span> <span id="s772">They were not killed.</span> <span id="s773">And so now it started.</span> <span id="s774">They became extremely for me.</span> <span id="s775">I remember one day shortly after the war, a man totally knocked at our door.</span> <span id="s776">One of the great moments of my life.</span> <span id="s777">We opened and he said, "I'm coming for Hiltgunt."</span> <span id="s778">He said in Norwegian.</span> <span id="s779">I said, "Are you?"</span> <span id="s780">He said, "I am.</span> <span id="s781">But, I'm not one of your prisoners," he said.</span> <span id="s782">"But they sent me.</span> <span id="s783">They want you to know that they have not forgotten you and that we try everything possible that we can come in contact with you.</span> <span id="s784">And so it took about one and a half years.</span> <span id="s785">I mean, Germany was really hermetically sealed.</span> <span id="s786">But little by little, the first pastors arrived, it was so beautiful.</span> <span id="s787">And little by little, the first people arrived in uniforms, and English uniforms and American uniforms, whatever they could get a hold of.</span> <span id="s788">My former prisoners came.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: So they came.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: They came to visit me after the war, you see.</span> <span id="s791">It was very beautiful.</span> <span id="s792">So the British authority, they were very strict, of course.</span> <span id="s793">They didn't know even of what's going on.</span> <span id="s794">But they very soon came and told them all about it.</span> <span id="s795">And so the connection was there.</span> <span id="s796">Not long afterwards, I was given the official invitation to both Denmark and Norway to visit them on our official state visit.</span> <span id="s797">It was one of the great moments of my life when I arrived there and in front all the prisoners who had survived.</span> <span id="s798">It's one of the great moments of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: And you received the medal . . . ?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s801">I received these decorations.</span> <span id="s802">I was very happy about.</span> <span id="s803">But, the greatest decoration was really that I could get them out alive.</span> <span id="s804">That was something so wonderful a feeling.</span> <span id="s805">Yet I was very grateful for all the honors later that came.</span> <span id="s806">But the importance was really that I could do when it was needed.</span> <span id="s807">And I think that we need to remember now how much we human owe to each other.</span> <span id="s808">I think sometimes we forget that because now we have times, of course, where we have relatively comfortable situations.</span> <span id="s809">We have no wars going on, or big wars.</span> <span id="s810">But I think we must never forget what we as individuals can really do for each other.</span> <span id="s811">So often, for example, in this country, I hear that they should do this and they should do that.</span> <span id="s812">"They" meaning this unknown authority, whoever.</span> <span id="s813">And each time I cannot but say who is "they"?</span> <span id="s814">Well, that authority.</span> <span id="s815">Well don't you think it's a good idea to ask myself what I could do?</span> <span id="s816">And so little by little, of course, when the thingswhen I wrote my book, "Walls"(ph), and when things got known, the universities got very interested in, to hear about it more.</span> <span id="s817">And so I now since several years that you might know have been traveling from one university to the next.</span> <span id="s818">They wanted to find out what really was happening at that time.</span> <span id="s819">And more and more, they also ask the question, why would you do it?</span> <span id="s820">Why would you have taken the risk?</span> <span id="s821">It makes me always a little bit sad.</span> <span id="s822">And I look at them and say, "Why should I not have done it?</span> <span id="s823">What would you have done?"</span> <span id="s824">And sometimes the answer is silence.</span> <span id="s825">And I don't resent that because that is really the question each of us has ask yourself.</span> <span id="s826">If you come in such a situation, what would you do?</span> <span id="s827">I mean, this is somebody can decide that for you.</span> <span id="s828">What makes me sad, I must tell you this, is how today in our community of people how often I hear these kind of things.</span> <span id="s829">Well, those Jews or those blacks and those this and those that.</span> <span id="s830">How much of prejudices we still have.</span> <span id="s831">I think in many ways, the war is still going on.</span> <span id="s832">It's my prayer, now I'm old, that we begin to learn that the human condition is really one we all have in common.</span> <span id="s833">And before we don't fully understand ityes, before we don't fully understand itthere will always be the possibility of another Hitler.</span> <span id="s834">And that is really my prayer, if I have any prayer left, that we begin to understand that the human condition is that what we all have in common.</span> <span id="s835">And if we fully understand this, and I'm proud to say that in this environment.</span> <span id="s836">If we begin fully to understand it, then I think there is hope for this troubled world.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: Dr. Zassenhaus, can you describe your family life with your brothers and your parents and how they raised you, and with what values they raised you?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s840">I must tell you that my father had studied religious literature and history.</span> <span id="s841">He was an educator and very soon became the head of a rather prestigious school in Hamburg, in Germany, where he also taught a little bit.</span> <span id="s842">He taught mostly ethics and literature.</span> <span id="s843">My mother was a free spirit, which you can see in those days this was very unusual.</span> <span id="s844">Already with age 15, she moved into another city because she came from a very small city, where she was a the first woman in Germany took her full education, her full degree in school, which was very unusual at that time.</span> <span id="s845">Fortunately, she met there the head of that school and fell in love with him.</span> <span id="s846">And that became my father.</span> <span id="s847">So they married.</span> <span id="s848">She never went to the university, which she actually had wanted to do.</span> <span id="s849">Don't forget, it was a different time.</span> <span id="s850">My father very soon was called to Hamburg to a very prestigious school there where he became the head.</span> <span id="s851">Not only that, he also taught history and religion, and wrote the history of Germany, which became a very important book and it’s still read in the universities in schools in Germany.</span> <span id="s852">So that was a background I had.</span> <span id="s853">I would say the ideas of Hitler were as far from our family as the moon.</span> <span id="s854">And I remember so very well the very day, the 30th of January, when suddenly now through all the loud speakerstelevisions we didn't have at that time.</span> <span id="s855">Loudspeakers came "the Fuhrer has the power.</span> <span id="s856">Adolf Hitler has come to power."</span> <span id="s857">It was to us almost as somebody shook us and said "the whole house is on fire".</span> <span id="s858">We didn't know.</span> <span id="s859">Especially we were four children.</span> <span id="s860">I had three brothers, all one year apart, and I was the young sister.</span> <span id="s861">When my brother studied at the university, I was still going to school.</span> <span id="s862">I remember as it had been today, although it was, I think, 200 years ago.</span> <span id="s863">Our parents assembled us all together at the table and my father said, "From now on, things will be different.</span> <span id="s864">Everything has changed."</span> <span id="s865">And my mother added, "But one thing remains the same.</span> <span id="s866">In our house, everything will be same.</span> <span id="s867">We will be now one family who totally stands together.</span> <span id="s868">But this house has to become a fortress.</span> <span id="s869">Whatever you say outside, it has to be mainly in silence because somehow we have to try to survive."</span> <span id="s870">And very well the next day we found out what she meant with it.</span> <span id="s871">I woke up to a total dark room, although it was a light day.</span> <span id="s872">I could not know what had happened.</span> <span id="s873">I saw at the windows and a hush through the whole house.</span> <span id="s874">And I saw all our windows were sealed with swastikas, with paper, and darkened by that.</span> <span id="s875">Because my father was a rather known educator in Germany who had written books about education and so they wanted to show us now what had happened.</span> <span id="s876">And if we didn't know, my father, of course, immediately was without a job.</span> <span id="s877">He was the head of the school.</span> <span id="s878">At that time, he was already quite ill.</span> <span id="s879">He had Parkinson's disease in a rather progressed shape already.</span> <span id="s880">And I think that really saved his life.</span> <span id="s881">He was so well‑known a person that to begin with, the Nazis more or less tried to tread lightly.</span> <span id="s882">And so they let him be at home and let him die in peace.</span> <span id="s883">A couple of months later, he was dead.</span> <span id="s884">And now here my mother was with four children.</span> <span id="s885">I was the youngest.</span> <span id="s886">I was about 16 or 17 years old.</span> <span id="s887">I remember my first school day.</span> <span id="s888">The teacher, a wonderful teacher whom I adored, she taught us history.</span> <span id="s889">She came into our class.</span> <span id="s890">She was very pale.</span> <span id="s891">That is what I noticed immediately.</span> <span id="s892">And she said, "Well girls, I must tell you from now on everything will be different.</span> <span id="s893">And the first thing I will tell you from now on whenever a teacher enters the class, you all have to get up.</span> <span id="s894">You have to raise your right arm and have to shout as loud as possible 'Heil Hitler'.</span> <span id="s895">That's the way it will be."</span> <span id="s896">I knew her well enough.</span> <span id="s897">I saw the tears in her eyes.</span> <span id="s898">I was disturbed by it.</span> <span id="s899">Why would she even tell us that?</span> <span id="s900">How could she tell us?</span> <span id="s901">I came home.</span> <span id="s902">I was very upset.</span> <span id="s903">I told my parents.</span> <span id="s904">I saw they became very silent.</span> <span id="s905">And somewhat later, they came to meant they said, "Well, what will you do?"</span> <span id="s906">And I said, "Well, what am I to do?</span> <span id="s907">What do you think I should do?</span> <span id="s908">Give me advice.</span> <span id="s909">I cannot raise my right arm.</span> <span id="s910">I will not do this kind of thing."</span> <span id="s911">And they said, "Well, I think we will all think about it somehow."</span> <span id="s912">And so the next morning before I went to school, they came again to meant they said, "Now what have you decided?"</span> <span id="s913">And I said, with tears in my eyes, "What do you think I should do?"</span> <span id="s914">I was desperate.</span> <span id="s915">It was probably one of the really most desperate days of my life, because my father looked very seriously at me and he said, "Hiltgunt, you must decide for yourself."</span> <span id="s916">Totally in that moment, it was the first time that I really felt very alone.</span> <span id="s917">So, I come to school and I had my place at the window.</span> <span id="s918">It was a wonderful day in spring.</span> <span id="s919">That was about when this order had been passed.</span> <span id="s920">Simply for now on should all raise our and place our arm "hail Hitler".</span> <span id="s921">The teacher enters the classroom, the windows were open.</span> <span id="s922">Now all these girls stood straight, raising their right arm.</span> <span id="s923">Curious as they were and as much as these little girls were, they knew where I stood.</span> <span id="s924">The heads all were bent to me.</span> <span id="s925">What will she do?</span> <span id="s926">And in my desperation, I took my left arm and I threw it through the open window!</span> <span id="s927">The glass fell, blood fell from my arm!</span> <span id="s928">Here you see still the scar.</span> <span id="s929">(laughter) I was rushed to the hospital to be sewed up.</span> <span id="s930">And I must tell you, I still consider it the scar of my honor.</span> <span id="s931">And from now on, I will tell you, nobody ever looked in my direction.</span> <span id="s932">They simply left me alone.</span> <span id="s933">And I stood there alone some down there and thought, well, well, but they didn't say anything, and just did nothing.</span> <span id="s934">Really it was by the grace of God, or maybe rather by the doubtless respect they had for my father who was really a known educator, that they simply overlooked me.</span> <span id="s935">They let me be.</span> <span id="s936">That was really the reason that I still was allowed to remain in school, that they simply ignored me.</span> <span id="s937">That was the best they could.</span> <span id="s938">The other way they would have simply would have to tell the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s939">They didn't do that, thanks to the reputation of my father.</span> <span id="s940">I passed my examination and I was on my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Tell me, before that incident happened, you were given an assignment to go to a Hitler rally.</span> <span id="s942">This is before January 30 . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: That was before January 30.</span> <span id="s944">That was before all this happened, before Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s945">I went there and I was . . . I'd never been to such an assembly.</span> <span id="s946">Hearing these people scream like absolutely mad.</span> <span id="s947">Seeing this man . . . I mean, like I had fear but also I had to laugh.</span> <span id="s948">I mean, it was almost as you have seen a clown.</span> <span id="s949">And so I came home and the next day . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: Did you talk with your parents when you came home?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: I talked with my parents.</span> <span id="s952">I was totally . . . I couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s953">My parents tried to calm me down because here I was a very young.</span> <span id="s954">I think 15 or 17 years old.</span> <span id="s955">I couldn't understand what was happening.</span> <span id="s956">My father said, "What will you do?"</span> <span id="s957">I said, "What can I do?"</span> <span id="s958">I asked my parents.</span> <span id="s959">And I remember that my mother said, "You must decide that for yourself."</span> <span id="s960">And for the same time, I remember this.</span> <span id="s961">Suddenly this feeling of total loneliness.</span> <span id="s962">Finally, nobody could give me advice.</span> <span id="s963">My mother said to me, "You must really decide which way you will go from now."</span> <span id="s964">And the next day, I remember we were told now that for now we should raise our right arm.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: But you wrote an essay.</span> <span id="s966">Didn't you write an essay?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s968">I wrote . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: What did you write in this essay?</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: I wrote the essay about Hitler.</span> <span id="s971">I remember I closed with the words "Hitler is psychotic."</span> <span id="s972">With all the rest of my 17 years.</span> <span id="s973">And only two days passed and I saw my teacher coming very pale tome.</span> <span id="s974">And she said, "Take this back.</span> <span id="s975">Take this back and tear it apart."</span> <span id="s976">And I said, "Why?</span> <span id="s977">That is what I mean."</span> <span id="s978">And she looked at me, "Can't you see what you're doing to me, and what you're going to do to you?"</span> <span id="s979">And so she just simply didn't want anything to do with it.</span> <span id="s980">Now, of course, being a much older person, I understand.</span> <span id="s981">But I couldn't understand this at that time.</span> <span id="s982">Then when the order was passed that for now on whenever the teacher entered the class and for each class, we would all shout together and raise our right arm and shout "Heil Hitler".</span> <span id="s983">I came home.</span> <span id="s984">I came very upset.</span> <span id="s985">I told my parents about it.</span> <span id="s986">And I saw how serious they looked.</span> <span id="s987">Give me advice.</span> <span id="s988">What can I do?</span> <span id="s989">What shall I do?</span> <span id="s990">I will not do this.</span> <span id="s991">And I never forgot, my mother said, "You must decide that for yourself."</span> <span id="s992">That was a moment I felt very lonesome.</span> <span id="s993">So the next day arrived and I had to go to school.</span> <span id="s994">The school girls in the class then knew, of course, from before where we stood, and what I would do.</span> <span id="s995">The teacher comes into the class.</span> <span id="s996">She had told me the day before, "Hiltgunt, don't make it too difficult for me.</span> <span id="s997">Just think now."</span> <span id="s998">She was a very dear teacher.</span> <span id="s999">"Don't make this difficult."</span> <span id="s1000">And she had said, "Don't make it too difficult for yourself."</span> <span id="s1001">And so I stood there and all the eyes of the class were on me because they knew that this was going on.</span> <span id="s1002">Would I break?</span> <span id="s1003">Would I give in?</span> <span id="s1004">And I remember the words of my father, "Do you realize that you can destroy all your future if you don't give in?"</span> <span id="s1005">In my desperation, when she comes in, all these girls raise their right arm and shout, "Heil Hitler", I take my left arm and threw it right through the open window!</span> <span id="s1006">Glass was breaking, blood was pouring from the arm!</span> <span id="s1007">(laughter) I was rushed to the doctor.</span> <span id="s1008">I had to be sewed up.</span> <span id="s1009">And I will tell you, this scar I still have now.</span> <span id="s1010">I call it really the most wonderful decoration I ever got.</span> <span id="s1011">No decoration I got in later life could ever.</span> <span id="s1012">It was a very childish action.</span> <span id="s1013">I know that now, but I think it started the way I was about to go from then on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: What happened with your relationships, your friendships, with the girlfriends that you had or people you were friends with?</span> <span id="s1015">Once this happened, did people remove themselves from you and your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: You know, it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s1017">They said, "Why are you stubborn?</span> <span id="s1018">You want to study, you want tojust give in.</span> <span id="s1019">What is so difficult that you give in a little bit and do it?"</span> <span id="s1020">I felt I couldn't.</span> <span id="s1021">What they did, I will say that my father was very known person in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s1022">He has written the history of religion.</span> <span id="s1023">That book is still taught in school, the same book, at the universities.</span> <span id="s1024">So he lost, of course, his job.</span> <span id="s1025">He was ill anyway.</span> <span id="s1026">That was very good.</span> <span id="s1027">It was a thing where the Gestapo could let go and say, "Let's see what they're doing."</span> <span id="s1028">So, he was, I would say, ignored.</span> <span id="s1029">And that was our luck.</span> <span id="s1030">But, it was very, very difficult for me to give in and to raise my arm.</span> <span id="s1031">How it was resolved that I was sit in the last bench in my class and they simply ignored me.</span> <span id="s1032">They just let me go, let me do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: And when you went home, did you have friends outside of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: It was very difficult.</span> <span id="s1035">We had, of course, a few friends.</span> <span id="s1036">We would always have a few friends who thought the same way like we.</span> <span id="s1037">And this friendship got even deeper.</span> <span id="s1038">But the separation between the others got altered.</span> <span id="s1039">It was very difficult.</span> <span id="s1040">From that time, I really felt my house was my fortress.</span> <span id="s1041">The effect was my father was very ill by that time already with Parkinson's.</span> <span id="s1042">That was the only saving grace because as known as he was, originally they wanted to arrest him as one of the people that instigated of the liberal movement, of the democratic party.</span> <span id="s1043">But they left him alone because to begin they tread lightly with the known persons.</span> <span id="s1044">To begin with, because they wanted first to get really in.</span> <span id="s1045">So, they let him very soon, I must say thank heaven, he died, because that was the only saving grace for him.</span> <span id="s1046">My mother was a very known liberal person.</span> <span id="s1047">She was at this point, of course, only concerned about how far she could bring this family through to those times.</span> <span id="s1048">We really tried as best we could.</span> <span id="s1049">How did we do it financially?</span> <span id="s1050">Because there was no money left and my father was not anymore in the situation he was.</span> <span id="s1051">So, we started now to teach.</span> <span id="s1052">All the years when we studied at the university, every day for hours and hours, we all had students.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: Everybody; your mother included.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: My mother, my brother, we all.</span> <span id="s1055">You know?</span> <span id="s1056">I called it my tuition.</span> <span id="s1057">(laughter).</span> <span id="s1058">Because it was the only way how we could survive.</span> <span id="s1059">I taught.</span> <span id="s1060">I was at that time, I barely had passed school myself, so I was not much of anything yet.</span> <span id="s1061">I had to start to study.</span> <span id="s1062">But I had all these children who didn't do so well in school.</span> <span id="s1063">I taught arithmetic.</span> <span id="s1064">I was not very good myself but I learned arithmetic with them, you see?</span> <span id="s1065">Languages.</span> <span id="s1066">Every day I taught them, you see, and that way we could take the money to study at the university, because it was very expensive to study at the university.</span> <span id="s1067">Only those who join the party, and they, of course, got all the advantages.</span> <span id="s1068">We didn't do this.</span> <span id="s1069">And so we had no choice.</span> <span id="s1070">We had either to pay and then to get the money or else.</span> <span id="s1071">And, so, for years and years, I just tutored, and we all tutored.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: Now your mother also was helping Jewish people in Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: Yes, that was the other thing.</span> <span id="s1074">We had quite a few Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s1075">Very soon, of course, it came that these Jewish people were arrested.</span> <span id="s1076">And so we tried, and I will say mainly my mother because I was still a very young person, but we tried to help as much as we could.</span> <span id="s1077">We had quite a few Jewish friends and we tried to help them as much as possible.</span> <span id="s1078">For example, my mother, as my father, had very good connections to embassies, to people from abroad.</span> <span id="s1079">And so, many times she went to them to the English Embassy and asked for help.</span> <span id="s1080">And little by little, they knew my mother.</span> <span id="s1081">They knew of my father.</span> <span id="s1082">He had a very good reputation all over Germany because he was a scholar, you know?</span> <span id="s1083">And so, we could help to get these passports for Jewish people to get away.</span> <span id="s1084">That was where my mother was very, very helpful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: Did she do it for people she knew or as well for an underground group so that it was . . . ?</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: For people she knew.</span> <span id="s1087">And, you know, it always starts small.</span> <span id="s1088">And they brought other people, and they brought other people.</span> <span id="s1089">That gets bigger and bigger.</span> <span id="s1090">It's amazing when you get involved in the work, how one comes to the next.</span> <span id="s1091">These things develop.</span> <span id="s1092">So, for example, I studied then.</span> <span id="s1093">I was not finished for my school and what study would I have to do?</span> <span id="s1094">My three brothers studied medicine.</span> <span id="s1095">We all had government assistance before.</span> <span id="s1096">But, of course, now where we had not joined the Party, everything was and we had to do it ourselves.</span> <span id="s1097">It was very difficult.</span> <span id="s1098">So, what my mother did, what we all did, we tutored children who did not do good at school for hours and hours every day.</span> <span id="s1099">Sometimes I had the feeling our house was like a little cage with many birds in it, you know, as we tutored them.</span> <span id="s1100">It worked.</span> <span id="s1101">It was years of very hard work, but it was the only way we could afford the money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: Tutored Jewish children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">A: No.</span> <span id="s1104">Jewish children by that time, they were probably dead already, you know?</span> <span id="s1105">No, they were not there any more.</span> <span id="s1106">No.</span> <span id="s1107">Children simply . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: You're talking about after '39?</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: Yeah, after '39.</span> <span id="s1110">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1111">But also, I mean, after '33, you didn't have many Jewish children.</span> <span id="s1112">I mean, very few.</span> <span id="s1113">I mean, everybody who had to go.</span> <span id="s1114">Because '39, I don't think there were many Jews left.</span> <span id="s1115">I mean they were simply arrested.</span> <span id="s1116">The Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1117">I don't talk any more of the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1118">They were very soon that started after '33.</span> <span id="s1119">I cannot really give you the dates.</span> <span id="s1120">It was too long ago.</span> <span id="s1121">But, they were simply arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: Do you remember seeing Jews arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: But our Jewish friends, you see, we had . . . that was a different story because my mother, and again my father, we had very good connections to the English Embassy.</span> <span id="s1124">And so, I remember all the days when my mother was ready for days and days trying to go from one embassy to the other to try to help them out.</span> <span id="s1125">That we were very successful in.</span> <span id="s1126">I shouldn't say we.</span> <span id="s1127">It was my mother and my father, as much as he was still . . . he was very ill later on, but he always was in it.</span> <span id="s1128">So, that was very beautiful.</span> <span id="s1129">We helped quite a few of our Jewish friends out.</span> <span id="s1130">But, you see, all that was so fast.</span> <span id="s1131">Very soon.</span> <span id="s1132">I mean, I think it started then.</span> <span id="s1133">Was it '39?</span> <span id="s1134">When was the big arrest in Germany?</span> <span id="s1135">Correct me.</span> <span id="s1136">I think much earlier already, wasn't it, that the Jewish people were arrested.</span> <span id="s1137">And, of course, it was too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: Do you remember Kristalnacht(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: Absolutely I remember that, too.</span> <span id="s1140">See, certain things you never forget.</span> <span id="s1141">I remember it to that point that I very often dream of it.</span> <span id="s1142">This is very bad, you know?</span> <span id="s1143">You never quite shake the things you have seen.</span> <span id="s1144">They will stay with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: What do you remember about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: I remember the mob, the screaming people.</span> <span id="s1147">People I had known as neighbors who suddenly were screaming and raiding Jewish homes.</span> <span id="s1148">You could do anything that you wanted.</span> <span id="s1149">Anything, just kicked in the windows.</span> <span id="s1150">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s1151">The Jewish people were arrested, of course, as much as they were there.</span> <span id="s1152">My mother was very instrumental of getting Jewish people passports, passbook, whatever.</span> <span id="s1153">Whatever worked.</span> <span id="s1154">She did wonderful things at that time.</span> <span id="s1155">And she was away sometimes for days.</span> <span id="s1156">When she came home we would ask her.</span> <span id="s1157">She would say, "Please don't ask me."</span> <span id="s1158">Because the less we knew, the better for us.</span> <span id="s1159">And the less again she knew of my work later on, the better for her.</span> <span id="s1160">So, we never talked much with each other because bear in mind the Gestapo had methods which aren't known here.</span> <span id="s1161">Methods of torture where not anybody could have . . . I mean, it was simply humanly impossible.</span> <span id="s1162">So, more or less, they could find out everything they wanted once they had you.</span> <span id="s1163">So the best thing was really not knowing.</span> <span id="s1164">And those dreaded years where we all got very silent, because silence was the best thing.</span> <span id="s1165">I knew my mother was often away for days.</span> <span id="s1166">I did not ask any question.</span> <span id="s1167">Then little by little when all the arrests came and the war came, then when the Germans invaded Norway and Denmark, I had already my exams at that time.</span> <span id="s1168">Then I was asked to take totally control over them.</span> <span id="s1169">That was one of the highlights of my life.</span> <span id="s1170">I thought, "My God, here is a chance.</span> <span id="s1171">I can really do something."</span> <span id="s1172">But, again, it also meant that I had to become very silent.</span> <span id="s1173">Because under torture nobody was holding up.</span> <span id="s1174">So, it meant that more or less I had to remove myself from my friends, from my mother as much as I could, so nobody knew what I was doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: So you had . . . clearly, you would not be able to be intimate with anybody about what you . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: Under torture, you can get everything out, everything out.</span> <span id="s1177">I learned that from experience.</span> <span id="s1178">There is nothing so the main thing was silence, and doing what you felt yourself was necessary, but not involving anybody else because I felt really what I did myself I had to respond.</span> <span id="s1179">I would have to be punished myself.</span> <span id="s1180">But to involve anybody else was extremely dangerous.</span> <span id="s1181">And also the more other people knew, the more danger for you.</span> <span id="s1182">Believe me, this country, you see, it's very hard for you to envision.</span> <span id="s1183">Under torture, nobody holds up.</span> <span id="s1184">Once you are tortured, there is nothing which can hold up.</span> <span id="s1185">I knew if I would be discovered.</span> <span id="s1186">I didn't even know what my mother was doing, because I knew she did a lot of things.</span> <span id="s1187">I didn't even want to know it, because not knowing meant really gracious that you couldn't even invent anything because you wouldn't know.</span> <span id="s1188">You have never had the system in this country.</span> <span id="s1189">How fortunate you are.</span> <span id="s1190">It's very hard for you to envision.</span> <span id="s1191">But under the pressure of the Gestapo, nobody could hold up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: Were you ever questioned by the Gestapo?</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1194">I was several times.</span> <span id="s1195">I think two or three times I was summoned by the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1196">The interesting thing was we had two systems in Germany.</span> <span id="s1197">The one that was the, the legal system, which was the old Germany, and the system you have here.</span> <span id="s1198">And I was hired by the legal system to supervise all activities of the political Scandinavian prisoners.</span> <span id="s1199">But on the other side was the Gestapo who knew no law and no order.</span> <span id="s1200">And they, of course, could do with you what you wanted.</span> <span id="s1201">So here was the interesting thing.</span> <span id="s1202">I was appointed by the Minister of Justice of the old legal order to take over the total supervision in the prisons.</span> <span id="s1203">But, on the other hand, I had the Gestapo who were looking for that woman.</span> <span id="s1204">Why would she have such a . . . waiting for that moment where they could tug(ph) me and clearly give me what was due me according to them.</span> <span id="s1205">That was a very interesting relationship.</span> <span id="s1206">It's very hard for you people to understand.</span> <span id="s1207">So I walked a very thin path.</span> <span id="s1208">I had all my credentials there from the highest Minister of Justice from Berlin.</span> <span id="s1209">Whenever the Gestapo started to answer, I showed this and said, "Look here, you have to answer these people."</span> <span id="s1210">And that was this little double game I led that's really practically saved my life.</span> <span id="s1211">That gave me that authority because the interesting thing was again in the prisons there were also very sharp laws.</span> <span id="s1212">And I knew these people were practically my prisoners but practically starving to death.</span> <span id="s1213">So I said we have to do something.</span> <span id="s1214">And I put in the luggage heavy with bread, with medication, mainly vitamins.</span> <span id="s1215">I mean, things which we either concentrated which could keep them up.</span> <span id="s1216">They did not dare to open my luggage because I again was a very high authority appointed by Berlin.</span> <span id="s1217">You see, it's funny how for people here in America don't understand.</span> <span id="s1218">It's worked very much by authority and since I had been appointed by high authority, they did not dare examine what I was taking in.</span> <span id="s1219">Why I was doing these things because they were afraid of me.</span> <span id="s1220">This other world(ph), such a system as we had in Germany, the Nazi system, which is a system which other countries could have too, which is always a potential.</span> <span id="s1221">It works on the fear.</span> <span id="s1222">The one fears the other.</span> <span id="s1223">And he who can instill the most fear will have the upper top.</span> <span id="s1224">So my whole policy in dealing with the authorities was to have continuously referred to my connections in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1225">And the connections in Berlin had certain for them like Hitler, didn't quite know what they should make of me.</span> <span id="s1226">There was another thing they couldn't understand.</span> <span id="s1227">They couldn't understand that I was a academic, that I had all the essential examinations for that particular examination exactly understood.</span> <span id="s1228">But why oh why would they appoint a woman?</span> <span id="s1229">And I was only a woman.</span> <span id="s1230">That was very hard to understand, especially for these high Nazi officials.</span> <span id="s1231">And so, little by little, a saga developed.</span> <span id="s1232">Somehow she must have very high connections to Berlin.</span> <span id="s1233">(laughter) And since I very often said Berlin doesn't like this.</span> <span id="s1234">(laughter) I had to play my game because not only did I have to save my beloved prisoners but also my own life, the life of my siblings at stake.</span> <span id="s1235">If I had really been found out, it would have been tragic, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: Were you frightened throughout this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: Very much so.</span> <span id="s1238">Don't think that I . . . The greatest insult I still had when my Scandinavian people tried to stop and tell me I was a hero.</span> <span id="s1239">I said, "Please don't say that I'm a hero.</span> <span id="s1240">I was ever afraid of the next . . . there's nothing, no hero in me."</span> <span id="s1241">But I felt I had to go my way.</span> <span id="s1242">That is what I had decided even to the point of this: I would have been killed or hanged.</span> <span id="s1243">I think I had to go my way.</span> <span id="s1244">When you're very young, I think you can make that kind of decision.</span> <span id="s1245">And I must tell you, if such a situation would arise again today, I think I would be able to act the same way.</span> <span id="s1246">Thank heaven it has never . . . that was one of the reasons I came to this country.</span> <span id="s1247">I needed, after all this was over and I had survived, I needed to forget.</span> <span id="s1248">You see, when everything was over, Scandinavia was so good to me.</span> <span id="s1249">You have no idea.</span> <span id="s1250">They treated me, I mean I can almost start to cry.</span> <span id="s1251">There never was anybody treated better.</span> <span id="s1252">They came to me.</span> <span id="s1253">The very first moment they came, they sent food.</span> <span id="s1254">They then finally invited me to Scandinavia.</span> <span id="s1255">I could study.</span> <span id="s1256">I could finish my medicine.</span> <span id="s1257">There was not a thing they didn't do for me.</span> <span id="s1258">And I will never forget that.</span> <span id="s1259">The gratitude was overwhelming.</span> <span id="s1260">But still when all is said and done and I had passed my examinations, the one thing that had never left me – my memories.</span> <span id="s1261">This what was so totally destroyed.</span> <span id="s1262">Because I loved Germany.</span> <span id="s1263">I loved my country just as you love your country.</span> <span id="s1264">And I haven't seen it for years and years.</span> <span id="s1265">This total destruction of all I had loved, of the spirit of good, of all these things which was for me Germany.</span> <span id="s1266">Somehow I had to try to forget.</span> <span id="s1267">I felt Scandinavia was too close to it all.</span> <span id="s1268">So after the war I had my examinations there, I studied medicine there.</span> <span id="s1269">They were extremely good to me.</span> <span id="s1270">And they said, "Now you will stay with us."</span> <span id="s1271">Instead, I think, I have to leave.</span> <span id="s1272">I have to go where I can forget what happened.</span> <span id="s1273">First, they couldn't quite understand that.</span> <span id="s1274">But they said, "You have to ."</span> <span id="s1275">But they forgave me and they finally said, "If that's what you must do, we will bless you and we will wish you our good wishes."</span> <span id="s1276">And I can assure you even today after so many years, if somebody comes from Scandinavia, they will always come to me.</span> <span id="s1277">They will not only come to Washington, they come to me.</span> <span id="s1278">And that maybe has been even a greater reward for me than all the wonderful kinds of decorations they after bestowed on me.</span> <span id="s1279">This gratitude, this remembrance, this love.</span> <span id="s1280">That will forever be in my heart.</span> <span id="s1281">I'm very grateful for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: Tell me aboutyou and your mother were baking loaves for bread and you were taking them into the prisons?</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1284">That was what I did because it's hard for you to imagine because even in this prison system here in America, it certainly is not very comfortable because I have been visiting prisons here.</span> <span id="s1285">But certainly they get fed and, I mean, it's absolutely according to schedule and all this.</span> <span id="s1286">But there, it was really was so very little.</span> <span id="s1287">starved out.</span> <span id="s1288">I mean, they got rations.</span> <span id="s1289">It's hard for you to imagine.</span> <span id="s1290">Of course, don't forget you only hear about the people who survived.</span> <span id="s1291">You know, of course, of the2,000,000 of people who died.</span> <span id="s1292">And not only Jewish people, but many, many of our political prisoners from wherever.</span> <span id="s1293">Simply overstaffed finally, but there was a certain order in prison still.</span> <span id="s1294">It was a minimum.</span> <span id="s1295">A minimum of rationing, but it was so that they just could get by if they were strong.</span> <span id="s1296">So the young ones survived.</span> <span id="s1297">The older ones it was more difficult.</span> <span id="s1298">And so what I felt I had to do when I was appointed from Berlin to this special situation, to supervise the visits my Scandinavian political prisoners got, I felt not only do I have to supervise there my way, that's not enough.</span> <span id="s1299">But I have also to give them help as much as I could.</span> <span id="s1300">And so I had a wonderful idea.</span> <span id="s1301">Everybody in Germany was afraid of the air raids and that they would lose everything.</span> <span id="s1302">So, I had two very heavy pieces of luggage.</span> <span id="s1303">And each time when I went into the prison or into these camps, I filled my luggage with bread, with vitamins, with anything possible to give them nourishment.</span> <span id="s1304">And I locked them in and that they never ask you to open it.</span> <span id="s1305">They couldn't because there again was the idea a very high position.</span> <span id="s1306">I was appointed directly by Berlin.</span> <span id="s1307">So whenever they even made a little ask what have you there, I showed them my thing and they said, "Well, but all the luggage.</span> <span id="s1308">Why don't you leave it here?</span> <span id="s1309">We can keep it here."</span> <span id="s1310">I said, "Oh no, that goes right with me because if we are bombed, I will have my luggage.</span> <span id="s1311">That is the last thing I have."</span> <span id="s1312">And they never dared.</span> <span id="s1313">And that is never anybody dared to say, "open the luggage."</span> <span id="s1314">Because one opening they would have known what was in it, all these things for the prisoners.</span> <span id="s1315">Why did they not dare it?</span> <span id="s1316">Because I really had a very high position.</span> <span id="s1317">I was above them.</span> <span id="s1318">I came more or less as if you think your controller comes to control what you're doing.</span> <span id="s1319">So, that was really the tremendous blessing I had.</span> <span id="s1320">So isn't this awful how the one fooled the other?</span> <span id="s1321">That was the whole game the Gestapo played.</span> <span id="s1322">To some extent, they were afraid of me.</span> <span id="s1323">I was, of course, very much afraid of them.</span> <span id="s1324">(laughter) But if you knew how to play it, somehow you could really give them help.</span> <span id="s1325">What kind of help could I give?</span> <span id="s1326">You see, these prisoners were . . . It's very hard for you even to envision that.</span> <span id="s1327">They were at an absolute zero.</span> <span id="s1328">But they mostly needed . . . they needed, of course, nourishment.</span> <span id="s1329">They needed medication.</span> <span id="s1330">Now, it was nice to carry in bread.</span> <span id="s1331">I tried to carry that in.</span> <span id="s1332">But that was so little.</span> <span id="s1333">What they mainly needed were vitamins, I mean, just to give them the most basic.</span> <span id="s1334">Somehow to keep them alive.</span> <span id="s1335">And, see, that's what I had in my luggage.</span> <span id="s1336">I had two rather heavy pieces of luggage which I had to carry myself because the Norwegian and Danish priests, I could very well understand it, that they could not do this because that was really my risk.</span> <span id="s1337">And so I had to carry them myself.</span> <span id="s1338">And also by carrying them in myself, since I had this rather high position directly appointed by Berlin, anybody who would ever had dared to say, "open your luggage", and there was a good possibility, I would have said, "Look here, you don't know who your talking with."</span> <span id="s1339">And would have uttered a few names off.</span> <span id="s1340">The whole system of Nazism, which I think you have found out and understood, is that the one feared the other.</span> <span id="s1341">And if you worked on the fear, based on the fear the other had for you, then you somehow could get away.</span> <span id="s1342">At least you took a very good chance to do it.</span> <span id="s1343">That was really my whole work, and somehow I could do it.</span> <span id="s1344">You see, what took place already, very much the prison systems all used different . . . different prisons.</span> <span id="s1345">You see, I went from prison to the other.</span> <span id="s1346">How in the world could a woman get such a high job?</span> <span id="s1347">Because I was only a woman.</span> <span id="s1348">In Nazi Germany, the woman was really just there to give children.</span> <span id="s1349">That already somehow made them a little bit suspicious.</span> <span id="s1350">There must be something special with her if she would get this permission from Berlin.</span> <span id="s1351">So, that was already a very good thing.</span> <span id="s1352">And so they tried to stay as much as possible out of it.</span> <span id="s1353">And at least if they would have said, "open your luggage", which they usually would have done, I would immediately said, "Do you realize who I am?"</span> <span id="s1354">That would have been the end of that.</span> <span id="s1355">So, the whole system of Nazi, which I think is hard; it's very difficult to understand here is that the one intimidates the other.</span> <span id="s1356">It was a system of intimidation.</span> <span id="s1357">That is what I had to pay.</span> <span id="s1358">It worked very much with me.</span> <span id="s1359">Because the good thing was I was a woman and they always felt if a woman really would get . . . that's such a hard thing, then she must be something special.</span> <span id="s1360">You see, it is a system that the one is fearful of the other.</span> <span id="s1361">Because I was just afraid of them, of course.</span> <span id="s1362">(laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: Dr. Zassenhaus, when you first had the job censoring letters, they gave you letters from ghettos from Poland, isn't that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: Were those the first letters that you were . . .?</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: Those were some of the very first letters.</span> <span id="s1367">You see, I was in the censored system because due to by my language ability.</span> <span id="s1368">You see, I had also studied English.</span> <span id="s1369">It was very by circumstance.</span> <span id="s1370">It's all about education.</span> <span id="s1371">Scandinavian language, English language, French.</span> <span id="s1372">So, they could use me for all these things.</span> <span id="s1373">That was how it all started.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: But was this a shock to you?</span> <span id="s1375">Had you known about the ghettos in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1377">I knew that because, see, we had for years and years every night we listened to the English .</span> <span id="s1378">We knew about it.</span> <span id="s1379">Oh, yes, we were totally aware of whatever the English people knew.</span> <span id="s1380">The BBC we knew.</span> <span id="s1381">Because night by night we heard that.</span> <span id="s1382">Yes, we were fully aware of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: These letters were not on regular pieces of paper, I gather.</span> <span id="s1384">These were on tissues of . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A: They're tissue!</span> <span id="s1386">Toilet tissue!</span> <span id="s1387">All kinds of things.</span> <span id="s1388">Whatever they could get on.</span> <span id="s1389">And they sent food, you know?</span> <span id="s1390">Send food.</span> <span id="s1391">I mean, of course, I was there in order to throw it out.</span> <span id="s1392">So what I didYes, of course, I put the tissue out.</span> <span id="s1393">But, see, they had also form letters.</span> <span id="s1394">They had the form letters.</span> <span id="s1395">And the form letters, they went through.</span> <span id="s1396">That was "Dear mother and father, I am doing well.</span> <span id="s1397">They give me a wonderful time, plenty enough to eat.</span> <span id="s1398">Don't you worry."</span> <span id="s1399">And then there I put in "send food".</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">Q: So you wrote it in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A: I wrote this.</span> <span id="s1402">I tried to get my handwriting . . . yes, I wrote that in.</span> <span id="s1403">That was the only way.</span> <span id="s1404">"Send food".</span> <span id="s1405">See, that was the risk I took.</span> <span id="s1406">It was a risk which I simply ignored.</span> <span id="s1407">My parents, my mother, who was very unhappy about it, said "Why do you do that, because you give them little evidence."</span> <span id="s1408">If that letter was found, of course, yes.</span> <span id="s1409">But there again I based it on the stupidity on the(laughter) again on the prison authorities.</span> <span id="s1410">Because, see, I was the final and the highest authority.</span> <span id="s1411">I was the final authority to send out these letters.</span> <span id="s1412">And so they, of course, were very afraid of me.</span> <span id="s1413">That's Nazi system.</span> <span id="s1414">To understand the Nazi system, you have to realize that the one is afraid of the other.</span> <span id="s1415">It's just a thing how far can you play it.</span> <span id="s1416">And the mere fact that I was a woman made the Gestapo think she must be of the highest order, otherwise she would never have gotten this job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: Now one day there were no more letters from the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: And you asked somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: And I thought where are my letters.</span> <span id="s1421">I asked, you know.</span> <span id="s1422">And there was this deep silence.</span> <span id="s1423">They had been sent away, you know?</span> <span id="s1424">Then, of course, it was up to me to find out where that is.</span> <span id="s1425">It's probably just the same in America, I would think.</span> <span id="s1426">The prison authorities had different prisoners.</span> <span id="s1427">One didn't know about the other.</span> <span id="s1428">So now I had to try to trace them.</span> <span id="s1429">And, you see, by that time, I had built up a system already.</span> <span id="s1430">My prisoners knew that I expected them to let me know.</span> <span id="s1431">They found some ways.</span> <span id="s1432">It was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1433">You have no idea what humans can find about when they are in a tough situation.</span> <span id="s1434">They always found somehow a way to let me know where they had come.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: You're not talking now talking about Jews in Poland.</span> <span id="s1436">You're now talking aboutyou didn't know . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">A: I talk now about my Scandinavian prisoners.</span> <span id="s1438">See, the Jewish people . . . you must understand they had nothing to do with the prison system.</span> <span id="s1439">They were merely . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Q: Those were your letters that you got.</span> <span id="s1441">They just stopped . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A: But my letters from the Jews, that stopped.</span> <span id="s1443">That I could do nothing anymore for them.</span> <span id="s1444">No.</span> <span id="s1445">That was over.</span> <span id="s1446">You see, now I had only the Scandinavians where I could follow through to the other system.</span> <span id="s1447">It's very hard, I think, to understand for anybody here.</span> <span id="s1448">We had two systems.</span> <span id="s1449">The one was the prison system that was still the old order.</span> <span id="s1450">Very strict and very awful and very mean.</span> <span id="s1451">But the Gestapo system was simplyI mean, I hated it.</span> <span id="s1452">Once the order was given that the Jewish peopleand I hate it.</span> <span id="s1453">I could nothing do.</span> <span id="s1454">However, I saved one Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1455">I thought whatever, that means one.</span> <span id="s1456">That one means better than nobody.</span> <span id="s1457">Because we had, in my prison, in one of my prisons somewhere in Germany, we had one Jewish person who by error, by simply error, had landed in a prison instead of the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1458">See, now, that was my favorite child.</span> <span id="s1459">I always called him my favorite son because I had to have a special eye on him that they didn't find out that he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1460">And all through the years, you know, I had a special eye on him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: So he was one of your Scandinavian boys?</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: He was one of my, yeah . . . (laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Q: There were no girls in this Scandinavian prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">A: There were many men.</span> <span id="s1465">Most of them I had men.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">Q: Most, but you did have some women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A: I had also some women, yes.</span> <span id="s1468">But, most were men.</span> <span id="s1469">You know, it's a usual thing.</span> <span id="s1470">When Hitler came to or raided a country, he first took the elite of the country.</span> <span id="s1471">I really had the elite of the country.</span> <span id="s1472">He simply in one life they were all put to the next prison or jail or wherever.</span> <span id="s1473">So, they came to the German prisons.</span> <span id="s1474">It was really the elite of the country.</span> <span id="s1475">From the universities, from the government.</span> <span id="s1476">Fine, most wonderful people.</span> <span id="s1477">The minute they came, there again came the system bureaucracy.</span> <span id="s1478">They needed somebody who spoke there who was perfect in the language who had all these academic examinations.</span> <span id="s1479">Because there were many people who talked Norwegian or Danish.</span> <span id="s1480">But it has to be academic degree.</span> <span id="s1481">And, thank heaven, before I had my medicine degree, I studied Scandinavian languages.</span> <span id="s1482">I had my full academic career in it.</span> <span id="s1483">That was which got me this position.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Q: You worked with Mr. Jenkins.</span> <span id="s1485">But there was also a daughter, Anna Jenkins, who you met later on and then realized there was a much wider connection in helping you than you knew.</span> <span id="s1486">Can you talk about that a little?</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">A: Well, Mr. Jenkins was really the hero of my life, I can only say, you know?</span> <span id="s1488">I never saw him afterwards again, because he died too.</span> <span id="s1489">He was killed finally.</span> <span id="s1490">But, he sent me his daughter.</span> <span id="s1491">This daughter helped me very much in organizing and finding.</span> <span id="s1492">You see, the problem was these people are really dying.</span> <span id="s1493">This was a question of life and death.</span> <span id="s1494">It was not only a question of encouraging them.</span> <span id="s1495">They needed some medicine.</span> <span id="s1496">I needed vitamins.</span> <span id="s1497">I needed all these things.</span> <span id="s1498">Where could I get it in Hamburg, which was bombed out?</span> <span id="s1499">So I built it up little by littleconnections like Anna.</span> <span id="s1500">Like these people who could get them from other countries who came.</span> <span id="s1501">Who could get them by their connections.</span> <span id="s1502">So I had a whole network of people who helped me in this, that I could do this.</span> <span id="s1503">And, you see, the important thing was that we knew very little of each other.</span> <span id="s1504">Because whenever anybody was caught, were tortured by the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1505">I have seen how people got tortured.</span> <span id="s1506">Nobody would hold up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">Q: Where did you see that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: Oh, I saw that in the Gestapo quarters, for instance.</span> <span id="s1509">I saw these things.</span> <span id="s1510">I mean, these were also known things, but I saw them.</span> <span id="s1511">I saw the people afterwardshow they looked.</span> <span id="s1512">They have told me about it.</span> <span id="s1513">And I saw what they did.</span> <span id="s1514">I mean, it was inhuman.</span> <span id="s1515">That was the terrible fear, of course, of the people who were close to me.</span> <span id="s1516">My God, would you ever be able to hold up afterwards when and if you're caught?</span> <span id="s1517">And, see, there was a thing that I admitted.</span> <span id="s1518">That was a danger point.</span> <span id="s1519">Under torture, nobody is holding up.</span> <span id="s1520">Don't ever think . . . there is no hero who can hold up under torture.</span> <span id="s1521">And, so, there I had always a poison with me.</span> <span id="s1522">Always I had a medication with me which I would have taken and would have made it end.</span> <span id="s1523">But, of course, my mother always said "Please, don't do it too fast."</span> <span id="s1524">You have to find the proper moment to do it."</span> <span id="s1525">I was very fortunate.</span> <span id="s1526">I never came to that moment where I felt I had to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">Q: Where did get the poison from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">A: I can't remember.</span> <span id="s1529">I think from this captain.</span> <span id="s1530">You see, poison was easier to get because, as you may know, many of Jewish people, lots of our Jewish friends, simply poisoned themselves.</span> <span id="s1531">It came in a little capsule.</span> <span id="s1532">Stric (ph), stric (ph)how do you call it?</span> <span id="s1533">I don't know what you call it.</span> <span id="s1534">Something which would kill you instantly.</span> <span id="s1535">Many of these Jewish people did do it this way.</span> <span id="s1536">And, so, I had that.</span> <span id="s1537">It was good for me.</span> <span id="s1538">It gave me a sense of liberty.</span> <span id="s1539">That if it comes to the worse, I can do this.</span> <span id="s1540">And my parents knew about this.</span> <span id="s1541">I was totally open to them.</span> <span id="s1542">They totally agreed.</span> <span id="s1543">Becasue to submit to torturethat's also one of the wrong ideas in America.</span> <span id="s1544">They say, "Oh, some people got tortured and they hold up."</span> <span id="s1545">No.</span> <span id="s1546">Under torture, nobody holds up.</span> <span id="s1547">If you ever come to that, it's lost.</span> <span id="s1548">And so I felt I knew too much.</span> <span id="s1549">I had no other way out.</span> <span id="s1550">I would have to do it.</span> <span id="s1551">So whenever, and it was not often, I think twice, I came under these intensive feelings from the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1552">There was intensivethat hours and hours and hours.</span> <span id="s1553">It's simply a thing to wear you down.</span> <span id="s1554">You won't believe it.</span> <span id="s1555">I had a great sense of freedom.</span> <span id="s1556">Because I had it right in my pocket.</span> <span id="s1557">It was just one movement.</span> <span id="s1558">Before that, jump at me and I would have been dead.</span> <span id="s1559">It was stric (ph).</span> <span id="s1560">I don't know how you call it.</span> <span id="s1561">But something which you can end it immediately.</span> <span id="s1562">And, no, it did not make me unhappy.</span> <span id="s1563">It gave me a sense of I was in control.</span> <span id="s1564">This is very hard for you to understand nowadays.</span> <span id="s1565">And now I'm an old woman.</span> <span id="s1566">You might ask me would I do it again.</span> <span id="s1567">Yes and yes and again, yes.</span> <span id="s1568">I would do it again.</span> <span id="s1569">I'm very grateful that I could get away from it from all these memories.</span> <span id="s1570">Have I
