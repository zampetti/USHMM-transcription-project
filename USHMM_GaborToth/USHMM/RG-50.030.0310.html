Mosse.</span> <span id="s13">I was born in Berlin, in 1918.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: What month, and day?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: In September.</span> <span id="s16">20th of September, 1918.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: 20th of September.</span> <span id="s18">Can you tell me what the “L” stands for?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: Yeah, Lachmann, it’s a double name.</span> <span id="s20">Lachmann is my father’s name, Mosse is my mother’s name.</span> <span id="s21">And -- and my father married into the business, it was quite common.</span> <span id="s22">That is to say my grandfather Mosse founded the newspaper, business of newspaper advertising, and my father married into it, and then took my mother’s name.</span> <span id="s23">So it’s Lachmann Mosse, really.</span> <span id="s24">But when I came to America, I abbreviated the Lachmann to an L, and took Mosse, ‘cause I thought that was more comprehensible.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Can you tell us something about your -- your family -- the history of your family?</span> <span id="s26">Can you characterize what your family was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Don’t quite know how to characterize it.</span> <span id="s28">It’s a very typical German Jewish story.</span> <span id="s29">They came, with some exceptions, from the east, from -- from the region between Poland and Germany.</span> <span id="s30">And on both sides, the Lachmann and the Mosse side, the -- towards 1860, the sons emigrated to Berlin.</span> <span id="s31">It was common, too, Berlin was becoming the center, yes?</span> <span id="s32">And there they founded a business, I mean a business [indecipherable] my grandfather on the Lachmann side, to start with that first.</span> <span id="s33">My grandfather Lachmann side was a very notable grain dealer, yes, who played some role in German history, in fact, because in the Franco-Prussian war, the army -- nobody knew where the French army was that you wanted to fight, and as a grain dealer, he became sort of the, how would you say, the intelligence man for Bismarck, and the German army, yes?</span> <span id="s34">And he was offered nobility, which was very rare for a Jew.</span> <span id="s35">But he refused it.</span> <span id="s36">Like my other grandfather refused it too.</span> <span id="s37">These people were good liberals, the aristocracy was not -- was not something they desired.</span> <span id="s38">So, and then the grandfathers were the great thing, and then my father was his grandson, of this Salomon Lachmann, who was the notable grain dealer, and so on, yes.</span> <span id="s39">And on the other side, as of course become more famous through the years, because my grandfather Mosse, who came from a small village in Posen, called Greiz, came to Berlin, and went into the -- went into the advertising, so to speak, yes, what was then 1850’s.</span> <span id="s40">And in the 1860’s he had the idea of having an advertising agency where you could advertise not just for one paper, but for all papers.</span> <span id="s41">That was quite new something then, yes.</span> <span id="s42">And that’s what was the basis of what came after, for what came after was in 1867, the founding of the Berliner Tageblatt which -- and then other newspapers publishing the address book for Germany, yes, and the matters of this nature.</span> <span id="s43">And this publishing empire, you could really call it, he found it on the business of the advertising.</span> <span id="s44">that was the basis.</span> <span id="s45">And he had no children, only my mother.</span> <span id="s46">So my father married into the business, and when my grandfather died in 1920, he became the head of this business.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: What was your chi -- excuse me, what was your childhood like?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Well, I grew up in a luxury that I suppose seemed normal to me then, but today seems to me entirely un-normal, yes?</span> <span id="s49">We had a house in L, and an estate in …-- about 45 minutes from Berlin, yes.</span> <span id="s50">And other estates, but that’s the important one: 45 minutes from Berlin.</span> <span id="s51">And I spent my time between these two, Berlin and the estate, yes, until I went to boarding school.</span> <span id="s52">And in these -- in the -- in the house in Berlin and in the estates, of course, there were servants, usually a couple, butler and cook, you know, kitchen maid.</span> <span id="s53">My father once in our Berlin house, met a girl on the stairs and said, “What are you doing here?”</span> <span id="s54">She said, “I am the kitchen maid.”</span> <span id="s55">Of course, he didn’t know who these people were.</span> <span id="s56">And -- you know, and other kinds of maids, yes.</span> <span id="s57">And then, of course, as children, we [indecipherable] had governesses.</span> <span id="s58">First we had a nursemaid, and then we had governesses, and the governess were chosen by language.</span> <span id="s59">My first governesses were all French, French ladies.</span> <span id="s60">They didn’t last long with me, ‘cause I was very naughty.</span> <span id="s61">But they were French ladies, and then came an English lady.</span> <span id="s62">So I learned French first, and English then.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: You were naughty, what does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Well, I don’t know, I -- I suppose I made her life very unpleasant.</span> <span id="s65">They were all French ladies of a conservative cast.</span> <span id="s66">Until I was fairly old I thought French was -- France was giv -- governed by kings, because of these ladies I had, yes.</span> <span id="s67">So yes, it was a luxury.</span> <span id="s68">I had my own car and driver.</span> <span id="s69">Then eventually in our estate, I had my own little car which -- which I drove around the park.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: You had a brother and a sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Yes, indeed.</span> <span id="s72">They’re older than I was, much older.</span> <span id="s73">Seven years -- five and seven years older.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: So Hilda is se -- is fi --</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Was the oldest.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: She was the oldest?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Yeah, my sister was the oldest, seven years older.</span> <span id="s78">My brother was about six years older.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Were you close?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Well, the age difference is too big.</span> <span id="s81">My brother died very early, in 1958.</span> <span id="s82">But with my sister I was -- I was close, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: What about your relationship with your -- with your parents, since you were in some way raised by them?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Well, we really didn’t have much relationship with our parents.</span> <span id="s85">My parents were in public life in Berlin, through what they occupied, yes.</span> <span id="s86">So they were always going, or -- going out, or other things, yes.</span> <span id="s87">One’s immediate relationships were with one’s governess.</span> <span id="s88">And then when I was 10, I was sent to boarding school, and from then on I was in boarding school from the age of 10, to the age of 18.</span> <span id="s89">18 - 19, yes.</span> <span id="s90">So you didn’t have close relations with your parents; no, not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: What was school like for you before you went off to boarding school, where did you go --</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: I have very dim memories of that, of pre-school, as we would say.</span> <span id="s93">Very dim.</span> <span id="s94">Frau Wunderlich was the name of it, and I’ve -- I’ve hardly any memories of it, I can’t quite tell you why.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Do you have memories of being in your house during that period, even without [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Oh yes, I have memories of being in the house, yes, but not of this school.</span> <span id="s97">I mean, that’s where I learned to read and write after all, but I have umf -- I don’t know, it’s just blotted out.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: When you went to school --</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: -- when you were sent away to boarding school --</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: -- how old were you, 10?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: And where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: That was a very famous German school, one of the most famous boarding schools in Germany.</span> <span id="s106">My father had a -- a friend, a friend -- or friend is said too much, a companion, when he grew up in his high school gymnasium, yes, called Kurt Hahn.</span> <span id="s107">And Kurt Hahn is a fascinating character in his own right.</span> <span id="s108">Kurt Hahn was -- became secretary to the Prince of Baden, who became chancellor -- interim chancellor.</span> <span id="s109">And after the first World War, in the castle of the prince, he founded a boarding school, on the English model, on the English model, which became a boarding school si -- it’s difficult to say.</span> <span id="s110">It became a boarding school -- it’s -- I mean, it’s not difficult to say, it’s just I have to find the right words.</span> <span id="s111">It became a boarding school for the aristocracy, yes.</span> <span id="s112">For example, the Duke of Edinburgh went there, yeah.</span> <span id="s113">The queen of Greece.</span> <span id="s114">I used to dunk her pigtails into ink.</span> <span id="s115">I mean, the late queen of Greece, yes.</span> <span id="s116">Didn’t like her very much as a child.</span> <span id="s117">And all sorts of yes, royalty, and rich families, but also poor.</span> <span id="s118">But it’s typical of the atmosphere of the school that the free places, or scholarship places were reserved for sons and daughters of generals of the first World War, yeah.</span> <span id="s119">Or people, officers who’d fallen in the first World War, something like that, yes.</span> <span id="s120">I think that was very typical, though the plus of the school was that it was one of a very few, I think the only German boarding school that was co-educational.</span> <span id="s121">And that was not on the English model, and that was a great plus, yes.</span> <span id="s122">But otherwise, it’s very strict discipline, as you can well imagine, yes.</span> <span id="s123">And I don’t think the teaching was very good, I don’t think you learned a lot, but your character was built.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Did you like school?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Yes, I liked school, because I’m a bully by nature, and did very well.</span> <span id="s126">‘Cause in these boarding schools, if you’re not a bully by nature, you don’t do very well.</span> <span id="s127">I did very well indeed in the two boarding schools I went to, ‘cause eventually I went to an English boarding school, of course, when Hitler came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Explain to me what you mean by if you’re not a bully you don’t do very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: If you’re not a bully you don’t do very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: What does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Well, if your s -- boys together in a boarding school, yes, I mean, there’s a lot of bullying, you know, after all, yes?</span> <span id="s132">And it’s children among themselves, especially young teenagers can be very brutal.</span> <span id="s133">But all this was controlled by a discipline which I now think, looking back on it, was really excellent and doesn’t exist in this country at all.</span> <span id="s134">For example, from -- from the age of 10 on, yes -- I left it when I was 15, but it existed ‘til the age of 18, you got something called -- if you were especially good -- this was a privilege, you got a training plan, which was a plan on which there was written, have you brushed your teeth, have you done your run in the morning, have you had your cold shower, yes?</span> <span id="s135">You know?</span> <span id="s136">Have you cheated today, and so on.</span> <span id="s137">And you put a plus and minus whether you did it or not.</span> <span id="s138">And nobody cheated.</span> <span id="s139">Was a privilege, nobody cheated.</span> <span id="s140">And that -- that, I think, makes up for all the deficiencies of the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Why do you think that was so, that nobody cheated?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: It was just in the atmosphere, it was a privilege, it wouldn’t have occurred to anybody to cheat.</span> <span id="s143">It was not done.</span> <span id="s144">The best way of putting it: it was simply not done.</span> <span id="s145">And that sort of training is totally absent in American education, unfortunately.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: George, growing up in -- in such a household, with parents who are, in a real sense, public figures, what does that mean about who you meet, who comes into the house, what was --</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: Well, you met interesting people.</span> <span id="s148">Of course I was much too young to notice interesting people, yes?</span> <span id="s149">I mean, for example, one day Litvinov, the -- the -- the Russian, first foreign minister, the Bolsheviks, came -- came to the house, a party or something, and I was allowed to go into the drawing room downstairs, which as a rule I was not, of course, yes?</span> <span id="s150">And he had on a what you call it, formal dress, yes?</span> <span id="s151">And I stood in front of him, I’m told, and pointed at him, to the great embarrassment of everybody, and said, “A Bolshevik?</span> <span id="s152">How come he’s dressed that way?”</span> <span id="s153">Yes, mostly cause my father, who was not very apt at business, but who had great cultural interests, above all music, mostly musicians came into our house.</span> <span id="s154">Every Christmas -- you see, part of the daily rhythm was vacations in those days, and the vacations were normed.</span> <span id="s155">In other words, every winter we went skiing, regardless, every winter.</span> <span id="s156">Usually to Saint Moritz, yes, and later on to Arosa, but every winter we went skiing, and every summer we had a house in the Alps.</span> <span id="s157">So, this was the rhythm.</span> <span id="s158">But the Christmases, for example, we always spent with a -- the most famous German conductor, I suppose, almost, of the century, called Fuertwangler.</span> <span id="s159">With the Fuertwanglers we spent the Christmas.</span> <span id="s160">He didn’t behave very well after 1933, that’s another story.</span> <span id="s161">But we spent Christmas at Fuertwanglers.</span> <span id="s162">And there were always people from the musical world, and sometimes from the theater world, who came to the house, but I was too young, I wasn’t allowed to be present, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Did they also, the musi -- the musicians come and play concerts and --</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Yes, because in our Berlin house there was a concert hall built on, yes.</span> <span id="s165">Big room where they played.</span> <span id="s166">Rubinstein played, and so that I was allowed to go and hear.</span> <span id="s167">Rubinstein played and all sorts of people played, because my father was a Hubermann above all, my father gave the first violin to Hubermann.</span> <span id="s168">So, Hubermann played and so on, yes, yes, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s169">Very, very musical household, but there were also other things.</span> <span id="s170">My grandmother founded, for example, what we would call in Berlin, homes for wayward girls, yes.</span> <span id="s171">And this became a society [indecipherable] society women.</span> <span id="s172">Every woman adopted one of these homes for wayward girls.</span> <span id="s173">And my mother was the president of it.</span> <span id="s174">So they met, of course, in the house, these society women, and the home for wayward girls.</span> <span id="s175">I don’t know what they mean by wayward girls, to this day I can’t tell you.</span> <span id="s176">But that’s what it was, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Was this typical, this philanthropic [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Oh yes, yes, yes, very much, yes, yes, yes, every -- everybody had his philanthropy in these very wealthy houses -- homes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: What was that about?</span> <span id="s180">I mean, it was -- was -- why was it so typical, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Well, that was just a thing you did, I mean, you -- you -- you -- especially if you were Jewish, it’s part of assimilation for the Jews, yes, to be part -- for example, my grandfather founded a -- an orphanage, big Berlin orphanage, still stands, a Berlin orphanage, you know, for Jewish and Christian children, you did that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s182">That was part of being integrated into the society, if you like, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: In -- in what sense was your family Jewish?</span> <span id="s184">Was there any religious association?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Oh yes, both my grandfather and father were very involved with the Jewish reform.</span> <span id="s186">Now Jewish reform in Germany was a complete reform, much more than anything you know about today, yes.</span> <span id="s187">And they were very involved with it indeed, yes.</span> <span id="s188">Both, my grandfather Mosse, and my father.</span> <span id="s189">And they did in our estate always, the synagogue youth clubs and things came out, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: So were you involved in that also?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: No, no, I was in boarding school, no.</span> <span id="s192">No, no, uh-uh.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Did you one day a --</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: I was -- I was kicked out of the -- of what we called Sunday school, cause it met on Sunday, cause I was so naughty.</span> <span id="s195">Yes, an effort was made to send me to religious school, and it didn’t last long.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Did you once express to your father an interest in becoming a rabbi?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s198">I don’t really know why.</span> <span id="s199">I did express that interest, and -- I don’t know what got into me.</span> <span id="s200">But anyway, my father had a very good cure, he thought, and he was right.</span> <span id="s201">He put me into a car, into our car, and a -- said to the chauffeur to drive to the Scheunenviertel, that’s the Jewish quarter of Berlin, yes.</span> <span id="s202">And there he took me and said -- and showed me these pious Jews, you know, with the peyes, and dark, you know.</span> <span id="s203">And said, “Do you want to be like them?”</span> <span id="s204">And I said, “Of course not.”</span> <span id="s205">So that was that.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: George, what do you experience as a young child growing up?</span> <span id="s207">When do you remember the national socialists political upheaval?</span> <span id="s208">Do you -- anti-Semitism --</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Well there’s one thing that must be said, I think, straight away.</span> <span id="s210">Growing up after the war, with the lost war, revolution, counter revolution and so on, yes.</span> <span id="s211">My generation isn’t like other generations, especially today.</span> <span id="s212">We were always politicized.</span> <span id="s213">My first memories are political memories.</span> <span id="s214">The first thing I remember from childhood are political memories.</span> <span id="s215">For example, my mother taking me to a soup kitchen for the unemployed, which she ran, yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s216">For example, leaning out of the window one day and there were no lights on in the square, what’s happened?</span> <span id="s217">President Ebert died, the president of the republic.</span> <span id="s218">These kind of memories, yes, political memories.</span> <span id="s219">I think they became less as I grew older for awhile, but I was very much politicized.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: In the late 20’s, when you start boarding school – ‘cause it would be ’28 when you were 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Are you feeling any of the political movements at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: No, no, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: When did -- when do you -- does that begin to affect you?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s226">I think a little later, a few years later, when I was in Berlin, where I was at the boarding school, where we knew that some of our teachers were seen in a neighboring town, Uberlingen in Nazi uniform.</span> <span id="s227">They didn’t dare carry it in the school, but in the neighboring town.</span> <span id="s228">Of course, the gymnastics teacher, you know, in uniform.</span> <span id="s229">We knew that, yes.</span> <span id="s230">And swastikas were burned on the hills around the school, that I remember, too, yes.</span> <span id="s231">And indeed, things were already so relatively tight, that when you went to take the train to school, it was quite -- it was a long train ride, seven -- six, seven hours, something like, yeah, you were given something that the Jewish defense organization put up -- put -- put out, called the Anti-Anti, that is the name.</span> <span id="s232">And it was a kind of folder, yes, where you looked through.</span> <span id="s233">And if somebody said to you, the Jews are bad, you looked through, and you said, “But there’s Einstein.”</span> <span id="s234">Things like that.</span> <span id="s235">It’s a wonderful document because it shows how the Jews tried to combat anti-Semitism rationally, yes, ‘cause this folder was divided into parts, yes.</span> <span id="s236">I mean, Jewish inventors, Jewish generals, well there wasn’t much there.</span> <span id="s237">You know, Jewish so and so.</span> <span id="s238">And then you just had to look it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Did you carry one of these?</span> <span id="s240">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s241">I still have it.</span> <span id="s242">It’s quite precious now.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: What did you think of it, when you were young, carrying this around, I mean, does it make sense to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: No, I thought it was good, because I was the historian, I didn’t know how stupid it is to counter irrationality with rationality.</span> <span id="s245">I wasn’t brought up in a household where irrationality was prized.</span> <span id="s246">So I thought it was perfectly all right.</span> <span id="s247">I never had a chance to use it, though.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Did this ever frighten you?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: No, I don’t remember being really frightened by it a great deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Do you remember your first experience with anti-Semitism, with --</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s252">No.</span> <span id="s253">You see, there was other anti-Semitism in school, but never directed against me, because I was good at sports, and that of course, kosherizes you in boarding school.</span> <span id="s254">And I became a prefect, so I could tyrannize the other kids, and they couldn’t tyrannize me.</span> <span id="s255">So that was a good -- a good thing, yes.</span> <span id="s256">So, no, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s257">It was never directed against me.</span> <span id="s258">For some reason I can just tell you how I saw it, or I experienced it.</span> <span id="s259">I never really experienced anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s260">Sometimes in our vacations in France later on, in the 30’s, I experienced it in France, but not in my youth, I mean, in those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Were you having political conversations with your friends in boarding school about what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Oh no, I don’t remember any.</span> <span id="s263">I’m sure I did, but I just don’t remember it.</span> <span id="s264">There were other things to talk about, I mean, you know, it’s not something that’s necessarily foremost -- or I said the memories are politicized.</span> <span id="s265">Yes, we must have had political con -- well, I don’t remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Do you have any particular close friends that you had during that time who are -- were important to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: None who remained important to me, none.</span> <span id="s268">Well, the war intervened, and it must not be forgotten that Hitler put aristocrats in the first row of soldiers in Poland.</span> <span id="s269">So an awful lot of my friends in Salem were killed in ’39, immediately, ‘cause they were aristocrats.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Your family, you, your t -- your brother, sister, mother and father left Germany in January of ’33.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: How come so -- so quickly --</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Well, because we were exposed politically.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Can you explain that?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: It isn’t only a Jewish thing.</span> <span id="s276">Well, because the newspapers were liberal newspapers, which never compromised, they really didn’t, never compromised with the Nazis or anything like that.</span> <span id="s277">And so -- so obviously we were one of the main targets of Hitler -- of Hitler’s ire, I mean, he mentioned us quite often, so -- and there were demonstrations in front of our house and so on.</span> <span id="s278">My mother left straight away after the first demonstration in front of our house, I think.</span> <span id="s279">My father and my brother and sister a little later, and I latest of all.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Was you mother beaten at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: No.</span> <span id="s283">Was any member of your f-family --</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: -- picked up, hurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Where did your mother go when she --</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Oh, wa -- don’t we -- German Jews looked to France, and especially my family.</span> <span id="s291">For example, my father was the first -- after the first World War, took a lot of courage to invite a French singer [indecipherable] Guilbert to sing in Paris in our concert thing, you see.</span> <span id="s292">That took a great deal of courage.</span> <span id="s293">And we were very linked to France.</span> <span id="s294">Indeed, in the end, the French ambassador made it in Germany, François Poncet, made it possible for my grandmother to come out.</span> <span id="s295">So, they were -- oh, everybody went to France, except me.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Why were you last?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Well, at -- first of all I was last because I was bad, generally, and I had to do -- what do you call it, after school, what do you call it if you have to stay after school, yeah?</span> <span id="s298">I had to stay after school, and my parents and everybody was out.</span> <span id="s299">And Hitler made a decree that I think -- I -- I always get that wrong, but let’s say towards the first of February or something, you -- not the first of February, the 12th of February, you had to have a permit to leave Germany, yes.</span> <span id="s300">That was unprecedented, that never been before, yes.</span> <span id="s301">And I wouldn’t have gotten it, because the Nazis would have taken me hostage for the family, and the newspapers, and everything, yes.</span> <span id="s302">So my parents pleaded, but the headmistress of my pre-school -- I was, of course, in pre-school--who was a real Protestant type, a Vermont Protestant type, but a real Prussian Protestant type, said no, that I must stay till I have finished my duty after school, you see.</span> <span id="s303">So, the result of that is -- no, I mean she was a wonderful woman, she got into – Fraeulein Koeppen was her name, she got into prison eventually because she refused to teach “Mein Kampf”, but she refused to teach “Mein Kampf” in German class, because it was bad German, not because we -- you know, it was bad German.</span> <span id="s304">It is bad German, yeah, so she was a real -- as you call it, a real -- you know, a real type, as it were.</span> <span id="s305">So I was late, and the way to leave was via the ferry across Lake Constance, ‘cause that’s near where the school was.</span> <span id="s306">So I came to the ferry, and that was the last ferry before this so-called “sichtvermerk,” this permit -- the exit permit, yeah.</span> <span id="s307">And there were nothing but Brown Shirts on either side, yes.</span> <span id="s308">And when you had to run through them, as it were, yes.</span> <span id="s309">And -- and it was my luck that just before Hitler had mentioned us, in some way.</span> <span id="s310">Mosse, Jew press, you know, and so on.</span> <span id="s311">So I came there, and I said, well, I’m done for, because all they did is hel -- hold me back five minutes and the ferry would be gone and they had me.</span> <span id="s312">And indeed, when I showed my passport, they looked at each other and passed it from one SA man to another.</span> <span id="s313">They didn’t stop me.</span> <span id="s314">That’s Germany.</span> <span id="s315">It was five minute to 12, not 12.</span> <span id="s316">So that’s why I’m here today, yes.</span> <span id="s317">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: George, talk a little bit about being liberal Jews, and the importance of that in that -- in that context.</span> <span id="s319">Because often people talk about anti-Semitism, but not about the political --</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Well, the political orientation of most Jews, German Jews, most Jews in Europe, was a liberal orientation, because they were emancipated in the enlightenment.</span> <span id="s321">That had given them the chance of emancipation, to become part of the community as it were.</span> <span id="s322">And this chance they used, and what remained of it was a belief, let us say in -- in -- in processes, not in finished thing -- in other words, in Germany -- there’s one other factor perhaps I should explain.</span> <span id="s323">There is the word “Bildung”, which means -- it’s a German word, essentially European word, which means cultivate your character, cultivate yourself.</span> <span id="s324">And the assimilation of Jews was facilitated by the idea that everybody could cultivate his own nature, his own character, yes.</span> <span id="s325">Didn’t matter were you Jews and Christians, because this was a process.</span> <span id="s326">This was not a finished product, like nation or anything else: this was a process.</span> <span id="s327">Now, this fitted the whole Jewish situation obviously, because that was their way to integration, yes?</span> <span id="s328">So that you will find, for example in Germany, yeah, that the Jews supported the small liberal party, which was tiny by 1933, yes, our newspapers, the other Jewish owned newspapers, yes.</span> <span id="s329">Which meant most of the serious press supported the tiny liberal party, when it obviously had no chance.</span> <span id="s330">And of course, as in a way the fate of the Jews depended not only on tolerance, but also on freedom, economic freedom, and so on, yes.</span> <span id="s331">They didn’t see -- my father, for example, not at all-- what was obvious, that by the 1920’s, the social democrats were the great champions of the Jews in Germany, yes.</span> <span id="s332">But they didn’t see it, they still saw the social democratic Marxist rhetoric as an enemy, yes.</span> <span id="s333">So I remember when my sister first voted social democratic.</span> <span id="s334">That was terrible row in the house, terrible row.</span> <span id="s335">And my mother immediately began with the toothbrush, “do you want to share your toothbrush?</span> <span id="s336">That was her reaction to everything on socialist, you see.</span> <span id="s337">It was terrible, though.</span> <span id="s338">Illegitimate children were also mentioned, and God knows why.</span> <span id="s339">I mean, today it seems ridiculous, but that’s how social democrats were perceived, though they were the real champions of the Jews, not the liberals, not the political liberals in Germany, that -- you know.</span> <span id="s340">But they will remain liberals to the very end, that is the German Jewish tradition, and it’s a very fine tradition.</span> <span id="s341">In a way you can put it this way, that it were the German Jews who carried the liberal tradition from 1933 through to 1945.</span> <span id="s342">Who transmitted it.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Was you sister unusual?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: What do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: In terms of the kind of support that she was giving?</span> <span id="s346">That she was a social democrat within the context of --</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Well, she was more left than social democrat in the end, oh yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s348">Was she unusual?</span> <span id="s349">No, many of the children of these very rich Jews became socialists, of course, yes.</span> <span id="s350">Some became communists, it’s well known, yes.</span> <span id="s351">No, she worked up in the north of Berlin, in the Wedding, the working class part, with children at that time in her life.</span> <span id="s352">And told my father, for example, that working class children already came to -- came to the meetings with little Nazi daggers in their belt, my father should take Hitler seriously.</span> <span id="s353">My father thought till the last that Hitler belonged in the comic papers -- pages of the newspaper, yes.</span> <span id="s354">After all, that’s what Hitler, you know, helped him so much that everybody undervalued him.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: You went to a Hitler ra -- rally, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: I once went from home, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: What -- what year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: I think it was a bet with my sister.</span> <span id="s359">What?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: It was a bet with your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: What does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: She said I wouldn’t, I said I would, too.</span> <span id="s364">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: So when -- when did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: That must have been 1931 or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: What was your impression?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Oh, it was marvelous, I mean [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s369">You were carried away, of course.</span> <span id="s370">The -- his charisma, which you can’t experience in film, you had to experience it in person, his charisma and the movements of the crowd were heady, I mean, you were carried away.</span> <span id="s371">I mean, there must have been thousands of people, and they all did the same thing, and they all spoke the same thing.</span> <span id="s372">It didn’t matter what he said, that doesn’t matter in this kind of political liturgy that much.</span> <span id="s373">So you were carried away.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: So did you go home and tell your sister about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Yes, certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Talk about it?</span> <span id="s377">What was --</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Oh, she says, that’s typical of you, or something.</span> <span id="s379">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Did you have any worry about this guy?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: So you leave Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Yes, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Do you go to France, or do you go to Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: No, I go to -- well, first I go to Switzerland, cause you see, what happened after ’33, the advertising agencies of ours, which were outside Germany, they went with the family, yes, not with the German, but with the family.</span> <span id="s386">And the biggest of those was in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s387">Indeed, if you go to Zurich, have -- I don’t know if you’ve been to Zurich, but in the Limmatquais the chief you know, where the canal is, there is one house that to this day has Mosse house on it.</span> <span id="s388">That was the headquarters of our Swiss business, which was very large.</span> <span id="s389">So first we went on to Switzerland, for one year I went to a Swiss boarding school.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: And everybody’s together?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: No, no, nobody’s together, because my brother immediately went to study in Zurich, my sister went to study medicine and so on in Basel, you know, and I stayed one year in a boarding school near Zurich.</span> <span id="s392">My parents were already divor -- separated, my father was in Paris, my mother immediately went to Juan-les-Pins, the Riviera.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: So what it -- was that like, was that -- life didn’t change very much in some way for you, or was this [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: No, life’s changed in every way.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Can you describe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: I mean, it was -- it was hard.</span> <span id="s397">The Swiss boarding school wasn’t particularly good, I have very few memories of it.</span> <span id="s398">But then I went to English boarding school, and that was hard, because you had to adjust, you had a language, nobody there knew German, it wasn’t really in the cards.</span> <span id="s399">You had to adjust and so on, yes.</span> <span id="s400">But it was a very good boarding school, the Quaker boarding school, run by the Society of Friends.</span> <span id="s401">A good boarding school, and -- and I -- I made it all right, yes.</span> <span id="s402">But everything wa -- became a hassle, because in the first list of si -- of people who lost their citizenship, we were in that first list, including me, all of 15.</span> <span id="s403">So having no citizenship in the modern world was a terrible fate.</span> <span id="s404">So everything became a problem.</span> <span id="s405">Everything, yes.</span> <span id="s406">First, when you visited your mother in yo -- parent, father, in France, you had to have permit de sejour.</span> <span id="s407">Was dreadful and humiliating.</span> <span id="s408">These women there, and these -- these official things in France are unbelievable, unbelievable, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: What did they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: I mean, they’re -- they’re just -- just a bureaucracy that you can’t imagine.</span> <span id="s411">And very nasty, because we were mere immigrants, and nothing, nothing, yeah.</span> <span id="s412">So that wasn’t a big change, yes.</span> <span id="s413">You had to do that everywhere.</span> <span id="s414">For example, whenever I went to Switzerland to see my sister or brother, I had to -- my father, I -- my father had to deposit a very large sum, to be sure I went out again.</span> <span id="s415">Do you know?</span> <span id="s416">The Swiss were the worst, that’s not generally realized.</span> <span id="s417">The “J” for Jew in your passport, that was a Swiss, not a Nazi idea at all.</span> <span id="s418">It was a Swiss idea, so they could keep Jews out, yeah.</span> <span id="s419">That isn’t enough -- emphasized enough, yes.</span> <span id="s420">So I didn’t -- so then we all got different passports, of course.</span> <span id="s421">My sister, because it was very -- she knew how to do things, went -- there was one consul in Naples, Reitling was his name, who gave Jews passports without a ‘J”.</span> <span id="s422">And she got one.</span> <span id="s423">And th -- almost the same thing happened to me, I went in London to get a new passport without a “J”, you know, and the consular official talked to me and shoved me over surreptitiously, a passport without a “J”.</span> <span id="s424">You see, there were decent people around, yes.</span> <span id="s425">So for awhile I had a passport, then my brother became a Turk for awhile because we had very good Turkish connections, yes.</span> <span id="s426">And then this German passport expired in a very short time, and my father got the Prime Minister of Luxemburg to forge his own passport, which I still have, for me, yes, without expiry date, so I traveled for about three years on a Luxemburgian passport, which was embarrassing when I met somebody from Luxemburg because I’d never been there, of course, in my life.</span> <span id="s427">And today I keep it in case the Americans are cheeky, I say, me, a Luxemburgian, you know.</span> <span id="s428">And what I learned from that is you can never have enough passports, believe me, you can never have enough passports.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: So tell me more about what it’s -- what it’s like during this time, you’re traveling around the -- this is before 1939, between ’33, and ’34, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: In ’39, when I was first in Bootham, in this school in York, and then every vacation -- don’t forget you’re six months in, six months out usually in England in those days.</span> <span id="s431">So during the long vacations I went first to my father and stepmother in Paris and then to my mother in Juan-les-Pins usually, yes.</span> <span id="s432">Divided it.</span> <span id="s433">Or if it is summer, my mother had a house in Charmonix in the Montblanc -- I mean, in the Alps, so I went to Paris and Charmonix.</span> <span id="s434">You see, in winter I went skiing.</span> <span id="s435">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: So during this period, at least, there is support from all the businesses that are outside of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Yes, indeed, mm-hm, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s439">And you father is still working at this?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Yes, right, he had an office in Paris and he still worked at this, yes.</span> <span id="s441">But Hitler took them one by one.</span> <span id="s442">Every time he con -- conquered a country, a business went out, you see, yeah.</span> <span id="s443">So it must have been difficult, I wasn’t in -- you know, in the loop that I could say what the discussion was about finances.</span> <span id="s444">But it was certainly difficult.</span> <span id="s445">I would say that when I remember -- also I should add that is, yes, I remember when we left in ’33, we first went to Zurich, to a hotel, yeah, and that I remember visit -- vividly, cause that hotel was full of émigrés, sudden émigrés.</span> <span id="s446">It just happened, just happened.</span> <span id="s447">Émigrés who were quite famous.</span> <span id="s448">The literary critic of our paper, for example, Kerr was there, and all sorts of people.</span> <span id="s449">And the whole thing I always thought, even then, must have been like the refugees from the French revolution sort of atmosphere, yes.</span> <span id="s450">But I lost it cause I was bitten by my dog -- by a dog then, the first time I was ever bitten by a dog.</span> <span id="s451">But nevermind, it had nothing to do with the greater events.</span> <span id="s452">So anyway, that I remember vividly.</span> <span id="s453">And the next episode that I remember vividly is that Goering called my father back, and he said, “I want to talk to you, and if you don’t come back, we’ll take your mother.”</span> <span id="s454">And so -- his sisters were still there, yes, hostage.</span> <span id="s455">So my father, who must have been a very courageous man -- well, he fought in the first World War-- I guess, went onto the train to Berlin, to Goering.</span> <span id="s456">And nobody knows what really transpired, but there is a secret history here, which has never been really scru -- it’s never been investigated by scholars, how many Jews were Aryanized.</span> <span id="s457">‘Cause my f -- Goering offered my father Aryanization.</span> <span id="s458">There were others, some very famous, the German chief of the Luftwaffe, General Milch was Aryanized.</span> <span id="s459">Now why he did this is a general dispute.</span> <span id="s460">Either -- I don’t think it’s cause he wanted to use the advertising agencies as spy places, he had enough spy places.</span> <span id="s461">Maybe he wanted respectability, and he would have -- you know, he would have had him maybe for a year, and then, yo -- you know, to Dachau, or something else, yeah?</span> <span id="s462">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s463">Anyway, my father refused, and was escorted back on the train by the chief -- then chief of the German secret police, a man called Bergmann, the first chief of the Nazi secret police.</span> <span id="s464">And we think he should have been murdered on the train, but he wasn’t.</span> <span id="s465">And Bergmann wrote his memoirs where he also talks about this, and he came back.</span> <span id="s466">So that was the next episode.</span> <span id="s467">And that, of course, I remember, yeah, cause there were some anxieties, you can imagine, yes?</span> <span id="s468">But then it must be said that in these early days, the Nazis asked other people to come back.</span> <span id="s469">For example, the - our chief editor, Theo DeWolfe, who was a [indecipherable] man, has a correspondence, and Goebbels asked him to come back.</span> <span id="s470">They wanted respectability for a period.</span> <span id="s471">I think that’s really the explanation.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Did your father’s sisters then get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Yes, yes, everybody got out, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s474">Yes, everybody got out.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: So what are you studying during this period?</span> <span id="s476">Does it -- are -- is -- is the education better when you’re in --</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: In England?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: -- England?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: Yes, much.</span> <span id="s480">Oh, no comparison.</span> <span id="s481">I had a wonderful education.</span> <span id="s482">I had a history master, Leslie Gilbert, who I’m sure got me involved in history as he did others.</span> <span id="s483">Many great British historians of my generation come from Bootham because of Leslie Gilbert, yes.</span> <span id="s484">He put the right kind of books into my hand.</span> <span id="s485">We had a marvelous English teacher who did what I’ve never seen done since.</span> <span id="s486">He gave us a list of all the Victorian novels, and we read them all, because when you’re about 17 and 18, that’s the time to read, you know, the Bronte’s, and you know, Trollope and everything.</span> <span id="s487">It was just wonderful, it was a wonderful education, except science.</span> <span id="s488">Typically British.</span> <span id="s489">They didn’t know anything about science, and we had a terrible -- all I learned in science, all I know about science to this day is to roast chestnuts on Bunsen burners.</span> <span id="s490">That’s all I know about science to this day.</span> <span id="s491">It’s enough, it’s gotten me this far.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: So what is life in exile like then?</span> <span id="s493">Do you feel like a refugee --</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Well, you -- yes, yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: -- except [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: -- yes, I remember my sister got very furious one day, we were leaning out of a train again, and I said, “Why am I s -- always saying good-bye?”</span> <span id="s497">And that’s exile.</span> <span id="s498">You’re always saying good-bye, you’re always on trains.</span> <span id="s499">That’s partly the family situation, but still, you’re always on trains, there’s really no really permanent home, my -- all -- everybody rented, yes.</span> <span id="s500">No, there is no center, but then my family was never really my center in that sense in the boarding school.</span> <span id="s501">But still, yes, that was difficult, I think, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Did you want to go be with your mother or your father or your sister, as --</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: No, I was very fond of my stepmother; I was very close to my stepmother.</span> <span id="s504">Yes, that was lovely.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: So that was different for you, given that you --</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Yes, yes, because I didn’t know a stepmother existed until emigration, because my parents typically thought they couldn’t get divorced as long as they had this public position, and the anti-Semitism and so on, you know, made them stay together, or something like that.</span> <span id="s507">But once the emigration there was no longer that pressure, and so eventually he married my stepmother, who -- who I was very, very close to.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: What was she like?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Well, she’d studied theology, Christian theology.</span> <span id="s510">I mean, she was Jewish by race if you want to go to that, but she studied Christian theology, she had been a -- a Christian counselor to the students at the University of Berlin, yes.</span> <span id="s511">And her father had been a minor novelist, if you like to put it that -- yes, I’m very close to her son, too.</span> <span id="s512">She’d married a fa -- a country parson in the first marriage, yes, in a small village.</span> <span id="s513">And the son, and the grandchildren -- the grandchildren I’m very close to, yes, to this day, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: When is there the next change?</span> <span id="s515">Is -- is it the war in 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: Well, I mean before 1939, I went to Cambridge, of course, I left Bootham, went to Cambridge for two years, yeah.</span> <span id="s517">And then I didn’t want to go to America, that’s the last place I want to go to.</span> <span id="s518">I -- only American I’ve ever met in Cambridge was crazy.</span> <span id="s519">And then my favorite hairdresser, in Chamonix where my mother had a house, just before I went, when I said to him, “I’m going to America.”</span> <span id="s520">He said, “Vous allez chez les fous.”</span> <span id="s521">You know how that’s -- and we knew nothing about America, I mean it’s so typical.</span> <span id="s522">Here was a big newspaper family, perhaps the most prestigious newspaper in Germany, had no American connections.</span> <span id="s523">None.</span> <span id="s524">The only relative we had in America was somebody who had -- who had slept with a truck driver in 1890, and was sent to America.</span> <span id="s525">That also I knew, yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s526">So, I me --</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Why was America on the horizon?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: Well, where else were you going to go?</span> <span id="s529">My father got a visa to America, was a rare thing.</span> <span id="s530">And I had to immigrate to America before I was 21.</span> <span id="s531">I would never get a visa myself.</span> <span id="s532">There were long lines for this sort of thing, yeah.</span> <span id="s533">So, there was a terrific row until I finally said -- and then I had a re-entry permit to come back.</span> <span id="s534">And I went over here in the first of August, 1939.</span> <span id="s535">Well, you know what happened subsequently.</span> <span id="s536">So I stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: In Cambridge you studied history?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Yes, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: And was that because of this guy Gilbert?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: I think he had a lot to do with it, coming to think of it, yes, but it was also the study of gentlemen.</span> <span id="s541">If you didn’t know it -- an -- anything else to study, and in Cambridge you stayed in the circle of the friends of your school.</span> <span id="s542">You went to the college with which your s -- boarding school was affiliated, yes.</span> <span id="s543">And you had that kind of circle -- I had also other refugee friends, but you also had that kind of circle, and -- and if they didn’t know what to do, they either studied law, which I thought was impractical, cause I me -- could I remain in Britain, there is a very good question, yeah.</span> <span id="s544">And so history seemed to be the best bridge until I knew what I was going to do, which I had no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: So you come to America in August?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Alone?</span> <span id="s548">A: I come to America alone, but I had a cousin who met me at the boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: This cousin?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: No, no, th -- th -- we haven’t talked about yet.</span> <span id="s551">She is a sa -- the daughter of one of my father’s sisters.</span> <span id="s552">She met me at the boat, she was the only one.</span> <span id="s553">But you see, my sister would have met me, my sister came first in 19 thir -- ’36.</span> <span id="s554">And as my mother said, “You are giving us to the bombs.”</span> <span id="s555">You see?</span> <span id="s556">But she, of course, had good sense, she came [indecipherable] and she was in residence Schenectady, New York.</span> <span id="s557">Schenectady, New York was my first reference point in America.</span> <span id="s558">She was a resident of Schenectady in New York, yes.</span> <span id="s559">And I came to New York, and then my stepmother arrived, yes.</span> <span id="s560">And I hired an apartment for us, terrible apartment for us, yes.</span> <span id="s561">And my father was caught in France with my stepbrother, my stepmother’s son, yes.</span> <span id="s562">And he came out only with great difficulty, but he came out, too, eventually.</span> <span id="s563">And my mother came out through the occupied zone of France, from Switzerland, that you could do, and my brother came out that way.</span> <span id="s564">But my sister was the first, yes.</span> <span id="s565">So I had my sister here, I visit her, but that didn’t solve my problem, because August, you know, school starts in September, what am I going to do?</span> <span id="s566">So what I did was fairly simple.</span> <span id="s567">Bootham was a Quaker school.</span> <span id="s568">I knew nothing about America, believe me, nothing.</span> <span id="s569">But I knew there was a Quaker city called Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s570">So I looked up the trains and I just had enough money to come to Philadelphia, that was all.</span> <span id="s571">We were very poor, there was no money.</span> <span id="s572">I just had no money.</span> <span id="s573">And in Philadelphia I went and got myself a taxi and said, “Drive me to the first Quaker institution.”</span> <span id="s574">Which he did, which was Friends Select School.</span> <span id="s575">So I went in and said, “I want to see the headmaster,” and I said to the headmaster, “I’m an old Bootham boy, I have no money, first you must pay the taxi.”</span> <span id="s576">Which he did.</span> <span id="s577">Then I said, “Now it’s September, what am I going to do?”</span> <span id="s578">He said, “We have two colleges, the Quakers.</span> <span id="s579">Haverford and Swarthmore.”</span> <span id="s580">I said, “Where does the train go first?”</span> <span id="s581">The train went first to Haverford.</span> <span id="s582">So I got off at Haverford station, walked to the college, saw the president, William Wistar Comfort.</span> <span id="s583">And said, “I’m an old Bootham boy here am I stranded,” you know, “I’m hungry.”</span> <span id="s584">I was hungry.</span> <span id="s585">And he said, “We’ll take thee.”</span> <span id="s586">Now, I don’t know, I was the first Jew ever accepted at Haverford I think.</span> <span id="s587">Yes, I’m sure, yes, and it was very exclusive mainline college in those days, very, yes.</span> <span id="s588">So I went to Haverford.</span> <span id="s589">A lucky choice, because in those days small colleges could afford great scholars, and Haverford had great scholars.</span> <span id="s590">Was very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Like who?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: That’s when I really learned to study.</span> <span id="s593">Well, the man whose assistant I was -- I majored in English, first, was Leslie hots -- Hodson, the man who discovered who’d killed Christopher Marlowe.</span> <span id="s594">He was a great literary detective, which was very good for my research skills.</span> <span id="s595">And then I wrote my honors thesis, which was quite long, under William Lunt, who -- who was a very prominent historian in those days, English historian, of England, historian of England, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Now why did you go to -- into English, after you had been majoring in history at Cambridge?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: I don’t know, I wanted to.</span> <span id="s598">I do -- can’t tell you, yes.</span> <span id="s599">I had enough of his -- I wanted to go into English.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: And what was it like for you amongst these students?</span> <span id="s601">Being in America now, when you was --</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Oh no, oh no, Haverford was very accepting, it was really very good, yes.</span> <span id="s603">No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s604">I -- I had no -- no problems at Haverford really.</span> <span id="s605">I made friends, you know, the faculty was very nice, and the -- see, some were very distinguished, and -- no, that -- that was quite different.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: Were you very conscious at this point of -- was there a lot of reports you were getting and reading about what was going on in Europe?</span> <span id="s607">Was this something that was of concern to you, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: Yes, we were all concerned, but I wouldn’t say it was in the absolute forefront, no.</span> <span id="s609">There was too much else.</span> <span id="s610">Haverford was a very demanding place, you mustn’t forget.</span> <span id="s611">Vacations were shorter than in England, much shorter.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: And where was -- where were your f -- was your father and stepmother living, and where was your mother living after you -- after they came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: My mother went to Juan-les-Pins as I said, in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: No, no, no, tha -- she came here though, didn’t she?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: Yeah, she di -- oh, my stepmother, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: Oh no, she lived with my father in Paris, they lived in Paris, until they come to America -- oh no --</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Oh, that’s what I --</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: -- oh, you mean America.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: -- that’s what I asked.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: No, what they did in America is very interesting, because that’s another story that needs to be written sometime.</span> <span id="s622">They went to Berkeley.</span> <span id="s623">All rich refugees went to Berkeley.</span> <span id="s624">In Berkeley you couldn’t get any work, there was no work, but it’s a beautiful climate, beautiful scenery, university, and library, cultivated conversation.</span> <span id="s625">So in Berkeley you will find quite a group of refugees, all of them more or less wealthy, you know, because afterwards the money came back.</span> <span id="s626">More or less wealthy refugees, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: So, since your father has lost all of his business --</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Oh, let me say, they didn’t go to Berkeley, cause Berkeley was too damp, they went to Orinda, behind the tunnel road.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: So what does your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: And how do they survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Oh, there was money then.</span> <span id="s635">There was money because we sold the Swiss business.</span> <span id="s636">I should have said that.</span> <span id="s637">When eventually they sold the Swiss business, and then there was money, yeah.</span> <span id="s638">I mean, they didn’t live opulently, but they lived well.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Did it bother you to have --</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: And my stepmother also then earned money by having, as you would say, a daycare center in her house.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: Did the change of money, not living the way you had in Europe bother you?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: It’s very odd, very odd.</span> <span id="s643">No, it didn’t at all.</span> <span id="s644">And the two -- two -- two things that have to be said about that.</span> <span id="s645">First of all, it didn’t bother me because in my boarding schools I’d already lived a Spartan life, so -- so what was new?</span> <span id="s646">You see, that was excellent, yes.</span> <span id="s647">And secondly, because I felt already then, which I’ve become convinced of since, that exile was my salvation, because if I just stayed in Germany, I would just have been a spoiled brat, another spoiled brat, and nothing would ever have become of me, I’m sure.</span> <span id="s648">So I had a -- I mean, I say that exile and all this, that was my own personal salvation.</span> <span id="s649">It’s not the usual view of exile, of course, but I have known other people who will say that, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Did it give you other kinds of insights, or o-other -- other kinds of --</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: Yes, well, exile was very important, of course.</span> <span id="s652">It -- I think it made me -- let me say, very -- well, it made me like rootlessness.</span> <span id="s653">It made me sympathize with what the Germans used to call, you know, free floating intellectuals.</span> <span id="s654">You know, as an historian, it gave me a vision that wasn’t so prejudiced, ‘cause I am -- really wasn’t rooted anywhere.</span> <span id="s655">So I came to terms with it, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: Ru -- ruthlessne -- rootlessness --</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: -- is often a frightening thing for most people.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: Yeah, no, for me I think it was a good thing.</span> <span id="s660">It was not frightening for me at all.</span> <span id="s661">That’s because I’d always been rootless.</span> <span id="s662">Look, I was first in the German boarding school, then in the English boarding school, then in Cambridge.</span> <span id="s663">Those were my environments.</span> <span id="s664">The home was not an environment.</span> <span id="s665">I really didn’t have a home in the classical sense, very much.</span> <span id="s666">I mean, from the time I was 15, and even before, it wasn’t a -- a homey home, and -- as you think of, you know.</span> <span id="s667">For example, now when I come back now -- I mean now that the German -- East Germany is -- is done for, I -- I went back, of course, to see where I spent most of my time on vacation before I was 15, at our estate in Schenkendorf, yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s668">And I saw the castle and all that.</span> <span id="s669">I had no sentimental feelings at all, it’s very odd.</span> <span id="s670">Now, it’s sold, it’s gone, and I wasn’t at all sentimental about it.</span> <span id="s671">Though, in the village, where it ‘tis -- Schenkendorf village -- my parents gave the church bells.</span> <span id="s672">And one is named after me, and one after my sister, and I’m happy to say my sister was melted down in the war, but I still ring over the village, yes.</span> <span id="s673">All the time.</span> <span id="s674">I went, at great danger to life and limb up to the tower to see that darn bell.</span> <span id="s675">And it still rings, I can tell you, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s677">That’s a good place to stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">End of Tape One, Side A Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: George, before we go on with your getting your Ph.D. --</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: -- tell me -- tell us a little about your sister, and what she did, and the clinic that she set up in Harlem.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: My sister was a psychiatrist, who was very much interested in -- in social problems, and her specialty was reading disorders.</span> <span id="s683">She eventually wrote a two volume book on reading disorders in children, yes.</span> <span id="s684">But she set up -- it must have been in the late 40’s, a -- a psychiatric clinic in Harlem, which was free, yes, the first one in Harlem, free, in the basement of Adam Clayton Powell’s church.</span> <span id="s685">And she called it the La Farge Clinic.</span> <span id="s686">You know, La Farge was Karl Marx’s west Indian son-in-law, but nobody to this day knows what that means, they think it’s a donor.</span> <span id="s687">Oh well.</span> <span id="s688">Yes.</span> <span id="s689">And that ran for -- I don’t know -- she set it up with another psychiatrist called Wertheim, whose also quite famous, yes.</span> <span id="s690">She and Wertheim set it up together, but she was really the force behind this.</span> <span id="s691">And -- and then eventually it’s discon -- it was discontinued, there was no more need for it, I guess, others came.</span> <span id="s692">And now the papers and all this are in the Schomburg library, Black History Library in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Let’s get back to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: You graduate from Haverford, and you have to make -- when did you make the decision to go on to graduate school and get --</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: Oh that, immediately.</span> <span id="s697">Yeah, once I studied history at Haverford -- I mean, I was an English major first, but then I switched to history major.</span> <span id="s698">Then -- immediately -- and I first want to go to Yale, yes.</span> <span id="s699">But then I went to Harvard because I discovered something in the Harvard catalog -- one has to read college catalogs.</span> <span id="s700">There is in Harvard a fellowship called the Holzer Fellowship, which is for those who were born in Berlin Charlottenburg, which is a suburb -- no, it’s not a suburb, it’s a part of Berlin.</span> <span id="s701">And I had to prove that the street, the house -- my street was part Berlin, part Berlin Charlottenburg.</span> <span id="s702">And I had to prove I was born in Berlin Charlottenburg.</span> <span id="s703">When I proved that, I had three years tuition and everything, cause no -- there were no other candidates who in that time was born in Berlin Charlottenburg.</span> <span id="s704">It pays to read college catalogs is the answer.</span> <span id="s705">So -- but I went to Harvard because there was a professor I want to study with, Charles Howard McIlwain.</span> <span id="s706">I was interested then in English Constitutional history, yes.</span> <span id="s707">And I wrote my thesis on English Constitutional history.</span> <span id="s708">That was really my field, yes, my interest.</span> <span id="s709">And that came about because really very little else was taught to begin with i-in -- in school, in any case.</span> <span id="s710">And I -- through Leslie Gilbert and others, I had become deeply involved in English history.</span> <span id="s711">So that’s why.</span> <span id="s712">And then I did my thesis with a wonderful man, a great teacher, Charles Howard McIlwain at Harvard.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: Now, you didn’t -- before you finished your degree, you actually started teaching in --</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: Yes, that was necessary.</span> <span id="s715">I -- I wrote, I think, a hundred letters, and got two offers.</span> <span id="s716">It was very tough after the war, one forgets, it’s not just now.</span> <span id="s717">Got two offers, one from NYU, and one from Iowa.</span> <span id="s718">And I took the one from Iowa -- from Iowa.</span> <span id="s719">And was an offer, I think 16 hours teaching at $1,800, or something like that.</span> <span id="s720">But you could make a living, yes.</span> <span id="s721">And of course I’d never been in the Midwest, and I’ll never forget arriving in Iowa City, four in the morning, ‘cause that’s when the Rock Island Rocket, the train gets through there, yes, and going to the main street, and the main street is, as I now know in the Midwest, just tapers off into nothing.</span> <span id="s722">I started to cry.</span> <span id="s723">The main street tapered off into nothing, there was nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: Did you regret the choice then?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: No, no, no, because Iowa had a wonderful thing in those days, absolutely unique.</span> <span id="s726">It had a dean who was a genius in his way.</span> <span id="s727">He said, “Now look, we are a university that’s poor, what can we really be good in?”</span> <span id="s728">Fine arts.</span> <span id="s729">So it had an art department which was top, top.</span> <span id="s730">I still have in my house pictures by painters who are now famous, ‘cause whenever you gave a party and a painter broke an ashtray, he gave you a picture, you know, pretty good.</span> <span id="s731">You put the ashtrays in their way.</span> <span id="s732">So -- and it had a theater that was fantastic, British directors, and actors, sometimes Hermione Gingold, and I don’t know what, really absolutely superb, art history superb, yes.</span> <span id="s733">And history was good too, it was a university in the up.</span> <span id="s734">But the wonderful thing -- and I was a cultural historian, don’t forget-- the wonderful thing was the whole fine arts scene.</span> <span id="s735">There was there the famous writer’s workshop, which still exists, yes.</span> <span id="s736">So my colleague for three -- I was there ni -- eight years, and eight or nine years.</span> <span id="s737">For four of these years, Robert Lowell, the poet, was my colleague, yes.</span> <span id="s738">And his wife, Elizabeth Hardwick.</span> <span id="s739">Yes.</span> <span id="s740">So, I mean Iowa was quite a special place, believe me.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: Now, you said you were -- you were a cultural historian.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: But when you graduate from Harvard, that’s not the --</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: No, that’s not it, it shifted.</span> <span id="s745">I mean, I was still doing English Constitutional history, but more and more interested in cultural matters.</span> <span id="s746">This is quite true.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: Is there some reason it comes about, or simply that you start teaching?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: No, it’s simply I -- I taught -- I taught Ren and Ref, Renaissance and Reformation, and I taught English Constitutional history, of course, yes.</span> <span id="s749">And sometimes modern Britain, it depended, yes.</span> <span id="s750">And I always taught the freshman course, that was my great plus.</span> <span id="s751">I learned to teach first in the war, when I was a part of the program which trained occupation troops.</span> <span id="s752">And I had one regiment that was to occupy Czechoslovakia, and one that occupied France.</span> <span id="s753">And the boys in the Czechosl -- in the one that was to occupy Czechoslovakia were very nice.</span> <span id="s754">But the ones who were to occupied France gave me great deal of pressure, ‘cause I thought France probably deserved them.</span> <span id="s755">They were all Marxists, all from New York City, most of them.</span> <span id="s756">So you can imagine, I had to teach them, my first teaching, that was a challenge.</span> <span id="s757">That’s how I learned to teach, I’m very grateful for that, it really -- it really was a challenge.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Where were you doing this teaching?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: In Iowa city already.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Oh, that -- that’s where --</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: That program was in Iowa city.</span> <span id="s762">I just stayed in Iowa city.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: So what did you have to teach them?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: How to occupy the countries, with the -- the topography, almost everything.</span> <span id="s765">They were all sent to Japan, of course, in the end, the army being the army, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: You like teaching.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: Yes, very much, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s768">Well, I became very good at lecturing, ‘cause then the veterans came, and we had classes of, let’s say up to a thousand.</span> <span id="s769">And I was the only person in my whole department who could lecture to a thousand.</span> <span id="s770">It takes a certain showmanship, yes.</span> <span id="s771">And that I used to get immediate promotion to tenure, of course.</span> <span id="s772">I remember I met the dean on the staircase and I said, “Well, I think I have enough, I’ll leave.”</span> <span id="s773">“Oh no, you mustn’t do that,” he said.</span> <span id="s774">Then I gave my conditions.</span> <span id="s775">But I was the only one who could lecture to that many people.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: What kind of research did you start to -- start to do at -- at this time in the late 40’s and early 50’s?</span> <span id="s777">Were you moving towards --</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: No, not yet, this was all red -- Renaissance and Reformation research, yes, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s779">I did then -- I began in the mid-50’s to do some on antisemi -- one on anti-Semitism, German anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s780">I wrote an article, I don’t know, ’58 or something like that.</span> <span id="s781">That was my first.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: And what did -- what -- the impetus, is there any particular reason why you --</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: No, I can’t really tell you.</span> <span id="s784">Well, there was a particular reason, yes.</span> <span id="s785">Wisconsin gave me an offer, and I wanted to come to Wisconsin, ‘cause it was then one of the best history departments in the country.</span> <span id="s786">And the condition was that I teach modern cultural history.</span> <span id="s787">So I had to work it up, I never had a course in modern history in my life.</span> <span id="s788">So I had to work it up, obviously, yes.</span> <span id="s789">So that’s -- that’s how it came.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: Is there something in -- in that beginning study that also goes back to your history -- I mean, clearly it goes back in -- in simple parallels.</span> <span id="s791">You went through some of that, your family --</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: -- goes through some of that, but -- but --</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: -- is there something in that that drives you as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: Yes, well to understand, of course, what happened, yes.</span> <span id="s797">To understand what happened, and what had gone -- could have gone so wrong, or the position of the Jews, and thing -- matters of this nature.</span> <span id="s798">You see, I started out, I should say, my Ren and re -- Ref research was heavily weighted on the Reformation, and on Christian theology, yes.</span> <span id="s799">I’d studied Christian theology, I’d even lived for a short time in a kind of monas -- monastic Christian establishment.</span> <span id="s800">I knew how to serve mass.</span> <span id="s801">Greatly astonished my Hebrew -- when I first came to the Hebrew university in ’69, they asked me to teach the Reformation.</span> <span id="s802">So I said, how can I teach the Reformation to kids who doesn’t know what -- who don’t know what the mass is.</span> <span id="s803">So I arranged with the -- I had some connections with -- with Our Ladies of Zion, to let me celebrate a mass for them, and I did.</span> <span id="s804">Showed them exactly what’s happening, what’s what, what what.</span> <span id="s805">The ladies were impressed.</span> <span id="s806">The students, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s807">Anyhow, so I was -- I was really into the Christian theology [indecipherable] and then in the Baroque, which goes directly to my interest, you know, in Nazi liturgy and things, which is -- comes after, in a sense, from the Baroque, yes.</span> <span id="s808">I had continued to publish on early modern till ’68 -- till ’70 really, cause one thing I wrote in -- in ’60, came out only in ’70.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: But in the early 60’s is when you started publishing more --</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: Almost exclusively except for the textbook, Europe in the 16th Century, which came out in ’68.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: When you came to this country, you clearly must have noticed the racism against blacks, African-Americans.</span> <span id="s812">Did that -- was that something --</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: No, what astonished us was the racism against Jews, not against blacks.</span> <span id="s814">We knew nothing about blacks, we’d hardly ever seen a black, quite apart from met a black.</span> <span id="s815">But I remember, we went it -- in -- in a travel agency and wanted to go somewhere, and the travel agents says, “You can’t, it’s restricted.”</span> <span id="s816">And we said, “Why did we leave Germany at all?”</span> <span id="s817">That was common, you know, there were lots of resorts that were restricted for Jews, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s818">Yes, of course.</span> <span id="s819">And I was rejected from Columbia graduate school, because the Jewish quota was full.</span> <span id="s820">In fact, I have the rejection, it says it.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: It says it?</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: Yeah, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s823">So, and -- third -- third evidence, when I left Harvard for my first job, my major professor, who was not an anti-Semite, he was a wonderful man, had to write on my letter of recommendation, which is secret, but I promptly read it when I got there, of course, “George Mosse has good manners, though he is a Jew.”</span> <span id="s824">And I think I got my job, I was always the first Jew.</span> <span id="s825">I was the first Jew in Iowa department, I was the first Jew in the Wisconsin department.</span> <span id="s826">But what kosherized me, of course, my English education in Cambridge.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: Was it -- was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: Th -- if instead I had been -- I had been educated in the Bronx in City College, I don’t think it would have been the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: Was it difficult at Harvard?</span> <span id="s830">Did you experience anti-Semitism there?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: No, no, none.</span> <span id="s832">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: Were there many Jewish professors at Harvard?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: I never gave it much thought.</span> <span id="s835">There were some who were quite spectacular.</span> <span id="s836">Levine, who just died, in English.</span> <span id="s837">Not many.</span> <span id="s838">Very few, very few.</span> <span id="s839">Well, above all, in my subject, these were taboo subjects, English and history, there was hardly any.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: Hardly any Jews at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: Yeah, hardly any.</span> <span id="s842">In America, hardly any.</span> <span id="s843">No, these were as good as closed subjects.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: How do you -- how do you characterize th-th-the questions that you’re really asking, once you start studying racism, National Socialism, and fascism, and -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: I don’t quite know what you mean by characterize.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: Sometimes people say that -- that -- that scholars have one question they’re really asking all the time, and they ask it in different --</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: No, my question is usually why did -- why was it popular, why’d it succeed, what do people see in it, yes.</span> <span id="s848">Yeah.</span> <span id="s849">I look at it from it’s effect, let’s put it that way.</span> <span id="s850">What was the effect?</span> <span id="s851">What was the mindset, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: Do you understand it?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: Yes, I think I understand it pretty well.</span> <span id="s854">At least to my satisfaction.</span> <span id="s855">Maybe not to others, but to my satisfaction, yes, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Can you -- can you give us some -- I mean, I know that it’s five -- it’s 10 books, but if you would start to explain in -- in some sort --</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: Well, there are always two things, I mean, it’s an interaction between the actual situation, yes, and then to see the conditioning of the thought, yes.</span> <span id="s858">They interact, and of course the actual situation before ’33 was pretty miserable, yes.</span> <span id="s859">And Hitler had immediate successes, you know, with unemployment, so that’s one thing.</span> <span id="s860">And the other thing is, I think, in such a situation, and that’s nothing new, people want certain things.</span> <span id="s861">They want security.</span> <span id="s862">They want shelter.</span> <span id="s863">They want to -- self affirmation.</span> <span id="s864">All that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s865">And if you really list all these things, you will find that fascism took care of it, you know.</span> <span id="s866">I mean, Hitler said it best, let the little merchant who is lonely in his shop, when he comes out to a mass meetings, suddenly finds himself, as it were, among comrades.</span> <span id="s867">He suddenly finds what he misses, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: But there’s -- but there’s -- I know you don’t like the term totalitarianism.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: But in the context of what it was that the Nazis created in Germany --</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: -- as well as the possibility for that kind of home, so to speak --</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: -- within the context of this society.</span> <span id="s875">There’s also the constant threat that you will be seen as an enemy, or you can be possibly taken out.</span> <span id="s876">Or is that the --</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: Yeah, not really.</span> <span id="s878">I mean, not really.</span> <span id="s879">Not if you conform.</span> <span id="s880">And of course there were those who didn’t like it, who thought they could be outside it, but there was a consensus.</span> <span id="s881">Fascism could use the consensus in Germany and Italy, and it produced a consensus where most people wanted to conform.</span> <span id="s882">They wanted that heady feeling of being in a group of comrades, if you like, yes.</span> <span id="s883">Of doing something, marching, demonstrating, all of this.</span> <span id="s884">They wanted strong leadership, yes.</span> <span id="s885">They wanted to know where they are going, and they wanted to know where they came from, and the -- the -- the Nazis did all of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: How would you describe the differences between Italian fascism and the National Socialism in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: Well, the differences are quite considerable, I think, on one level.</span> <span id="s888">Mussolini’s regime was more open, let’s say different things went into it unknown in Germany.</span> <span id="s889">The futurist movement, with it’s idea of speed and dynamic, and all of this, yes.</span> <span id="s890">And of course, Italian nationalism was kind of a -- always had a revolutionary edge to it, th -- one that Mussolini adopted, yes.</span> <span id="s891">While in Germany, you have a much more dense space, romanticism, racism; racism unknown in Italy, there’s no racist tradition.</span> <span id="s892">Italy hardly has an anti-Semitic tradition.</span> <span id="s893">So that deprives it, already, of a lot of things that you associate with the Nazis, yes.</span> <span id="s894">But a lot of things are the same, the control of thought -- well, there’s another great difference.</span> <span id="s895">Mussolini didn’t care about culture.</span> <span id="s896">You could have the most -- after all, the most modernist buildings in Europe were built under fascism.</span> <span id="s897">Like the House of Fascism in Modena, probably the most modernist building in Europe of it’s time, yes.</span> <span id="s898">There was no -- no official art in Italy till very late.</span> <span id="s899">It did come, but very late, yes.</span> <span id="s900">All of that.</span> <span id="s901">There was no -- so severe book censorship as in Germany.</span> <span id="s902">In other words, the culture, which didn’t interest Mussoli -- Mussolini, or did interest him, but he had a more open -- he was quite a different person, he had a more open mind on this, yes.</span> <span id="s903">Otherwise, it was a dictatorship.</span> <span id="s904">These are the differences.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: Did you travel to Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: During the w --</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: In the 30’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: 30’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: Where did you go and what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: Well, my mother took me to Florence, that’s what Germans did.</span> <span id="s913">And that was the Italian city, yes.</span> <span id="s914">So I -- were very heady, I looked at Florence for the first time.</span> <span id="s915">But while we were in Florence in ’36, the axis between Hitler and Mussolini was signed, and part of the axis was an extradition treaty, under which we could fall.</span> <span id="s916">But Mussolini, in about 1921 -- ’20 - ’21, before he became prime minister, made the rounds of all the newspaper publishers, yes, important ones, also my father, and my father supported him, I mean, not for Germany, but for Italy it was fine, it made the train run on time, and so on, yes.</span> <span id="s917">And that Mussolini and in fact, showed himself grateful by letting me and my mother s-stay in Italy as long as we liked, and simply ignored the extradition treaty.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: George, in the 50’s -- through a good part of the 60’s, it’s probably still true today, but certainly in the 50’s, there’s repetition of “Red Scare”.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: And McCarthyism is very strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s922">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: You are -- what -- what is happening to you during this period?</span> <span id="s924">What’s [indecipherable] activity?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: Oh, I was very active during this period.</span> <span id="s926">First of all, I was vice-chairman of the Wallace campaign, Henry Wallace, not the other, Henry Wallace campaign in Iowa, in ’48, yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s927">And that’s another speaking, I learned to speak cause I spoke at county fairs, and so on, that was very good.</span> <span id="s928">So -- in the Wallace campaign, yes.</span> <span id="s929">And then I became chairman of the American Association University Professors, but in Iowa it was quite different.</span> <span id="s930">There, McCarthy was the radical.</span> <span id="s931">For example, I made a big meeting, as chairman, anti-McCarthyite meeting, overtly, with the finance chairman of the Republican party of Iowa as the main speaker.</span> <span id="s932">You see, for him McCarthy was the radical, yes.</span> <span id="s933">And indeed, when singing cowboy Senator Taylor -- you’re too young to know all this -- who was Henry Wallace’s vice-presidential candidate, you know, he came and strummed; he was senator from Idaho.</span> <span id="s934">Idaho is greatly changed in politics since then.</span> <span id="s935">He was -- the senator from Idaho came to my house.</span> <span id="s936">This was risky because I was just an assistant professor without tenure, but the president himself called me and said, “That’s fine, George, do go ahead.”</span> <span id="s937">Yeah.</span> <span id="s938">And our Republican state rep -- our Republican representative came to the house too at that point, to say hello to the senators.</span> <span id="s939">No, no, in Iowa you were protected by the -- by the conservatism against McCarthyism.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: Did you teach Marxism?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: Yes, always.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: Was that a problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: Never.</span> <span id="s944">Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: But now professors in the east had problems during the 60’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: Ah, yes, and I nearly had problems, because -- and that’s another good e-example what happened.</span> <span id="s947">In Harvard, Marxism wasn’t taught, so together with many other of my friends, I went over to MIT to Dirk Struik to study Marxism.</span> <span id="s948">And then all people in Dirk Struik’s seminar were denounced to the Chicago Tribune, no less, by whom?</span> <span id="s949">The former Librarian of Congress.</span> <span id="s950">The historian -- what’s he called?</span> <span id="s951">I forgot now.</span> <span id="s952">I even blocked on his name.</span> <span id="s953">Well, the one before this one, a Nixon appointee.</span> <span id="s954">Yeah, historian.</span> <span id="s955">Well, h-he -- became later, he denounced it, yes.</span> <span id="s956">But he didn’t denounce me, he stopped before me, that was very ticklish, so I never had to face that.</span> <span id="s957">But because this denunciation came, and brought people at Rutgers and otherwise into terrible difficulty, again told our dean, you know, I’m about to be denounced to be a Marxist, but he says, “Don’t worry.”</span> <span id="s958">I would -- you know, I think I would have been saved because of the conservatism.</span> <span id="s959">But not at Rutgers, not -- not in all these eastern places where the others taught, who’d been with me in Dirk Struik’s Marxism class.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: That’s interesting.</span> <span id="s961">When did the racism in the United States for you become a conscious problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: Well, as I said, when my mother and I spoke to that travel agent, but then it became conscious that there was, in fact, anti-Jewish racism around.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: No, but in the 60’s, you -- you -- in -- in -- in ’56 --</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: Oh, the Civil Rights movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: The Civil Rights movement [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: Yes, well that was different, I mean, then well -- knew -- everybody knew and so many of my students went on freedom rides, very close friends of mine went on freedom rides, and so that was totally different.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: Were there many black students at University of Iowa?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: No, that’s before that, before the bl -- influx of black students, yes, before.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: When do you go to University of Wisconsin?</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: ’56.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: And how long were you at the University of Wisconsin?</span> <span id="s972">Until [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: Till I retired, till ’88.</span> <span id="s974">But from ’69 to ’88, only half time.</span> <span id="s975">I mean, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s976">I came to Wisconsin already getting every other semester off.</span> <span id="s977">That I used from ’69 on to teach in Jerusalem, but I got my chair in Jerusalem, regular chair in Jerusalem in ’78.</span> <span id="s978">And from then I went on half time in Wisconsin.</span> <span id="s979">It dovetailed very nicely the way semesters were then.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: Now what is the Jerusalem connection?</span> <span id="s981">The connection with Israel that you’re going back and forth, and so early --</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: Well, it’s a funny connection, because you know, all my youth, I was an anti-Zionist, I was an anti-Zionist even into the war, yes.</span> <span id="s983">Because I thought defeating Hitler came first, and the Zionist agenda a far second, yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s984">And then I suppose I changed when I saw what was happening, and -- and I made my first visit to jerus -- to Israel in ’51, yes, as a tourist.</span> <span id="s985">And then I came back in ’61, and then I had already, from a very good friend of mine, the Marxist -- the -- I mean, the scholar of Marxism, George Lichtheim, very good rec -- letters of recommendation, yeah.</span> <span id="s986">And I met all the people there, the -- the historian Talmon, but above all Gershem Scholem, to whom I was going to be quite close in a way, if one could be close to Scholem, was -- couldn’t really.</span> <span id="s987">But, you know, who I got to know very well in the end, and all this, if you like “yekke” German Jewish circle there, yes.</span> <span id="s988">And one thing led to another, and I gave some lectures in ’63, and then in ’68 they asked me to come for a semester, which I did.</span> <span id="s989">And then they made me what they called “permanent visiting professor”.</span> <span id="s990">‘Course, they didn’t like, even when I came in ’78, they didn’t like anybody -- they were -- they’re very odd, the Hebrew [indecipherable] very provincial in many -- in this way, they didn’t like somebody teaching other places than the Hebrew University.</span> <span id="s991">Now how could I do it ’78?</span> <span id="s992">Because I got the Koebner chair.</span> <span id="s993">Koebner was the first professor of history there, yes?</span> <span id="s994">And I think the Germans who gave the money insisted that somebody respectable come on that chair.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: Were you any part of the discussions prior to the state being formed in ’48 --</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: -- against the -- the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: [indecipherable] Magnes and Arendt…</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1001">I know now, and I’ve written about it.</span> <span id="s1002">No, no, I know all these people.</span> <span id="s1003">Robert Welsch became a very close friend of mine, but that’s all long after.</span> <span id="s1004">It’s all long after.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: So are you a Zionist now, or did you become one in ’51 in some sense?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: I suppose so.</span> <span id="s1007">Yes, yes, no -- I mean, look, it’s not so simple, because you can’t [indecipherable] in one -- yes, I’m an Utopian Zionist.</span> <span id="s1008">I still think it should be otherwise than just another little Albania there, or whatever you have, yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s1009">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1010">And I know very well what the possibilities in Zionism were.</span> <span id="s1011">Namely, a humanized nationalism, you know, with Buber and many others.</span> <span id="s1012">Gordon, and founder of the Kibbutz movement.</span> <span id="s1013">It could have been a humanized nationalism, perhaps still is in a way, yes.</span> <span id="s1014">Yes, I suppose I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: Talk about that.</span> <span id="s1016">What do you mean by humanized nationalism, becau --</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: People who wanted nationalism, open cosmopolitan nationalism, for whom nationalism was merely a stage of your own self growth, you know.</span> <span id="s1018">As for Buber, as for Gordon, it’s post-German and eastern European, that exists, and that still exists today, a very strong current, anti-war, you know, and all of this.</span> <span id="s1019">It still exists.</span> <span id="s1020">I mean, it’s very difficult to think of another country where you could have anti-war demonstration the middle of a war for survival.</span> <span id="s1021">But you have it in Israel.</span> <span id="s1022">So these currents are still there, yes.</span> <span id="s1023">No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: ‘Cause most people think of Zionism as a -- as a monolithic --</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: Oh, it’s far from monolithic, it’s far from monolithic.</span> <span id="s1026">No.</span> <span id="s1027">No, no, I feel very much at home in Jerusalem, and should by now, you know.</span> <span id="s1028">And I have many, many friends there, probably more than any other place.</span> <span id="s1029">But -- and there’s much more inters -- interesting intellectual discussion there than here, yeah.</span> <span id="s1030">Because obviously, when you are in an extreme situation, the discussion is more pressing, more -- more interesting, yes, more fruitful, than when you’re just with nothing.</span> <span id="s1031">I mean, I know Americans try to invent enemies when they can, but in Israel it’s real.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: Do you think that’s true, that -- that intellectual life is -- is more creative when -- when there’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: -- a sense of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: Yes, I think it’s true.</span> <span id="s1036">But in Israel I must say -- I’m not talking about the average Israeli, I move in Israel very rarified circles, yeah.</span> <span id="s1037">The German Jewish circle is dying out.</span> <span id="s1038">But the young people, many of them I’ve taught in one way or another, it’s very exciting, very good, you know.</span> <span id="s1039">And there is something about it, about these young people even, that’s cosmopolitan, you know, I mean, you know.</span> <span id="s1040">I mean, they also talk about Europe, not just about Israel, you know, and that sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: Are there particular issues in history that -- that are very important to these students, I mean, can -- can one in some sense --</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: No, I don’t think so, no.</span> <span id="s1043">Of course, in the Jewish history course, they all wait for the Holocaust, ‘cause that’s the most spectacular.</span> <span id="s1044">Which is a pity, because Jewish history is not about the Holocaust, there are also many other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: But it’s spectacular for this century.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1047">And that’s a pity, because they -- they -- it blinds them to other Jewish things in this century, which have, perhaps, great intellectual value, or carry -- whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: What do you think it might blind people to, when -- when the Holocaust is overemphasized like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: It blinds them for one thing to the irony of Jewish history that the Holocaust takes place at the precise moment when you have the greatest success of assimilation in history, namely in the United States.</span> <span id="s1050">And it blinds them to the fact of the success of assimilation, rather than the failure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: That’s very significant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: Yes, it’s very significant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: I suppose it’s hard to take both at the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: It’s hard for people to think dialectically, which is what you have to do in these cases, yes.</span> <span id="s1055">The negative -- the positive is in dialectic relationship, but I think it’s undoubtedly true, yes.</span> <span id="s1056">And then it blinds you what is the consequence of the Holocaust, I mean people ask me, what is a historical consequence of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1057">Has it stopped massacres?</span> <span id="s1058">No.</span> <span id="s1059">You think so?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: No.</span> <span id="s1062">Has it stopped genocide?</span> <span id="s1063">Probably not.</span> <span id="s1064">Yeah?</span> <span id="s1065">Has it -- it has done something to the situation of the Jews.</span> <span id="s1066">It has made, in a way, assimilation easier, because, you know, people don’t want to repeat it, people don’t want to come into contact with it.</span> <span id="s1067">Certainly in central Europe, yes.</span> <span id="s1068">Not so much in countries which are distant from the Holocaust, but wherever the Holocaust had an impact.</span> <span id="s1069">It’s in ham -- impact on the status of the Jews.</span> <span id="s1070">I think there’s no doubt about that.</span> <span id="s1071">And above all it has created Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: Is there also an irony to -- I-I don’t know if “irony” is the right word, but that -- there is at the same a kind of sensitivity about anti-Semitism that didn’t exist prior to the Holocaust, even though there is at the same time, even Christian -- a -- a very different relationship --</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: -- Christians have with Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: Yes, I think that’s true, but only to some extent.</span> <span id="s1076">I mean you can’t -- one can’t make blanket statements about that.</span> <span id="s1077">I doubt that on the average this has made much difference.</span> <span id="s1078">It has made difference to certain Christian theologians and Christian thinkers, and perhaps even to Christian churches, yes.</span> <span id="s1079">Not to all of them, but to wu -- to the mainstream Christian churches, yes, yes, I think it has, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: George, you don’t teach the Holocaust, I gather.</span> <span id="s1081">You -- this is not [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: Well, only in a general Jewish history course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: And your scholarship --</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: -- stops before [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: -- whatever it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: Why -- why --</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: Before the -- before the killing process.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: Before the killing process.</span> <span id="s1092">Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: Because I think the -- to me it’s much more interesting to say why it happened than how it happened.</span> <span id="s1094">After all, to me the decisive thing is why did it happen.</span> <span id="s1095">Once -- how it happened, that’s, I would say, an administrative matter.</span> <span id="s1096">Very interesting and fine, and necessary to know, but the crucial question is why did it happen.</span> <span id="s1097">That’s why.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: But let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s1099">If you don’t investigate -- and I’m not talking about the how now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: But if you don’t investigate who it was that was doing the killing, or the process in some way --</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: -- how do you bring together what you studied prior, the -- the why that brought you up to the moment --</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: -- of doing it, and -- and explain it, you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: But you see, I do, because when I lecture, as I did just yesterday, on the first World War or the Holocaust, that’s exactly what I do.</span> <span id="s1107">I explain the mindset of the perpetrators, which seems to me essential, and the atmosphere in which they grew up, which has to do with the first World War, in which even many of them fought.</span> <span id="s1108">So there is a continuity here in the minds of the perpetrators.</span> <span id="s1109">How they regarded mass death, cause the Holocaust is about mass death.</span> <span id="s1110">So is the first World War.</span> <span id="s1111">So, how they regarded mass death, and so on.</span> <span id="s1112">And there is a definite continuity there.</span> <span id="s1113">Without a certain atmosphere in post-war germ -- post World War І Germany, it would have been quite different.</span> <span id="s1114">Would have been quite different.</span> <span id="s1115">These weren’t youngsters who did the killing process, I mean.</span> <span id="s1116">Maybe they hadn’t fought in the war, but they knew enough about the war, and certainly about post-war Germany, the Weimar Republic, and all that.</span> <span id="s1117">So again, I don’t think you can explain their motivation without going back.</span> <span id="s1118">And then one thing brings you to another.</span> <span id="s1119">You see what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: Yeah, sort of a treat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: Let me ask you -- let me ask you about Hannah Arendt for a moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: You’re one of the few scholars who, when her book Eichmann in Jerusalem, came out --</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: -- did not just simply criticize it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: What was she saying in there that you thought was important?</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: Everything she said about Eichmann I thought was true.</span> <span id="s1130">I thought nothing she said about the Jews was actually true, but everything she said about Eichmann was true.</span> <span id="s1131">There is a banality of evil, because Eichmann’s evil is ordinary, yeah.</span> <span id="s1132">He was an ordinary man.</span> <span id="s1133">To him, it was ordinary, yeah.</span> <span id="s1134">So the question is, when does evil become an ordinary thing.</span> <span id="s1135">That’s, after all, the vital thing, and that she addressed there, very well.</span> <span id="s1136">When does evil s -- become an ordinary thing, almost an everyday thing?</span> <span id="s1137">Infect ordinary people like -- like Eichmann, yeah.</span> <span id="s1138">That, I thought, was very well taken.</span> <span id="s1139">But now, part of what she meant by the banality of evil, was that the perpetrator was thoughtless.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: Was what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: Thoughtless.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: No -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: Was not -- was not actually -- was not carrying on a Socratic dialog with himself --</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: No, of course not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: [indecipherable] question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: No, of course not, and she’s quite right, no.</span> <span id="s1147">It was doing your duty, that’s not a dialog, yes.</span> <span id="s1148">“Being at the battlefront of the race war” -- I’m quoting a perpetrator now – “being at the battlefront of the race war”.</span> <span id="s1149">That doesn’t allow for dialog, no more than you can have a dialog in the trenches.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q: But at the same time, orders are not given for everything.</span> <span id="s1151">People make up things to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: Yeah, because you have to do what you have to do in order to have the result, which is an order.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: So is Hilberg right, that somehow the perpetrators had a sense of what the order was, even if there’s no direct --</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: Oh yes, I think on this he’s totally right, yes, for sure.</span> <span id="s1155">Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: So as a missed -- a -- a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: Well, but they -- they had the order directly from Himmler, I mean, you know, there’s no -- no question about that.</span> <span id="s1158">They just didn’t go in there and start killing on -- on a hunch that that might please the Fuehrer, might please him.</span> <span id="s1159">They had a direct order from Himmler, do it.</span> <span id="s1160">And the Einsatztruppen made a direct order, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: Have you ever talked with perpetrators, Nazi perpetrators?</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: Oh ye -- no, I interviewed a lot of Nazis, but what I interviewed -- what we call in German “schreibpischtaeter”- what do you call it, theoretical, I mean -- for example, I’ve interviewed -- I was -- I knew Speer quite well, yes.</span> <span id="s1163">I talked a lot with Speer, and I went and participated in what was left of the SA cultural circle, yeah, which was quite interesting, yes.</span> <span id="s1164">And si -- you know, I t -- I talked to Mathilde Leudendorf.</span> <span id="s1165">I talked a lot when I was writing, The Crisis of German Ideology, and then I was writing a book called, The Nationalization of the Masses, which is very largely based on Speer’s memory of -- of certain matters.</span> <span id="s1166">So, yes, I’ve interviewed a lot of Nazis, and what I do there is very simple, with success.</span> <span id="s1167">I -- when I first met Speer, he was very suspicious, of course.</span> <span id="s1168">And I said, “Look, look, I’m not interested in your morals.</span> <span id="s1169">That’s between you and God.</span> <span id="s1170">I’ve come to ask you technical question.”</span> <span id="s1171">So I asked him, why do you use this lighting effect at the Nuremberg trials, why do you do this?</span> <span id="s1172">And with that, he thought these were questions he could answer, technical quest -- and then we went from technical to other things, and it worked, I think, very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: What was it like --</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: I got everything out of him -- what?</span> <span id="s1175">He got me -- he always picked me up in Munich -- you know, this at -- this went over about five, six years.</span> <span id="s1176">He always picked me up in Munich in a car, which had a Wankel motor, that was the -- the -- the -- the alternative to our engine, yes, our -- yes, our motor engine, and that he developed in the war, yeah, yes.</span> <span id="s1177">And off we went.</span> <span id="s1178">And the embarrassing thing -- the only embarrassing thing was whenever I ate with him in public, people came up and wanted his autograph.</span> <span id="s1179">Whenever.</span> <span id="s1180">They must have thought I was too a Nazi.</span> <span id="s1181">And the other interesting thing about it was it’s quite true, it gave me insights into other things.</span> <span id="s1182">For example, whenever he talked about Hitler negatively, his eyes lit up.</span> <span id="s1183">I mean, Hitler must have had a tremendous charisma, because this man, even you know, denying everything, thinking everything was dreadful now.</span> <span id="s1184">Genuinely thinking it was dreadful, his eyes lit up when he talked about Hitler.</span> <span id="s1185">Oh, I learned a lot from him, oh yes.</span> <span id="s1186">I never wrote about him, I wrote about him once in an Australian paper, cause I didn’t want him to see it, particularly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: What did he teach you about Hitler, did he teach you -- I m -- I mean, ec -- except for the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: Well, he -- sort of in -- everything that’s in his excellent memoirs, but in a kind of different way, yeah.</span> <span id="s1189">For example, Hitler’s attitude towards women is very remarkable, he never knew Speer was married, and Speer was married with eight children, or something like that.</span> <span id="s1190">I mean, he was not only married, really married.</span> <span id="s1191">He never knew it, Hitler never knew it.</span> <span id="s1192">He never asked, he never knew.</span> <span id="s1193">You see, you learn the tidbits like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: What about when you went to this not -- this cultural -- th-the remnants of [indecipherable] cultural -- what was that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: Ah.</span> <span id="s1196">That -- I wrote about that, too.</span> <span id="s1197">They di -- that was in one of the castles in upper Hesse, which was sort of the center of neo-Nazi activity.</span> <span id="s1198">And they read to each other, poetry.</span> <span id="s1199">They gave a prize called the Adenauer prize, after the old chancellor, yes, and things like that.</span> <span id="s1200">And what I did there is -- I couldn’t go under my own name, so I borrowed the name of a good friend who was a Count.</span> <span id="s1201">And it’s very typical of this kind of rightist person that when you come as a Count he ask -- they ask no questions, they accept you, of course, immediately.</span> <span id="s1202">‘Course, it was a well-known, old German name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: So what was that like for you to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: It was fascinating, I loved it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: Well, tell me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: Te -- te -- tell me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: Well, I came there as one of them.</span> <span id="s1209">I know the language, I know everything like that, and I was a voelkisch writer, poet, or whatever, I forget what I made myself out to be.</span> <span id="s1210">Count von -- I won’t give you the name because the lady is still alive.</span> <span id="s1211">Count von so and so, yes.</span> <span id="s1212">And I had to be very on my -- on my toes, because they said, Count, you know, and that was me.</span> <span id="s1213">And then I -- I viewed the late Mathilde Leudendorf, you know, the wife on that, and the afterplay was this, that the people who were in my house in Madison says, “Three boxes arrived for Count so and so at 36 Glenway, Madison, who is that?”</span> <span id="s1214">I said, “It’s me.”</span> <span id="s1215">She sent her collected works.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: Did you talk about that period with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: What?</span> <span id="s1218">Yes, of course.</span> <span id="s1219">No, to Mathilde Leudendorf I wanted some specific information again first, about some other voelkisch person who was important, and so on and so forth, yeah.</span> <span id="s1220">Well Speer would talk constantly about the Nazi period, that was after -- the period of his glory.</span> <span id="s1221">What it was like in Paris when he went there with Hitler, you know, and Arnold Breker, and so on.</span> <span id="s1222">Spr -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: You taught in South Africa?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: Yes, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: That was in 1980.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: ’80.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: What was that -- that like, was that like going back in time, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: No, it was very interesting because nobody knows, I mean, people are so ill-informed.</span> <span id="s1229">There was a law on the upper side, that any course given at a white university that was not given at a black university, blacks could attend.</span> <span id="s1230">So I gave a course on the history of nationalism, yes, and my course was 50 percent black.</span> <span id="s1231">And that was very interesting, I got to know, and they took me to Soweto, and they took me here and took me there.</span> <span id="s1232">It was very interesting, yes.</span> <span id="s1233">And I had some very good friends there.</span> <span id="s1234">And Cape Town is certainly the most beautiful city in the world, I mean there’s no question about that.</span> <span id="s1235">I had a very good time, and I was interested -- again, I’m not, you know, like always interested in victims, I’m s -- I’m sometimes interested in the other side.</span> <span id="s1236">So I was interested in the Boers.</span> <span id="s1237">I got to know some Boers very well.</span> <span id="s1238">I was there on behalf of the Jewish community to open what we called the Kaplan Chair of Jewish Studies at Cape Town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: Did it surprise you what happened in the last few years?</span> <span id="s1240">That it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: Yes, of course.</span> <span id="s1242">Very much so.</span> <span id="s1243">Yes, I mean it’s very difficult to get used to it.</span> <span id="s1244">I mean, I -- I was only there, you know, what is it, two months or something, but it was tough, yes, seeing this -- this apartheid in action, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: Did you like to go --</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A: I mean, to me it was interesting as a r -- as an expert on race, I mean, you know, one should -- I had just written, Towards the Final Solution, and you know, to see it is interesting, and to see the diverse attitudes of people towards it, you know.</span> <span id="s1247">And they -- it -- it was very humiliating because, for example, in the hotel where I lived, all the blacks and colored, yes, always address me as “baas” -- master.</span> <span id="s1248">And I said you don’t really -- I don’t really like it, but I couldn’t break it.</span> <span id="s1249">To the last I was “baas”.</span> <span id="s1250">I mean, you come into a colonial situation actually.</span> <span id="s1251">That’s what it -- you must put it that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: Hopefully in a few years they won’t say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: I think now they don’t say that any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: George, tell me about how you view Holocaust studies, as a whole, the kind of history that’s done, the kind of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: No, much of it is extremely good, I mean, I -- I -- I’m not -- you ja -- I don’t really have an overview.</span> <span id="s1256">Now, the background of the Holocaust, yes, there have been some very good studies, on -- on the Holocaust, too.</span> <span id="s1257">But there are vast, oddly enough, neglected areas one can think about at once.</span> <span id="s1258">One is women in the Holocaust, yes.</span> <span id="s1259">Homosexuals, that area’s being repaired now.</span> <span id="s1260">An excellent book by Gauss and so on, that’s being repaired.</span> <span id="s1261">Gypsies is being repaired, yes.</span> <span id="s1262">But look how long it is after the Holocaust, how long it took, yes.</span> <span id="s1263">I mean, that’s the astonishing thing, yes.</span> <span id="s1264">And -- and still, I don’t think there is enough about the victims, oddly enough.</span> <span id="s1265">What they felt, what they thought.</span> <span id="s1266">We know a lot about the perpetrators, but a -- again, not enough, because Holocaust scholars have been either historians or English professors.</span> <span id="s1267">If they’re English professors, they go in for the literary.</span> <span id="s1268">If they’re historians, they go in for the instrumental.</span> <span id="s1269">But what about the mindset of these people, yes?</span> <span id="s1270">There are some, but not an awful lot on that sort of stuff.</span> <span id="s1271">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">Q: How would you suggest someone do that sort of work, given that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A: Well, it’s very difficult to do, but you’d have to go through it, you’d have to look at their background, you’d have to look at -- you know, to see if there’s anything in the documents that can tell you anything.</span> <span id="s1274">What analogies they made, let’s say, during the killing process.</span> <span id="s1275">What do you think they were doing?</span> <span id="s1276">And you’ll find that they made analogies.</span> <span id="s1277">That’s just one thing, I mean, there are many others, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: Do you think there’s something almost too frightening to really look at the victims, and to really look at the perpetrators --</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: -- that instrumentalities are easier in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: That may very well be true.</span> <span id="s1282">I think -- I don’t think that, for example is true to Hilberg, who was purely instrumentalities -- a very important book, I mean, the first -- but no, I don’t think that’s true, necessarily, no, no.</span> <span id="s1283">It’s pretty abstracted.</span> <span id="s1284">I mean, it’s awful, it’s frightening, but -- but a -- I don’t think that’s really the main reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: What do you think it is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: I don’t know why, the omission of women is clear, that somehow in our culture that’s a very deep stream, that men do these things, women don’t do this, yes.</span> <span id="s1287">I think it’s -- in a way it’s as simple as that, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: You mean in terms of the perpetrators, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1290">Women don’t do these things, it’s not a womanly thing to do.</span> <span id="s1291">So, I think there you have to look at the stereotypes and things that go with, yes.</span> <span id="s1292">With the women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: But what about looking at women victims?</span> <span id="s1294">That’s also been neglected.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: Yes, that’s been very much neglected, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1296">In fact, nobody -- looking at victims is very difficult.</span> <span id="s1297">Most of them can’t speak to us any more, yeah.</span> <span id="s1298">And the others that do speak, you know it better than I do.</span> <span id="s1299">But yes, there isn’t an awful lot on victims.</span> <span id="s1300">Victims are shown being victims.</span> <span id="s1301">But what they thought, what they felt and so on, that’s -- that’s not there, you know.</span> <span id="s1302">Or that it was tougher for women than for men, which I well believe.</span> <span id="s1303">That’s not there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: [indecipherable] you believe that.</span> <span id="s1305">Why do you think that’s so?</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: Well, I don’t know, I just feel it.</span> <span id="s1307">Because, I mean, women have other needs than men at times, and things like that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: Have you interviewed victims as well as perpetrators?</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: No, no, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: Did you -- did you ever meet anyone who was on a Jewish Council?</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A: No -- yeah, well, Guttman, of course.</span> <span id="s1312">No, he wasn’t on the Council, was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: No, I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1315">I don’t know what it would be.</span> <span id="s1316">That I would find very uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s1317">There I -- with Hannah Arendt, I mean, she was dead wrong about it, dead wrong, but I still somehow feel like it, but that’s very -- I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: You think she was wrong?</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: When -- what she said about Jews, yes</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: About the Jewish -- the Jewish [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: Oh yes, yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1322">They were very brave and courageous people.</span> <span id="s1323">That was not an easy thing to do, and Hannah Arendt is absolutely crazy about that.</span> <span id="s1324">What would she have it, no councils?</span> <span id="s1325">It would have been -- it couldn’t have been worse, but it would have been quicker, it would have been -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1326">At least the councils did something, even if they only postponed the death of one person, it would already be justified.</span> <span id="s1327">I have a great respect for the Councils, but I think what they did was so horrible, and took so much courage, that I would really be uncomfortable in their presence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">Q: What about somebody like Gens in -- in Wilno --</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Q: -- who also wouldn’t help the resistance in many ways, or would denounce people.</span> <span id="s1331">I mean, when you have situations like that, does that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">A: Well, you’d have to look at it.</span> <span id="s1333">I mean, I -- I can see -- I mean, if it’s a less evil to prevent a greater one, in such an extreme situation, I could see that.</span> <span id="s1334">Anyway --</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: So you’re much more sympathetic, even though it might be difficult to talk to somebody who [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: Yes, I am sympathetic because first all, it’s a situation which I can’t really grasp.</span> <span id="s1337">I can grasp almost everything about the Holocaust, but that situation I find very difficult to grasp.</span> <span id="s1338">And second of all, I -- I don’t know what I would have done in such a situation.</span> <span id="s1339">I mean, you can’t really criticize people who are put in such a position in such a time, you know?</span> <span id="s1340">I must assume they did their best, ‘cause they had -- they -- they had nothing to gain by not doing their best, in a sense.</span> <span id="s1341">Sure, they didn’t support the resistance, and they didn’t support the uprisings and so on, probably because they thought they would fail, I mean, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: What do you think about the arguments about was there resistance, wasn’t there resistance, was there enough resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A: Oh, I think they’re -- they’re jejune, they’re -- they’re -- they’re -- they’re -- first of all they have a lot to do with a book I’ve just finished on masculinity, you know.</span> <span id="s1344">Like Bettelheim says in his book, The Informed Heart, why did they di -- why weren’t they men?</span> <span id="s1345">Why did they die this way?</span> <span id="s1346">You know?</span> <span id="s1347">That itself shows a historical stereotype, yes.</span> <span id="s1348">I mean, that’s silly.</span> <span id="s1349">I mean, what do you expect them to do?</span> <span id="s1350">Yes?</span> <span id="s1351">I mean, that just shows they have no grasp what it was about, they have no grasp how people behave under such circumstances.</span> <span id="s1352">They have no grasp about the circumstances, yes.</span> <span id="s1353">And they are completely caught up in -- in war images, like the perpetrators, they have that in common with the perpetrators, both think of this as war.</span> <span id="s1354">One thinks a war against the Jews, the other thinks the Jews have behaved like soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: Or should have behaved like --</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">A: Yeah, should have -- so this is where both are -- I think both are -- are to be condemned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: There’s something about how you understand things, it’s not just that you understand them from a cultural perspective --</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: -- but you really attempt to understand things from the way people, ordinary people perceive, taking [indecipherable] their lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: Yes, I try, I try, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: I try.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: And some of the people you’re criticizing, like Hannah Arendt --</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: -- certainly had an incredibly elitist point of view about --</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: Yes, quite right, quite right, but this doesn’t keep them from having insights.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">A: No, my hist -- kind of history I do might really be called a history of perceptions, that’s what I would think cause I believe people act on their perceptions, and their perceptions sometimes have very little to do with reality.</span> <span id="s1369">I used to say to my students, you know, fo -- you also live by perceptions, cause if you saw yourself as you really are, you would commit suicide.</span> <span id="s1370">You know, thank God we don’t see each other as we really are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: But if we live by our perceptions, which I think is probably true a lot of the time --</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: -- how do we get to see some reality so that we don’t move in the directions that we’ve seen --</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: You per --</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: -- like genocide, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: -- yeah, your perceptions are, however, also informed by reality.</span> <span id="s1377">I mean, that depends on the person.</span> <span id="s1378">If they are formed by reality, you know what happened, you try to move away from it, obviously, yes.</span> <span id="s1379">But the whole world is now perceptions: what do we know about the people who rule over us?</span> <span id="s1380">What do we know about anything?</span> <span id="s1381">We don’t, it’s all mediated, yeah.</span> <span id="s1382">It all plays on our perceptions, or tries to manipulate them.</span> <span id="s1383">So that’s nothing new, you might say that that kind of fascist liturgy and so on was really the beginning of modern politics, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q: Of images.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A: Yeah, politics through images, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q: Does the contemporary war in the former Yugoslavia surprise you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">A: Oh no.</span> <span id="s1388">It was always the case there.</span> <span id="s1389">That’s why I am not with the Bosnians, cause I don’t believe in small political units, I believe in large political units.</span> <span id="s1390">If you divide the Balkans up again, you’re going to have nothing but war, was quite clear.</span> <span id="s1391">Every unit has claims against every other.</span> <span id="s1392">So the only thing is to have them all in one big -- like Yugoslavia, one big federal system.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">End of Tape One, Side
