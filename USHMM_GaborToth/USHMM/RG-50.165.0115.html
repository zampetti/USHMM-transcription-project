part of the time we were in Queens, part of the time in Manhattan.</span> <span id="s42">We stayed in the New Orleans Hotel, near Columbus and 81st Street.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">WH: What were American kids like to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">ST: I think they were curious but I had nothing in common with them.</span> <span id="s45">There were no kids from Europe in my classes.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">WH: Were your years in Ecuador happy?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">ST: I think it was happy.</span> <span id="s48">I was with my family.</span> <span id="s49">We lived in Quito.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">WH: Did your parents identify Jewishly in Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">ST: They were, uh, Jewish.</span> <span id="s52">They spoke both German and Czech.</span> <span id="s53">The Czech- speaking Czechs were more assimilated.</span> <span id="s54">They went to services every Friday night in Quito.</span> <span id="s55">My father was very religious.</span> <span id="s56">He was a Conservative Jew.</span> <span id="s57">He observed the Sabbath.</span> <span id="s58">He didn’t ride on the Sabbath or smoke.</span> <span id="s59">My mother was not religious but she respected him and kept a kosher home.</span> <span id="s60">My father was a butcher.</span> <span id="s61">One day a week he koshered his store and sold kosher food.</span> <span id="s62">The rabbi slaughtered the meat.</span> <span id="s63">We have had many kosher friends come to dinner and my mother explained to me how to do it.</span> <span id="s64">Like how to put a knife into the earth to</span></p> <p><span id="s65">make it kosher.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">WH: Did he continue identifying once he came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">ST: Yes.</span> <span id="s68">But he only lived for three years after coming here.</span> <span id="s69">He was 57 when he died.</span> <span id="s70">My mother never remarried although she was in her forties then.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">WH: Where did you go to high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">ST: Washington Irving High School.</span> <span id="s73">We lived in Woodside, Queens.</span> <span id="s74">Afterwards I went to F.I.T. I designed children’s clothing for twenty years, for Healthtex.</span> <span id="s75">I designed the materials, styles.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">WH: And where did you meet Bill?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">ST: At the Village Independent Democratic Club, Koch’s old club.</span> <span id="s78">This was the election (1964) that turned Koch into a public official, running against Di Sapio, where he won by 41 votes.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">WH: What was Bill doing there?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">ST: He was a journalist and actually was a journalist at the age of eight, working for his father.</span> <span id="s81">His father had his own newspapers down South.</span> <span id="s82">He won an award given him by Eisenhower at Columbia University for having the best high school newspaper.</span> <span id="s83">He was the editor; it was in Durham, North Carolina.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">WH: Are you involved in the Jewish community today?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">ST: No, not in a sense of belonging to a synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">WH: What about political involvements?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">ST: Most of my involvements at this point are through Bill.</span> <span id="s88">I don’t belong to organizations.</span> <span id="s89">I’m more of a loner.</span> <span id="s90">I’m interested in art and music.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">WH: Did your mother say anything about the fact that you were marrying someone black and not Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">ST: Well, she was not very happy about it.</span> <span id="s93">She would certainly have preferred for me to marry a nice Jewish boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">WH: You had to be very strong to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">ST: I was not a youngster anymore when I got married.</span> <span id="s96">I was 32 and I was determined to make up my own mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">WH: This was 1966, the height of the Civil Rights Movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">ST: Some people were against the marriage, but it’s something that Bill and I went into very consciously.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">WH: Does it result in appreciating different people more?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">ST: Sure.</span> <span id="s101">It’s an experience a lot of people have.</span> <span id="s102">They always say that on TV interviews.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">WH: Do you think Black-Jewish relations will improve or deteriorate in the future?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">ST: I think things are bad right now.</span> <span id="s105">Things are anti-Jewish and anti-Black and I live in both worlds.</span> <span id="s106">And I think it’s going to get a lot worse before it gets better.</span> <span id="s107">I think the skinheads and the temperament of the government is not conducive to good relationships.</span> <span id="s108">And it’s going to get worse.</span> <span id="s109">I just have a very bad feeling.</span> <span id="s110">I’m very distressed because very few people see it.</span> <span id="s111">And a Holocaust could happen again.</span> <span id="s112">It’s going to be very different from the way it was before.</span> <span id="s113">It’s not going to be possible for it to happen the same way again.</span> <span id="s114">It’s going to be both against blacks and against Jews.</span> <span id="s115">And it’s in the air.</span> <span id="s116">There was an article about hate group propaganda in Midwestern jails.</span> <span id="s117">It’s so widespread it’s incredible.</span> <span id="s118">It’s not going to be concentration camps, but it may just be a bloodbath.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">WH: Do you see it in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">ST: I see the angry kids.</span> <span id="s121">I see the kids who aren’t learning anything in school.</span> <span id="s122">And the unemployment, which leads to more hatred.</span> <span id="s123">Then white supremacists say, “Those jobs belong to me.</span> <span id="s124">My kids have to eat and yours don’t.</span> <span id="s125">You’re trash; you’re a Jew.</span> <span id="s126">You don’t deserve that job; you’re black.”</span></p> <p><span id="s127">WH: How about Dinkins?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">ST: Somebody did a poll and people said they felt there has been no improvement in race relations since he’s been in.</span> <span id="s129">Of course, he’s been in for a very short time.</span> <span id="s130">I think there was a relief when he was elected.</span> <span id="s131">And I think he’ll improve race relations.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">WH: How could Black-Jewish relations be improved?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">ST: I think it goes back to people just getting to know each other.</span> <span id="s134">We had a coalition with Bill, Dinkins and Rabbi Brickner, but it just stopped after a while.</span> <span id="s135">When Bill spoke, people were fine until he spoke about Jesse Jackson, because of his relationship with Arafat.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">WH: Do you think Jackson’s anti-Semitic?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">ST: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s138">Again, it goes back to knowing someone personally.</span> <span id="s139">I don’t know whether he has a relationship with Arafat, but embracing him doesn’t mean Jackson is anti-Semitic.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">WH: He’s a politician.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">ST: Right.</span> <span id="s142">I don’t know him personally.</span> <span id="s143">I’ve met him.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">WH: Then there was the “Hymie” comment.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">ST: We had never heard of “Hymie” before.</span> <span id="s146">They wanted an excuse to hang somebody.</span> <span id="s147">It as the “needle in the haystack.”</span> <span id="s148">Sometimes the same people that either hate or love blacks, have a black maid and they say meine schvartze “my wonderful black maid.”</span> <span id="s149">And I can’t imagine that someone would say, “I hate blacks” or “I love blacks.”</span> <span id="s150">It’s such a relative thing.</span> <span id="s151">If you say you hate blacks, say you hate people.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">WH: Did you ever experience racism?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">ST: Not with Bill except for an occasional cab not stopping.</span> <span id="s154">But in California, in Eagle Rock, Los Angeles, I experienced racism one summer living there, because my daughter is black.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">WH: Do you identify in any way with the survivor community?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">ST: Well, I identified with my mother’s friends when she was alive and with their kids.</span> <span id="s157">There was a Masaryk Club for Czech Jews and non-Jews.</span> <span id="s158">The parents started the club and we and the other kids used to go once a week to the Empire Hotel near Lincoln Center on Broadway.</span> <span id="s159">We went to Central Park, to the Palisades.</span> <span id="s160">The club had a lot to do with not being accepted elsewhere.</span> <span id="s161">Like I didn’t have any friends.</span> <span id="s162">And we all had a common background.</span> <span id="s163">I formed a friendship with someone I met in 1948 who is still my friend today.</span> <span id="s164">She lives in Canada.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">WH: Did you feel that Americans looked down on the refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">ST: They just had nothing in common with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">WH: How might your experiences have influenced the way you see things?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">ST: My husband has said I have a very different sense of justice.</span> <span id="s169">He also says I want to find good in everyone and that I refuse to be critical.</span> <span id="s170">I get very upset about things that are not fair.</span> <span id="s171">My brother, who’s a year older, has it too.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">WH: What about what’s going on in Israel?</span> <span id="s173">You’ve been there?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">ST: Yes.</span> <span id="s175">I had a very good impression of the country.</span> <span id="s176">I felt, maybe, it could be home.</span> <span id="s177">I don’t feel that I have a home because I was torn from what my home would have been in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s178">I felt it could be home if I would give it a chance, if I would settle there.</span> <span id="s179">That the people would be more like I am.</span> <span id="s180">I know a lot of Israelis here.</span> <span id="s181">I just get that feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">WH: If you were living in Israel what would you do politically?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">ST: I would probably be in Peace Now.</span> <span id="s184">We had a marvelous experience there during Operation Moses and we saw the absorption centers.</span> <span id="s185">The problem was that they were farmers in Ethiopia and they gave them industrial jobs in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">WH: How does your daughter identify?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">ST: She has difficulty, not because she is Jewish, but because she’s in a very white school, St. Lawrence University, and she does not relate to the black community, even though she’s black.</span> <span id="s188">What I’m hoping is she’s going to be able to walk from one community to another, like my husband is able to do.</span> <span id="s189">She feels Jewish on Hanukkah and Christian on Christmas.</span> <span id="s190">She definitely identifies as a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">WH: Do you ever go to Temple?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">ST: Less now that I used to.</span> <span id="s193">I went more before my father died.</span> <span id="s194">After he died I had a nasty experience with the temple that turned me off.</span> <span id="s195">A stupid rabbi who, on Yom Kippur, told the congregation that they should be ashamed of themselves for not buying a ticket for the services and that we were in the temple by the good graciousness of all the parishioners who paid to be there but left so we could come in.</span> <span id="s196">It was a temple in Woodside on 75th Street.</span> <span id="s197">We never knew about buying a ticket until we came here.</span> <span id="s198">I didn’t go for years, not until Rabbi Brickner invited my mother and I.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">WH: Did your mother come to terms with the fact that you married Bill?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">ST: Oh, she loved Bill.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">WH: What was the wedding like?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">ST: We had a small ceremony in a judge’s chambers.</span> <span id="s203">Then we had a small party in my mother’s house, and then we gave a party the day after.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">WH: Why send your daughter to such a white school?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">ST: We didn’t know it would be so tough.</span> <span id="s206">Now we’d like her to attend a more cosmopolitan school.</span> <span id="s207">And she said an interesting thing the other day.</span> <span id="s208">She said, “Maybe I’ll go to a black school.”</span></p> <p><span id="s209">WH: That would be a switch.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">ST: Oh, it would be a wonderful thing.</span> <span id="s211">She meant a place like Howard or Lincoln.</span> <span id="s212">She’s dyslexic, went to Hunter High School for a while.</span> <span id="s213">I think she should have gone to Music and Art.</span> <span id="s214">(At this point Susan’s daughter calls and I help her pick a title for a library research project on a community.</span> <span id="s215">My choice: the Hasidic community of Williamsburg.</span> <span id="s216">She also tells me about an Orthodox Jewish friend whose parents think he’s observant but who really isn’t.)</span></p> <p><span id="s217">WH: Do you believe in God?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">ST: No.</span> <span id="s219">If there is a God, I don’t think he would have allowed the Holocaust to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">WH: Where were all the good people during the war?</span> <span id="s221">How were the Nazis able to act like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">ST: I have to let you know also that it’s very difficult for me to kill a fly.</span> <span id="s223">So I can’t understand people who can take a human life.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">WH: Someone said to me, you’ll pardon me for repeating it, that the Amsterdam News is an anti-Semitic paper.</span> <span id="s225">And I fail to see how if someone is married to someone Jewish, is conscious of the issues, has Jewish friends, goes to Israel all the time, he could be anti-Semitic.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">ST: Well, he’s not.</span> <span id="s227">Ed Koch made him anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s228">Ed Koch is the one that’s spreading that word about him.</span> <span id="s229">When Bill was involved in the Jewish-Black coalition Ed Koch accused him of being a cabal.</span> <span id="s230">Bill is nowhere near being anti-Semitic.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">WH: Well, it does sound ludicrous and when I said that to the person, he said there are anti-Semitic articles in the paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">ST: So, look at The New York Times.</span> <span id="s233">(She laughs.)</span></p> <p><span id="s234">WH: You know who likes him?</span> <span id="s235">Jerry Lippmann, who runs a truly independent newspaper on Long Island, The Long Island Jewish World.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">ST: Bill was actually threatened by Farrakhan and had to have protection for three months from 24-hour detectives.</span> <span id="s237">My daughter was taken to school every day by a detective.</span> <span id="s238">Just like Dinkins was threatened by him.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">At this point Bill Tatum returned.</span> <span id="s240">He was incensed at the suggestion that he or his paper might be anti-Semitic and vigorously defended himself.</span> <span id="s241">“I’ve published a piece by Israeli Consul Uri Savir just last week on Black-Jewish relations.</span> <span id="s242">Koch spread that story about me.”</span> <span id="s243">He then criticized Israel for its actions saying, “Israel had better get its act together.</span> <span id="s244">Peace is breaking out all over.</span> <span id="s245">If not why should they get three billion a year in aid while black Africa gets only 400 million?”</span> <span id="s246">Then, returning to the other subject, he quipped, “Yeah I married my wife to get back at the Jewish people.”</span> <span id="s247">He then described how he had gone to Bitburg where his friend Elie Wiesel had sharply rebuked Ronald Reagan.</span> <span id="s248">He inveighed at length about the outrage of Bitburg.</span> <span id="s249">He was clearly establishing that, while he might be critical of Jews or Israel in certain areas, he was definitely highly sympathetic to the Jewish people in general.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span id="s251">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s252">USHMM Archives RG-50.165*0115</span></p> <p><span
