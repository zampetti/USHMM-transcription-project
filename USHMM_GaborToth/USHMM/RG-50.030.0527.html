id="s13">Thank you very, very much, Mrs. Ustjanauskas for coming and talking to us.</span> <span id="s14">This is going to be a very broad story with many different components, and many different people who are in it.</span> <span id="s15">It will be a -- a glimpse into at least what happened with one person in a very tough part of the world, in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s16">And I would like to start, as we often do, at the very beginning.</span> <span id="s17">I’d like to find out about your background, where you were born, the family you were born into, the details about your early life.</span> <span id="s18">So let us start with that.</span> <span id="s19">Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Answer: Smalininkai.</span> <span id="s21">Smalininkai.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: And is that a village or a town?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: I would call it a little town.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: And where is it close to?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: It’s close -- it’s on the German border.</span> <span id="s26">My birth certificate is in German and in Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s27">It was like a style in those days, you had a baby born in Germany, and my mother was on the way to Germany.</span> <span id="s28">Right on the border, I was born.</span> <span id="s29">She didn’t make it to the German border, but as I say, my birth certificate is both in German and in Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s30">So we have no idea about Smalininkai, we didn’t live there.</span> <span id="s31">She just happened to be traveling through.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: And your birth date is?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: October 9, 1926.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: And where was your mother coming from?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: At that time my father was teaching in the high school, Jewish high school in Jurbarkas.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: That’s where she came from, from Jurbarkas to have me in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about -- first of all, Smalininkai was still a Lithuanian territory village or town, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Border town.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: It was a border town --</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Border town.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: -- but it did not belong to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s45">And was it -- can you tell me a little bit about the -- the border was to what part of Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Prussy?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Prussia.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Prussia.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Prussia, okay.</span> <span id="s50">Then let’s go back to Jurbarkas.</span> <span id="s51">What did -- what kind of a place was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s53">It’s a town.</span> <span id="s54">I was rem -- I remember being there with high school for literary competition, I believe.</span> <span id="s55">It was a small town in Lithuania, not a big town.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Was it close to Kaunas?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Was it close to [indecipherable] city?</span> <span id="s59">No?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s61">We -- I remember we took a river boat to go to Jurbarkas.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: So you don’t have any memories of --</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: No, none whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s65">Tell me a little bit about your earliest memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Kaunas.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Father was attending -- at the same time he was teaching, he was attending university, and the only way of communication at that time was taking a riverboat.</span> <span id="s69">It was too strenuous, too long.</span> <span id="s70">So he decided to move to Kaunas to attend his studies.</span> <span id="s71">So, what I remember first, I remember my kindergarten.</span> <span id="s72">And in those days, what was known in -- not known in United States, but it was very well known in Lithuania, Montessori system kindergarten.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Oh, you were in the Montessori system?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Montessori system, and the person who had -- who was the leading person was Professor [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: She started that.</span> <span id="s77">From the Montessori, I went to German kindergarten.</span> <span id="s78">And when my mother brought me to school to enter me into the first grade and they checked my abilities, they told my mother that, you know, your child doesn’t belong in first grade.</span> <span id="s79">In first grade we use matches to count.</span> <span id="s80">Your daughter can write and read and count.</span> <span id="s81">We should put her into second grade, but she is too young, she is only four and a half years old.</span> <span id="s82">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: So what did they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: -- to make a long story short, I finish high school at 14 and a half.</span> <span id="s85">I jumped three years in the meantime.</span> <span id="s86">I never discuss it because it’s not very believable and there were only two cases in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s87">One was Kutraga, Dr. Kutraga’s son, he was 15 and a half, I was 14 and a half.</span> <span id="s88">But when we came to United States, it just happened that the principal of my high school and my first teacher lived in Hartford.</span> <span id="s89">I never talked about myself, but they told everybody.</span> <span id="s90">So they s -- this is no mystery any more, you know, no secret any more.</span> <span id="s91">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: But you went from Montessori school to a German kindergarten?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: We’ll come to your schooling in a little while --</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Now --</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: -- I’d like to come back to that.</span> <span id="s97">But your first memories are of this Montessori school.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Yeah, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Do you have any picture in your mind of --</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Oh yes, I remember.</span> <span id="s101">I remember, for example, during the bell, we were too small, there was a little wooden block, we could stop the -- step on the block, ring the bell by ourselves.</span> <span id="s102">We were to be -- to take our clothes -- coats by ourselves, hang it on a peg, the pegs were lower.</span> <span id="s103">Everything we had to do ourselves, and I don’t remember too much about the activities, I just remember that I hated to drink cocoa because it had a skin of milk on the top.</span> <span id="s104">That I remember very well.</span> <span id="s105">So, we’re coming now to the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Elementary school.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: They told my mother that they are a little bit worried that at my age I’ll start, but the-they told her, don’t worry, if we see that she is falling behind, we’ll just very naturally, gradually put her back, one year backwards.</span> <span id="s110">Well, it never came to that.</span> <span id="s111">So I finished second grade, I finished third grade, and then I took exams to high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: And this was you were still in the German school?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: No, that was already Marija Pečkauskaitė gymnasium.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: So that was a Lithuanian school.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: It was a Lithuanian school.</span> <span id="s116">It was private.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Expensive, and I went through it.</span> <span id="s119">Now, after I took the exams to first class, I continued at that school.</span> <span id="s120">In Lithuanian language it was called pono gymnasium.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Pono?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Pono.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s124">And how would you translate that?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Well, we had the children of -- our cabinet minister’s children, heads of department children, children of very rich people.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: So, the elite?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Elite, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: The elite.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Elite, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: So it wasn’t the of-official name of the school --</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: No, it was not official --</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: -- it was the unofficial name of the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: -- it was unofficial name of the school.</span> <span id="s134">In those days the government high schools, were charging 100 litas per year.</span> <span id="s135">In our school it was 400.</span> <span id="s136">So not everybody was able to afford it.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Let me take -- stop at that moment for a moment, because that begs a lot of questions, and then we’ll go back a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: And th -- because the question, the first one is, how is it your family could afford it?</span> <span id="s140">And then the question that comes after that is, who was your family?</span> <span id="s141">So let’s go back to mother and father.</span> <span id="s142">Can you tell me a little bit about your mother?</span> <span id="s143">Who she was, where she was born, what her name was, what her family was like.</span> <span id="s144">And the same then for your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Mama’s father left Lithuania during the Tsar’s occupation.</span> <span id="s146">We don’t know too much, we just know that in those years, the Tsar used to send people for bringing illegal literature, from Germany, from Prussia to Lithuania.</span> <span id="s147">And many people tried to escape when they knew that it came close to being arrested, they es -- mostly escaped either to United States, or to South America.</span> <span id="s148">He left Lithuania and he settled in Montevideo, Uruguay.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: How many brothers and sisters did she have?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: She had one sister and two brothers.</span> <span id="s151">After awhile her father took the youngest brother to Montevideo, Uruguay, and a sister and a brother stayed in Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: She was born when?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: Mama was born 1900.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: And her name was?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: El-Elvera.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s157">And her last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A:

used here.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Was she the youngest, the oldest?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: She was the oldest.</span> <span id="s164">She was the oldest.</span> <span id="s165">What I know about Mama; Mama finished again an elite high school in Riga, Latvia.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: How could that be afforded if her father had left her mother with four -- three, four children and -- and had -- and had gone to Montevideo?</span> <span id="s167">How could the family afford --</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: 1900’s were Tsar’s time.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Tsar’s time.</span> <span id="s171">And it was call -- called Liktroich it’s a famous high school.</span> <span id="s172">Mama was fluent, but I

<p><span id="s182">Q: Well, excuse me, I must go back to the other question.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: When you say it was the Tsar’s time, nevertheless, she is a girl who comes from a family and we don’t know what kept that family going financially.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: I can’t answer.</span> <span id="s186">I don’t know whether the grandfather used to send something or not, tha -- I really have no idea.</span> <span id="s187">But they must have had means.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Because that -- that particular high school was like my high school, was elite high school and somehow they managed.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Now, because she worked in that famous Polish refugee commi -- assistance committee, that actually what later helped us to get to the west, that fact.</span> <span id="s192">Anyway, when Mama returned to

ceremonies, only --</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: But it see --</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: -- only religious ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: But it is am -- it is an interesting kind of irony, if you were born in a border town that is still within the territory of the state of Lithuania, yet your birth certificate is in German --</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: German --</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: -- and it’s civil.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: It’s a little bit strange.</span> <span id="s313">Something --</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: It’s -- it is strange.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: You don’t have it usually, because it -- today you could -- you don’t have it in Lithuania any more, it’s not that the church gives you birth certificate.</span> <span id="s317">Today it -- you go to city hall and get it.</span> <span id="s318">But in those days Lithuania didn’t have it.</span> <span id="s319">So that’s why I escaped all that, you know, big issue.</span> <span id="s320">It never bothered me, and it never bothered my paper -- parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: So you didn’t -- you didn’t go to any Catholic religious --</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: -- classes, you never went to any --</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: -- Jewish classes.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: We had -- we had -- we had the acr -- rabbi, we had the Lutheran and we had the Orthodox and we have Roman Catholic priests teaching at the high school.</span> <span id="s327">The -- quite a few of us stayed away from religious -- not only Jewish children who were in school, but also the -- we had some Orthodox, we had some of a -- Lutherans, who didn’t attend either.</span> <span id="s328">So we just spent that hour, you know, waiting outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Oh, so you’re saying in the public schools, there was a li -- religious class, is that ri --</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: And whatever religion you happened to belong to --</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: You had to -- you -- you -- if you wanted, you had --</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Did your parents tell you the story of how they met?</span> <span id="s336">Did you ever learn --</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Okay, so tell us the story of how they met.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: It -- I ha -- I remember Mama telling that my father approached her, and she had -- she didn’t know him at all, and she was kind of trying to -- not get rid of him, but tried not to get into a conversation, there was -- there was no proper introduction or anything.</span> <span id="s340">And he was very persistent.</span> <span id="s341">She had no idea about his nationality or his religion or anything.</span> <span id="s342">And somehow -- somehow they started to date.</span> <span id="s343">I know only one thing, that at that time my father was engaged.</span> <span id="s344">And Mama only told me that she remembers looking through the window, seeing grandmother come to that place where h-he was stationed at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: His mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: His mother.</span> <span id="s347">And she -- he told her la -- later on that she was trying to persuade him to drop -- see -- whoever he is seeing and come back to Siauliai when he’ll be able and to stay with his fiancé.</span> <span id="s348">She did not persuade him.</span> <span id="s349">I don’t know Mama’s year of marriage, but if I was born in ’26, probably must have been married somewhere around ’24 - ’23.</span> <span id="s350">You see, in those days, in Lithuania, I think in the entire country, you couldn’t count to 10 to find mixed marriages.</span> <span id="s351">It was very, very unusual.</span> <span id="s352">It was even worse than in those days in United States if you had a black and white marriage.</span> <span id="s353">It was unheard of.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: So this is --</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: It was unheard of.</span> <span id="s356">I think what -- what make my mother decide to -- to do it, first of all, I would describe him as -- not as a Jew in Lithuania, but a Lithuanian of Jewish extraction.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Is that how she saw him?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: No, she saw him who he is, but I mean, that made it easier to get into the marriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: For her?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: For her, I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: And for him?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: For him?</span> <span id="s363">They were not religious people, so that didn’t mean anything.</span> <span id="s364">And what they did, they also have a German marriage certificate.</span> <span id="s365">They did the same thing when I was born, but by coincidence over there, they did the same thing --</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: So where did they marry?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: They married also on the border, with a German document.</span> <span id="s368">So they didn’t have to use either religion for their marriage certificate.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: So it was a civil ceremony?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: Civil ceremony.</span> <span id="s371">Lithuania didn’t have it.</span> <span id="s372">That eliminated changing the religions, either this or that, and so we lived happily ever after.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: But let me get back to this a little bit.</span> <span id="s374">Even if the families were not particularly religious, and your parents were not particularly li -- religious, you mentioned that your paternal grandmother had tried to dissuade your father from marrying your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Yes, but his fiancé was also Lithuanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: So that -- that was not an issue of religion, that was an issue, don’t drop --</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Don’t drop the first one.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s382">Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: And were -- were your parents accepted by the in-laws?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s385">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s386">My father’s -- my grandfather on Father’s side adored my mother.</span> <span id="s387">Adored.</span> <span id="s388">I mean, exactly in the word, adored my mother.</span> <span id="s389">Mama helped to put his brothers through universities.</span> <span id="s390">Mama took them in.</span> <span id="s391">They stayed a long time with us.</span> <span id="s392">And on Mother’s side there was exactly the same situation.</span> <span id="s393">Exactly the same situation.</span> <span id="s394">You mentioned before my father’s brother.</span> <span id="s395">My mother’s brother found my father’s brother in Vilnius on the street.</span> <span id="s396">That’s how we got in touch.</span> <span id="s397">So it’s -- it’s a -- they were very close.</span> <span id="s398">Both families were very close.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: I’m a little confused about this incident of finding one another on the street.</span> <span id="s400">At what year are you talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: They went 40 -- what is it, 40 -- 40-something?</span> <span id="s402">When he came from Vorkuta.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Oh, you’re [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: Okay, so you’re talking about after the war now --</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: After the war, right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: -- where they found one another.</span> <span id="s408">Let’s still stay in the 1920’s, and did you know your maternal grandmother?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: And so you spent time with your mother’s side of the family as well as your father’s side of the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Well, my mother’s side of the family was in Kaunas.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Ah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s416">It’s only my father family who was in Siauliai.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s418">So you moved from Jurbarkas to Kaunas --</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: To Kaunas.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: -- with your father --</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: -- as he finished his studies.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: All right, so he was -- he was going to university as you were growing up.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s427">What was -- are there any memories of your childhood with your greater family together, with your -- with your grandparents, with your uncles, with your aunts, anything that you can ti -- that you remember, that sticks out?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Well, during the Easter break, my father’s family always had a Seder.</span> <span id="s429">Even so, the youngest uncle couldn’t stop laughing during the ceremony, but it was there.</span> <span id="s430">I remember big, big crates of matzo, silver dishes which were stored from year to year, I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: So you participated?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Oh absolutely.</span> <span id="s433">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s434">During Christmas, I remember that their neighbors had all this very big Christmas celebration, they were Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s435">So I spent a lot of time for Christmas with the neighbors who had children my own age.</span> <span id="s436">Otherwise I just loved going to Siauliai to be pampered by three uncles and grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: And your uncles were younger?</span> <span id="s438">They were all younger brothers of your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: They were younger brothers.</span> <span id="s440">When I was finishing attending last years of high school, the youngest brother was a student in Belgium.</span> <span id="s441">So the age difference was not such a shocking one, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s443">Well, thank you, we will go to the -- End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: Well, it’s unusual.</span> <span id="s446">It’s -- it’s unusual what you describe, because there is a certain irony, or let’s say contradiction.</span> <span id="s447">On the one hand, in your family, both your very nuclear family of your mother and your father, and then the larger, extended family, you say that there was a great deal of closeness and that the in-laws liked the other partner very, very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: But in the larger society, you’re saying you could count on the fingers of -- of both hands how many couples were in mixed marriages.</span> <span id="s450">So how do you explain that?</span> <span id="s451">How do you explain th-th-they got on so well within, but were in an environment that was very unlikely?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Well, there is a -- two words in Lithuanian terminology.</span> <span id="s453">The words are Savanoris-Kurejas.</span> <span id="s454">These are the people who fought for Lithuanian’s independence and put Lithuania on the map.</span> <span id="s455">These people were privileged society.</span> <span id="s456">We had privileges.</span> <span id="s457">For example, if I would have chosen to go to a high school, free.</span> <span id="s458">My conservatory, music, was free.</span> <span id="s459">My ballet school, state ballet school, was free.</span> <span id="s460">They were given as many privileges as they could.</span> <span id="s461">Papa was one of the officers’ corps, who fought at the f -- with the famous first pulkas regiment, probably.</span> <span id="s462">They were one for all, all for one.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: So he was a Savanoris-Kurejas?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: Yes, was Savanoris-Kurejas, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: And what is the literal translation of those words?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: A volunteer -- oh, kurejas is -- e -- it doesn’t sound in -- in English it doesn’t make any sense.</span> <span id="s467">Here we understand volunteer army.</span> <span id="s468">They -- they were volunteers.</span> <span id="s469">They put their books in high school, they went to fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: They went to fight for the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Were there --</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: So he was accepted in the society as one of those volunteer fighters for Lithuanian independence, without any attachment of religion.</span> <span id="s474">And that officer’s corps, that solidarity that -- with the officers, later on proved how the solidarity worked between them.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s476">I see, so that was one of the reasons why your -- you were able to attend more elite schools as you were growing up, as you said, and -- and have some privileges, because of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: Well, I didn’t use privileges for the free high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: University was free, also.</span> <span id="s480">Even so, the other university students had to pay.</span> <span id="s481">All these volunteer fighters had privileges for their family.</span> <span id="s482">I didn’t use it.</span> <span id="s483">I just used it for the conservatory and for the ballet school, but I didn’t use it for the high school, and I was too young to use it for university.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: How is it that your father came to join the army and take part in this -- in these battles?</span> <span id="s485">What was the ethos, what was the -- the motivation that propelled him?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: I think it had to start with his parents.</span> <span id="s487">My grandmother Lithuanian was very strange dialect.</span> <span id="s488">We don’t talk in towns in that dialect.</span> <span id="s489">It’s a dialect --</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Your Jewish grandmother, you’re talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: My Jewish grandmother, yes.</span> <span id="s492">In translation we would call it lowlands, Zemaitji, or it’s normally, in geographical sense, it’s called Samogitia.</span> <span id="s493">She came from part of Lithuania closer to the Baltic Sea.</span> <span id="s494">And naturally we understand them, but they have a very heavy accent.</span> <span id="s495">Which is very pretty, by the way.</span> <span id="s496">And my grandmother, my father’s mother, taught me all old Lithuanian songs.</span> <span id="s497">All Lithuanian folklore things.</span> <span id="s498">It was I got from my father’s mother.</span> <span id="s499">My mother’s mother, again, came from St. Petersburg and Riga.</span> <span id="s500">She was not so much engrossed in Lithuanian, you know, language and so on.</span> <span id="s501">Everything I have, it’s from my father’s mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: That’s th -- also unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: That’s very unusual, but you see, that’s -- that’s what it is.</span> <span id="s504">I am the product of two -- two lenk -- two nationalities, two religions and I fit and -- in here, and I fit in here.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Were your grandparents though -- outside of your family, your lo -- your nuclear and your extended family, did your parents, or did you experience any kind of prejudice?</span> <span id="s506">Any kind of difficulties?</span> <span id="s507">Anything that made it awkward, that there was this Jewish Lithuanian union and that you were the child of it.</span> <span id="s508">Did they experience anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: They or me?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Both.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Neither.</span> <span id="s512">Neither.</span> <span id="s513">The only first time in 1942, I had a very good voice and the conductor in Vilnius in the symphony -- what we had in Vilnius, we had a musical outfit, I -- if I would know the name -- anyway, I joined the choir and the conductor was my music teacher in high school, and couple of days after we had rehearsals he met me on the street and he said, Ada, don’t come any more.</span> <span id="s514">I was told who you are.</span> <span id="s515">So be careful, and don’t come in any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: And this is during the war --</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: That -- that -- during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: When there’s already a ghetto --</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: -- in Vilnius.</span> <span id="s521">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Yeah, that was the first time that I experienced somebody telling that.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: But during your growing up years, before the war --</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Never, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Did it -- when you were with Lithuanians though, not Jewish Lithuanians, but Lithuanians, did you hear any kind of -- general kind of anecdotes or -- or sayings, or ways that would diminish, let’s say, somebody who was Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: You know what?</span> <span id="s527">The class of people that I attended the school with, was above it.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s529">So you say it -- it did exist, but not in the milieu that -- your circle --</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: -- you were in.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s534">Did your parents ever talk about such things, about any difficulties that they might have heard of, or any things that were harder for them to take because they were -- they had made other decisions?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: No.</span> <span id="s536">What helped a lot probably, is that Father always worked for Lithuanian institutions, [indecipherable] Ministeria, Minister of Justice.</span> <span id="s537">And then Lietukis, the organization -- do you know what Lietukis is?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: Tell us.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s540">It’s an organ -- it’s a association of Lithuanian co-ops.</span> <span id="s541">It was all over the country.</span> <span id="s542">Every little town, every village had a co-op.</span> <span id="s543">And that outfit had in their hands entire import and entire export of the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: It just so happened that my father was in the imports of oil, gas and my husband was in the other part of lithua -- export from Lithuania.</span> <span id="s546">It’s just a coincidence.</span> <span id="s547">So he always worked with Lithuania and France, and with -- he was always in that atmosphere.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: There are articles that are now appearing in -- in Lithuania that explore, for want of a better way of putting it, the rise of anti-Semitism in the 1930’s in the country.</span> <span id="s549">And a number of these articles talk about comp -- competition and a competitive kind of conflict of interest between organizations such as Lietukis and inde -- whether they would be Jewish independent [indecipherable] --</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: -- companies and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Absolutely correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Can you tell us a little bit about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: I can’t tell you too, too much, but I know that my father tried to introduce Lietukis to his Jewish -- to the people who had business in their hands, people who were Jewish.</span> <span id="s555">He was trying to explain that this is the country you’re in, let’s move more towards a Lithuanian site, doing business with Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s556">And you see, this is again in answer to your question did he ever feel, he was trying to get the -- to get the Jewish merchants take more merchandise from Lietukis.</span> <span id="s557">He was very much against using Russian language in Lithuan -- in Jewish society.</span> <span id="s558">He was very much against.</span> <span id="s559">He traveled all over Lithuania during the fin -- Finnish Soviet war, giving lectures --</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: In 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: -- right, giving lectures about the [indecipherable] Mannerheim’s fight with the Soviets.</span> <span id="s562">And from his side, he didn’t see himself as a Jew, he saw himself as a Lithuanian patriot, when you [indecipherable] those people.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: And did he talk about what kind of reaction this type -- these efforts were having?</span> <span id="s564">Did he make headroad?</span> <span id="s565">Were there -- were there some of his Jewish colleagues or friends who were not part of Lietukis who accepted it, or did he talk about what his experiences were?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: Well, it wasn’t easy to persuade.</span> <span id="s567">You know, the merchant is a merchant and they have their local how do you -- how would say it, local ways.</span> <span id="s568">But he managed, he managed to pull quite a few to buy from Lietukis.</span> <span id="s569">That what it was, buy from Lietukis.</span> <span id="s570">My father was an expert, he published a book which Mama was afraid to -- to keep around when the Soviets came, about the all kind of merchandise in connection with oils and gas.</span> <span id="s571">Everything connect -- in connection with that area.</span> <span id="s572">And that was his last work, absolutely.</span> <span id="s573">So that’s -- that’s all I can tell you.</span> <span id="s574">And he was the only Jewish person in the entire country in Lietukis, the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: And why would you think that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: Because nobody regarded him as a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: So if they ha-had regarded him as a Jew, he wouldn’t have been accepted?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: But he wa -- he was a Jew --</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: -- everybody knew it.</span> <span id="s581">But nobody -- nobody regarded him as a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: What I mean to say is if there had been somebody else who had been Jewish and did not have the same, let’s say, point of view as your -- your father, but had wanted to be part of Lietukis, would they have gotten such acceptance?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: And the reason being?</span> <span id="s585">A: Because he was a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: So there was anti-Semitism in the country, and quite --</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: Officially no.</span> <span id="s588">Officially no, but in the -- in -- for example, my father’s next brothers, Salomonis, Solomon, he was the only person in Lietuvos bankas, the bank of Lithuania.</span> <span id="s589">Again, another example.</span> <span id="s590">So you could get through, if you were accepted by Lithuanian community as one of ours.</span> <span id="s591">Not as a Russian talking Jewish person, which was the style of our Jewish population.</span> <span id="s592">That’s why it was so difficult to s-save sometimes, children, because they spoke Russian and they spoke Yiddish and they didn’t speak Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s593">That was a tragedy that really was an -- a very important factor.</span> <span id="s594">Many children could ha-have been saved.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: You’re talking now about the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s597">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: About the -- the ghetto and the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s599">Let me go back a little bit again to World War I just for a question.</span> <span id="s600">Your father joined the -- the military and fought for Lithuanian independence.</span> <span id="s601">Were there other Jewish people that you knew --</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: -- Jewish men that you knew --</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: -- who did the same?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s607">There was -- I don’t know the number, but I remember during the parades with -- when we used to have big military parades, it was suba -- [speaks Lithuanian here]</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Like I see in my -- you know, I saw a film in United States and my father was in that film, too.</span> <span id="s610">I see the -- I would ca -- probably say about -- about a hundred, they were all fighters for Lithuanian freedom.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: So this [speaks Lithuanian] would be translated as a Jewish --</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: The Jewish volunteers --</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: -- volunteers --</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: -- for Lithuanian independence.</span> <span id="s615">Were Jewish fighters.</span> <span id="s616">Jewish fighter, volunteers for Lithuanian independence.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: And there were at least a hundred people --</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: I -- I see -- I see the parade in -- I see in my eyes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: And that was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: It could have been more because the parades was always in Kaunas and there -- others in the other villages in other towns who probably -- not always used to come to Kaunas.</span> <span id="s621">But there was quite a few.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: I’m -- I mention this because the -- one of the charges of -- of Lithuanians against the Jewish community is that the Jewish community in Lithuania sided with the Soviets when 1940 came around.</span> <span id="s623">That’s the charge.</span> <span id="s624">And I remember talking to a number of survivors who would say there were people who fought for Lithuania’s independence, and that was not acknowledged, as they were being driven to the pits to be shot.</span> <span id="s625">Is that sort of experience, that -- can you address that at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: In life there are two groups of people.</span> <span id="s627">There are richer people, there are factory working element.</span> <span id="s628">Well, you cannot deny it, you have pictures, you see who stood in our main street accepting Soviet army.</span> <span id="s629">You see the pictures, you don’t have to be told.</span> <span id="s630">The people with red flags standing and greeting Soviet army were the element -- factory element.</span> <span id="s631">Jewish factory element.</span> <span id="s632">The people -- the richer element, in percentage, was deported to Siberia -- higher percentage than Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s633">I don’t mean number, I mean percentage.</span> <span id="s634">So now you adjust these two factors.</span> <span id="s635">No intelligent class was willing to huh, Soviets are here.</span> <span id="s636">That was not the case.</span> <span id="s637">The factory class, yes.</span> <span id="s638">What remembered in people’s memories are the red flags and who are the red flags.</span> <span id="s639">Only they, when those people stood with red flags, my father, Mama and I, we all worked -- walked to [speaks Lithuanian]</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: The War Museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: The War Museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: In Kaunas, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: Where for the last time -- I don’t know if you’re familiar, every evening the invalids came from the building, they paraded through the grounds and there was a ceremony.</span> <span id="s644">Whoever came to that, that day to the place, we were singing the Lithuanian national -- national anthem, everybody was crying.</span> <span id="s645">It was unbelievably mova -- m-moving scene.</span> <span id="s646">So you see, you can’t blame the -- you can’t blame the whole Jewish nation, same way you cannot blame the whole Lithuanian nation for what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: It is a bitter moment though, for those who would have been volunteers.</span> <span id="s648">It’s a bitter moment for everybody, but in particular the people who had volunteered for Lithuania’s independence to then be called traitors and not have that counted at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: I don’t know if you want to make a -- okay.</span> <span id="s650">Attorney Gornionskis from Kaunas --</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: -- was one of those.</span> <span id="s653">When the Soviets came, he took his f-family, moved to Vilnius.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: He was a Jewish volunteer for the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: I’ll tell you very quickly, because we are too far away.</span> <span id="s658">When the Lithuanian hapunes --</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: Who would this be?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: You had to be Lithuanian in those days.</span> <span id="s661">Hapune come from a word hapun.</span> <span id="s662">Hapun is to grab.</span> <span id="s663">They were called in Jewish language, hapunes.</span> <span id="s664">These were the Lithuanians with the white --</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Armbands?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: Armbands.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Balta raištį.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: Balta raištį.</span> <span id="s669">Came to his apartment and a Lithuanian officer was living in the same apartment and Lithuanian officer told him -- he was active officer in Lithuanian army at th -- th -- in those days, is that Mr. Gornionski, do not answer the door.</span> <span id="s670">They see my name on the door, don’t even come close to the door.</span> <span id="s671">And whatever, hide in my room and lock the door.</span> <span id="s672">Don’t even leave my room.</span> <span id="s673">When the hapunes came to the apartment, Mr. Gornionski put his wife and two children in the Lithuanian army officer’s room, and Gornionski said, oh for God’s sake, I am the volunteer with Savanoris-Kurejas, they are not going to do any harm to me.</span> <span id="s674">So he opened the door and his appearance was extremely Jewish.</span> <span id="s675">You couldn’t take him for anybody else.</span> <span id="s676">And the Lithuanians taunted, oh come on, you such and such.</span> <span id="s677">So he said to him, look, I am a volunteer fighter.</span> <span id="s678">I fought for your country’s independence.</span> <span id="s679">That’s why you have a country today, because of people like me.</span> <span id="s680">And that made the man wild.</span> <span id="s681">He started to beat him there, to the pulp.</span> <span id="s682">So that was the reaction between one and the other.</span> <span id="s683">Now, how do I know all about it, is because of something very similar happened in our place.</span> <span id="s684">My father said to Mama, please go to see what happened to Gornionski.</span> <span id="s685">Because there was an aktion when those -- when --</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: So this was in 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: ’41, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: Right when the Nazis are invading --</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: Right, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: -- during those first weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: And this is what happens to -- and did he die, Mr. --</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: Well, I’ll tell you what happened.</span> <span id="s694">So at -- Mama went and Mrs. Gornionski opened the door and she told Mama what happened because she could hear everything, even though they were locked in the room.</span> <span id="s695">Mama ran to Lithuanian military commandantura, Lithuanian military headquarters.</span> <span id="s696">And Gornionskis had very, very good friend, Songila -- I have to remember the name.</span> <span id="s697">I think Majora Songila, if I’m not wrong.</span> <span id="s698">Songila -- whatever he was doing, he dropped everything, he ran to Lukiškės jail, where everybody was taking, to Lukiškės.</span> <span id="s699">He went all over through the hundreds of people that were already brought and he was screaming, Gornionskis, Gornionskis, Gornionskis until he couldn’t scream any more.</span> <span id="s700">He couldn’t find him.</span> <span id="s701">So whether from be -- being beaten so badly he just passed out, or whether he was so overcome with what happened to him that he didn’t react, Major Songila couldn’t find him.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: So he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: We don’t know -- well -- well, naturally he died.</span> <span id="s704">Naturally they -- everything from the Lukiškės was taken to Paneriai and shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: That’s a bitter moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: It is a bitter moment, but you see there’s again an explanation to -- to all of that certain explanation.</span> <span id="s707">This was about two -- two -- two, three weeks after deportations to Siberia.</span> <span id="s708">Now, you’re too young to remember.</span> <span id="s709">I remember.</span> <span id="s710">Deportations to Siberia brought a lot of anger.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: But why should it be directed against the country’s Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: The red flags of the people on the alley of liberty, [Lithuanian].</span> <span id="s713">People don’t forget things like that.</span> <span id="s714">People who worked in personnel departments of each institution, kadroskidos, they were in the hands of certain nationality.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: So you --</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: All that added up to the outburst of hatred.</span> <span id="s717">They didn’t look at the time, were you pro or contra, it just mass, the whole mass was experiencing that hatred.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: How is it that your parents didn’t, or your family didn’t?</span> <span id="s719">You father didn’t, or his -- his uncles -- or did they?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: How -- how did we -- what do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: Make it through those first few weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: Well, that was all [indecipherable] officer’s help.</span> <span id="s723">See, the -- I -- I tol -- I mentioned that, it probably belonged to that famous first regiment.</span> <span id="s724">The closeness of the officers was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s725">When the Soviets came in 1914, Papa was the first person from Lietukis thrown out of job.</span> <span id="s726">Not only thrown out of job, but not given right to live in Kaunas, and not given right -- not given the labor book.</span> <span id="s727">So for awhile we couldn’t understand what’s going on.</span> <span id="s728">We never had anything to do with the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s729">But after a few days, people started to see what’s going on.</span> <span id="s730">So Mama said to my father, you know what?</span> <span id="s731">Go to Vilnius.</span> <span id="s732">His brother, who was bor -- working in Bank of Lithuania in the meantime was transferred from Siauliai to Vilnius, so she said, go to Vilnius --</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: This is brother who -- which was --</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Salomonis.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: Salomon.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s737">Solomon.</span> <span id="s738">And he went to Vilnius.</span> <span id="s739">He tried to get a job in Vilnius.</span> <span id="s740">Whenever he would put his name and go through Kadroz Kiduz, that office of political personnel, he couldn’t get the job.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: Why?</span> <span id="s743">First of all, he was an officer.</span> <span id="s744">Secondly, he went all over Lithuania talking, giving speeches against Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: In the Finnish German --</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: In the finni -- fi -- fi --</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: -- in the Finnish Soviet war.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: -- Soviet war.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: And secondly he was not a class that they want to have.</span> <span id="s751">In those days, when you opened our main newspaper, on two pages were hundreds and hundreds Lithuanian army personnel out of work, out of work, out of work.</span> <span id="s752">They would tell all these officers are out.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: Which newspaper was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: That was still the first days [indecipherable] Aidas, but then it change already to different names.</span> <span id="s755">But they gave a list of, in alphabetical order of each and every officer that used to serve in Lithuanian army.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: So that means during the Soviet time, that is in 1940, this echo of Lithuania newspaper was still being published.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: From the beginning.</span> <span id="s758">From the beginning it was published, but then they changed the names, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s760">My point though, is I’m trying to understand is that even with the Soviet takeover, a newspaper that was not Soviet controlled was allowed to be published and allowed to have the names of people who were unemployed listed there.</span> <span id="s761">That’s unusual, if I’m understanding it correctly.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: The -- they knew we -- what -- don’t forget there was a -- a -- the -- they formed a Lithuanian pro-Soviet government.</span> <span id="s763">So the government had no choice.</span> <span id="s764">If they were told that all the officers’ corps has to be out of the army, they had to do it.</span> <span id="s765">So that’s where the -- all the officers were listed.</span> <span id="s766">If there exists a fi -- somewhere you know, in archives, the newspapers from that area, you’ll find it.</span> <span id="s767">So you say how come.</span> <span id="s768">So anyway, to make a long story short, Father couldn’t get work in Vilnius.</span> <span id="s769">It happened that he met one of the people from his fighting years who was a head of health department in Vilnius.</span> <span id="s770">Pulkanikas Colonel Usas.</span> <span id="s771">Usas saw him on the street and say hey, what are you doing here in Vilnius, you’re in Kaunas.</span> <span id="s772">So my father explained to him that yes, I am in Kaunas, my family is in Kaunas, but I can’t -- I don’t have right to work in Kaunas and I don’t have right to register in Kaunas to live.</span> <span id="s773">So I came to Vilnius to see maybe I can do something in here.</span> <span id="s774">So Colonel Usas told him look, we’ll do something different.</span> <span id="s775">I will not put you through that political personnel department.</span> <span id="s776">I will hire you as chief accountant and you’ll be listed as a daily worker, a laborer, so you don’t have to go through the political process.</span> <span id="s777">And Mr. Usas kept my father, as he said, in the health department, protected him as much as he could.</span> <span id="s778">And when the Germans came in Vilnius, the regulation that no Jew is allowed to work for a government office came not immediately.</span> <span id="s779">So, every morning, when Jews were already wearing the white -- not -- not yellow stars yet, the white armband, white and blue --</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: Jews were wearing a white and -- white --</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: Yes, white and blue armband -- armband.</span> <span id="s782">So Mama used to take my father to the health department -- End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: Okay, so your father was working in the health department in Vilnius, i-in -- in the -- what is the capital city now.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: The Germans arrive and his protector, whose name was?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: Pulkanikas Colonel Usas.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Usas.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: U-s-a-s.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: Okay, experiences some sort of difficulties or pressure.</span> <span id="s791">Can you tell us about what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Which one of them?</span> <span id="s793">My father’s experiences -- pressure, or Colonel Usas?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: Well, isn’t it that ker --</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: They had --</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: -- whoever -- whoever is --</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: -- okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: -- yeah, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: That was a law.</span> <span id="s800">It was a law advertised on every pole, on every telephone pole, and not only on the poles, we used to have such a -- that structure, on every couple of cor -- ca -- corners of the street, where you would announce concerts, operas and so on.</span> <span id="s801">Everywhere was the new regulation issued by the -- signed by the new Lithuanian government, that no more Jewish extraction people are allowed to work for a state institution.</span> <span id="s802">That was a law.</span> <span id="s803">And Usas had no way to keep him any longer.</span> <span id="s804">He kept him up til that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: And this is in June or July of 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: That’s right, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: And so it’s -- if it’s issued by the Lithuanian government, do you mean the Lithuanian provisional government?</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: Provisional government.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: So it’s a provisional government directive, not a German directive?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: It was -- you know, it’s difficult to tell today, because there was regulations put out by the German military headquarters, by Germans.</span> <span id="s811">We used to call Gebiets commissar, the ca --</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: Regional commissioner.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: Regional co-commissioner for Baltic countries.</span> <span id="s814">I can’t tell you exactly now which one is which, but anyway, Usas or -- Colonel Usas told my father that the only thing I can think what to do in this situation, I’ll appoint you as a director of the Jewish hospital.</span> <span id="s815">At least you’ll be safe for awhile as a director of hospital because, he said, I believe the Germans will not shut the hospital.</span> <span id="s816">They are -- they will be afraid of epidemics, typhoid or whatever, so you should be safe in the hospital.</span> <span id="s817">And -- my father never had anything to do with hospital or anything, but he said well, this is the only thing I can do at the time being, unless you want to go into the hiding.</span> <span id="s818">And at that time my father said he is not thinking about hiding.</span> <span id="s819">He’ll go with his entire family, which at that time was quite a few in Vilnius, he’ll go and take the position of director of the hospital.</span> <span id="s820">And he stayed in the hospital for quite awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: Now at this point, I’d like to leave that for a moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: I have a question about Colonel Usas and -- and it’s one that’s -- that it bi -- sort of like rouses my curiosity.</span> <span id="s824">Here is somebody who was a -- let’s say a comrade of your father’s from the officer corps of the Lithuanian independent army, who survives, let’s say, a Soviet purge.</span> <span id="s825">In other words, his is not one of the names that’s on the list of those who are unemployed, who ends up in Vilnius during the Soviet rule and is able to offer your father protection.</span> <span id="s826">And then lasts long enough to still hold that post when the German come -- Germans come in.</span> <span id="s827">How is that possible with a person of such a background, to be able to do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: First of all, he was a doctor [speaks Lithuanian here]</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: Ear -- ear, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: A -- he was a doctor ear, nose and throat.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: So he was not just an administrative person, he was a doctor.</span> <span id="s833">So when the Soviets had those lists of officers out of the army, he was probably not in the regular army, he was a doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: He was a doctor.</span> <span id="s836">A political person, a doctor.</span> <span id="s837">So that’s how he managed to do it.</span> <span id="s838">Now, you want me to continue in which direction?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: Okay, I would say let’s go back to the 1930’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: -- a little bit.</span> <span id="s842">We were -- we were talking earlier about your larger extended family, about your father’s work at Lietukis, which was a cooperative association.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: There’s one thing I forgot to mention.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: We had a paramilitary organization called Sauliai.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: Not Siauliai, but Sauliai, s-a-u.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: What does that translate as?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: Para -- nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Oh, para --</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: Paramilitary organization.</span> <span id="s852">And my father was one of the leaders of that paramilitary organization.</span> <span id="s853">The members wore a uniform similar to army uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: Was it like a national guard?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Something like national guard.</span> <span id="s856">The problem is that it was a very patriotic paramilitary organization which unfortunately, when the Germans came got a very bad review.</span> <span id="s857">It wasn’t before.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: Did it -- was it a deserved review?</span> <span id="s859">What did they do?</span> <span id="s860">How did they --</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: Kill the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Well, let’s -- what did they do, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: Killed the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Oh, they killed the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s866">But, I haven’t seen, and I don’t know, but this is, if you will look into whatever is written, you will find.</span> <span id="s867">So you see, Father was a head of that organization in many places.</span> <span id="s868">So the Soviets couldn’t digest him.</span> <span id="s869">Plus he’s going all over the country, talking about the Finnish war.</span> <span id="s870">And he was known.</span> <span id="s871">Father was a member of Jewish -- a Revisionistic organization called Brit ha-Hayal.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: What is that?</span> <span id="s873">Tell us about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: The -- the Jewish people have Zionistic and Revisionistic.</span> <span id="s875">This was a Revisionistic organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Was it not for patriation to Palestine?</span> <span id="s877">Was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: Zionistic organizations were more for patriation to Palestine.</span> <span id="s879">Revisionistic were also s-same, but the ideologic -- ideology was different.</span> <span id="s880">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: How was it different?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: I was too young to tell you about the difference.</span> <span id="s883">I think they were more supporting bik -- Revisionistic movement was movement for the richer people.</span> <span id="s884">Zionistic movement was more movement of working class.</span> <span id="s885">I must have been around four or five years old and my father organized a military camp for members of the Brit ha-Hayal.</span> <span id="s886">He always felt that Jewish people don’t have that military drive, let’s do it and there was a big camp organized, and in that camp I learned a lot of Hebrew songs, which I happen to remember today.</span> <span id="s887">And th-they were pro-Israel, but I don’t know how they are [indecipherable] at that time.</span> <span id="s888">See, Israel at that time was British.</span> <span id="s889">So they tried to use pressure somehow to get it out of British clutches.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: Did you visit him at that camp?</span> <span id="s891">A: I was in the camp, Mama and I, we was -- we were in the camp.</span> <span id="s892">Yeah, no-no -- no other families, just Mama and I.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: And what do you remember from it?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: What I remember, I remember morning drills that they had, marching like army.</span> <span id="s895">You tried to induce the -- you know, it’s always been said the Jewish people are so often this and that, and he said it just the contrary, but you have to give them an out, somewhere how to do it, see.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s897">So, training.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: Training.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: And was it -- was it well attended?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s901">They lived in there a -- for a month.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: And how many people do you think were there?</span> <span id="s903">Do you -- would you rec -- what was it, a couple of hundred?</span> <span id="s904">Was it fewer, was it more?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: I-I wouldn’t say couple of hundred.</span> <span id="s906">You see, i -- in my memory I see them lined -- lined up for the morning revai and so on.</span> <span id="s907">I couldn’t tell you how many they had, but there was quite -- quite a group.</span> <span id="s908">Quite a group.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: And this had nothing to do with the Lithuanian military at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: No, no, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: And the idea of it was that it would be a pr -- a force that would be part of the movement to Israel, the movement to be able to establish Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: You can’t establish Israel in those days.</span> <span id="s913">You can’t think about establishing, because it was in British clutch.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: It was Palestine.</span> <span id="s916">But they did work towards it, which -- which -- I don’t know how they did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: Did you know many of the other people who were at -- like --</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: Who were in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: Yes I did, but you see, I was four or five years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: I remember they had in our town, in Kaunas was Mr. Dushnitsky and Papa was under Mr. Dushnitsky.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: So yi -- one was a leader, he was an assistant.</span> <span id="s925">And I remember that after the camp they needed a worker in Lithuanian embassy.</span> <span id="s926">And there were two people as candidates.</span> <span id="s927">One was my father and another was, I can’t remember now his last name.</span> <span id="s928">So anyway, he got that position in that Lithuanian embassy in Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: Oh, so there was a representation of Lithuania in Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: Yeah, there was, there was, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: And so the other person got that --</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: The other person got the job, yeah.</span> <span id="s933">That -- what -- you see, I was too small to remember too much about [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: What languages did you speak at home?</span> <span id="s935">What was your language between your father, your mother and yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: Just Lithuanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: Just Lithuanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: Just Lithuanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: And were other languages sometimes spoken in your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s941">A lot of ad -- parents had a lot of friends from the army who were officers from the Russian Tsaristic army, incorporated into Lithuanian army.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: Okay, so former Tsarist officers --</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: Former Tsarist officers, right.</span> <span id="s944">And he had the very, very, very clo -- I -- I would say probably the closest friends.</span> <span id="s945">Now let me see.</span> <span id="s946">It was Kanaz LaPotion, Kanaz -- what -- what we called him in -- in English.</span> <span id="s947">[speaks Lithuanian]</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: Ah, Grand Duke.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: Gran -- Duke.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: Grand Duke, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: Duke LaPotion, yeah.</span> <span id="s952">But when LaPotions were visiting us, they always spoke Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: Because their Lithuanian was good, but not so good.</span> <span id="s955">His was good, his wife’s not so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: So this was part of, let’s say, the ri -- White Russian --</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: White, white Tsaristic --</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: -- Russian refugees who had --</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: -- refuges, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: -- who had come from Soviet --</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: Now Mrs. -- Mr. LaPotion’s brother, Kellanos Shablavinskas was the -- was attached to our president of Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: So this was our group, th-the LaPotions, the Shablavinska, but they, because of the w-women, who don’t learn so quick -- the men had to learn the language, but the women didn’t, they spoke Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: But otherwise I never heard Russian in the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: But your mother spoke Russian, so it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: Oh, she pa -- she spoke perfect Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: And when did you learn it?</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: You know, I cannot answer the question.</span> <span id="s970">I sometimes think to myself, when and where did I pick up the language?</span> <span id="s971">We used to spend summers around Kulautuva.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: But a lot of Jewish families used to stay in summer --</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: Where is Kulautuva?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: Kulautuva is past -- on the river Nemunas, past Kaunas.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: Not far away.</span> <span id="s978">I imagine those children must have talked Russian, I must have picked it up there.</span> <span id="s979">But, in 1940, when the Russians came in, I was graduating and they pushed us to learn Russian in that one year.</span> <span id="s980">They expected us to pick it up.</span> <span id="s981">We didn’t know the alphabet, we didn’t know how to write Russian letters, but we were given ins-instructions every day.</span> <span id="s982">We sat in high school til seven o’clock at night.</span> <span id="s983">They had --</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: You were how old then?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: 14.</span> <span id="s987">And so you hadn’t -- your knowledge of Russian to that point had been in verbal conversation rather than --</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: Just verbal, but not during my growing years, I didn’t have anyone to talk Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: Okay, so it was not --</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: Yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: -- there was no academic formal background --</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: No, no, no, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: -- there was no -- all of a sudden you have a crash course.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: Before we get back to 1940 I wanted to, you know, talk a little bit more about those 1930’s.</span> <span id="s996">Did you have -- when you were growing up, who were your closest friends your age?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: My age?</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: The -- the closest friend was the daughter of our minister -- minister what int -- in-interior.</span> <span id="s1000">Skučas, [indecipherable] Skučas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: That was my closest friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: So it would be his daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: [indecipherable] his daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: When the Russians came in, Skučas took his wife and daughter to the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: Of?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: Lithuania and Germany.</span> <span id="s1009">They let his wife and daughter across, the Lithuanian guards wouldn’t let [indecipherable] Skučas across.</span> <span id="s1010">He was in the ultimatum where the Russians put the ultimatum to our government.</span> <span id="s1011">They said that they want to have arrested Mr. Skučas and Mr. Povilaitis, both from Ministry of Interior.</span> <span id="s1012">So they took Mr. Skučas back, he was arrested.</span> <span id="s1013">When I met Mrs. Skučas in Florida, she asked me, Ada, do something, try to find out.</span> <span id="s1014">Maybe some Jewish people sat with him somewhere.</span> <span id="s1015">Maybe anybody knows, whatever there is, we have no idea what happened to him.</span> <span id="s1016">We are read in the paper that he was finished, but no details, no place of burial.</span> <span id="s1017">And I told her, Mrs. Skučas, I say, we have the same problem in our house.</span> <span id="s1018">We don’t know exact date, we don’t know where, we have no burial and we have no place where he is, you know, same thing.</span> <span id="s1019">So I sympathize with her as much as, you know, because she went exactly what my mother went through.</span> <span id="s1020">And that was my closest friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1022">I see.</span> <span id="s1023">Did you have friends who were part of the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1025">They lived not too far from us, and we were friends since probably the age of four or five.</span> <span id="s1026">We played together -- we played together with her.</span> <span id="s1027">For some reason I renamed her Lucia.</span> <span id="s1028">Her name was Judith.</span> <span id="s1029">I never liked the Judith name, I renamed her Lucia, so that even her parents, when I was there, called her Lucia.</span> <span id="s1030">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: What language did you speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: Lithuanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: So they were also more assimilated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: Nope, very Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: Very Jewish, very Jewish.</span> <span id="s1039">And that’s a house where I heard a lot of Jewish language.</span> <span id="s1040">Her mother was very famous.</span> <span id="s1041">She had an atelier.</span> <span id="s1042">Seam -- seamstress.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: She had many workers in the atelier, and those workers gradually went to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1045">They used to get the landing permits somehow through the zionis -- Zionist organization, and they went to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1046">So Lucia, I lost track of her when the Soviets came.</span> <span id="s1047">And then again, after the liberation, I met her in a theater.</span> <span id="s1048">It was a very difficult moment, and for her and for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: Well, she lost her father, I lost my father.</span> <span id="s1051">I had no idea that she’s alive, she had no idea that I am alive.</span> <span id="s1052">It -- it was a -- very difficult for me.</span> <span id="s1053">But anyway -- so otherwise I didn’t have Jewish friends, no.</span> <span id="s1054">But she had to be -- she was in an e -- two houses away, so we always played together.</span> <span id="s1055">That’s the only -- but otherwise in the Jewish society, no, it didn’t happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: Did you hear some of your other playmates at school make fun of Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: Di -- no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s1060">Not -- not in that class of people.</span> <span id="s1061">We were -- I’ll show you the pictures.</span> <span id="s1062">We had a very large number of Jewish students who excelled, so that from the side of teachers you would never hear anything like that, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: So this is at that elite high school that you went --</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: Elite high school, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: -- that you went to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: And of course if you have a larger number of kids who are Jewish then it’s unlikely --</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: Unlikely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1074">What were -- you know, as the 1930’s were progressing, you were getting older and older, from childhood into young teenager.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: What are your memories from that time?</span> <span id="s1077">A --</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: Wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: Wonderful in every way.</span> <span id="s1081">In every way.</span> <span id="s1082">I -- I was playing piano.</span> <span id="s1083">I entered Kaunas Conservatory.</span> <span id="s1084">I was very skinny, so my parents decided that I need more muscles, so they put me in the ballet school.</span> <span id="s1085">But our ballet school does not compare to American ballet school.</span> <span id="s1086">Six days a week, every day, just Sunday off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: That was a state ballet school.</span> <span id="s1089">So, between ballet and conservatory and sports, I had no time to be bored or anything.</span> <span id="s1090">I had a wonderful time, and I was very good in sports also.</span> <span id="s1091">I loved to ski.</span> <span id="s1092">I have a silver medal in Lithuanian ski competitions in the senior group --</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: Where there are mountains?</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: Yes -- not with mountains, cross country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: Uh-huh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: Cross country s -- right.</span> <span id="s1097">And I was good runner.</span> <span id="s1098">So can you imagine having all this and to do the music lessons at home?</span> <span id="s1099">The high school lessons didn’t bother me, I was very good at that, but the music, you had to do it.</span> <span id="s1100">So there was no free time.</span> <span id="s1101">I had the wonderful time, wonderful friends.</span> <span id="s1102">The skating rink, all they had to do was run down the hill to backyard into the skating rink.</span> <span id="s1103">I have plenty of pictures from skating rink with all my friends.</span> <span id="s1104">And since I was the youngest, I always was the smallest one, but that didn’t matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: When did world events, particularly those events in Germany start entering your consciousness?</span> <span id="s1106">Did peop -- you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: Never.</span> <span id="s1110">Some of my mother’s friends -- and my mo-mo-mother’s and father friends went to America cause they had t -- families in America, but they went only when the Soviets came, via Japanese help, you know, the Japanese consul?</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: Yes, with his help, they went.</span> <span id="s1113">We heard a lot of what was going in Germany because we used to spend summer in Palanga, and in the late part of 30’s, the German -- Germans used to come to Palanga and they used to tell us more or less what’s going on.</span> <span id="s1114">But we never thought it concerns us.</span> <span id="s1115">We never thought that Hitler one day will take Klaipėda and so on and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Do you remember when that happened?</span> <span id="s1117">When he did take Klaipėda?</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: What was it, 30 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: Okay, it started with the big -- big case of Sass and Neuman.</span> <span id="s1121">Lithuania caught the spies Sass and Neuman and put them on trial.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: Whose spies were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: They were German spies in Lithuania?</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: German spies in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1126">They were put on trial and I think since that trial, the atmosphere between Germany and Lithuania started to get worse and worse.</span> <span id="s1127">And then one day Hitler put an ultimatum and that’s when all the Lithuanians ran out from hi -- Žemaitija, from Klaipėda region, to Kaunas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: So, from the Memel region, Memel is Klaipėda --</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: Mem -- Klaipėda, in German [indecipherable] yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: -- in German, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1131">And -- and so there was an exodus?</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: Exodus.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: Absolute -- absolute exodus.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: Did you know any of these people?</span> <span id="s1136">A: Oh yes, oh yes, they entered our high schools, they entered our society and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: Did they talk about what they had experienced?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: They didn’t experience anything, they just ran.</span> <span id="s1139">It was an exodus to run.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: Oh I see, so they lost their --</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: They left --</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: -- they left their homes, they lost their --</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: -- yes, they left everything.</span> <span id="s1144">But it still didn’t give us even th -- if you talk to the German population, many of them say they didn’t know a lot.</span> <span id="s1145">We didn’t know a lot either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: Nobody thought that a civilized nation like German nation will be able to do atrocities of the kind that they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">Q: When you would meet people from Germany in the resort town, in Palanga by the ocean in the summer times, and they say they were talking about what was going on there --</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">A: You know what was the main talking?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q: -- do you remember what they say -- what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: Food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: We have no butter.</span> <span id="s1154">You have shortage of this, this and that.</span> <span id="s1155">That was their main thing coming to Palanga.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: They never mentioned political pressure, see?</span> <span id="s1158">So we had no idea.</span> <span id="s1159">We -- we knew that it’s not as good as it used to be before, but our Jewish people still kept going to Germany for trade.</span> <span id="s1160">The visas were open, you could go in and back.</span> <span id="s1161">So you see we didn’t -- we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1162">There is a book by a Lithuanian writer, [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: I have the book.</span> <span id="s1165">In that book she describes the survival of two Jewish girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: And when I was reading that book I figured, uh-oh, I think I know who she is.</span> <span id="s1168">She was in my school.</span> <span id="s1169">Her father had factory, I know the name.</span> <span id="s1170">And somehow, when I was vacationing in Maine, I came to talk about the book with one of Lithuanian singers from Canada, and -- Kabliss.</span> <span id="s1171">And he said, oh you’re right, that’s her.</span> <span id="s1172">But she doesn’t have -- she has nothing to do with people from that times.</span> <span id="s1173">And just why, what’s wrong?</span> <span id="s1174">I -- he said, I don’t know, but she doesn’t want to know anybody, she only keeps in touch with the family who saved her.</span> <span id="s1175">So, why did we come to this now, I can’t understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: I don’t remember, but it was something to do --</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: -- with the -- with what you know what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: Oh, oh.</span> <span id="s1180">Her father -- she was attending ballet school with me, and I remember her father going to Germany and I remember her father bringing her beautiful, black shoes.</span> <span id="s1181">And th-that’s why I remember [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1182">Her father kept going to Germany back and forth in business.</span> <span id="s1183">He had the big stocking factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: And he just went and came back.</span> <span id="s1186">Nothing -- nothing to -- so that’s way -- when you say that, did we know?</span> <span id="s1187">No, we didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: No sort of premonition?</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: And now let’s go east.</span> <span id="s1191">When did you get a sense of Soviet Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: When they entered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: And not before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: No.</span> <span id="s1195">Before, I used to stay very often with the Skučas family, and I remember once at the dinner, he had the conversation with his wife, the Russians started to tell us that couple of Soviet soldiers have disappeared.</span> <span id="s1196">And he said it -- it’s an awful provocation.</span> <span id="s1197">But in those days he didn’t think that it’ll come -- that’ll be a reason for the Russians to tell that they are coming to liberate Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: So the provocation is on whose side?</span> <span id="s1199">The Russians are provoking the Lithuanians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1201">That we did something to a couple of their soldiers and the soldiers disappeared, as if.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: See, that was -- that was the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: And that’s the first premonition you have --</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: That is pre-premonition that there’s some -- and then they introduced -- no, they introduced Soviet bases, basi, bases for Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s1206">They were not going out of the way, so they stayed on the base.</span> <span id="s1207">And that’s when they said that couple of soldiers disappeared from the base and never returned.</span> <span id="s1208">And that was a main thing, as if, to liberate us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: And how did you -- how did -- well, we’ll come to that in a little bit, but ho -- you were by that point 13 - 14 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">A: 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q: So I’d like to get a sense of what do you remember, what do you experience.</span> <span id="s1212">How did it affect you in particular?</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: Oh yeah, I’ll tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: But it can be in the next tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">End of Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Beginning Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: Okay, so what ha -- a-after you remember this dinner conversation with the ministry interiors talking about the strange situation of the Soviet Union saying their soldiers have gone missing here, and then bases are established within the territory, what was your next memory of what happened with independent Lithuania or life as you knew it, basically.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: Nothing until they crossed the border and marched into Lithuanian territory.</span> <span id="s1221">Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: And do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: Oh perfectly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: What happened, how -- what did you see?</span> <span id="s1225">What is what -- what’s in your minds -- mind’s eye?</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: The -- the Russian army, on little horses.</span> <span id="s1227">Most of the riders slanted eyed, was the [indecipherable] nation --</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: -- marching through our Avenue of Liberty in Kaunas, straight.</span> <span id="s1230">And that’s when I told you Papa took me and my mother to the Museum of War, and we spent with a crowd of people there.</span> <span id="s1231">We couldn’t stand any more that pressure, watching the Soviets get into the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: You mentioned earlier that there had been factory people and alluding that most of these had been Jewish who stood there with red flags.</span> <span id="s1233">Was it no -- only Jewish people?</span> <span id="s1234">Were there any Lithuanians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: Well, there are many pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: And when you look at the pictures, you can see the percentage.</span> <span id="s1238">So I don’t want to answer how many or not how many, just look at the pictures, and there is a -- different features of these two nationalities.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: How did life change in your personal relationships with the people that you knew?</span> <span id="s1240">Did any go -- did -- did any surprise you and -- and let’s say become part of the new system?</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: Not from my close friends, but I want to tell you, out of 30 students, of the 30 pupils at the time when the Soviet entered, we graduated nine.</span> <span id="s1242">It was all what’s left from 30.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: And what happened with the rest?</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: Either deported to Siberia, or cross the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: Left the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: What happened after the Soviet takeover?</span> <span id="s1248">How did it impact your family in the very first instance?</span> <span id="s1249">Was it the loss of your father’s job?</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: The loss of my father’s job, the closing of bank accounts and introducing the s -- how many square yards per person you were allowed to have.</span> <span id="s1251">So we were forced, in a nice way, to accept two families to live together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: What kind of a place did you have before?</span> <span id="s1253">Was it a large apartment or a house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: It was an apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">A: A-According to our code -- conditions in Kaunas it was a large apartment.</span> <span id="s1257">Three big rooms, plus a smaller room for the servant, kitchen, bathroom and so on.</span> <span id="s1258">So, we had a family in each room, and we were squeezed into one room.</span> <span id="s1259">But this was survivable, this was not a tragedy.</span> <span id="s1260">What affected more were the deportations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: Can you tell us a little bit about that?</span> <span id="s1262">What happened there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: Father, as I mentioned before, was in Vilnius working for the health department.</span> <span id="s1264">I was going through my last exams and sint -- deportations started Thursday night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: On what month?</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: June.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: And what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: ‘41</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: Couple of weeks before the war started.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: Mother couldn’t get through on the telephone to Vilnius to find out what’s going on.</span> <span id="s1273">She was climbing the walls, we -- we didn’t know what’s going on.</span> <span id="s1274">So she said look, I’ll get the suitcase ready.</span> <span id="s1275">I’ll put Father’s winter clothing into the suitcase.</span> <span id="s1276">The moment you finish your exam, we’re running to the railway station, we’re going to Vilnius.</span> <span id="s1277">And we came by rail to Vilnius.</span> <span id="s1278">That was Saturday.</span> <span id="s1279">Sunday morning the first bombs fell on Vilnius.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: So you missed the deportations, you weren’t on the lists.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: We were on the lists.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: You were on the lists?</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: But my father wasn’t there and they couldn’t find our house.</span> <span id="s1284">The house stood in between two streets on a hill.</span> <span id="s1285">You couldn’t access it from down, because it was locked, and you couldn’t find it from the top, because you couldn’t find it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A: It was a very lucky and unlucky situation.</span> <span id="s1288">Sometimes you know, I was thinking, if we would have been all together, and if we would been deported, maybe -- maybe he would survive.</span> <span id="s1289">But I don’t give much chance to it because I don’t -- I don’t think he would survive.</span> <span id="s1290">Usually they -- they shot the man from the beginning.</span> <span id="s1291">So anyway, that what happened.</span> <span id="s1292">I had the white dress on, Mama had a light purple dress on.</span> <span id="s1293">That was all we had, nothing.</span> <span id="s1294">We didn’t realize that -- what is coming this morning, so we thought we’ll leave him this stuff in case, for deporf -- deportations, we come back to Kaunas.</span> <span id="s1295">We couldn’t get back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: Germ -- German army came in next morning.</span> <span id="s1298">I mean, the war started next morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: When you were already in Vilnius.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: We were already in Vilnius Saturday night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: And war started Sunday morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: So deportations happening on a Thursday night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: Yeah, ye -- deportations happened two weeks before --</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">Q: On a Thursday night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: -- on the 14th - 15th --</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: -- that’s when the deportations started, yeah, two weeks before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1310">So you were preparing in case that was going to happen --</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A: In case --</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">Q: -- again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">A: -- yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: And any of your friends got deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: So I told you, out of 30 we were left nine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: Did you talk to their families?</span> <span id="s1317">Was there anybody left to tell you what was happening, or -- how did -- how did you experience those deportations, that’s what I’m saying.</span> <span id="s1318">If you weren’t affected yourselves --</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: Trying now to tell you.</span> <span id="s1320">You see, first night we didn’t know what’s going on.</span> <span id="s1321">M -- I had my exams, and the next morning when I went to school, there were fewer of us.</span> <span id="s1322">The first ones that were deported was our previous diplomatic ministry in Rome, Charnetskis’ -- Charnetski, they were my very close friends, all three children, they had five children and all the Charnetskis’ lived very close and th -- it was their daughter Lucia, I was especially close.</span> <span id="s1323">And char -- no, Charnetskis weren’t taken the first days because -- no, you’re right, Charnetskis were taken the first night and they didn’t show up for Friday’s exam.</span> <span id="s1324">Then we noticed next day some others didn’t show up for the exam.</span> <span id="s1325">By that time the town already knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s1326">And you know what’s very interesting?</span> <span id="s1327">That week we had posters all over that [indecipherable] KGB choir is giving concerts in our city.</span> <span id="s1328">And nobody put two and two together, why suddenly we have a KGB choir.</span> <span id="s1329">See, this way they -- people saw them on the street, but it didn’t occur to them that this is the help for deportations.</span> <span id="s1330">They came under auspices of musical unit, which they -- they were musical unit.</span> <span id="s1331">But at the same time we had ta -- ca -- th-the city full of [indecipherable] people.</span> <span id="s1332">So now when the deportations started, the people who later on kept us for two years in hiding, they were originally from Kaunas and Vilnius, and then their parents and brother were deported, the first night.</span> <span id="s1333">And their children were already sent to the fi -- grandparents for summer vacations.</span> <span id="s1334">They were not --</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: This was June, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: June.</span> <span id="s1337">And they took the whole family, the grandparents, the son and the two children, put them all into the echelon.</span> <span id="s1338">Echelon came to Vilnius, but the children were not on the list, so they took the children out of the echelon and tell them, go home.</span> <span id="s1339">So they came --</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: Off of the train they took them --</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: Out of the train, and they went home and they told exactly what has happened, that the whole echelon is full of people going to Siberia, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: But did they know it was Siberia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A: They didn’t know what was, it was Kazakhstan, Siberia, whatever, but they knew that something awful is going on.</span> <span id="s1344">So that was what compelled tha -- it was a huge farm, huge one -- they went right away to -- to take care of th -- of the place [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: And that was the first information that we had directly, what’s going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: So in your memory, you remember seeing Soviet soldiers in the streets who could have been part of the NKVD tw -- choir, but you never saw a -- a -- one of the trucks come by in the middle of the night, or you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: -- didn’t see any other --</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: -- actual instance of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1354">And also you wouldn’t have known then, who would have been the people who informed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: They had lists.</span> <span id="s1356">The lists were made by the political personnel office, [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: The political personnel office.</span> <span id="s1359">Don’t forget that when you looked for a job, when Soviets came, you had to give information three generations back.</span> <span id="s1360">You, your parents, your grandparents.</span> <span id="s1361">So they had very good information about everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1363">Where they lived, who they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1365">And I experienced [indecipherable] one in the sports circle.</span> <span id="s1366">We had a very highly trained group of sportsmen, and that group was supposed to represent Lithuania in Moscow sports festival.</span> <span id="s1367">And you know between sport people, you took [indecipherable] you -- sports here, sport there.</span> <span id="s1368">Anyway, just about a month before the departure we were told that we are going through the political indoctrination group.</span> <span id="s1369">And each one of us had to fill out the form, giving back, again, three generations who we are, and out of the group remained about a quarter.</span> <span id="s1370">75 percent were not acceptable, and the leader of the group was a Soviet lieutenant from Georgia, Chechyan, he said my God, what am I going to do?</span> <span id="s1371">I have to ship the group to Moscow and I have 25 percent of the group.</span> <span id="s1372">So he turned -- you -- he -- he knew -- we didn’t know about that sport and polit -- politics are just having something in common.</span> <span id="s1373">He turned to the organizations, all kinds of sport organizations, clubs of the workers, factories and so on and he got people, but he had one month to train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">A: He had one -- he said it’s unbelievable, how can I do it, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1376">But [indecipherable] the war came, there was no parade or anything, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: So his problem was solved.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: His problem was solved, right.</span> <span id="s1379">But that’s how the Soviet operated, see?</span> <span id="s1380">So by not -- by se -- sending 75 percent of the group out, you gave them a idea what’s going to happen to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1384">We’re in Vilnius now.</span> <span id="s1385">You’re in -- in your white summer dress.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">A: Yeah, in summer dr --</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: You mother, I think, has a purple dress.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: You meet your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: You’re together again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: And you hear airplanes overhead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1395">Now, when we heard airplanes overhead, that was Sunday morning, I went to a line to get some bread, I was standing in a line.</span> <span id="s1396">The bigger bombings started at night.</span> <span id="s1397">But since my uncle was working from Bank of Lithuania, and the bank has vaults under the ground, we all went to the Bank of Lithuania to wait until the bombs stopped falling.</span> <span id="s1398">And we found everybody who was working for the bank was downstairs in the vaults.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: But at that point your father was still a laborer in the health department.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: In the health department, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">Q: Your uncle still was at the Bank of Lithuania --</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: -- and the vaults of the bank were your bomb shelters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1406">What happened after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: Well, in the morning we went back to the apartment.</span> <span id="s1408">My -- in the apartment was my uncle, his wife, she was very pregnant and my father’s mama.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">Q: So, Uncle Solomon and his --</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">A: Solomon, his wife and his -- my father’s -- my grandmother and my father.</span> <span id="s1411">And then Mama and I.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Q: And how large was this apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">A: Oh, two rooms, because it was Soviet -- Soviet time, you couldn’t have any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1415">So there was a lot of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: Lot of people, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: And again, let’s take it further.</span> <span id="s1418">In the next several days, next week or so, what are your memories of that time?</span> <span id="s1419">What happened that was significant to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: I think it started with Jewish families being physically thrown out of big apartments in downtown Vilnius.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q: Who would do that?</span> <span id="s1422">Who was doing those throwing outs?</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">A: Both.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">Q: Both who?</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">A: And the German officers who needed apartments.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">A: And the help, Lithuanian help.</span> <span id="s1428">There were no yellow stars yet.</span> <span id="s1429">There was no -- no walking on sidewalk yet.</span> <span id="s1430">The first what I remember, all the Jews have to bring to the police station, all radio -- radios.</span> <span id="s1431">Think next one was all Jew --</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Q: Did your family do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Q: Cause you weren't Jewish, or cause you didn’t have a radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: No, because we were [indecipherable] for Jewish.</span> <span id="s1436">Next one was all the Jews are su -- to -- posed to bring to police station, all jewels.</span> <span id="s1437">And people did.</span> <span id="s1438">Then, around that time I think there was a provocation.</span> <span id="s1439">The Germans accused that a German soldier was killed.</span> <span id="s1440">That was the first time that was something very ugly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A: I think they called the Jewish elders, a committee of the elders, Judenrat --</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">A: And they put a fine in so many Jewish people, they had to report.</span> <span id="s1445">But it still didn’t -- didn’t give people any idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: You mean, some soldiers were killed, and then others --</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: A -- a soldier, a soldier was killed.</span> <span id="s1448">The Germans claimed it and they -- then they called the members of Judenrat and told them that they have to -- to send so many -- I don’t remember now the number, so many people to report to Lukiškės, to the jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">Q: And Lukiškės is a jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">A: Jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">A: After that, next one was Jewish people wearing the, about three inches wide, white with blue, the Jewish Magen David on the sleeve.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q: Jewish star.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: After that was no walking on sidewalks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">Q: Did that affect you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">A: In -- in what sense did that affect me?</span> <span id="s1459">I mean, I -- I mentioned before that Father was still working at health department, Mama would go every morning with him too, and every afternoon to pick him up.</span> <span id="s1460">She would hold him under the arm so that her hands was on his thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: But you’re half-Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: Yes, I know, but in Vilnius nobody knew me.</span> <span id="s1463">In Kaunas I wouldn’t be able to -- to hide it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">Q: So, in other words, you were not in Kaunas when the -- when the -- the first pogroms happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">Q: You weren’t -- you weren't there --</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A: I -- I was at Vilnius.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q: You were in Vilnius.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: Yeah, that’s why --</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">Q: Did you ha --</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">A: -- I don’t know anything about Kaunas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1473">And was there telephone connection, or did you find -- when you were in Vilnius, was there a way that you could find out what was going on and that -- did find out what was going on in Kaunas, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: No, because we were all in Vilnius.</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1476">I see.</span> <span id="s1477">So -- so you really had no knowledge --</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">A: No knowledge, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">Q: -- of what was going on there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">A: There -- what I knew -- what I knew about Kaunas was that Kaunas was given one month’s time for Jewish population.</span> <span id="s1481">They were given the borders bordering streets where they should move for future ghetto.</span> <span id="s1482">And in Kaunas the whole thing went in an orderly manner.</span> <span id="s1483">The Jewish people took their furniture, took the -- took their belongings into that area.</span> <span id="s1484">They had one month’s time to do it.</span> <span id="s1485">In Vilnius there was no warning at all.</span> <span id="s1486">The apartment which my Uncle S-Solomon had was in a building that was the last building before ghetto wall.</span> <span id="s1487">And when --</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">Q: On what street, excuse me, cause I know s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">A: Rudninku gatvė.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: Oh, so it was really right there across the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: Right there, right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: And when the Lithuanian army soldiers came to put the boards to enclose, my uncle went downstairs, and he spoke perfect Lithuanian and he told the soldier, look, my wife is expecting a baby any day, and my old mother, please let us climb, as long as you are not too high yet.</span> <span id="s1494">They just started, and the soldiers said, go ahead, right away.</span> <span id="s1495">So he took his mother, his wi -- pregnant wife and himself, they climbed that started wall and they went inside.</span> <span id="s1496">Now, the others were taken out to Lukiškės.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">Q: Excuse me now.</span> <span id="s1498">The apartment that your family was living in, it was outside the border of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">A: Outside the border, outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q: Okay, so they are still able to live in that apartment, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">A: Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">A: That was the last building before the ghetto border.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">Q: So where did they go, if they couldn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">A: They climbed the wall, went into the area.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">Q: Went into the ghetto area.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: Without a place to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A: Without a place to live.</span> <span id="s1510">But they were fortunate because they weren’t pushed to the jail, to Lukiškės jail.</span> <span id="s1511">They escaped sure death, because all the others who didn’t think so quick, they were already taken to Lukiškės and they never showed up any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">Q: All right, maybe I’ve gotten ahead of myself a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">Q: We were going through the sequence of what was happening in Vilnius and -- and in comparison it was chaotic to what was happening in Kaunas as far as the ghetto being established.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">Q: But we left it at such that people were had -- had to take their radios to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">A: Police.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">Q: -- the authorities.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">Q: They had to bring their jewels --</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">A: Jewels, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q: -- there.</span> <span id="s1523">They had to rep -- some, when a German soldier was supposedly killed, the Jewish elders were told to get a certain number of people to report to the jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">A: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Q: And then what?</span> <span id="s1526">And then what?</span> <span id="s1527">A: And then -- then this started the -- the most awful period of the Jews being dragged from apartments by hapunes, by -- by the helpers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">Q: By the Lithuanian helpers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">A: Lithuanian helpers, right.</span> <span id="s1530">That’s when I told you the incident with -- did you -- you asked me --</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">A: -- whether there are other Lithuanian officers.</span> <span id="s1533">That was what happened to Mr. Gornionski.</span> <span id="s1534">Now what happened in our case, normally when th-these -- see, in Vilnius, every house had a -- what would you call it i-in English?</span> <span id="s1535">Not a janitor, but it was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">Q: Housekeeper of a sort?</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">A: Not housekeeper.</span> <span id="s1538">It was a person who took --</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: A supervi -- a super.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: A super, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: Superintendent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: And all those supers knew everybody.</span> <span id="s1543">So when they -- the Lithuanians came to take people, the super would take them to every door.</span> <span id="s1544">She knew who lives where.</span> <span id="s1545">So normally when they -- they -- they would come, Mama would come out, and said no, there are no more Jews in here.</span> <span id="s1546">Just like that.</span> <span id="s1547">But that particular time it didn’t work out.</span> <span id="s1548">The super stood behind and Mama came out, I came out, the grandmother came to the hallway, because her Lithuanian was perfect.</span> <span id="s1549">And the question was, any more Jews inside?</span> <span id="s1550">And we couldn’t -- couldn’t hide any more, the super was standing right behind.</span> <span id="s1551">So, that’s probably the most difficult scene I’ve seen in my life.</span> <span id="s1552">He came into -- the hallway was little, the hallway.</span> <span id="s1553">He came into the first room.</span> <span id="s1554">My father was standing, my uncle was standing, grandmother was there, Mama and I.</span> <span id="s1555">We returned back.</span> <span id="s1556">My father wore the army officer’s boots, and the -- the army pants.</span> <span id="s1557">And he said, well, take a piece of soap, take one towel and let’s go.</span> <span id="s1558">Now, we already knew what let’s go more or less means.</span> <span id="s1559">It’s Lukiškės.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">Q: That’s the soldier.</span> <span id="s1561">That’s the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">A: That’s a Lithuanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">A: Mama started to talk to him.</span> <span id="s1565">She said look, you’re a young man, you’re attending college.</span> <span id="s1566">My husband fought for independence.</span> <span id="s1567">He put his books away, he finished high school after he returned from the front.</span> <span id="s1568">He is one of the Lithuanian volunteer fighters.</span> <span id="s1569">Please leave him here.</span> <span id="s1570">Under no circumstances.</span> <span id="s1571">Under no circumstances.</span> <span id="s1572">My mother went on her knees.</span> <span id="s1573">She grabbed his hands, she started kissing his hands, begging him, please understand that he is not just a person, he is person who fought for you.</span> <span id="s1574">And somehow finally, he agreed, with Mama on her knees, he agreed to leave my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: Do you remember what he looked like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: Oh, not today, not today.</span> <span id="s1577">I wouldn’t recognize him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">Q: But do you remember his manner, his -- his attitude?</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">A: His attitude?</span> <span id="s1580">I couldn’t care less, probably I would describe it.</span> <span id="s1581">He was told to get as many Jews as he can, and my uncle was standing behind my father.</span> <span id="s1582">So my mother said to him again, listen, that’s their mother.</span> <span id="s1583">You left one son and you’re taking the other son.</span> <span id="s1584">I’m begging you, please leave both sons to their mother.</span> <span id="s1585">And she managed to get my uncle left.</span> <span id="s1586">When -- when --</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">Q: What about grandma?</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">A: No, the men, men.</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">Q: Oh, I see, they weren't taking women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">A: Take a piece of soap, take one towel, you’re going to build the east west, or whatever it was, highway.</span> <span id="s1591">After he left our room, Mama told me, go to the kitchen, see what’s going on.</span> <span id="s1592">That was Soviet time.</span> <span id="s1593">Every room had a family, and the owner of that huge house had his room.</span> <span id="s1594">So I went out and I’ve seen that from the other room, they’re taking a husband.</span> <span id="s1595">His wife was pregnant with a child too.</span> <span id="s1596">And I went closer to the owner’s room, and I looked through the keyhole.</span> <span id="s1597">So what I could see was a man told him to give all the jewels first of all.</span> <span id="s1598">You know, he took his watch, he took his rings.</span> <span id="s1599">And then they took -- the man was in his probably, 80’s, very old person, to build a highway.</span> <span id="s1600">So anyway, after that, Mama ran to Mr. Gornionski’s place, because they were kicked out from their luxurious apartment by German officers.</span> <span id="s1601">But in a -- in a polite way.</span> <span id="s1602">But they had to leave everything behind.</span> <span id="s1603">She ran to the place where they lived with that -- sharing apartment with that Lithuanian officer, and that when Mama found out what happened to Mr. Gornionski.</span> <span id="s1604">And then the major from our military place, Major Songinas ran to Lukiškės to find him and couldn’t find him, that that was the end of it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">Q: So these are the first days --</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">A: These are the first days, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">Q: -- of the German occupation --</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">A: Yeah, yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">Q: -- of -- of Vilnius and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">A: -- yeah, yeah, yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">Q: -- what’s happening to the city’s Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">A: -- yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1613">And the -- the most unfortunate thing was that the ghetto area was small, and the population in Vilnius was big.</span> <span id="s1614">And there was no warning and there was nothing to make people go into the area.</span> <span id="s1615">So they couldn’t fit so many, so they just took the upflow, what there was, overflow to the jail, and from jail to Paneriai for liquidation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">Q: But did people know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A: No, no, people didn’t know what.</span> <span id="s1618">Now, about knowing that, I’ll come back to you.</span> <span id="s1619">While Father was the head of Jewish hospital, one night --</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">Q: Can we leave this for a second?</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q: Because we’re going to ba -- finish our tape and come to the next -- to the next cass -- End of Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">Beginning Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">Q: This is something that is un -- I -- I don’t fully quite understand it and maybe it needs a little bit more explanation.</span> <span id="s1625">It sounds that all of a sudden, one day, without any warning, people show up, these hapunes show up in the various apartments across the stity -- city where there are -- where there are Jews who are living, and who are pushing them out of their houses, who knows where.</span> <span id="s1626">Or is it they’re th -- just taking the men?</span> <span id="s1627">What -- what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">A: Everybody.</span> <span id="s1629">When -- when the exodus to ghetto started, it was everybody.</span> <span id="s1630">Just leave the house.</span> <span id="s1631">Old, young, baby, whatever.</span> <span id="s1632">Everybody had to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q: And they go to where?</span> <span id="s1634">Where they’re brought?</span> <span id="s1635">Where were they brought to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">A: As long as ghetto had enough place for those people, they went into the ghetto area.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">A: When -- there is no explanation why certain groups was taken straight to Lukiškės.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q: Straight to the prison, which is on another side of town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">A: Straight to the prison, another -- another side of town.</span> <span id="s1641">The view that you saw was awful.</span> <span id="s1642">People didn’t know what’s going on.</span> <span id="s1643">People thought that they are being grouped into ghetto.</span> <span id="s1644">They were dragging pillows, blankets, pots and pans, whatever they, in the panic they managed to take.</span> <span id="s1645">The Polish population stood outside this on the sidewalks making fun.</span> <span id="s1646">The atmosphere was awful, just awful.</span> <span id="s1647">Now, that day a -- Father told me to go to Colonel Usas home and stay with them, cause we didn’t know how much the Nuremberg laws will affect me, because the -- the nu --</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">Q: Did you know about the nur -- Nuremberg laws?</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">A: Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">Q: By that point you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1652">It -- but it’s a -- Nuremberg laws affect three generations.</span> <span id="s1653">Not the fi -- I was the first generation, and then my parents and then my grandparents.</span> <span id="s1654">So I stayed with [indecipherable] Usas, and Mama took my father’s war medals and went to see our Prime Minister, Kubilunas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">A: And she -- she managed to get into his office, and she told him, General, have a look at these documents.</span> <span id="s1657">It’s your signature on my husband’s war medals.</span> <span id="s1658">Aren’t you able to do something to help me?</span> <span id="s1659">And Kubilunas was very polite, but he told my mother, Ponia -- Madam, there is nothing I can do in Jewish question.</span> <span id="s1660">It’s in the hands of the Germans and my hands are tied.</span> <span id="s1661">I cannot do a thing.</span> <span id="s1662">So Mother’s only hope, that Kubilunas maybe will help, disappeared.</span> <span id="s1663">He couldn’t do a thing.</span> <span id="s1664">And you couldn’t do a thing.</span> <span id="s1665">It was all in the hands of Gestapo, and that was it.</span> <span id="s1666">And the SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">Q: And he was in Vilnius at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">A: He was in Vilnius, he was in ghetto, he was the head of Jewish hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">Q: No, no, no, I meant Kubilunas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">A: No.</span> <span id="s1671">The Lithuanian -- I think at that time that -- no, Mama went to Kaunas.</span> <span id="s1672">He was in -- in Kaunas.</span> <span id="s1673">Our first government, Kubilunas was the head of the government, was in Kaunas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">A: So when Mama came back from Kaunas, she told my father that she couldn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s1676">Now, I started to tell you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">Q: And where were the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">A: -- I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s1679">You asked me, did the people know what’s going on.</span> <span id="s1680">Quite awhile before ghetto, one night, I believe about five people escaped the shooting place Paneriai.</span> <span id="s1681">There were three not connected, I think, women and two children, not connected in between.</span> <span id="s1682">They managed to survive the shooting in the pit, and that night got out of the pit, found the two children alive, and they walked to Vilnius in the dark, towards Jewish hospital.</span> <span id="s1683">When they came into the hospital, my father took them to a separate area and started to question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">Q: So by that point he’s director of the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">A: He’s director of the hospital and they were all bleeding, so he sent his personnel with hot water to wash the blood from the sidewalks so that if the Germans catch it, there wouldn’t be no --</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">Q: Trail.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">A: -- trail which way did they go.</span> <span id="s1688">The Germans didn’t catch it anyway.</span> <span id="s1689">But my father isolated these people in the separate part of hospital because he was afraid of general panic.</span> <span id="s1690">And he put the lady, by the name Mrs. Salinski, she was from Kaunas.</span> <span id="s1691">She was a nurse -- she di -- no-not practically, she was -- she was a real, registered nurse but she wasn’t practicing, and she was in charge of these people.</span> <span id="s1692">The only person that went in and out, until he figured out what to do, because he didn’t know whether the Germans will find or not.</span> <span id="s1693">So by that time my father already had an idea what’s going on in Paneriai.</span> <span id="s1694">That’s it’s not going to build the highway east w-west or whatever, that is going straight to the pits to be shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">Q: In other words, he -- if he had any doubts before, he learned at that point, that when your mother fell on her knees, she saved his life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">A: Oh, that’s absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">Q: Yeah, and also --</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">A: Absolutely, because that -- that went to -- straight to Lukiškės, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">Q: I’d like to get a better sense of the sequence.</span> <span id="s1700">You talk of -- you talk of mass chaos, basically, people being forced into the territory of the ghetto and those who don’t have a room or a place are left in the streets, and if they’re in the streets, then they’re taken to Lukiškės prison and then from there they’re taken to Paneriai, but people don’t know that yet.</span> <span id="s1701">Is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">Q: And then when these two children, the three people, but two of them children, come to, you know, to the Jewish hospital in Vilnius, your father sees them, is that already when the ghetto has been established, even in its early days, or is that before the establishment of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">A: Before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">Q: Before.</span> <span id="s1706">So there’s no ghetto yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">A: Before.</span> <span id="s1708">No ghetto yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">Q: Is it after the time he was supposed to have been taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">A: After.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">Q: After.</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">A: After.</span> <span id="s1713">Because at the time that he was supposed to be taken, he was still working for health department.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">A: See?</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">Q: Okay, so then -- so the -- this is where I’d like to get mo -- a little bit more clarity.</span> <span id="s1717">So after that time your grandmother stays.</span> <span id="s1718">Your uncles --</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">A: Uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">Q: -- and father are saved by your mother.</span> <span id="s1721">And it’s by a hair’s breadth, but there they are.</span> <span id="s1722">Then did they come again for them?</span> <span id="s1723">Was there a second time when they were going to be put into the ghetto?</span> <span id="s1724">Do you understand, is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">A: No, I do -- I do --</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">A: I’m trying to figure out how [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1728">I’ll tell you what, the house was to -- supposed to be Jew free.</span> <span id="s1729">There was not supposed to be any more Jews in the building, see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">Q: So what happened when that hapunes left without his quarry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">A: Yeah, they -- he took all the others from the apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">Q: Okay, but then the rest of you stayed in it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">A: Mama and I and uncle and grandmother, we stayed in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">Q: So it wasn't Jew free, in reality?</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">A: In reality, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1737">And that’s where you stayed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">A: That’s where we stayed until … Mama decided it was too dangerous to stay, for me.</span> <span id="s1739">We got a room Kalinauskas Gatvė, in Kalinauskas Street, in an apartment where the owner of the apartment was a refugee from Poland, from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1740">Another room was take --</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">Q: A Polish Gentile refugee.</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">A: Polish Gentile refugees.</span> <span id="s1743">Another room was by a -- also Polish refugee from Warsaw, of German extraction.</span> <span id="s1744">And third room was ours.</span> <span id="s1745">We moved out because you -- y -- it was too da -- dangerous to be there.</span> <span id="s1746">It wasn’t easy to get rooms.</span> <span id="s1747">It was through the help of a Lithuanian person who knew who we are and who helped us to get a room.</span> <span id="s1748">In those you had the -- you -- that was a leftover of Soviet regulations, you had a certain area and you had a person in charge of that area.</span> <span id="s1749">So he was a person who worked in the administrative office, and he helped us to get a room because he knew our situation.</span> <span id="s1750">So that’s where we moved out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">Q: By that point -- excuse me, let me back up a little bit, I want to focus a little bit on your gram -- on your father’s family.</span> <span id="s1752">You had said earlier that your grandfather had been an invalid.</span> <span id="s1753">By the time 1941 rolled around, was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">A: He wasn’t there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">Q: He was -- he had already passed away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1757">He passed away, oh, he -- he passed away somewhere -- I just remember my father wearing the black on his sleeve; that was, you know, custom in Europe.</span> <span id="s1758">I must have been around, no more than nine - 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">Q: Okay, so mid-30’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">Q: Mid-30’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">A: He passed away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">A: But in ghetto, in the first time when I came in, in one room we had grandmother, father, uncle, his wife, newborn baby, a cousin, her husband, her mother.</span> <span id="s1765">So we had eight people in a room let’s say like from here to here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">Q: A small room.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">A: Eight people in that room, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">Q: That’s when we get to the ghetto, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">Q: -- your father had four brothers, one of whom was with you in Vilnius, Solomon --</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">Q: -- with his wife, pregnant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">Q: And wer -- whe-where were the other two brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">A: The sh -- Siauliai brother --</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">A: -- was in Siauliai with his wife and newborn baby, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">Q: And his name is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">A: Ephrain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">Q: Ephrain was in Siauliai, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">A: Yeah, Siauliai.</span> <span id="s1784">Now, the youngest brother --</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">Q: Reuben.</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">A: Reuben had a very strange story.</span> <span id="s1787">He was betrothed to get married, and in the first day of deportation --</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">Q: To Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">A: Yeah, in the first day of deportation, they took hi -- the family of -- his fiancée and her family.</span> <span id="s1790">He was getting out of his mind.</span> <span id="s1791">So he said, I’m going to beg an -- KGB to let me follow the transport.</span> <span id="s1792">Mama said look, don’t even try.</span> <span id="s1793">It won’t work.</span> <span id="s1794">The KGB is not going to let you follow the transport.</span> <span id="s1795">So he said to me, go with me, I know where their offices are, private, not official.</span> <span id="s1796">You stay on the other side of the street.</span> <span id="s1797">If I don’t come out, so you know that I didn’t come out.</span> <span id="s1798">Anyway, I was waiting across the street, he came --</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">Q: This is still in Kaunas?</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">A: Still in Kaunas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">A: That was before, the first night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">A: So he said they wouldn't even t-talk.</span> <span id="s1805">No, that’s no and no.</span> <span id="s1806">So, when the war started, he took my bicycle and he told my mother’s sister that, listen, I’ll try, maybe I’ll catch up with the train.</span> <span id="s1807">The trains are not going very fast, they’re overloaded.</span> <span id="s1808">Maybe I’ll catch up with my fiancée on the train.</span> <span id="s1809">And from that day on, we never heard anything about him.</span> <span id="s1810">Later on, somebody told us that he did manage to get to Soviet Union, but whether he found her or not, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1811">But he never returned.</span> <span id="s1812">So, that means --</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">Q: He disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">A: He disappeared, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">Q: And you never found out what happened to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1817">I -- I looked at the 16th division.</span> <span id="s1818">The 16th division had all their Lithuanian citizens in 16th division.</span> <span id="s1819">Nobody knew that he was in divis --</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">Q: The 16th division was a Soviet army --</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">A: Soviet army, 16th division --</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">Q: -- partisan [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">A: Yes, but he wasn’t there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1825">He wasn’t there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">A: So we figured that -- my aunt told him that, don’t take anything, just take the bicycle and go.</span> <span id="s1827">But he wanted to take some clothing and this and that on -- on my bicycle.</span> <span id="s1828">So he said look, they’ll kill you for the bicycle, don’t take anything, just as -- if you can, peddle as much as you can.</span> <span id="s1829">But we don’t know, you know, what happened to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">Q: And -- and yet, you say somebody told you that he did make it to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">A: Somebody told as if --</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">A: -- you know, like as if my father is buried here, or as if my father is buried there.</span> <span id="s1834">It’s nothing that -- to tie together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">Q: Yeah, not really reliable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">A: Mm-hm, no, no, no, not reliable at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">Q: What a sad thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">A: Yeah, sad thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">Q: Very sad thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">A: He was crazy when they deported her, just crazy.</span> <span id="s1841">Well, you know, so, that’s life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">Q: So there are three brothers --</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">A: Three brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">Q: -- and your grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">A: And her, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">Q: And they were all -- except -- except for your uncle in Siauliai --</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">Q: -- everybody was in Vilnius.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">A: Everybody was in Vilnius.</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">Q: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">Q: At this point it might sound a little odd that I ask this question, but it’s been on my mind as we’ve been talking.</span> <span id="s1853">How do you identify yourself?</span> <span id="s1854">What was your identity?</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">A: You know, I grew up Lithuanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">Q: Was there any part of you where you felt Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">A: Not that I felt Jewish, but I mean, I had a lot of solidarity, I had a lot of -- you know, it’s -- it’s very difficult to define.</span> <span id="s1858">You stand in the middle of two sides.</span> <span id="s1859">You don’t take any sides.</span> <span id="s1860">If it’s necessary you’re here, if it’s necessary you’re here, and that’s how you grow up.</span> <span id="s1861">I was never influenced by one side to be against another side.</span> <span id="s1862">So I -- I really cannot tell you, but I grew up Lithuanian, but at the same time I have a lot in common with the Jewish nation.</span> <span id="s1863">I know much more -- when my cousin of the -- the Uncle Ephrain’s daughter, when they finally eve -- returned from Vorkuta and when he found his family and when she came to visit me, she knew nothing about Jewish customs or anything.</span> <span id="s1864">I took her to synagogue and she just looked around.</span> <span id="s1865">I showed her, though the custom [indecipherable] everything which we all -- we all know here, she had no idea, she grew up in Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1866">But at the same time I tried -- we have a very large population in West Hartford of refugees from Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1867">We don’t call them Jewish, we call them Russians.</span> <span id="s1868">I do a lot for them.</span> <span id="s1869">And th-that’s -- you know, when my mother went to see f -- Prime Minister Kubilunas, and when she came back and she was asking my father, please do not accept any official position.</span> <span id="s1870">Be a private person.</span> <span id="s1871">Because his military friends wanted him to get out and stay in Lithuania, in the states, and forget the thing.</span> <span id="s1872">And then one day he told my mother, you know what, wh-whichever things were, whichever things are, I see how my nation is suffering, I cannot do it.</span> <span id="s1873">I cannot go into hiding and leave things the way they are in ghetto, because there was a chaos.</span> <span id="s1874">Can you imagine the Judenrat?</span> <span id="s1875">Judenrat was a representative of each Jewish organization.</span> <span id="s1876">There were so many [indecipherable] and Bundists and whatever you want, all Jewish gentlemen with big beards.</span> <span id="s1877">Can you imagine a German officer coming to talk to them?</span> <span id="s1878">It -- it wasn’t possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">Q: Is this what your father was saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">A: It wasn’t possible.</span> <span id="s1881">They spoke Polish, they spoke Yiddish, they didn’t speak German.</span> <span id="s1882">And they knew that in the hospital there’s something organized.</span> <span id="s1883">Working, and working very, very well.</span> <span id="s1884">He surrounded himself, since we didn't know the Polish Jews, he surrounded himself with Jews from Kaunas.</span> <span id="s1885">And they really had a atmosphere of work.</span> <span id="s1886">The first German request from the hospital for so many people, he had a separate section for syphilitics.</span> <span id="s1887">So, you don’t play God, but you try to do something.</span> <span id="s1888">So the first German request got the syphilitics.</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">Q: Do you remember how many people that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">Q: Did he talk about it at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">A: Well, he explained to my mother, that in order to save healthy people, cause the syphilitics didn’t have very long to live one way or the other, and he was afraid to spread syphilis.</span> <span id="s1893">The Germans didn’t know that they were syphilitics, but they -- that’s what Germans received, syphilitics.</span> <span id="s1894">And that was his idea all the time, to save whatever he can.</span> <span id="s1895">He believed, which was really very strange, he told to teach the children Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1896">And the population was aghast, what for?</span> <span id="s1897">What do they need the Hebrew for, they’re going to die.</span> <span id="s1898">So he said, they may die, and they may survive.</span> <span id="s1899">If they survive, where do you think they’ll want to stay, in Vilnius?</span> <span id="s1900">It’s -- it’s -- that’s you -- you know, place of their families?</span> <span id="s1901">They’ll want to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1902">They should stop talking in Jewish, they should learn Hebrew, so if a day comes and God willing they are s -- living, they can integrate themselves into the Israeli society.</span> <span id="s1903">See, he had different ideas from the others.</span> <span id="s1904">He discussed with the rabbinical committee in -- in ghetto, about how he is doing it.</span> <span id="s1905">Because naturally they say you cannot play God.</span> <span id="s1906">But he told them, look, I am giving, for example, 20 li -- li -- documents for life for the hospital doctors.</span> <span id="s1907">And I don’t know these doctors in person, they were all Polish doctors.</span> <span id="s1908">I lined them up in line and I tell the youngest ones, which in my opinion, by face and by the physique, look the youngest ones, I tell the 20 come forward.</span> <span id="s1909">So he says to my mother, how would you think, Elenka?</span> <span id="s1910">Should I save a young doctor who may survive and have children, or should I pick out a famous professor who is 80 years old?</span> <span id="s1911">Now what would you do in my place?</span> <span id="s1912">And you know, I was right there during the conversation.</span> <span id="s1913">Mama said, you know, I -- I cannot tell you how to behave.</span> <span id="s1914">But it’s very difficult for my father to pick out who lives, who doesn’t live.</span> <span id="s1915">But in a way, he had his opinion about it, that the strongest will survive, whether survive in ghetto or whether later on in the forest, but you have to give them a chance.</span> <span id="s1916">Now, what chance can you give an 80 year old professor?</span> <span id="s1917">See, that was how he was -- how he would [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">Q: You were part of these conversations at home --</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">Q: -- at age 14 - 15.</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">A: Four -- age 14 - 15, yeah, absolutely, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1922">We had a lot of these conversations with [indecipherable] Panana Šimaitė.</span> <span id="s1923">You know about her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">Q: Can you tell us about her?</span> <span id="s1925">Who was she?</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">A: I found out who was she from the Lithuanian press now in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1927">There was an article by her brother who for the first time said that she was a communist.</span> <span id="s1928">I do -- I believe I still have the newspaper.</span> <span id="s1929">Panana Šimaitė was a librarian in Vilnius University.</span> <span id="s1930">And Panana Šimaitė like us, had a permission to enter ghetto from Major Bourakas, another officer.</span> <span id="s1931">And he gave her permission to enter ghetto as if she’s studying the Jewish old literature.</span> <span id="s1932">And we met her in ghetto.</span> <span id="s1933">She was hiding a group of Jewish people in the attic of Vilnius University library.</span> <span id="s1934">In summer it wasn’t so bad, but in winter it was awfully cold.</span> <span id="s1935">Getting food in was one thing, getting waste out was another thing.</span> <span id="s1936">So Panana Šimaitė regularly, on the clock, was in our place at four o’clock in the afternoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">Q: In the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">A: No --</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1940">A: -- that was out.</span> <span id="s1941">And my father would come for dinner around four o’clock.</span> <span id="s1942">So shem -- Šimaitė and my father, they would always get into all kinds of political conversation and this and that.</span> <span id="s1943">And sure -- I remember one day my father said, you know, I am pretty sure that she is a member of communist party.</span> <span id="s1944">By her attitude, by you know, her answers and so on.</span> <span id="s1945">But that didn’t -- that didn’t scare us away.</span> <span id="s1946">The thing was that Panana Šimaitė used to come and get food every day, and we -- she had such a metal -- metal little, like a bucket.</span> <span id="s1947">And she would get a bucket full of food and carry to the attic, to the Vilnius, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">Q: And that’s when he was still director of the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s1949">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">Q: That’s when he’s already --</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">A: He was already the head of the ghetto, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">A: And that was day after day after day.</span> <span id="s1954">Why did we start talking about Šimaitė now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">Q: Something -- something jiggled your memory.</span> <span id="s1956">But we’ll come back to her.</span> <span id="s1957">I want to go back to the other question that I had when I asked you how did you identify yourself, because I had a follow-up question, and that is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">A: Now, I would say I -- I identified myself Lithuanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">Q: When you saw -- when you saw the chaos in Vilnius and you saw Jews being expelled from their apartments and Poles standing on the street and making fun, and the Lithuanian collaborators who were there, who were part of this expulsion, not doing it -- I mean actually doing it, not seeming to care very much, did any feelings go through you?</span> <span id="s1960">Did you ever think to yourself, how could they do such a thing?</span> <span id="s1961">Do they not see what’s going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">A: I -- I don’t think this was -- this was less because of religion or nationality.</span> <span id="s1963">I think that would be for a person unbelievable to watch from a point of human attitude.</span> <span id="s1964">You didn’t have to be a Jew or a Czech or a French, just to be treated like that.</span> <span id="s1965">I mean, it was a double -- you know, it was a double, the way I was brought up, in a humane way, to watch that was beyond your understanding.</span> <span id="s1966">It’s not just that because the people were Jewish, because they were people.</span> <span id="s1967">They were not cattle, they were not animals, they were people.</span> <span id="s1968">To watch people doing that to people, that was very difficult to watch.</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">Q: I know.</span> <span id="s1970">But earlier you said, when we were talking about what befell people when the Soviets came in and what befell people when the Germans came in, you were explaining that there was this hatred Jews because there had been some on the streets waving red flags.</span> <span id="s1971">And as a -- as an explanation as to why there was anti-Semitism, as an explanation as to why there was hatred, and for many people who were not there, who did not live through these times, that kind of explanation seems to hold very little water, exactly for the reason you just said right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">A: Well, that was po-political, I would say.</span> <span id="s1973">You see, we didn’t see the night deportations.</span> <span id="s1974">Whatever we heard after mostly was that Russian soldiers were correct.</span> <span id="s1975">The ones that came and told people pack up your stuff and go into the truck.</span> <span id="s1976">What we knew, what was going on in the building of KGB, that people were tortured, and they found later the traces of it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">Q: But wa -- again, I go back to, why would that be, if the soldiers were correct, then why would this kind of hatred, why would this kind of -- of anger be directed at a Jewish population?</span> <span id="s1978">And I mean in the sense of explanations later, when people are explaining things to themselves -- you’re sitting in Vilnius and you’re seeing the chaos of what’s happening, and you weren't saying to yourself, oh it’s because they waved red flags when the Soviets were coming in, you were seeing people being dehumanized.</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">A: This is one thing, but the cooperation didn’t have to be so voluntarily.</span> <span id="s1980">The cooperation was a -- I would say a result of the red flags, of the heads of political personnel --</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">Q: Whose cooperation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">A: Lithuanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">Q: Lithuanian cooperation --</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">Q: -- was not so voluntary, are you saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">A: No, I say -- I say this -- this is what it is.</span> <span id="s1987">It didn’t have to be so voluntarily.</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">Q: So you mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">A: It didn’t have --</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">Q: -- they wouldn’t have collaborated had they not seen --</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">A: -- I -- I believe st -- very strongly that the two weeks before that, if the deportations wouldn’t be there, if we wouldn’t have had a whole year of political personnel treatment, of not having a right to live where you are, of having everything confiscated of what you ha -- End of Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">Beginning Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">Q: Maybe I’ll repeat a little of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">Q: Of a -- you were a person who was integrated into Lithuanian society, who was part of it, and were more familiar with different communities than most people were.</span> <span id="s1996">And here, all of a sudden in 1941, you see a huge inhumanity take place.</span> <span id="s1997">You see -- you see Lithuanians who you’ve grown up with and you are part of, come and want to take your father away.</span> <span id="s1998">And others -- even if not those particular soldiers, others who took other people away.</span> <span id="s1999">And some of them robbed them as they were doing it, and pocketed the jewelry and so on.</span> <span id="s2000">How does one explain that to oneself about the culture one has come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">A: I don’t believe you can explain.</span> <span id="s2002">I s -- think maybe you could say what motivated them to do it.</span> <span id="s2003">Motivation can be all kinds, could be greed, could be jealousy.</span> <span id="s2004">There was no hatred such in Lithuania per se, there was no hatred.</span> <span id="s2005">We received our independence from the Polish -- from the Russian Tsars regime.</span> <span id="s2006">Russia is famous.</span> <span id="s2007">The first pogroms were in Russia.</span> <span id="s2008">We didn't have a word pogrom in our language per se, we didn’t use that word.</span> <span id="s2009">We never had pogroms in our country.</span> <span id="s2010">The Russians were not able to switch that ugly behavior of theirs in our territory.</span> <span id="s2011">But the seeds probably remained.</span> <span id="s2012">On one side they lived as neighbors, very well together.</span> <span id="s2013">Again, please -- I remember that during the Russian Tsars time, the Jewish people were not allowed to own land.</span> <span id="s2014">And the reason they all went into business was not because they wanted to be business people, they were not allowed to work the land.</span> <span id="s2015">So one came with the other.</span> <span id="s2016">So naturally, if he was, say, a tailor or shoemaker or he was bringing in his drosken kucher, some kind of merchandise to the farmers, that was the only way to survive.</span> <span id="s2017">So after so many years of Russian occupation, the first one, the Tsaristic occupation, that remains.</span> <span id="s2018">Now naturally, if you are a poor farmer and you work from four o’clock in the morning til late at night, and ri -- next door your Jewish tailor is doing a good business sewing and this and that and he doesn’t have to get up and milk his cows and maybe that brought some kind of a jealousy?</span> <span id="s2019">But we never had incidents in our villages, in our towns.</span> <span id="s2020">We never had a Jewish Lithuanian incidents.</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">Q: So tell me, when you have the hapunes come by --</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">Q: -- these collaborators --</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">Q: -- come by, what do you think motivated them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">A: Deportations and red flags.</span> <span id="s2027">I’ll sti --</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">Q: Deportations and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2029">A: Red flags.</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">Q: -- and red flags.</span></p> <p><span id="s2031">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2032">I’ll stick to that.</span> <span id="s2033">Cause I was one of those.</span> <span id="s2034">It’s -- except that I -- I couldn’t [indecipherable] as low as that, but the feeling inside was awful.</span> <span id="s2035">The feeling inside was awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">Q: That there were people who would to -- betray your country --</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">Q: -- betray your other -- but why would it ha -- okay, all right, but when you look at documents later, you -- people say that they were all nationalities who are part of this great Soviet experiment, not just the Jewish nationality.</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">A: No, and I told you before, according to percentage, according to figures, the bigger percentage of Jewish population was deported in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s2040">You see, out of the total.</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">A: There was not 30 percent of Lithuanians deported, but there were 30 percent of Jewish population deported.</span> <span id="s2043">So it’s not logical, because actually there were very many friendships in Siberia that we Jews helping Lithuanians, Lithuanians helping the Jews, the old way, the way it was before in the country.</span> <span id="s2044">Because they were all thrown into the same kettle.</span></p> <p><span id="s2045">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2046">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">A: So there -- there is no explanation.</span> <span id="s2048">We can go back to Tsaristic times, to that Tsaristic hatred, to Tsarist -- Tsaristic pogroms.</span> <span id="s2049">But again explain why didn’t we have a pogrom in our country?</span> <span id="s2050">Not a single one.</span> <span id="s2051">We -- we knew the word, we knew the concept, but we never used the word in our language.</span> <span id="s2052">See, that’s what very strange, wa -- how suddenly -- I have only my personal explanation is deportations and red flags.</span> <span id="s2053">That really made, you know, the [indecipherable] in a very ugly way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s2055">We’ll break right now for lunch and then we’ll come back to the story itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2056">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2058">You know, I [tape break].</span> <span id="s2059">Okay, I’d like to get a better sense, even though we’ve talked and -- and touched on this before, of the transition from your father being head of -- the director of the Jewish hospital to being appointed head of the Jewish police.</span> <span id="s2060">Can you tell me about the sequence of those events?</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">A: I mentioned that Mama went to talk to the Prime Minister ku -- Kubilunas and before she left she begged my father not to take any official duties.</span> <span id="s2062">Not to be tied, so that his name wouldn’t figure anywhere and in case of necessity she could take him out and that’s it.</span> <span id="s2063">When Mama came back, he told her exact words, “I’m sorry, these are my people.</span> <span id="s2064">I couldn’t refuse.”</span> <span id="s2065">I mentioned before that there was a Jewish committee of o -- el-elders and they were not able to grab [indecipherable] chaos.</span> <span id="s2066">People everywhere, people on the street, no food, nothing.</span> <span id="s2067">They just were completely lost.</span> <span id="s2068">And they heard that somebody is in the hospital and keeps the hospital very firmly, there’s an order.</span> <span id="s2069">So they came to talk to my father and they begged him, they begged him please, we are out of means, we don’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s2070">So he took it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">Q: Were you in the room when he said this to your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">Q: Do you remember how you reacted to this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">A: I didn’t react, but Mama -- Mama went pale.</span> <span id="s2075">Mama went pale.</span> <span id="s2076">So she told him, well, you know, you did what you decided to do, but you realize that that’s it.</span> <span id="s2077">There’s no way, now that you’ll be known to the Germans, that we can take you out and leave the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2078">There’s no question about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">Q: You were living in the ghetto at the time already?</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">A: No, we were coming in and out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">A: He started right away to organize.</span> <span id="s2083">People had to be placed somewhere.</span> <span id="s2084">I mentioned that in a tiny room there were eight of his family, and that was very good.</span> <span id="s2085">People were living 20 next to each other.</span> <span id="s2086">There was no way what to do.</span> <span id="s2087">He had to find a way how to straighten everything, how to organize food, how to organize cleanliness.</span> <span id="s2088">Rubbish collection.</span> <span id="s2089">Can you imagine to throw so many people into one place without anything, no administration?</span> <span id="s2090">And so he started.</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">Q: Were the borders already defined of what the ghetto was?</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">A: Oh, it was boarded up.</span> <span id="s2093">It was boarded up, there were no borders like in Kaunas, it was -- they started to board up early in the morning, by the evening everything was boarded up.</span> <span id="s2094">The windows that faced Vilnius’s streets were boarded too.</span> <span id="s2095">Every gate, every entrance was wor -- boarded up.</span> <span id="s2096">So anyway, he surrounded himself mostly with Jews from Lithuania that he knew.</span> <span id="s2097">But he asked the elders, please give me a [indecipherable] from Vilnius, from polis -- Polish side that I could work with, because Papa didn’t speak any Polish.</span> <span id="s2098">Wh-Who in Lithuania spoke Polish?</span> <span id="s2099">Nobody.</span> <span id="s2100">So they introduced Mr. Dessler.</span> <span id="s2101">And Dessler’s old family was very known in Vilnius, very decent family.</span> <span id="s2102">I cannot -- I cannot tell negative or positive about Mr. Dessler.</span> <span id="s2103">I can only repeat what people were talking and what my aunt saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">Q: Your aunt being your mother’s sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2106">I was told by Father, together with Mama, that please do not discuss anything we’re talking about at home where -- when Mr. Dessler is present.</span> <span id="s2107">And that was enough for us.</span> <span id="s2108">And later, I don’t know how much there is truth in it or not, people are blaming Mr. Dessler for my father’s untimely death.</span> <span id="s2109">Nobody knows why they shot him, whether to start the liquidation, they figured with him present would be very difficult to start liquidation.</span> <span id="s2110">Whether they found out that he’s sending people to the forests.</span> <span id="s2111">Whether they found out that he knows how to procure guns, we don’t know.</span> <span id="s2112">We don’t know -- we know from people that he was shot by the chief of the Gestapo, Neugebauer.</span> <span id="s2113">We don’t know where are his remains.</span> <span id="s2114">We were told by people that he was buried in Rasų kapi, the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">Q: That’s right, a cemetery that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">A: Cemetery of [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2117">And they put some plates, glass plates into the place of burial.</span> <span id="s2118">I went to Rasų kapi, talked to the caretakers, they said they’d never heard of anybody being brought by Gestapo into -- so anyway, there is no place.</span> <span id="s2119">We don’t know anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">Q: You don’t know where he was shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s2122">We know that he was shot at the Gestapo building in Vilnius.</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">Q: And the Gestapo building in Vilnius was where?</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">A: [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2125">What was the street name?</span> <span id="s2126">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s2127">If you know where the students -- students live on the -- on the hill.</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">Q: Orlando gartay?</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">A: No, no, no, right in the center of Vilnius.</span> <span id="s2130">[speaks Lithuanian]</span></p> <p><span id="s2131">Q: This I wouldn’t know.</span> <span id="s2132">I mean where is --</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">A: It’s -- it’s one of the side streets from the main street.</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2135">I thought it was where the KGB building was, too, the same building.</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">A: Wa -- the same thing, same building.</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">Q: It’s the same building, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2138">A: Same building, right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">Q: I see, so it’s at Lukiškės Square.</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">A: Befo --</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">Q: It’s a building -- building near Lukiškės Square?</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">A: But i -- co-coming from Cathedral --</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">Q: That’s [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">A: -- going straight, it would be to the left.</span></p> <p><span id="s2145">Q: Correct, that building.</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">A: Little street, that’s -- that’s it, that was the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2147">Q: So that’s the building that your father was shot at.</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">A: -- that’s the building was shot, right.</span> <span id="s2149">Now, so he warned us to be careful what you talk, what we are talking at home in his presence.</span> <span id="s2150">How -- what’s the role of Dessler, I cannot blame because I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2151">People didn’t talk very nicely of him.</span> <span id="s2152">Now, when he -- they introduced Mr. Dessler to Papa [indecipherable], Father tried to find out more military personnel.</span> <span id="s2153">He found Polish Major Vucht.</span> <span id="s2154">He found Polish Captain Bagle.</span> <span id="s2155">He found [indecipherable] Lieutenant Nikadrasin.</span> <span id="s2156">Anyway, whoever was from military, he took right away to work.</span> <span id="s2157">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s2158">Q: In what capacity?</span></p> <p><span id="s2159">A: Police.</span> <span id="s2160">Order.</span> <span id="s2161">Now, by the way, Captain Bagle, I knew from Papa hundred percent.</span> <span id="s2162">Father had a walking stick.</span> <span id="s2163">He had two pieces.</span> <span id="s2164">One he handed to Captain Bagle, one he kept himself.</span> <span id="s2165">The historic pictures from ghetto were in these two walking sticks.</span> <span id="s2166">When I met Vilik, Captain Bagle’s son, who was my very close friend in ghetto, I met -- met him in New York, my first question was Vilik, what happened to your father’s walking stick?</span> <span id="s2167">He said I -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2168">No idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">Q: So the photographs in those sticks --</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">Q: -- from the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">A: From the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2173">Papa had a very good photographer who was instructed to historically, in pictures, to show the life in ghetto.</span> <span id="s2174">So Vilik didn’t know anything, and Papa’s thing disappeared.</span> <span id="s2175">I’ll tell you later what I was able to find.</span> <span id="s2176">So that’s how he started the administration, and you see, Kaunas and Vilnius had the completely different histories.</span> <span id="s2177">Kaunas had barbed wire and Germans inside and at the gates.</span> <span id="s2178">Vilnius had no barbed wire, because everything was boarded up.</span> <span id="s2179">Vilnius had one Lithuanian policemen.</span> <span id="s2180">If you’ve seen pictures of the ghetto gate, there is one police -- little booth where the policemen stood and saluted my father.</span> <span id="s2181">So he tried to avoid the fate of Kaunas ghetto by having Germans stand at the gate, because Kaunas didn’t have forests.</span> <span id="s2182">Vilnius had big forests in the vicinity and very many Jewish survivors were hiding in those forests.</span> <span id="s2183">And when finally it was little bit quieter in ghetto, and people weren’t taken constantly to be shot, these people started to come back to ghetto to survive, because it seemed that it’s nice and peaceful.</span> <span id="s2184">And people didn’t realize that we used to get ration cards only for official number of inhabitants.</span> <span id="s2185">And the unofficial people had to be fed.</span> <span id="s2186">And how would you feed unofficial people when it’s not enough for official people?</span> <span id="s2187">So Vilnius had a completely different situation.</span> <span id="s2188">Now, through my father’s connection with Lietukis --</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">Q: With [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">A: -- for so many years --</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">A: He, for example would get a shipment of frozen potatoes.</span> <span id="s2193">The Germans would be told that potatoes are frozen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">Q: They’re no good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">A: No good for public consumption.</span> <span id="s2196">The Germans -- and they say, can we throw it to ghetto?</span> <span id="s2197">And Germans would say yes, you can throw it to ghetto.</span> <span id="s2198">That’s how -- but that wasn’t all, you had to feed thousands, it wasn’t in hundreds, it was thousands.</span> <span id="s2199">So the only thing was to get illegally food to ghetto.</span> <span id="s2200">You must have heard -- and in the -- in -- in writing too, the very, very, I would say rough treatment of people coming back from work at ghetto gates.</span> <span id="s2201">And you would -- I heard myself, standing across the street on the sidewalk, Polish people talking, why do you need Germans in here?</span> <span id="s2202">Look how the Jews are treating the Jews.</span> <span id="s2203">That was my father’s idea, to make it look so bad that the Germans wouldn’t need to bring either Ukrainians or Lithuanians or Latvians to the ghetto gates, because if you would have either one of those people at the gates, these people would die from hunger.</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">Q: So in other words, what would -- I’ll back up just a little bit.</span> <span id="s2205">As far as anybody else guarding those gates, it was one Lithuanian soldier --</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">A: He had nothing to do with the gates.</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">Q: -- in a booth, and that was it.</span> <span id="s2208">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2209">A: He was just standing on the side, he had a little booth, and he was stuck in that booth, that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2210">Q: And there were no German soldiers around?</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">A: No German soldiers.</span> <span id="s2212">But, by having Jewish police behave the way they behaved, Father escaped having Germans at the gate.</span> <span id="s2213">Now, nop -- I never --</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">Q: Did you see how they behaved?</span> <span id="s2215">Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2216">A: Oh, sure I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2217">Q: What did they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s2218">A: I’ll -- I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s2219">Father had meetings of the leaders of the brigade.</span> <span id="s2220">And the leaders were handed in a plan.</span> <span id="s2221">If two go through, the third one will be hit.</span> <span id="s2222">Three go through, the fourth one will be hit.</span> <span id="s2223">So that, watching from outside you had a picture that the Jewish police is hitting returning workers because they find something.</span> <span id="s2224">And you would.</span> <span id="s2225">The two that go through, no food.</span> <span id="s2226">The third one, food.</span> <span id="s2227">The three, no food, the fourth one, food.</span> <span id="s2228">And every week there was a meeting of brigadiers with instructions how to bring food.</span> <span id="s2229">The only unfortunate case was when Mueller caught our singer, Luba Levitska.</span> <span id="s2230">She had a pound of green peas.</span> <span id="s2231">Green peas, now scientifically, has the same vitamins as meat.</span> <span id="s2232">Mueller happened to come to the gates and he caught her with a pound of peas.</span> <span id="s2233">And as much as my father tried to get her from Lukiškės, if it would have been a Gestapo case, he would be able to smuggle her out.</span> <span id="s2234">With a Gebiets commissar, the civilian case, he was not able and she wa -- was finally shot.</span> <span id="s2235">But anyway, there was a system how to get food.</span> <span id="s2236">Another thing was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2237">Q: Can I -- I’m sorry --</span></p> <p><span id="s2238">A: Yeah, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s2239">Q: -- that I’m stepping back, but I wanted to understand this.</span> <span id="s2240">The work brigade is told that every third and then every fourth, and every x person --</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">Q: -- is gonna be hit.</span></p> <p><span id="s2243">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2244">Q: And that two should have no food and the third should have food?</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2246">Q: So they find food on that person?</span></p> <p><span id="s2247">A: No, no, they --</span></p> <p><span id="s2248">Q: Or it’s the first two have the food --</span></p> <p><span id="s2249">A: The -- the first two -- the first two are making up, they are getting [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2250">Q: They’re getting food in.</span></p> <p><span id="s2251">A: -- to the left and to the right, and the third one goes through.</span></p> <p><span id="s2252">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2254">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2255">A: But the picture from outside, the people that know to count one, two or three, looking from outside it looks awful.</span> <span id="s2256">A Jewish policeman hitting a Jewish worker.</span> <span id="s2257">And you don’t figure two or three goes through, but main thing is, two get hit, third one brings food inside.</span> <span id="s2258">Because bringing the food and getting caught was punished.</span> <span id="s2259">Punished by death.</span></p> <p><span id="s2260">Q: Okay, so he would catch people who just never happened --</span></p> <p><span id="s2261">A: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s2262">Q: -- to have any food on them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s2264">And the third one or the fourth one, but there was a plan, they -- they -- the head of the brigade knew the plan.</span> <span id="s2265">Now, for example, the older brigades came on the wide [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2266">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2267">A: -- it was in Polish.</span> <span id="s2268">If there happened that either Gestapo or Murer was at the gate, Mama would go to one direction, I would go to another direction.</span> <span id="s2269">We had only three words to tell, Murer colo brani.</span> <span id="s2270">Murer at the gates.</span> <span id="s2271">Everybody would lower their food on the street, because that meant death, you see.</span> <span id="s2272">So that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2273">Q: So you were in some ways involved in the bringing of food into the ghetto, in the ver --</span></p> <p><span id="s2274">A: I-In -- well, not in directly, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s2275">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2276">A: -- warning, warning not to bring food to the gates until it’s clear, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">Q: Let’s talk a little bit about how -- how you saw what you did, because that’s a little murky at this point in the story, because what we’ve seen -- what we’ve heard so far is that you’re living outside the ghetto, your father is appointed head of the police, and we’ve dropped that part of the story.</span> <span id="s2278">Bring us up to date on what ha -- where did your mother end up living, where did you end up living?</span> <span id="s2279">You -- we mentioned before your grandmother -- your father’s mother and your uncle, where were you all placed in -- in this geographical scheme of things?</span></p> <p><span id="s2280">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s2281">Father had one tiny room.</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">Q: In the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">A: In the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2284">As the chief of police.</span> <span id="s2285">Next to that tiny room was a door, regular door, to a large room, where about 30 people lived.</span> <span id="s2286">Upstairs was one little room.</span> <span id="s2287">My uncle, his wife, the baby and Grandmother, in one little room.</span> <span id="s2288">Now, we had an apartment across the street from ghetto, I would say maybe 200 yards away, Gėlių Gatvė</span></p> <p><span id="s2289">Q: Flower Street.</span></p> <p><span id="s2290">A: That was Flower Street.</span> <span id="s2291">Now we’re coming to a person I would like to talk about.</span> <span id="s2292">The whole area was in the hand of a Lithuanian Major Narusias.</span> <span id="s2293">That whole -- whole section, including the area where ghetto was.</span> <span id="s2294">A -- Murer used to come very often to ghetto to check on non-working population, because there was supposed to be no non-working population.</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">Q: Tell us who is Murer?</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">A: Oh Gebiets commissar [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">Q: Oh, he was the assistant --</span></p> <p><span id="s2298">A: Assistant to Hingst.</span></p> <p><span id="s2299">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2300">The -- the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2301">A: Assistant to Hingst, yeah Gebiets commissar.</span></p> <p><span id="s2302">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">A: And there was an instruction during the day, whoever didn’t work and had no working scheins, not to walk the streets.</span> <span id="s2304">So not make an impression that there are plenty people who are not workers.</span> <span id="s2305">But it was impossible in a room like that, there were bunkbeds.</span> <span id="s2306">In a room like that would be at least 30 people.</span> <span id="s2307">You had to put them somewhere.</span> <span id="s2308">Now, Narusias was Papa’s friend.</span> <span id="s2309">So he went to him and said, look, Stefan, there are buildings outside the ghetto where nobody lives.</span> <span id="s2310">Nobody wants to live to -- th -- next to Jewish ghetto.</span> <span id="s2311">Why don’t you talk to the Germans, explain to them that these buildings are getting ruined.</span> <span id="s2312">No heat, water seeps in.</span> <span id="s2313">Tell the Germans that you would like to attach those buildings to the ghetto area.</span> <span id="s2314">That proposition costed my father a lot in gold, in diamonds.</span> <span id="s2315">But Narusias went to the Germans and he attached a big area to the ghetto, so that first of all you wouldn’t have 30 people in a room.</span> <span id="s2316">You had already place to breathe, and you wouldn't see so many people on the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s2317">Q: Wa -- can you tell me, do you know the particular buildings and the particular streets that were attached?</span> <span id="s2318">What streets they were --</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">A: I-If you come -- if you come through the gates, the left side.</span> <span id="s2320">From the gates to the left, that was the area.</span></p> <p><span id="s2321">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2322">So it would be -- it would be streets that would go towards the church of Saint Michael and Sionta Mykoloyos, or it would be --</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">A: Oh, Mykoloyos Natan, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">Q: It would be going --</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">A: Well, it -- it was bordering Pino Gatvė.</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">Q: I know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2327">A: But f-further outside the ghetto wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s2328">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">A: Yeah, I -- I can’t know the -- remember all those names.</span> <span id="s2330">But anyway, that helped tremendously, and that was possible to do only through connections and through old friendships.</span></p> <p><span id="s2331">Q: And bribery.</span></p> <p><span id="s2332">A: Oh, sure, what you say.</span> <span id="s2333">Nobody would do it unless it -- but at least it gave results.</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2335">A: It gave tremendous results.</span> <span id="s2336">Now, he still had a problem with food, how to feed the people.</span> <span id="s2337">So he discussed with Germans the possibility to found more and more workshops.</span> <span id="s2338">And they agreed that they could have in ghetto a workshop for furniture.</span> <span id="s2339">They had their own telephone, they were not allowed to use city telephone, and they had all kinds of workshops, and they --</span></p> <p><span id="s2340">Q: The police had their own telephone?</span></p> <p><span id="s2341">A: Well they probably --</span></p> <p><span id="s2342">Q: The ghetto police.</span></p> <p><span id="s2343">A: -- probably, yeah.</span> <span id="s2344">Probably had.</span> <span id="s2345">And the Germans agreed to Father’s idea to take the boards from one of the door from previous stores, open the store with samples what the Jews can do in ghetto and what people can come and order to be done.</span> <span id="s2346">That was another outlet to get foods legally.</span></p> <p><span id="s2347">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2348">A: Legally, right, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s2349">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2350">A: -- they the -- you know, to get food.</span></p> <p><span id="s2351">Q: That’s right.</span> <span id="s2352">So they would make things to order.</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">A: To order, yes, but those people who came, at the same time it had people who had nothing to do with coming for order, they just smuggled food to ghetto.</span> <span id="s2354">But th -- until one day they caught a big shipment coming at night through the gates.</span> <span id="s2355">And they requested Father to give the guilty parties for arrest.</span> <span id="s2356">And there were two people in charge of that, Mr. Trapeida and Mr. Biniakonski.</span> <span id="s2357">When Papa called them in, they said commandant, you’re not going to be in charge of that.</span> <span id="s2358">We’re taking the responsibility and we’re going to Lukiškės.</span> <span id="s2359">You don’t know anything about the transport, you have nothing to do with it, so that in front of Germans your hands are clean.</span> <span id="s2360">So they took Mr. Trapeida and Mr. Biniakonski to Lukiškės jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s2361">Q: So these weren’t part pa -- these weren’t people from the ghetto, these were suppliers --</span></p> <p><span id="s2362">A: Ghetto -- ghetto -- ghetto people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2363">Q: These were ghetto people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2364">A: The Germans requested to give the culprits.</span> <span id="s2365">Who is in charge -- who is in charge of getting that food into ghetto through the gates.</span> <span id="s2366">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2367">Q: Okay, we’re going to have to -- End of Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s2368">Beginning Tape Seven</span></p> <p><span id="s2369">Q: Okay, so these two people who were as themselves ghetto inmates --</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2371">Q: -- went to your father --</span></p> <p><span id="s2372">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2373">Q: -- and said, we’ll offer ourselves up, basically.</span></p> <p><span id="s2374">A: And they told my father that -- they -- they called my father commandant.</span> <span id="s2375">[indecipherable] Commandant, you’re not going to take responsibility, we’re taking the responsibility.</span> <span id="s2376">They were in charge of the food supplies.</span> <span id="s2377">They said, whatever happens, we go, you stay.</span> <span id="s2378">They -- Father had to bring them, and they were brought to Lukiškės.</span> <span id="s2379">Thank God Father was able to buy them out.</span> <span id="s2380">They -- all wer -- they suffered was frozen toes.</span> <span id="s2381">Lukiškės had no heat and the winters in Vilnius are very, very --</span></p> <p><span id="s2382">Q: Cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s2383">A: -- cold.</span> <span id="s2384">So they finally got them out.</span> <span id="s2385">And usually -- it was always -- not always, but in many cases, possible to buy out from Gestapo arrest, but not from the Gebiets commissariat.</span> <span id="s2386">Whenever the civil SS -- SA, brown uniforms were involved, like Murer, you couldn’t do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2387">Q: So the Gestapo was more corruptible?</span> <span id="s2388">A: Gestapo you br -- corruptible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2390">A: Corruptible, yeah.</span> <span id="s2391">Now, in the Gebiets commissariat building, you know, there is a proverb that say that world is not without good people.</span> <span id="s2392">One day Father met a man, he looked familiar.</span> <span id="s2393">And then he said, Colonel Keenas.</span> <span id="s2394">He said yes, but now I am Colonel Kune.</span> <span id="s2395">Father’s friend from army.</span></p> <p><span id="s2396">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2397">A: When the Soviet came, there was repatriation to Germany, whoever could save himself finding an old aunt, and old grandmother from German descent, he went to Germany.</span> <span id="s2398">And that Colonel Kune is actually to be thanked for my life and for my mother’s life.</span> <span id="s2399">Every first of the month he was issuing my father two permissions, for Mama and for me separately, to use Lithuanian railway system.</span> <span id="s2400">You couldn’t go and buy a ticket to buy -- go on the train.</span> <span id="s2401">Every month on the [indecipherable] my father would bring us this permission to use the railways.</span> <span id="s2402">See, that’s all network of Lithuanian officers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">Q: But here I want to come to a point where it’s highly unusual that, in my mind, thinking that somebody who so the head o -- head of the ghetto police would be able to keep his wife and daughter outside the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s2404">A: Nobody knew.</span> <span id="s2405">Nobody knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2406">Q: Why didn’t they know?</span> <span id="s2407">How could they not know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2408">A: They didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">Q: So the Germans did not know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2410">A: Didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2411">Q: Didn’t know he had a wife and daughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s2412">A: No, no, they didn’t know.</span> <span id="s2413">One day we were walking on the Pilmo Street together and Weiss, one of the murderers, was going in a [indecipherable] a horse -- horse.</span></p> <p><span id="s2414">Q: Drawn carriage, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2415">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2416">And then he said to my father, oh I saw you on the street.</span> <span id="s2417">Who are these people?</span> <span id="s2418">And my father said oh, two very old acquaintances.</span> <span id="s2419">Nobody knew.</span> <span id="s2420">Until Father was shot, nobody opened their mouth.</span></p> <p><span id="s2421">Q: So even i -- di -- did people in the ghetto know that he was married and had a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s2422">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2423">How otherwise I would know everybody?</span> <span id="s2424">People in the ghetto did, but they would not squeal.</span> <span id="s2425">That’s why they say that their -- they suspect Dessler, that Dessler squealed after my father was shot.</span> <span id="s2426">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2427">I cannot blame because I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2428">Now I -- I had a friend in Gestapo, a Lithuanian in Gestapo uniform, who was a real friend from my childhood, from high school, in sporting events.</span> <span id="s2429">He never squealed.</span> <span id="s2430">So what -- the way the Gestapo came after us, it had to be very, very clear information, where we are, where we live, but that stopped in there.</span> <span id="s2431">I mentioned to you that we were about 200 yards from ghetto, across the street.</span> <span id="s2432">And they came into the apartment, they ripped everything apart.</span> <span id="s2433">They ripped the floorboards.</span> <span id="s2434">Whats they were looking for, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2435">They were looking for guns, for -- for some kind of written material, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s2436">Q: This is after your father is shot --</span></p> <p><span id="s2437">A: After.</span></p> <p><span id="s2438">Q: -- and they’re coming to get you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2439">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2440">Q: And you were there, you saw this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2441">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2442">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2443">A: We were given 10 minutes to disappear.</span> <span id="s2444">Father’s helper came one day and said, Mrs. Gens, please take Ada and disappear immediately.</span> <span id="s2445">Nothing taken, just walk out of the apartment the way you stand, not to throw any suspicion or anything.</span> <span id="s2446">Mama --</span></p> <p><span id="s2447">Q: What time of year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2448">A: That was the day he was shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2449">Q: What time of year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2450">A: Oh, that was in September.</span></p> <p><span id="s2451">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2452">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2453">And he said, just disappear.</span> <span id="s2454">But he didn’t tell that Father was executed.</span> <span id="s2455">Ghetto knew it, we didn’t know it.</span> <span id="s2456">We didn't know it for a long time.</span> <span id="s2457">And my mother’s sister know -- knew it, but she wouldn’t tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s2458">Q: Okay, so that day you were leaving the apartment, you’re told to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2459">A: Just walking out into the street.</span> <span id="s2460">Next day the Gestapo came into the apartment.</span> <span id="s2461">And how do I know how it looked?</span> <span id="s2462">Right across the landing was another apartment with a Polish refugee from Warsaw who was hiding her son inside the apartment.</span> <span id="s2463">And our back door, from the back entrance, were again, one across the other.</span> <span id="s2464">So she was watching what the Gestapo was doing and when my aunt came in, my aunt came in through her apartment, opened the back door, and came in with her.</span> <span id="s2465">They Gestapo kept the person hidden behind the front door for three days thinking that maybe we’ll come in or whatever.</span> <span id="s2466">But naturally, by that time we were out be -- because of these permissions to use the train, we were able to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2467">Q: Then your aunt came into an apartment which had somebody waiting behind the front door.</span></p> <p><span id="s2468">A: No, after that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2469">Q: After that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2470">A: -- after that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2471">Q: After that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2472">A: You couldn’t do that, that was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2473">Q: Okay, so in other words, they knew, her neighbor knew, people knew that there’s still somebody standing there for three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s2474">A: Outside, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2475">Q: O-Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2476">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2477">Q: If that’s the case that nobody knew from the Germans that you had any connection whatsoever to the head of the ghetto police, how was it that you had permission to go in and out of the ghetto?</span> <span id="s2478">Wasn’t that restricted?</span></p> <p><span id="s2479">A: I ha -- I mentioned before, was Major Bouragas, again another military friend, issued permission to cross the gates.</span> <span id="s2480">Panana Šimaitė had one, my mother had one and I had one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2481">Q: And how often did you go in and out of the ghetto?</span> <span id="s2482">A: Me?</span> <span id="s2483">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2484">A: I would say I spent more than 50 percent time in ghetto than in outside, because it was safer for me in ghetto than being round up in -- in the town for labor work in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2485">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2486">So as there was ghetto life, there was -- still were roundups within -- outside the ghetto walls.</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">A: With -- outside the ghetto walls for the ge -- Gentiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">Q: I see, I see.</span> <span id="s2489">And the ghetto -- can you just give us this frame, the ghetto existed from what date until your father’s execution and then beyond.</span> <span id="s2490">Ca -- do you remember the dates?</span></p> <p><span id="s2491">A: According -- according -- I wasn’t there --</span></p> <p><span id="s2492">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2493">A: -- according to the books that I read, the liquidation started on the 23rd of September.</span></p> <p><span id="s2494">Q: 19?</span> <span id="s2495">A: ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s2496">Q: Of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s2497">A: Of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s2498">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2499">And it existed -- it was founded --</span></p> <p><span id="s2500">A: From -- founded, I would say two years.</span> <span id="s2501">’41 - ’42 - ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s2502">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2503">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2504">Q: So late summer, early fall, ’41?</span></p> <p><span id="s2505">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2506">Q: And -- and in those --</span></p> <p><span id="s2507">A: Until exactly 23rd of September, ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s2508">Q: And 23rd of September is the date you left your apartment --</span></p> <p><span id="s2509">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2510">Q: -- and the date your father was shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s2511">A: We don’t know.</span> <span id="s2512">We weren’t told.</span></p> <p><span id="s2513">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2514">A: You see, we weren’t told for several months.</span> <span id="s2515">We -- we didn’t know -- had told that Father is dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s2516">Q: Do you remember the last time you saw him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2517">A: Probably day before.</span></p> <p><span id="s2518">Q: Anything memorable from that -- from that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2519">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2520">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s2521">A: Regular.</span> <span id="s2522">Mm, you see, so many -- so many things happened in between.</span> <span id="s2523">There were roundups of people in small ghettos outside of Vilnius.</span> <span id="s2524">While Papa was alive, children were not touched.</span> <span id="s2525">After Papa was dead, they took the children.</span> <span id="s2526">My mother’s sister tried to get my cousin.</span> <span id="s2527">When it was time to go, the mother wouldn’t give.</span> <span id="s2528">She said, oh, as long as my -- my father is there, nothing will happen to my daughter.</span> <span id="s2529">Let’s wait.</span> <span id="s2530">And then when one day they put Ukrainians around, you couldn’t get anything out.</span> <span id="s2531">So then my aunt went to Siauliai, where it was exactly the same story.</span> <span id="s2532">The mother wouldn’t give her child before, and when my aunt arrived from Vilnius to Siauliai the ghetto was surrounded.</span> <span id="s2533">So she couldn’t save the other child either.</span> <span id="s2534">She managed to do somebody’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2535">Q: You mean your -- your --</span></p> <p><span id="s2536">A: Mother’s sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s2537">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2538">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2539">Q: No, no, you mean your mother’s sister who went, but it was your uncle’s children.</span></p> <p><span id="s2540">A: U-Uncles’ children, both uncles here and uncles there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2541">Q: When you had permission -- I’m sorry to go back to that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2542">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2543">Q: -- but when you had permission to go into the ghetto, what was the reason for it?</span> <span id="s2544">What was the ostensible reason for why a Gentile girl who has no connection to the ghetto, would be going there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2545">A: Who would know that?</span> <span id="s2546">Just the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s2547">The Jewish people knew that I’m his daughter.</span> <span id="s2548">I -- how would I know everybody, if I wouldn’t have been there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2549">Q: No, I’m -- okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2550">A: So I mean, the Jewish people, everybody knew.</span> <span id="s2551">That’s what I said, until Father was alive, nobody squealed.</span> <span id="s2552">We don’t know who squealed after he was killed.</span> <span id="s2553">We don’t know.</span> <span id="s2554">And I can’t put a finger or anyone, because you don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2555">Q: What would you do when you would be in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s2556">What would be your job or your function --</span></p> <p><span id="s2557">A: No job, no job.</span></p> <p><span id="s2558">Q: -- or your activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s2559">A: We had a group of people that we knew each other very well from Lithuanian, Kaunas area, and there were a group of younger -- you know, we were young people.</span> <span id="s2560">Can you imagine at that age, we just finished high school, all of us, and it -- it’s awful.</span> <span id="s2561">You’re -- you’re -- it’s depressing.</span> <span id="s2562">There is no way to express -- I -- I don’t know what -- what to say what would I do.</span> <span id="s2563">I would visit everybody.</span> <span id="s2564">We would stay in groups.</span> <span id="s2565">There was a lot of things to do in ghetto, there was a c -- there were activities that I attended.</span> <span id="s2566">Papa took me through the pur -- orphanages, through the kitchens, you -- you know, with him, to show me how things are going.</span> <span id="s2567">And then I just would say -- stay with grandmother, with Papa’s family.</span> <span id="s2568">That’s -- you wouldn’t do very much.</span> <span id="s2569">I had one very, very bad experience when Murer came into the ghetto and Papa managed to sh-shove me out from the door into the next apartment, and Murer was checking apartments.</span> <span id="s2570">I had nothing on me, no schein, no yellow --</span></p> <p><span id="s2571">Q: Star.</span></p> <p><span id="s2572">A: -- stars, nothing.</span> <span id="s2573">But luckily, he didn’t get into that room.</span> <span id="s2574">There were oh, at least 30 women in that room and pa -- can you imagine if Murer would come in and yi -- Papa would have to explain to them why are these 30 ladies in the room, not working.</span> <span id="s2575">That was a very, very narrow escape.</span> <span id="s2576">But it -- it worked out.</span> <span id="s2577">And then, you know, I participated a lot.</span> <span id="s2578">I used to -- you must know that ghetto had a very strong cultural life.</span> <span id="s2579">I used to bring information about the place they were playing.</span> <span id="s2580">For example, at the same time ghetto had in Vilnius theater, there was a play called Žmogus Potilto.</span></p> <p><span id="s2581">Q: Oh, person under the bridge.</span></p> <p><span id="s2582">A: A person under the bridge.</span> <span id="s2583">So I used to bring them sketches and tell how they do that, so that the -- the Jewish production was not worse than the production in Vilnius.</span> <span id="s2584">And I took musical lessons.</span> <span id="s2585">I continued, I couldn’t go to conservatory because I was warned at the philharmon -- philharmonia -- not to show myself.</span> <span id="s2586">So I took music lessons, I stayed and played, not normal as if it’s a normal life.</span> <span id="s2587">It was the normal, but as much as possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2588">Q: But somebody in Vilnius outside the ghetto knew who you were, because through the philharmonic they found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2589">A: Yes, somebody did, yeah, somebody did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2590">Q: Did you -- did you participate aside from warning workers as they’re coming back that Murer is at the gate?</span> <span id="s2591">Was there any other way that you participated in some of these activities to help -- help the ghetto, and help the ghetto in -- inhabitants.</span> <span id="s2592">Was it through the kitchen, was it through other kinds of activities of taking care of some of the old people or -- or -- or such?</span></p> <p><span id="s2593">A: No.</span> <span id="s2594">No.</span> <span id="s2595">I -- I went, I saw, I was -- Papa took me to show, but I didn’t participate in any administrative work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2596">Q: Did your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s2597">A: Don’t forget I was 15 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s2598">Q: Yes, it -- anyways --</span></p> <p><span id="s2599">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2600">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2601">A: A --</span></p> <p><span id="s2602">Q: He might have not wanted you to, either.</span></p> <p><span id="s2603">A: I don’t know, but at 15, what -- I mean, he had the -- the very well trained personnel to do all that.</span> <span id="s2604">For example, there was no hunger.</span> <span id="s2605">The children, the orphans were very well kept.</span> <span id="s2606">They had quarters where they lived.</span> <span id="s2607">Jusef Mushkat was one of Father’s helpers, police member.</span> <span id="s2608">He was in charge of orphans so that there were no people on the street, sitting or begging or anything like that.</span> <span id="s2609">And whoever survived the ghetto is a testimony that Vilnius was very well run as far as the feeding, the hospital.</span> <span id="s2610">They had babies.</span> <span id="s2611">Under German law you couldn’t have babies.</span> <span id="s2612">Papa had a section where babies were born, so that ev-everything was done, whatever it was possible to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2613">Q: Let’s go back to the time when he was -- still in the very beginning, he was director of the hospital and the two children crawled out from the pits of Paneriai --</span></p> <p><span id="s2614">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2615">Q: -- and make their way back, and he hides them in this room.</span> <span id="s2616">What happened to those children, do you know?</span> <span id="s2617">A: What happened later?</span></p> <p><span id="s2618">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2619">A: Later I don’t know, there were thr --I think -- believe there were three ladies --</span></p> <p><span id="s2620">Q: Three --</span></p> <p><span id="s2621">A: -- and two children.</span></p> <p><span id="s2622">Q: Do you know what happened to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2623">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2624">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2625">A: Right now I -- no, I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2626">Q: And did he have such -- you know, and at that point you talked about he had to turn over to the Germans a certain number of people --</span></p> <p><span id="s2627">A: Yeah, right --</span></p> <p><span id="s2628">Q: -- from the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s2629">A: -- right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2630">Q: I take it that must have continued in the ghetto as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s2631">A: Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2632">Q: And were you -- did he talk to you about these things?</span></p> <p><span id="s2633">A: Oh, surely.</span> <span id="s2634">I -- i -- you need an outlet.</span> <span id="s2635">You can’t work under such pressure where human life is involved.</span> <span id="s2636">You -- you have to try to -- to get the best of the wor -- du-during the worst, you have to try to do the best you can, but it’s very difficult.</span> <span id="s2637">I portrayed to you the selection of doctors.</span> <span id="s2638">Those selections were going all the time.</span> <span id="s2639">And they are painful selections, because why -- why Joe and not Peter?</span> <span id="s2640">Why Peter and not Joe?</span> <span id="s2641">It’s impossible.</span> <span id="s2642">But one thing which Vilnius I think is famous for, no corruption.</span> <span id="s2643">You couldn’t buy a life certificate for money.</span> <span id="s2644">You hear that in other towns.</span> <span id="s2645">You hear that in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s2646">I’ve heard that in Lódz, reading the books, you cannot find one single case of life certificates sold for money.</span></p> <p><span id="s2647">Q: There are though -- there is that incident, I think, outside of town, was it Oshmini?</span></p> <p><span id="s2648">A: O-Oshmena</span></p> <p><span id="s2649">Q: Oshmen -- Oshmena.</span></p> <p><span id="s2650">A: Mm-hm, Oshmena.</span></p> <p><span id="s2651">Q: Where in some of the things that I’ve writ -- I’ve read, it’s written that some of the police came back rather well-to-do.</span> <span id="s2652">Now, can we ta -- can you tell us about what the whole incident was at Oshmena?</span> <span id="s2653">What -- how distance i -- you know, its geographical distance from Vilnius --</span></p> <p><span id="s2654">A: In -- in the -- in --</span></p> <p><span id="s2655">Q: -- and what happened there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2656">A: I don’t know geographically how many miles, but there were couple of small places -- like small ghettos, and the Germans, the plan was that they will be brought to Vilnius, to close the small ones and bring them to Vilnius.</span> <span id="s2657">And that’s what it was assumed will happen.</span> <span id="s2658">When Papa didn’t go there, when the police went over there, the Germans told them that these people are not going to Vilnius and that they will be finished.</span> <span id="s2659">In those writings -- I read them -- what I believed what happened, this was the mostly gold pieces, money.</span> <span id="s2660">The Jewish nation went through so many upheavals and pogroms in Tsaristic Russia, they didn’t keep paper money, they ca -- kept mostly golden pieces, golden rubles.</span> <span id="s2661">And I think those who came back pretty rich, they were told by the Germans to collect the bodies, and I think that’s when they got into that.</span> <span id="s2662">That wasn’t a story with life certificates, that was a story when people were -- made-believe that they’re going to Vilnius ghetto and at the last moment they were told that’s what’s going to be then, you not --</span></p> <p><span id="s2663">Q: So they -- they weren’t shot at Paneriai, they were shot at Oshmena?</span></p> <p><span id="s2664">A: No, they were -- Oshmena [indecipherable] they did, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2665">Q: And your father wasn’t involved in any of that, then.</span></p> <p><span id="s2666">A: Oh, he didn't know.</span> <span id="s2667">He didn't know.</span> <span id="s2668">See, they do -- they did exactly the same thing with Kaunas.</span> <span id="s2669">Father checked very carefully through Lietukis [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2670">They were going to bring a transport to Kaunas.</span> <span id="s2671">Father checked on the offices of suppliers of food whether it’s really going to happen, and he was assured by the Lithuanian officials, yes, we had an order for bread, we had an order for potatoes, we had an order for this, for that.</span> <span id="s2672">This is for that additional transport to Kaunas.</span> <span id="s2673">And when they were in the Vilnius railway station, Father overheard an old Polish railway worker that we’re changing the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2674">Q: Railway lines?</span></p> <p><span id="s2675">A: -- rail -- railway lines.</span> <span id="s2676">So he said, what do you mean you’re changing the railway lines?</span> <span id="s2677">He said well, we’re not going to Kaunas, we’re going to [indecipherable] to Paneriai.</span> <span id="s2678">So at that moment, Father said he understood what’s going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2679">Q: And -- and that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s2680">A: And that was -- I don’t -- you know, it -- it’s been so long, now I don’t remember whether this was -- whether this was the people around the top in Oshmena, or that was another German trick.</span> <span id="s2681">Could be that could have been the Oshmena people who were supposed to go to Kaunas.</span></p> <p><span id="s2682">Q: How -- how did people in the ghetto, as far as you are able to tell, how did they look at your father?</span> <span id="s2683">How did they evaluate your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s2684">A: You know, in ghetto they used to say, look at commandant’s face when he is on the street.</span> <span id="s2685">If the commandant is smiling, you know that no aktions are coming forth.</span> <span id="s2686">If the commandant has a --</span></p> <p><span id="s2687">Q: Scowl.</span></p> <p><span id="s2688">A: -- it’s -- yeah, scowl, you know that it’s not good.</span> <span id="s2689">And I -- I would say that they took everything at a stride.</span> <span id="s2690">They knew that he is trying his best.</span> <span id="s2691">You -- it’s -- as much as a human person can do, he tried.</span> <span id="s2692">It -- you know, there was a -- we had a performer.</span> <span id="s2693">He had a, like a little song, a [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2694">They -- li -- life certificates were white, then they turn yellow, then they turn pink, make sure they don’t turn red.</span></p> <p><span id="s2695">Q: Can you sing the song?</span></p> <p><span id="s2696">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2697">Q: Do you remember it?</span> <span id="s2698">Do you just remember the words?</span></p> <p><span id="s2699">A: That -- it’s a -- it’s a jet -- oh yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s2700">Q: That’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2701">A: -- but it was in the Russian language.</span></p> <p><span id="s2702">Q: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2703">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2704">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2705">A: But the -- go --</span></p> <p><span id="s2706">Q: How does it go?</span></p> <p><span id="s2707">A: [speaks Russian].</span> <span id="s2708">The thing is that Father tried to get from Germans permission to employ people inside.</span> <span id="s2709">And he told the Germans that he needs some kind of paper to give those people.</span> <span id="s2710">Not the yellow scheins to work outside, but something so that people would have something in their hands to give them more hope.</span> <span id="s2711">And the Germans agreed, so they printed the pink scheins.</span> <span id="s2712">And they were --</span></p> <p><span id="s2713">Q: Certificates.</span></p> <p><span id="s2714">A: Certificates, right.</span> <span id="s2715">So he tried whatever was possible to keep their spirit alive.</span> <span id="s2716">At -- it’s not so easy.</span> <span id="s2717">Now, the question of theater, for example.</span> <span id="s2718">From the beginning it was very, very negative.</span> <span id="s2719">How can you have theater and concerts in a place which is actually a cemetery?</span></p> <p><span id="s2720">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s2721">A: Where so many of our people have died, or are being taken to die?</span> <span id="s2722">But after awhile, I think the human nature wants to look more -- towards more positive and more opportunistically.</span> <span id="s2723">You couldn’t get a seat in the hall.</span></p> <p><span id="s2724">Q: Did you used to go to the performances?</span></p> <p><span id="s2725">A: Absolutely, everyone, absolutely everyone.</span> <span id="s2726">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2727">Q: And was this your father’s idea, to start the theater?</span></p> <p><span id="s2728">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2729">The very first -- the very first one was in a room about the size I would say like this, towards that broom, that size.</span> <span id="s2730">It one -- one of the rooms were the administrative building.</span> <span id="s2731">My mother was so against it, you have no idea, but she couldn’t talk him out of.</span> <span id="s2732">They said, look Elenka, we need something to give the people.</span> <span id="s2733">Let’s try it.</span> <span id="s2734">And in that room they had like little pieces.</span> <span id="s2735">One would sing, [indecipherable] Rosenthal, she sang, and the Fima Shapiro, Marek Shapiro.</span> <span id="s2736">Adriana -- little sketch, little pieces.</span> <span id="s2737">And it was tremendous success.</span> <span id="s2738">But the opinion in ghetto was awful, look at that.</span> <span id="s2739">There were not many, I would say no more than 30 people attending, and it was just for the administrative apparatus.</span> <span id="s2740">And after that he discussed it with other people who were in that line of work before the war and they decided to start.</span> <span id="s2741">And it started, and the success was tremendous, just tremendous.</span></p> <p><span id="s2742">Q: What were your mother’s objections?</span></p> <p><span id="s2743">A: My mother’s objections?</span> <span id="s2744">Her objections was exactly the same way.</span> <span id="s2745">You don’t open a theater in a cemetery.</span> <span id="s2746">She’s -- she’s -- she’s -- figured that it would be too painful for people who lost family members, which -- which I completely agree.</span> <span id="s2747">But in retrospect when I look back, I see that that gave people a lot of positive thinking towards the future.</span> <span id="s2748">You go to a symphony orchestra, you know, you relax, whichever country you are.</span> <span id="s2749">Especially in ghetto conditions.</span> <span id="s2750">Was a very good symphony orchestra until Luba Levitska was int -- killed.</span> <span id="s2751">She was a very good singer, and the drama actors were very good.</span> <span id="s2752">So that it -- it worked out, it worked out to the benefit of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2753">Q: In general, I’d like to, in the next tape, talk a little bit more about your mother’s activities during these two years of the ghetto, from 1942 til 1943, but we can keep that for the next tape, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2754">End of Tape Seven</span></p> <p><span id="s2755">Beginning Tape Eight</span></p> <p><span id="s2756">Q: It sounds from your telling that your mother was still very integral in your father’s life, even when he moved into the ghetto and she was not known ami -- at least amongst the Gentile, and certainly the ge -- German administration that she is his wife.</span> <span id="s2757">Was that so?</span></p> <p><span id="s2758">A: That’s so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2759">Q: Did he used to come back to the apartment that you had an awful lot?</span> <span id="s2760">Was he able to?</span></p> <p><span id="s2761">A: At four o’clock in the afternoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s2762">Q: Every single day?</span></p> <p><span id="s2763">A: When the things were quiet, every single day.</span> <span id="s2764">That’s where Panana Šimaitė would come in at the same time to get her ration of food --</span></p> <p><span id="s2765">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2766">A: -- for the people upstairs, and well, influence.</span> <span id="s2767">First of all, influence -- first of all, he didn’t listen to her when she begged him not to get involved.</span> <span id="s2768">That’s the influence ended.</span> <span id="s2769">Oh well, what can you do it?</span> <span id="s2770">Otherwise, they always conferred, they always discussed.</span> <span id="s2771">Whatever was going on, they always discussed.</span> <span id="s2772">Mama was a very intelligent and clever person, and she -- she felt his pain, and she felt his inability to do more than he can do.</span> <span id="s2773">And for a wife to watch her husband being torn to all sides, it’s very difficult.</span> <span id="s2774">On one of those awful nights of Oshmena, Mama woke up in the morning, her hands were covered with a -- like a scale, from nervous tension.</span> <span id="s2775">Both hands were covered.</span> <span id="s2776">And she was a very sensitive person, nervous tension.</span> <span id="s2777">And she could predict, in a way, things.</span> <span id="s2778">And my father was aware of her knowing what is going to happen.</span> <span id="s2779">In 1939, I believe, there was a reunion of Lithuanian officers in Vilnius.</span> <span id="s2780">And my father knew that Mama wanted to see a Talmudist in Vilnius, because in Kaunas everybody was speaking, there is a famous Talmudist in Vilnius.</span> <span id="s2781">And he told her look, I’m going to the conference, don’t you dare to go and see that Talmudist.</span> <span id="s2782">Don’t you dare.</span> <span id="s2783">Cause Father was not one of those people that, you know, believes in this or that.</span> <span id="s2784">When he returned from the conference, he had one look at my mother and he said, you didn’t listen to me.</span> <span id="s2785">You went to see the Talmudist.</span> <span id="s2786">Now, I don’t know how to explain it, but the Talmudist told my mother everything that happened.</span> <span id="s2787">They didn’t say the word Germans, but he described the awful things that are going to happen and he told her that in a couple of years after that, she’ll lose her husband.</span> <span id="s2788">Talmudist had no idea who she is, who my father is, that her husband is Jewish.</span> <span id="s2789">Absolutely no idea.</span> <span id="s2790">He read Talmud.</span> <span id="s2791">So when Father returned home from the conference, looked at my mother, he knew right away.</span> <span id="s2792">And Mother lived with that heavy burden on her chest all these years, from ’39 to ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s2793">Q: And she never told him what he told her -- what the Talmudist to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2794">A: She did, my father laughed.</span> <span id="s2795">But he told her, I warned you, please don’t go.</span> <span id="s2796">Cause he knew my mother was a very sensitive person.</span> <span id="s2797">I told you about the scales overnight.</span> <span id="s2798">He told her not to go because to him that was a laughable object.</span> <span id="s2799">To her, that didn’t disappear.</span> <span id="s2800">And she lived all these years waiting and expecting something terrible to happen.</span> <span id="s2801">And Talmudist didn’t know how to put it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2802">Q: It was 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s2803">A: ’39, yes.</span> <span id="s2804">But he said, things are going to be awful beyond description, and you lose your husband couple years after that.</span> <span id="s2805">So you know when you live it was a feeling like this.</span> <span id="s2806">My mother hated the Germans to the point that when we were forced to live in Munich in one apartment, she never talked to the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2807">Q: This is after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2808">A: After the war.</span> <span id="s2809">Well, I wanted to go through German consulates to look, maybe I could find out something about Weiss, about Murer, about Neugebauer, people that they thought -- she didn’t even want to hear anything about them.</span> <span id="s2810">Her hatred is not a human hatred.</span> <span id="s2811">I-It’s difficult to describe.</span> <span id="s2812">And when my mother fi -- found out about my father’s death, was already probably 40 -- end of ’44.</span> <span id="s2813">She went to Kaunas from where we were staying, and the landlady of my aunt’s house didn’t know that Mother doesn’t know.</span> <span id="s2814">We lived in the hope that maybe he ran away, or maybe -- whatever, but not dead.</span> <span id="s2815">And she started to, oh, poor Mrs. Gens, oh my sympathy, oh, I am so sorry.</span> <span id="s2816">Mama couldn’t understand what she is talking about.</span> <span id="s2817">And when Mama finally grasped, she nearly went mad.</span> <span id="s2818">It was awful.</span> <span id="s2819">The lady was telling me later, said she hasn’t seen a sight like that in her life.</span> <span id="s2820">Because it was shock plus she finally realized what happened.</span> <span id="s2821">She didn’t take too much activity in ghetto.</span> <span id="s2822">First of all, Mama -- I wasn’t afraid, Mama was afraid of the Germans, that can get caught in there.</span> <span id="s2823">And she would spend time with Grandmother, with Uncle, and we had very many friends in ghetto, so she would visit.</span> <span id="s2824">But she didn’t take part in any administrative or anything because, as I say, nobody from German part knew that we exist.</span> <span id="s2825">But she would attend, like I show you the picture, I showed the picture.</span> <span id="s2826">But even in the picture, she bent down so you wouldn’t see her face.</span> <span id="s2827">She didn’t want any documentation that there is a wife to the commandant.</span></p> <p><span id="s2828">Q: What happened with your grandmother?</span></p> <p><span id="s2829">A: They were -- that was the last.</span> <span id="s2830">That was already after Papa’s death, they were taken all to Paneriai.</span></p> <p><span id="s2831">Q: So your grandmother is in Paneriai?</span></p> <p><span id="s2832">A: In Paneriai.</span> <span id="s2833">Now the aunt with a little girl, she tried -- Sala -- Salomon’s wife, she tried to save herself.</span> <span id="s2834">The girl was adorable.</span> <span id="s2835">Big green eyes, blonde.</span> <span id="s2836">She was dressed in a white fur coat.</span> <span id="s2837">Tiny girl, two years old.</span> <span id="s2838">And she put the girl on the ground and she tried to go to the other side.</span> <span id="s2839">So I talked to survivors and they said that the German officer picked the child, was going around to say where is the mother of the child, where is the mother of the child?</span> <span id="s2840">And th-that Sonia couldn’t stand it, she -- she just broke down.</span> <span id="s2841">She came to the German officer, took her child and went to the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2842">Q: To Paneriai?</span></p> <p><span id="s2843">A: To Paneriai, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2844">Q: What was the girl’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2845">A: This one?</span> <span id="s2846">This one was Ivana and the one in Siauliai was Aviva.</span> <span id="s2847">About the same age, both.</span></p> <p><span id="s2848">Q: We’ll get to Siauliai in a --</span></p> <p><span id="s2849">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2850">Q: -- in another --</span></p> <p><span id="s2851">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2852">Q: -- time.</span> <span id="s2853">So -- and your Uncle Salomon wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s2854">A: Kloge.</span> <span id="s2855">Kloge.</span></p> <p><span id="s2856">Q: So your uncle was deported to Kloge --</span></p> <p><span id="s2857">A: To Kloge, after Father’s death.</span> <span id="s2858">And what was interesting, when he was deported to Kloge, the train went via Siauliai and he was able to write a little note, throw it through the window.</span> <span id="s2859">Somebody picked it up and ran to the ghetto in Siauliai.</span> <span id="s2860">And the brother in Siauliai came to the train, he was the head of ghetto in Siauliai.</span> <span id="s2861">He brought Solomon some clothes, some food, and that was the last the two brothers met.</span> <span id="s2862">And that’s was -- when Salomon told the Siauliai brother that my papa is dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s2863">Q: So your -- Salomon knew --</span></p> <p><span id="s2864">A: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2865">Q: You didn’t know, but Sal --</span></p> <p><span id="s2866">A: I didn't know sa --</span></p> <p><span id="s2867">Q: -- but Salomon knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2868">A: -- Salomon knew.</span> <span id="s2869">They didn’t tell us.</span> <span id="s2870">They didn’t tell.</span> <span id="s2871">That’s why I don’t even know the exact date.</span> <span id="s2872">We always took the date as 23rd of September.</span> <span id="s2873">That’s what we thought, but we don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2874">Q: When was it -- when was it that you found out?</span> <span id="s2875">Your mother found out through this lady in Kaunas.</span></p> <p><span id="s2876">A: That’s when th -- when we found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2877">Q: Tha -- so that you found out the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2878">A: Yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2879">Q: So your mother told you, or this lady -- you were there when the lady was te --</span></p> <p><span id="s2880">A: No, no, I was in hiding.</span> <span id="s2881">We were both in hiding.</span> <span id="s2882">But that’s also already 1944, I believe.</span> <span id="s2883">So that that was already so far away.</span> <span id="s2884">Mama went to Kaunas.</span></p> <p><span id="s2885">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2886">A: And that’s when she found out, and then she returned back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2887">Q: And she’s the one who told you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2888">A: And she’s the one who told me, yeah.</span> <span id="s2889">But when she returned back, you know what she did?</span> <span id="s2890">She sat in one corner, looked into the other corner opposite and wouldn’t move.</span> <span id="s2891">She wouldn’t move.</span> <span id="s2892">Nothing mattered to her, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2893">Q: How did -- what were you thinking?</span> <span id="s2894">What were you -- how did you react to something like that?</span> <span id="s2895">A: I think at my age you don’t react like my Mama reacted.</span> <span id="s2896">I-I believe that I kind of suspected it.</span> <span id="s2897">You see, what happened, only the day when they told us to leave the apartment and we went to Panana Šimaitė’s place, Šimaitė came back and she said, listen, the rumor in Vilnius has it that somebody ran away from Gestapo building and there are guards around the area.</span> <span id="s2898">So that kept me --</span></p> <p><span id="s2899">Q: Hoping.</span></p> <p><span id="s2900">A: -- hoping that if whoever escaped the Gestapo building, it would be my father.</span> <span id="s2901">That’s -- but that took too long, when by ’44 we haven’t heard, because if he would have been alive there would be a way to -- to let us know or something, so I started to lose my hope.</span> <span id="s2902">But Mama clung to it, that Papa managed to get s -- ge -- escape Gestapo and he is in hiding somewhere.</span> <span id="s2903">He just cannot get in touch with us.</span> <span id="s2904">See, that is -- that was her attitude.</span></p> <p><span id="s2905">Q: Where did -- where did Mrs. Šimaitė bring you -- or Miss Šimaitė bring you, to get into hiding?</span> <span id="s2906">We haven’t explored --</span></p> <p><span id="s2907">A: She didn't bring, she didn’t bring.</span> <span id="s2908">We went to Šimaitė.</span> <span id="s2909">Panana Šimaitė lived in the apartment which was used to -- as a lodging for people who worked for the university.</span></p> <p><span id="s2910">Q: She lived in a dormitory.</span></p> <p><span id="s2911">A: Dor -- like a dormitory, yes.</span> <span id="s2912">And in same apartment was a lady whose husband was a very high Soviet official in -- during the Soviet year.</span> <span id="s2913">And the Germans had a place for all wives and children of Soviet officers who didn’t manage to take their wives away.</span> <span id="s2914">They didn’t do anything bad to them, but they were segregated from others.</span> <span id="s2915">It was a house close to Hakapay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2916">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2917">A: And she was taken by director of Vilnius University and placed in an apartment with Šimaitė, illegally.</span> <span id="s2918">So when we saw her there, Mama said, you know what Panana Šimaitė?</span> <span id="s2919">I don’t feel very safe in here because of her.</span> <span id="s2920">Because if Germans come after her --</span></p> <p><span id="s2921">Q: They’ll find us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2922">A: -- they’ll discovered us.</span> <span id="s2923">So Šimaitė walked with us to a wife, Polish wife of another police officer, Mr. Alprin.</span> <span id="s2924">And we stayed a couple of days with Mrs. Alprin.</span></p> <p><span id="s2925">Q: So her husband was a ghetto police person?</span></p> <p><span id="s2926">A: Ghetto police person [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s2927">Q: But she was a Polish Gentile?</span></p> <p><span id="s2928">A: She was pol -- Polish Gentile.</span> <span id="s2929">And after a couple of days, we figured, well th-this is the place t-to hide, because we didn’t know to what extent the Germans are going to look for us.</span> <span id="s2930">So we had the permissions for the train.</span> <span id="s2931">We boarded the train and we had very close friends of my parents, that’s the people whose children were on the echelon to Siberia, and we thought we’ll go over there.</span> <span id="s2932">That’s far away from Vilnius, far away from Kaunas.</span> <span id="s2933">On the train, when the gendarmerie came to check the documents, my mother’s face went white.</span> <span id="s2934">She didn’t know is it because they have to check everybody, or just us.</span> <span id="s2935">And her face gave her away.</span> <span id="s2936">The Germans probably didn’t notice, but the people --</span></p> <p><span id="s2937">Q: Next to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2938">A: -- sitting next to us noticed.</span> <span id="s2939">So the man who was sitting next to me turned around to my mother and he said very quietly that, Madam, I see that you have some very big problem and may I offer our house in Siauliai until you decide what you are doing?</span> <span id="s2940">They --</span></p> <p><span id="s2941">Q: Strangers?</span></p> <p><span id="s2942">A: Strangers.</span> <span id="s2943">They didn’t know who am I, who Mama is, or anybody.</span> <span id="s2944">There was a curfew.</span> <span id="s2945">The train pulled out late, ta -- five or six o’clock in the morning, you couldn’t walk.</span> <span id="s2946">So we spent the couple of hours until the dawn, and the cra -- curfew was away, and he mentioned his name and he said that we have a huge estate, past Siauliai.</span> <span id="s2947">I’ll take you to the estate and then you’ll decide what you want to do next.</span> <span id="s2948">No questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s2949">Q: So this was a train going from Vilnius to Siauliai?</span></p> <p><span id="s2950">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2951">Q: You weren’t going back to Kaunas, you were going to Siauliai.</span></p> <p><span id="s2952">A: No, to Siauliai, Kaunas was too close.</span> <span id="s2953">Everybody knew us in Kaunas.</span></p> <p><span id="s2954">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2955">A: When we came to the estate we discovered -- well, we knew his name, he introduced himself.</span> <span id="s2956">We discovered that family who knew who we are, and they gave us, or actually him, a -- a horse and buggy and he took us to the estate where we stayed for two years in hiding.</span> <span id="s2957">The first face, when I looked down from the buggy was my sport friend, in sports, a member of Lithuanian basketball national team, Shlupas.</span> <span id="s2958">Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2959">I just looked at him, said [indecipherable] what are you doing here?</span> <span id="s2960">And he says to me, and what are you doing here?</span> <span id="s2961">He doesn’t know that I am half Jewish.</span> <span id="s2962">And this is my mother, he says, Mrs., what are you doing here?</span> <span id="s2963">So I said -- he was not afraid of me.</span> <span id="s2964">So I said, I’m in hiding.</span> <span id="s2965">How would we translate in [indecipherable] the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2966">Q: Wi -- uh-huh, he was sort of like the village elder.</span></p> <p><span id="s2967">A: Village elder.</span> <span id="s2968">The village elder was his cousin, and he needed a place to hide not to be inducted into German working force.</span> <span id="s2969">So he came to his cousin.</span> <span id="s2970">His cousin sent me to the place where we were in hiding, and that was the first face I saw.</span> <span id="s2971">And Mama wasn’t very happy about it, but I said, Mama, you don’t expect anything bad from the family Shlupas.</span> <span id="s2972">It’s too high in our society to do anything bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s2973">Q: But she would have preferred someone who didn’t know you at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2974">A: Sh-She would have preferred, but I don’t think he knew anything about me besides my name, last name and so on.</span> <span id="s2975">So that -- to suspect anything, because definitely my mother doesn’t look anything like a Jewish person.</span> <span id="s2976">And he knew me for years, we were together in [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2977">The -- the -- the -- we had in Kaunas the [indecipherable] sports --</span></p> <p><span id="s2978">Q: A sports --</span></p> <p><span id="s2979">A: -- sports --</span></p> <p><span id="s2980">Q: A sports facility.</span></p> <p><span id="s2981">A: -- facilities.</span> <span id="s2982">So for years we were together in sports with him.</span> <span id="s2983">I knew -- we knew each other very well.</span> <span id="s2984">So, see that what happen.</span> <span id="s2985">You never know whom you meet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2986">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2987">A: So he stayed there for quite awhile with us over there, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2988">Q: And so this was a se -- you went first to this person who was set on a train.</span></p> <p><span id="s2989">A: On a train, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2990">Q: Saw that your mother was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2991">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2992">Q: -- was beside herself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2993">A: Beside herself, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2994">Q: Offered his services.</span></p> <p><span id="s2995">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2996">Q: But he recognized, or he was able to identify who you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s2997">A: No, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2998">Q: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2999">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s3000">Q: And then who knew who -- you say when you’re gone to a certain estate.</span></p> <p><span id="s3001">A: That was, if you know Lithuania, the Venslauskas family.</span></p> <p><span id="s3002">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3003">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3004">Q: And they’re the ones --</span></p> <p><span id="s3005">A: That’s another known family, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3006">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s3007">And they’re the ones who hid you for --</span></p> <p><span id="s3008">A: We’d stayed with them for awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s3009">Q: For awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s3010">A: And then he brought us to the estate where we stayed, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3011">Q: I see, and you stayed out in the country then?</span></p> <p><span id="s3012">A: In the country for two years, over two years [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3013">Q: And you were then closer to Siauliai than you were to Vilnius?</span></p> <p><span id="s3014">A: Closer to Siauliai, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3015">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3016">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3017">Q: Before I leave the Vilnius ghetto and talk about Siauliai, I’d like to ask a few other questions.</span> <span id="s3018">Were you familiar with -- did you know about the Resistance movement that was forming within the ghetto?</span> <span id="s3019">Did you know any of the people who were in it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3020">A: I knew only enough in case I am caught, not to give the information, because there was always a possibility that Gestapo may find out about us.</span> <span id="s3021">Father was very, very careful.</span> <span id="s3022">And I knew the fact, I didn’t know the names.</span> <span id="s3023">I knew, for example, in 1942, Father talked to the Germans and explained to them that ghetto has no way to heat the buildings and he asked for permission to send Jewish workers in faraway woods to cut the timber and bring it in ghetto, and finally je -- Germans agreed.</span> <span id="s3024">That was a place where the movement started.</span> <span id="s3025">A carriage would go with double floor, with people under the double floor, to unload themselves, load the timber and that goes one back and forth.</span> <span id="s3026">So I -- I spent couple of weeks in that place over there and I knew perfectly what’s going on.</span> <span id="s3027">But if you would put me at the wall and tell me I will shoot you if you don’t tell me, I wouldn’t be able to tell.</span> <span id="s3028">Father was very careful.</span> <span id="s3029">We --</span></p> <p><span id="s3030">Q: So you knew perfectly what was going on --</span></p> <p><span id="s3031">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3032">Q: -- but you had nothing you could say?</span></p> <p><span id="s3033">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3034">Q: That sounds --</span></p> <p><span id="s3035">A: I didn’t know the names.</span></p> <p><span id="s3036">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3037">A: You wouldn’t -- you wouldn’t mention the names.</span> <span id="s3038">I knew the fact because I was spend my time over there, I went with him over there.</span> <span id="s3039">I knew -- I knew the extent what’s going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s3040">Q: So in other words, he was also supporting the resistance by doing this.</span></p> <p><span id="s3041">A: He was -- well, you -- you’ve seen the literature.</span> <span id="s3042">They have all kinds of -- all kinds of opinions.</span> <span id="s3043">They -- on one side they say that you are supporting, that he was procuring the guns.</span> <span id="s3044">On the other side they s -- would say that he didn’t want them to leave ghetto, to leave the children and old people alone, because if you -- let’s say you saved hundred people in wood, you left the others for their own what?</span> <span id="s3045">They can’t do anything.</span> <span id="s3046">Children, old ladies, women.</span> <span id="s3047">He was against young people completely leaving the old ones in ghetto without any defense.</span> <span id="s3048">He thought that there should be -- there should be something left.</span></p> <p><span id="s3049">Q: But it goes against what you were saying earlier --</span></p> <p><span id="s3050">A: Well, that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s3051">Q: -- when he chose the -- the young to live --</span></p> <p><span id="s3052">A: Ye -- he chose the young to live, but you see, circumstances change, and when you see old mothers and mothers and grandmothers and little children and everybody tries to get into the forests and leave them behind, I-I don’t think you can stick any more to -- to your ideas that you had before.</span> <span id="s3053">He was telling them nicely that listen, I am warned by the Germans that if they find out who brings the guns, who goes away, the repercussions will be very bad, and they threatened the children.</span> <span id="s3054">Th -- Papa did everything in his force not to sacrifice the children, and the children were not touched until Papa was alive.</span> <span id="s3055">He asked them to be careful, and he tried to explain to them that by removing a dozen today, dozen today, dozen tomorrow, we cannot save the ghetto.</span> <span id="s3056">He wanted to prolong -- you see, the front was moving slowly.</span> <span id="s3057">It wasn’t as rosy for the Germans as it used to be in ’41.</span> <span id="s3058">In ’43 the situation in the front was already different.</span> <span id="s3059">He was hoping against hope that maybe somehow, if he drags the people longer, like in Kloge where my uncle died, the Russians were right there.</span> <span id="s3060">They came in, the timber was still burning, you see?</span> <span id="s3061">So he -- he just thought that maybe, maybe, if we don’t provoke the Germans, if they leave us alone and let us live the way we are, work, work, work, work, nevermind work, but work, maybe we’ll expect -- you know, maybe our expectations will take place.</span> <span id="s3062">Maybe it’ll happen.</span> <span id="s3063">Maybe the Russian army will come closer.</span></p> <p><span id="s3064">Q: Did he ever have a conversation with you as his daughter of, I may not survive the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s3065">A: No, never.</span> <span id="s3066">He knew it very well.</span> <span id="s3067">He knew that the German could -- a German soldier came into the ghetto area and he wanted to rip a -- Father had a -- a Lithuanian officer’s c -- student -- student -- like we have here, those [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3068">Q: Insignias --</span></p> <p><span id="s3069">A: Insignia, yeah.</span> <span id="s3070">And Father didn’t want to give it to him.</span> <span id="s3071">He pulled out the gun.</span> <span id="s3072">So, there was no way, you know, he had to give it to him.</span> <span id="s3073">And an officer could have shot him any time, any German could have shot him any time.</span> <span id="s3074">We -- we -- we counted on it, we knew it.</span> <span id="s3075">So, I mean, there was no sense to discuss at all.</span> <span id="s3076">What sense did it make?</span> <span id="s3077">We knew the way he -- he lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s3078">Q: You say that he was very careful to not talk to you about something that could eventually hurt you and hurt others, were you caught, where you would be forced to talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s3079">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s3080">Q: And yet, at the same time, every day four o’clock, he’d come back to your apartment --</span></p> <p><span id="s3081">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3082">Q: -- and he would share things with your mother.</span> <span id="s3083">Do you think the same rule applied with her, or do you think he went into details with her, because he needed to talk to somebody who was trusted?</span></p> <p><span id="s3084">A: I would say the same rule.</span> <span id="s3085">I wou -- I -- I was always there, so whatever I heard, she heard.</span> <span id="s3086">There was no secrets without me being present.</span> <span id="s3087">You know, all -- all the effort that he put into that period of life was to prolong, somehow, the survival.</span> <span id="s3088">Whatever he did was for that one and only purpose.</span> <span id="s3089">We have no idea, as I told you before, we have no idea what the Germans di-discovered, or simply they decided that he is the head, he should be removed, it’ll be easier to annihilate the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s3090">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s3091">A: For example, he built malinas.</span> <span id="s3092">You know what malina is?</span></p> <p><span id="s3093">Q: Secret places.</span></p> <p><span id="s3094">A: Secret places.</span> <span id="s3095">In charge of malinas were two people, engineer Marcos and Mr. Dellwell.</span> <span id="s3096">Mr. Dellwell was from Kaunas.</span> <span id="s3097">He knew him very well because his daughter was with me in school, and engineer Marcos was from Poland.</span> <span id="s3098">It was in engineer Marcos’ hands to build the malinas.</span> <span id="s3099">It was in Mr. Dellwell’s hands to supply water and food.</span> <span id="s3100">This we knew.</span> <span id="s3101">Mama knew and I knew that they are in charge.</span> <span id="s3102">I didn’t know where the malina was, but I knew that Father had a plan, had quite a big plan for malinas.</span> <span id="s3103">And I believe what people told me, that my uncle’s wife and grandmother and the child were in the malina.</span> <span id="s3104">But the Germans forced people to open the malinas.</span> <span id="s3105">So some were saved and some were pulled out.</span> <span id="s3106">But his idea was to do as much as possible, to save as much as possible.</span> <span id="s3107">So it’s -- it’s not like you sometimes read, cooperation, what kind of cooperation?</span> <span id="s3108">He would go into [indecipherable] with the Germans.</span> <span id="s3109">If they would say they want 5,000, he would offer a thousand and the Germans would come down to 3,000, he would s-say 1,500.</span> <span id="s3110">But he was able, he managed to have that -- I think billing -- being such a military nation, the Germans had certain -- I wouldn’t call it respect, but they had a certain attitude towards a military posture of my father.</span> <span id="s3111">He looked a military man whichever way you looked at him, from the left, or to the right.</span> <span id="s3112">He looked a military man.</span> <span id="s3113">And when the mail used to come from Gebiets commissariat, mail, they would never write to Jewish, they would write Herr Jacob Gens.</span> <span id="s3114">It was unusual to have such a polite form.</span> <span id="s3115">I think that had a lot to do.</span> <span id="s3116">And we were told that when Papa went into Gestapo and the army found out, well I don’t know whether that’s true or not, the army offered Gestapo two -- End of Tape Eight</span></p> <p><span id="s3117">Beginning Tape Nine</span></p> <p><span id="s3118">Q: So your father is arrested and you heard later that the -- that the German army might have -- I mean a rumor --</span></p> <p><span id="s3119">A: Might --</span></p> <p><span id="s3120">Q: -- that a --</span></p> <p><span id="s3121">A: There was a rumor that the German army offered Gestapo a tremendous amount of money to let my father go.</span> <span id="s3122">Not because of sentimental reasons, but he was a organizer of entire product -- productive, you know, force for the German army, and army needed it.</span> <span id="s3123">But unfortunately the -- Hitler’s line was stronger and they --</span></p> <p><span id="s3124">Q: Well, so what you said earlier about the Gestapo being corruptible, wasn’t always the case.</span></p> <p><span id="s3125">A: That was not the Gestapo, that came straight from Himmler.</span></p> <p><span id="s3126">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3127">A: That came from the up, up, up.</span></p> <p><span id="s3128">Q: That it’s time for Gens to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s3129">A: The Jewish solution, yeah.</span> <span id="s3130">It’s time to finish with the Jews --</span></p> <p><span id="s3131">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3132">A: -- in Vilnius.</span> <span id="s3133">Time to finish with the Jews.</span> <span id="s3134">So they didn’t care that army needed them.</span> <span id="s3135">They didn’t want any more Jews.</span> <span id="s3136">The only place that they left for time being was the Hakapay at Kilus.</span> <span id="s3137">Kilus was producing a fur uniforms for the German lady -- female personnel, and also for German officers, and later on for German army, what -- as much as they could.</span> <span id="s3138">And Hakapay was involved in structural work, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s3139">Q: What is Hakapay, what was Hakapay?</span></p> <p><span id="s3140">A: I don’t know the German word -- n-name of Hakapay, I can find it.</span> <span id="s3141">It’s what’s called H -- Hakapay, HKP.</span></p> <p><span id="s3142">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3143">A: I -- I’ll find out what i-it meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s3144">Q: But there was also effort --</span></p> <p><span id="s3145">A: The Jewish -- they were out of ghetto.</span> <span id="s3146">They were living separately, out of ghetto, in the vicinity where the Russian wives and children of Russian officers were there -- where they were there.</span> <span id="s3147">And they had the -- they didn’t belong together, they always were separate, and I don’t remember which one went first, because I wasn’t there, whether Kilus went first or Hakapay went first, they were not able to -- to save them.</span> <span id="s3148">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s3149">Q: So you didn’t know of the details of resistance activity in Vilnius ghetto.</span> <span id="s3150">Did you know of the incident as -- as it happened, of Vittenberg, or Wittenberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s3151">A: Yes, I knew, that I knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s3152">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3153">A: That I knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s3154">Q: What did you know of that, and what did you see or experience that surrounded the head of the resistance and his --</span></p> <p><span id="s3155">A: Father warned his people to be very careful with Polish people around.</span> <span id="s3156">He never trusted the Polish people, I’m sorry to say that.</span> <span id="s3157">One reason was, he didn't know them.</span> <span id="s3158">Another reason was that he saw too many Jewish people disappear in Lukiškės, because the Polish people will give them out.</span> <span id="s3159">So he said, be very careful.</span> <span id="s3160">Don’t ever trust a Polish person.</span> <span id="s3161">I don’t remember the details now, but somehow Germans, I believe, caught a Polish person and under torture he gave name.</span> <span id="s3162">And the Germans requested to be handed in [indecipherable] yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3163">Q: So this person -- so he gave the name of [indecipherable] Wittenberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s3164">A: Yes, Wittenberg.</span> <span id="s3165">It was an awful case because Papa tried to assure the Germans that there is no illegal activity in ghetto.</span> <span id="s3166">Because they were threatening all the time, if we catch illegal activity, that will be the end of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s3167">Now we all knew that Gestapo had means to torture and the -- the Polish man didn’t -- was not able to stand it, Wittenberg wouldn’t be able to stand it either.</span> <span id="s3168">Now if they got Wittenberg and he would start talking, that was very bad for the ghetto.</span> <span id="s3169">I can’t remember who gave him ciancarli.</span></p> <p><span id="s3170">Q: What’s ciancardi?</span></p> <p><span id="s3171">A: The very strong poison like Goering took?</span> <span id="s3172">Goering’s wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s3173">Q: Cyanide?</span></p> <p><span id="s3174">A: Cyanide, yeah.</span> <span id="s3175">Can’t remember now.</span> <span id="s3176">Even when I read those books years, years ago, I -- I don’t reread them all the time.</span> <span id="s3177">I can’t remember, but anyway, he was given ciancarli.</span></p> <p><span id="s3178">Q: Did you know Wittenberg?</span> <span id="s3179">Had you seen him ever?</span></p> <p><span id="s3180">A: Probably.</span> <span id="s3181">A -- you know Wittenberg, Wittenberg.</span> <span id="s3182">He -- he -- nobody knew anything, so Mr. Wittenberg, that’s it.</span> <span id="s3183">So he wasn’t given a life.</span></p> <p><span id="s3184">Q: So in other words they handed over a corpse.</span></p> <p><span id="s3185">A: Corpse.</span></p> <p><span id="s3186">Q: And how do you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3187">A: Oh that -- that was -- everybody knew that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3188">Q: So that was written, or that was -- that was at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3189">A: That was at the time, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3190">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3191">A: But Papa couldn’t afford to have Wittenberg tortured, because then the whole thing would slowly come out.</span> <span id="s3192">The forests, they’re going to the forests with a double bottom to, you know, carriage --</span></p> <p><span id="s3193">Q: Did he talk about that at home during his four p.m. meetings, you know, when he’d come back every --</span></p> <p><span id="s3194">A: About Wittenberg’s torture --</span></p> <p><span id="s3195">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3196">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3197">It was very, very difficult story for him.</span> <span id="s3198">But what do you do?</span> <span id="s3199">You can’t risk -- that’s what he was trying to tell those people, I cannot risk the entire ghetto because 20 or 30 of you would run to the woods and leave me with a whole -- thousands on my hands, so that you are going to be free.</span> <span id="s3200">You see, the situation changed.</span> <span id="s3201">Situation changed and he saw that there is no way -- if Warsaw ghetto, with such tremendous, organized uprising didn’t survive, he knew that Vilnius can’t -- Vilnius doesn’t have so many ammunition or anything.</span> <span id="s3202">You -- you can’t -- you can’t survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s3203">Q: So, but it was an argument then, that he must have had, a very strong argument and a longstanding one with those who wanted to resist, the young people who wanted to resist and belong to that resistance movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s3204">A: That’s all right?</span> <span id="s3205">They wanted to resist, and what about the others?</span> <span id="s3206">What about this -- the aftereffect?</span> <span id="s3207">Okay, they would resist, let’s say they would fight for a week.</span> <span id="s3208">There’s no question that the Germans would send their army and that would be squashed out.</span> <span id="s3209">But what about the remaining ones?</span> <span id="s3210">What about the remaining ones?</span> <span id="s3211">Straight to the ovens?</span></p> <p><span id="s3212">Q: It sou -- it sounds like he was caught in s --</span></p> <p><span id="s3213">A: He was caught, yeah.</span> <span id="s3214">What would you do?</span> <span id="s3215">How -- how would you -- how would you reason with people?</span> <span id="s3216">He knew that the young ones wants to save -- they want to save themselves, but what do you do with mothers and grandmothers and so on?</span> <span id="s3217">Father was counting that maybe one day the army, Russian army will come closer, and the Germans will run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s3218">Q: When did you a -- he sounds extraordinary.</span></p> <p><span id="s3219">A: I would say not because it’s my father, but I would say that he was extraordinary.</span> <span id="s3220">He was.</span> <span id="s3221">Absolutely no fear.</span> <span id="s3222">Absolutely no fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s3223">Q: But did he have fear for you and your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s3224">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3225">That’s why c-certain things you wouldn’t tell.</span> <span id="s3226">You -- I would know the facts, but I wouldn't know the names.</span> <span id="s3227">Because, you see, in Kaunas the Nuremberg law was applied right away.</span> <span id="s3228">Somehow in Vilnius, between Polish, Lithuanian and Jews and this and that, it didn’t come on the poles.</span> <span id="s3229">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s3230">Q: You mean, you didn’t see these Nuremberg laws pasted --</span></p> <p><span id="s3231">A: No, pasted i-in Vilnius.</span> <span id="s3232">In Kaunas, yes.</span> <span id="s3233">And Kaunas had quite a few suicides, when one side wouldn’t give the other one away and both would commit suicide.</span> <span id="s3234">Nothing like that in Vilnius.</span> <span id="s3235">So -- you know, but you never knew when it will start.</span> <span id="s3236">That’s why he was always very much afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s3237">Q: What legacy has he left you?</span> <span id="s3238">Your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s3239">A: What legacy?</span></p> <p><span id="s3240">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3241">A: You know, he tried to help people.</span> <span id="s3242">I’ve been helping people since 1947.</span> <span id="s3243">He never got anything for his help.</span> <span id="s3244">I never ask anything for my help, and I -- I help a lot.</span> <span id="s3245">I think this is something that goes through the genes.</span> <span id="s3246">You are the way you are because of something.</span> <span id="s3247">You’re not the way you are that suddenly [indecipherable] oh, it’s good to make good, and this and that.</span> <span id="s3248">You are the way you are.</span> <span id="s3249">And I believe a lot of that behavior had tremendous influence on my growing up -- in my growing up years.</span> <span id="s3250">He used to say -- he had a saying in Lithuanian that [speaks Lithuanian here].</span> <span id="s3251">In English it would be, the dear Lord is getting old, and doesn’t see what’s happening on the earth.</span> <span id="s3252">But he never complained, he never blamed, he just took it in stride, whatever the life was throwing at him.</span> <span id="s3253">And he had a very easy way not to do it.</span> <span id="s3254">The Lithuanian officers had the place for him.</span> <span id="s3255">It was a estate of Pulkanika Skorupskas.</span> <span id="s3256">Just go and stay there.</span> <span id="s3257">Nobody would know, that’s why Mama was begging him, don’t get any official place.</span> <span id="s3258">We have a place for you, we’ll wait until the end of the war, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s3259">But you see, certain -- certain forces in your conscience overpower you, and even if he wasn't Jewish up til that time, he felt for his nation, and he -- he wouldn’t budge.</span></p> <p><span id="s3260">Q: Do you think people have been too hard on him?</span></p> <p><span id="s3261">A: You want to know my answer?</span> <span id="s3262">I couldn’t care less.</span> <span id="s3263">That’s my answer, I couldn’t care less.</span> <span id="s3264">I would like to have them just sit in his skin and do what he did.</span> <span id="s3265">Telling you’re going to die, telling you’re going to live.</span> <span id="s3266">That’s easy on a person?</span> <span id="s3267">They show in those plays, they show a scene, they describe a scene.</span> <span id="s3268">Father standing at the gate, and the German is letting father, mother in to children.</span> <span id="s3269">And he sees a family coming with three children and he sees a family coming with one child.</span> <span id="s3270">And he grabs a kid from the three, throws them into the family with one, hits the father on the shoulder with his stick and yells at him, what do you do?</span> <span id="s3271">You left your child behind.</span> <span id="s3272">Well that story is all over the plays, the books and so on.</span> <span id="s3273">His mind had to work in all directions.</span> <span id="s3274">If he wouldn’t have noticed that one has one child and the other has three children, the one would go through and they would take another third child from the next.</span> <span id="s3275">He had to see everything.</span> <span id="s3276">It’s not so simple.</span> <span id="s3277">And it’s not so simple to -- to have conversations with the Germans when you have human blood to count.</span> <span id="s3278">As I told you, they want 5,000, you offer a thousand.</span> <span id="s3279">They go down to four, you go up to one -- 1500.</span> <span id="s3280">These are people, these aren’t just marionettes, and you have to deal with it.</span> <span id="s3281">So I would like those people who have harsh words to try to be in his skin and see how they would like to do it.</span> <span id="s3282">That’s why I say I couldn’t care less at all, cause I’ve seen my father’s reaction and I’ve seen his tremendous effort to do whatever is possible.</span> <span id="s3283">And he -- in the certain way the effort worked out, quite a bit survived.</span> <span id="s3284">Not necessarily -- not necessarily in Vilnius but they survived in Dachau, they survived in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s3285">Some survived.</span> <span id="s3286">So, you know, it’s difficult -- difficult to make a judgment.</span> <span id="s3287">And now what can people -- they judge harsh -- harsh behavior at the gate.</span> <span id="s3288">I explained to you the gate.</span> <span id="s3289">Kaunas had completely different situation.</span> <span id="s3290">Vilnius had completely different situation.</span> <span id="s3291">Kaunas didn’t have to feed the people, we had to feed the people.</span> <span id="s3292">So, you do something to do it.</span> <span id="s3293">He had Polish people around, which he didn’t trust.</span> <span id="s3294">Kaunas didn’t have it, Kaunas had Lithuanian people.</span> <span id="s3295">So he had here the Germans on one side and he had untrustworthy Poles on the other side.</span> <span id="s3296">So h-he’s -- find the gold medium.</span> <span id="s3297">You were afraid of the Polish population, which was not friendly at all, not friendly at all.</span> <span id="s3298">He had an agreement with Gestapo.</span> <span id="s3299">The Jewish person had a Polish family, friends.</span> <span id="s3300">The Jewish person would leave his gold for the Polish family to save for him.</span> <span id="s3301">And then one day they would agree that the Jewish person somehow will come in the dark to get some of the gold.</span> <span id="s3302">And the Polish person would call the Gestapo, and the Jewish person would come in, and pick up the Jew, here we go to Lukiškės.</span> <span id="s3303">And that happened time and again, time and again.</span> <span id="s3304">So Father made the plan.</span> <span id="s3305">He offered Gestapo 50 - 50.</span> <span id="s3306">I’ll tell you where the gold is, you take 50, I take 50 percent.</span> <span id="s3307">No Jew goes to Lukiškės, no Jew is shot in Paneriai.</span> <span id="s3308">You have your share, I have my share for the ghetto.</span> <span id="s3309">You had to buy food.</span> <span id="s3310">Food was at exorbitant prices, you needed money.</span> <span id="s3311">So you figured, what I’m losing?</span> <span id="s3312">One way or the other, the Pole will call Gestapo to get the Jew, the gold will go hundred percent to Gestapo.</span> <span id="s3313">This way at least I’ll have 50 percent for Jewish ghetto.</span> <span id="s3314">And the treasury in ghetto will not be bare, will have something.</span> <span id="s3315">Well these people -- these people don’t know it, see?</span> <span id="s3316">He had to -- it was a Machiavelli scheme, but it worked.</span> <span id="s3317">Everybody was happy.</span> <span id="s3318">Gestapo was happy, and Jewish treasury was happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s3319">Q: The Pole wasn’t very happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s3320">A: The -- th-the -- that was not my father’s concern, you see?</span> <span id="s3321">If the -- if the Polish people kept the same attitude, greedy people, people who were friends before, just because it was financial benefit involved, he didn’t care about it.</span> <span id="s3322">So you see, things like this, they are not in the books.</span> <span id="s3323">People who wrote all those articles were happy to have food.</span> <span id="s3324">And they were happy when they saw Commandant werk -- walking around the street aw -- in a good -- in a mood.</span> <span id="s3325">They were happy at that time.</span> <span id="s3326">Well, he -- he wanted -- he wanted to live, but I’ll you again -- you mentioned about his father in Siauliai, I think if he would have lived, his fate would be even worse than his brother’s in Siauliai, from the Soviet Union side.</span> <span id="s3327">Because in addition of being the head of the ghetto, he was anti-Soviet, with all I told you before.</span> <span id="s3328">So I think if my uncle was sent to Vorkuta, he would have -- probably didn’t even reach Vorkuta.</span> <span id="s3329">He would be finished before Vorkuta.</span></p> <p><span id="s3330">Q: Let’s get to Siauliai.</span></p> <p><span id="s3331">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3332">Q: How is it that your uncle, Ephrain Gens, got to be the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3333">A: Coincidence, we didn’t know a thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s3334">Q: It wasn’t -- it wasn’t in any way --</span></p> <p><span id="s3335">A: No way.</span> <span id="s3336">Absolutely not connected.</span> <span id="s3337">Very energetic, very good looking, tall, blonde, blue-eyed.</span> <span id="s3338">Didn’t look like a Jew at all.</span> <span id="s3339">I -- I saw your picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s3340">Q: You showed me the pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s3341">A: He had -- I showed you the picture.</span> <span id="s3342">He didn’t look like a Jew at all.</span> <span id="s3343">Product of Lithuanian schools, Lithuanian university.</span> <span id="s3344">Energetic person.</span> <span id="s3345">Pru --</span></p> <p><span id="s3346">Q: When did you learn he was a ghetto police chief?</span> <span id="s3347">When you were in Vilnius?</span></p> <p><span id="s3348">A: When we were in Vilnius, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3349">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s3350">A: From my aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s3351">Q: From your aunt in Siauliai?</span></p> <p><span id="s3352">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3353">Q: What -- did she have the right to come --</span></p> <p><span id="s3354">A: No --</span></p> <p><span id="s3355">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3356">A: -- no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s3357">Q: Did the brothers ever meet during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s3358">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s3359">The only brother that met [indecipherable] was Salomon on the way to Kloge, to Estonia.</span></p> <p><span id="s3360">Q: So your father and Ephrain, in the times that they each were --</span></p> <p><span id="s3361">A: Had no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s3362">Q: They had no idea --</span></p> <p><span id="s3363">A: No idea, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3364">Q: -- that the other was the head of the police in the other ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s3365">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3366">Q: Not only did they not meet, they had no idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s3367">A: No idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s3368">Q: When did you learn that he --</span></p> <p><span id="s3369">A: When I did learn?</span> <span id="s3370">When he came from Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s3371">Q: So you were still in Lithuania when he came from Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s3372">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3373">Q: And can you give us just a brief kind of overview of what his fate was, what his role there was, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s3374">A: All right.</span> <span id="s3375">First it --</span></p> <p><span id="s3376">Q: And what happened to Aviva?</span></p> <p><span id="s3377">A: He had to hand it in, children’s section.</span> <span id="s3378">That’s what my father didn’t live to see.</span> <span id="s3379">One thing, he was protecting the children.</span> <span id="s3380">And two, his moral satisfaction.</span> <span id="s3381">He did not see the handing in of the children.</span> <span id="s3382">They were taken out after his death.</span> <span id="s3383">He was doing everything he could to protect the children.</span> <span id="s3384">Every time the Germans wanted the children, he would offer something else.</span> <span id="s3385">He si -- his brother couldn’t protect her daughter.</span> <span id="s3386">He was commandant’s -- chief of police daughter, so everybody knew.</span> <span id="s3387">He had to ge-get her.</span> <span id="s3388">What happened?</span> <span id="s3389">In -- when stut -- Stutthof was liberated, the Russians put German cows -- cows marching through Lithuania to Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s3390">And they put the prisoners from Stutthof in charge of the cows.</span> <span id="s3391">And if you talk today to people in Kaunas my age, they will tell you how Kaunas looked when hordes of cows were going through our streets further towards Belose.</span> <span id="s3392">You have no idea.</span> <span id="s3393">So, his wife was one of those prisoners from Auschwitz liberated --</span></p> <p><span id="s3394">Q: Stutthof.</span></p> <p><span id="s3395">A: -- Stutthof, liberated, who was put in charge of getting the cows to Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s3396">Naturally when they came to Vilnius she ran away -- well, they weren't prisoners any more -- she ran away.</span> <span id="s3397">She knew where my aunt, my mother’s sister lived, and she came straight to my aunt, and she told us -- she told us everything.</span> <span id="s3398">She told us how they had to give the child away, and she said that if her husband is alive, they agreed -- cause nobody could even f-fathom what will happen, but they agreed that they’ll meet in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s3399">They’ll look for each other in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s3400">So she stayed with us all the time.</span> <span id="s3401">She was shaven, her hair started to grow, little by little.</span> <span id="s3402">And one day the university choir had a concert in Vilnius.</span> <span id="s3403">We came to Vilnius and I went to visit my mother’s brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s3404">Q: An uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s3405">A: An uncle.</span> <span id="s3406">And when I knocked at the door and my -- his wife, my aunt opened the door, she screamed in an awful way.</span> <span id="s3407">I thought, oh my God, what happened, why is she screaming like that?</span> <span id="s3408">And then I looked deeper and I saw my Uncle Ephrain sitting at the end of second room.</span> <span id="s3409">She screamed -- and she told me later that she didn’t know how to react.</span> <span id="s3410">She was afraid of my reaction, at the same time she couldn’t control herself.</span> <span id="s3411">So anyway, he sat in there, i-in the other room in a German uniform, cause he was six something.</span> <span id="s3412">They couldn’t find him any clothes after Dachau so they dressed him in a German army wu -- uniform.</span> <span id="s3413">Can you imagine, Soviet years, war is still going and I get to the street with a man in German uniform?</span> <span id="s3414">So anyway -- oh, that’s another thing, how we survived, we have to come back to something.</span></p> <p><span id="s3415">Q: We will.</span></p> <p><span id="s3416">A: Anyway, Mama’s ministry of -- I think it was of -- [speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s3417">Q: Commerce.</span></p> <p><span id="s3418">A: -- of commerce, commerce ministry had trucks going Kaunas Vilnius.</span> <span id="s3419">So they gave us a truck.</span> <span id="s3420">We put my uncle at night in the truck and we transported him from Vilnius to Kaunas.</span> <span id="s3421">Now in Kaunas when we returned -- we had nothing in Kaunas, but my aunt had an apartment.</span> <span id="s3422">But because we -- we were cut off in the Samogitia place --</span></p> <p><span id="s3423">Q: Mm-hm, in [indecipherable] mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3424">A: -- in -- in Lithuania, there were 30,000 of us were cut off, we returned to kow -- to Kaunas very late.</span> <span id="s3425">And already in all the poles you could read, if you don’t come back by such and such date, the state will take over your apartments.</span> <span id="s3426">That meant that wi -- if you are in Germany, you ran away, we’ll take over your apartment.</span> <span id="s3427">But they gave a chance for the 30,000 to come back.</span> <span id="s3428">So my ha -- my aunts --</span></p> <p><span id="s3429">Q: The 30,000 refugees, the 30,000 who were hiding, the 30,000 Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s3430">A: The 30,000 who were cut off in Samogitia.</span></p> <p><span id="s3431">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3432">A: Cut off.</span> <span id="s3433">You had Russians coming from this side, you are Germans arriving from this side, and you had 30,000 Lithuanians trying to get somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s3434">Q: I see, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3435">A: So anyway, my -- my -- ma -- my aunt’s landlady figured that probably my aunt will return, so she had no way to save her stuff, but she put her stuff into one room and gave her apartment to enkavadair lady worker.</span> <span id="s3436">The KGB lady worker.</span> <span id="s3437">So now we can’t show my uncle.</span> <span id="s3438">It’s one apartment.</span> <span id="s3439">You know, you share the rooms, share the kitchen.</span> <span id="s3440">It’s one apartment.</span> <span id="s3441">So during the day he exactly sat behind a tall wardrobe, without moving.</span></p> <p><span id="s3442">Q: And the reason why is because he had only a German uniform on?</span></p> <p><span id="s3443">A: He had a ger -- he had a German uniform, he came from Dachau, explain to her, to a KBG lady.</span> <span id="s3444">In uniform.</span> <span id="s3445">She had the blue epaulets and everything.</span> <span id="s3446">So anyway, after awhile of staying in this arrangement, we had no place to sleep.</span> <span id="s3447">My aunt had only one little couch and one chair that you could open.</span> <span id="s3448">And there was my uncle, his wife, Maba, Kata and myself, five of us.</span> <span id="s3449">So they decided that the best thing for them to do would go to Klaipėda.</span> <span id="s3450">But at that time Klaipėda was not open for private population because it was mined by the Germans when they ran.</span> <span id="s3451">They mined every building.</span> <span id="s3452">So the Russian forces were going from one building to another --</span></p> <p><span id="s3453">Q: Clearing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3454">A: -- removing the mines.</span></p> <p><span id="s3455">Q: And this was a harbor town, harbor city.</span></p> <p><span id="s3456">A: It was harbor city.</span> <span id="s3457">So they said, when the mining period will be finished, they’ll go to Klaipėda.</span> <span id="s3458">Nobody knows in Klaipėda the Gens name.</span> <span id="s3459">They realize they cannot stay in Kaunas, Vilnius or Siauliai.</span></p> <p><span id="s3460">Q: He had new clothes, I take it, by that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s3461">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s3462">Q: At some point along the way --</span></p> <p><span id="s3463">A: No.</span> <span id="s3464">No, not yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s3465">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s3466">A: Not yet, not yet, not yet.</span> <span id="s3467">So that’s what -- what was decided would be the best thing for him to do, to move to Klaipėda.</span> <span id="s3468">And then slowly we started to gather things for him to take with and so on, and at one point naturally the clothes had to be changed and the -- but what happened, when Dachau was liberated, he was appointed a head of German post office in Frankfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s3469">Q: How did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s3470">A: Well, he tel --</span></p> <p><span id="s3471">Q: A former prisoner of Dachau becoming --</span></p> <p><span id="s3472">A: Yeah, but that’s a -- Germany is no more.</span></p> <p><span id="s3473">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3474">A: Intelligent person, knew how to work, and he was in Frankfurt am Main, am Oder, that was Frankfurt am Oder.</span> <span id="s3475">He was head of the post office, but then h-he remembered that he made an agreement with his wife to meet in Lithuania if they stay alive.</span> <span id="s3476">So he said nevermind my post in the post office, I’ll go to Lithuania and I’ll see maybe I’ll find my wife alive.</span> <span id="s3477">And that’s, you know, what happened.</span> <span id="s3478">So we transported him from Vilnius, from my other uncle’s home to do this and later on -- you see that -- that will make me explain to you why we left Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s3479">Q: Okay, you can do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3480">A: We have enough time to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s3481">Q: We got enough -- End of Tape Nine</span></p> <p><span id="s3482">Beginning Tape 10</span></p> <p><span id="s3483">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s3484">So your uncle at Frankfurt am Oder remembers his promise to his wife, that if they are alive they meet back in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s3485">He makes it back to Lithuania only in a German soldier’s uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s3486">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3487">Q: By a miracle doesn’t get arrested, doesn’t get picked up.</span> <span id="s3488">Is -- is transported surreptitiously from your mother’s brother’s, that is your uncle’s from the other side of the family apartment in Vilnius, to Kaunas --</span></p> <p><span id="s3489">A: To --</span></p> <p><span id="s3490">Q: -- and eventually goes to --</span></p> <p><span id="s3491">A: Klaipėda.</span></p> <p><span id="s3492">Q: -- Klaipėda.</span></p> <p><span id="s3493">A: N-Now, I’ll explain to you what happened with us.</span> <span id="s3494">When we returned back from hiding --</span></p> <p><span id="s3495">Q: And when did hiding end and how did it end for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3496">A: Soviet army broke through from Leningrad, Riga, pushed the Germans out, and we were on the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s3497">Q: And do you remember what it was like seeing the first Soviet soldier?</span></p> <p><span id="s3498">A: What it was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s3499">Q: Yeah, well I mean, did you see them?</span> <span id="s3500">Did somebody come and tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3501">A: Oh sure.</span> <span id="s3502">No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s3503">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3504">A: We were in the valley.</span></p> <p><span id="s3505">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3506">A: On the other side of the valley was a high -- not highway, but a road where the German army was running like crazy, because on the other side of the valley was a hill and you could see Russian soldiers, mounted soldiers with binoculars watching what’s going on.</span> <span id="s3507">So here is a picture.</span> <span id="s3508">People in the middle, Germans running away, not letting you on the road, because they had to run.</span> <span id="s3509">Russians watching the whole scene and shooting with cartouches over our heads at the rush -- at the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s3510">Q: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s3511">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3512">Now, these were the Russian troops, the frontier troops.</span> <span id="s3513">Mama, in her wisdom told us look, we’re not waiting for the 30,000 people to be transported back to Lithuania, we’re leaving tonight.</span> <span id="s3514">As long as we are dealing with frontier troops, they are not going to be -- there won’t be any inquisition about our political views.</span> <span id="s3515">As soon as the Russian troops go out and the civil government sets in, we’ll start the same thing as we lived in 1940.</span> <span id="s3516">Who are you, where are you and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s3517">And Mama was right, as always.</span> <span id="s3518">So, we asked the Russian echelons of soldiers, trains of soldiers, to help us to go back to Kaunas.</span> <span id="s3519">We explained that we’re refugees from the war, from the shooting.</span> <span id="s3520">So Mama, my unc -- my aunt, who came to join us later in the hiding place, they transported us as far as Radvilishkis.</span> <span id="s3521">On the way there, more people joined the train and they started to tell that in Radvilishkis, which was already in Soviet hands for quite awhile, there is already a KGB checking every refugee, his papers, and asking questions.</span> <span id="s3522">And those people told us that, you know what?</span> <span id="s3523">You better get, before Radvilishkis, off the plane, walk --</span></p> <p><span id="s3524">Q: Off the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s3525">A: -- off the train, walk to Radvilishkis, go in a half circle and get another soldier’s train, jump in to go to Kaunas.</span></p> <p><span id="s3526">Q: By train do you mean an actual train on tr -- on railway tracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s3527">A: On railway tracks, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3528">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3529">A: But the soldiers were coming from the front, back.</span></p> <p><span id="s3530">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3531">A: So we did what the people advised us, and we were in Radvilishkis, the three of us.</span> <span id="s3532">We were on the street and then I see a man coming towards us.</span> <span id="s3533">I say Mama, doesn’t he look familiar to you, I just can’t point -- how do we know him?</span> <span id="s3534">Mama couldn’t remember.</span> <span id="s3535">And then it dawned to me.</span> <span id="s3536">After going to Palegise it was usually, we used to go to a big estate and spend another month in that es-estate, and he was the brother of the owner of the estate.</span> <span id="s3537">Tall man, looked very much like my uncle from Siauliai.</span> <span id="s3538">Silver hair, big, tall.</span> <span id="s3539">So I approached him and I said, do you remember me and my mother?</span> <span id="s3540">He looked at my mother, he said, you know what?</span> <span id="s3541">I think I remember you from year after year staying at that estate.</span> <span id="s3542">And he helped us to go around Radvilishkis.</span> <span id="s3543">He put us on the next soldier train, and we escaped already the Soviet civilian authorities.</span> <span id="s3544">Now again the same thing when -- when we approached Kaunas, we told -- we were told get off the train little bit before.</span> <span id="s3545">When the train stops, don’t go to Kaunas railway station, it’ll be even worse.</span> <span id="s3546">Because Kaunas already in Russian hands for quite awhile.</span> <span id="s3547">See, the area where we were was liberated only in the si -- October, and Kaunas was already liberated much earlier from the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s3548">Q: So we’re talking October ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s3549">A: ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s3550">Q: And Kaunas was liberated probably in July or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3551">A: Somewher -- something like that, you see.</span> <span id="s3552">So that’s what happened, but we didn’t know what happened to my aunt’s apartment.</span> <span id="s3553">So we walked to the apartment and that’s what we found.</span> <span id="s3554">We found that she moved all her stuff to one room, let the [indecipherable] into her apartment, but at least she had one room.</span> <span id="s3555">In those days Lithuania had the cards for food.</span></p> <p><span id="s3556">Q: Ration cards.</span></p> <p><span id="s3557">A: Ra-Ration cards.</span> <span id="s3558">I entered right away the university.</span> <span id="s3559">So we had cards better than the regular person.</span> <span id="s3560">My aunt went back to work, she was a manager of Spodos Fondas.</span> <span id="s3561">I don’t know if you know Spodos Fondas.</span> <span id="s3562">It was a huge chain of -- like Plymptons in America.</span> <span id="s3563">Stationery --</span></p> <p><span id="s3564">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s3565">Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3566">A: Huge chain.</span> <span id="s3567">She went back to Spodos Fondas.</span> <span id="s3568">Now Mama started to look for work.</span> <span id="s3569">Wherever she went, the moment she filled out papers Gens [indecipherable] Mrs. Gens, nothing worked.</span> <span id="s3570">We had [indecipherable] we had nothing.</span> <span id="s3571">So, you know, I was pushed against the wall, I said, Mama, what are we going to do?</span> <span id="s3572">On my student card and my aunt’s regular card, we’ll starve.</span> <span id="s3573">It’s worse than during German occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s3574">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3575">A: There’s nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s3576">I said, you know what?</span> <span id="s3577">I’m going to Vilnius.</span> <span id="s3578">I have to find some survivors in Vilnius, I’ll see what I can finally find out.</span> <span id="s3579">To make a long story short, I go to Vilnius, and I knew that in every institution the Kadros Kiros would be again in the hands of Jewish people.</span> <span id="s3580">I go to one ministry, I open the door and were f-five of them standing.</span> <span id="s3581">They couldn’t believe that I am alive.</span> <span id="s3582">They said, Ada, you alive?</span> <span id="s3583">What about mother?</span> <span id="s3584">Said, Mother is alive.</span> <span id="s3585">Said oh, we all knew that you are dead, both of you.</span> <span id="s3586">Because we disappeared.</span> <span id="s3587">See, we disappeared so quick that there was no time even to think otherwise.</span> <span id="s3588">So I said, look, we are alive, yes, but you know, we probably will die from hunger cause we have no money, nothing to sell, and how do we survive?</span> <span id="s3589">So he said, oh, don’t you worry.</span> <span id="s3590">I said Mama was looking for a job, she speaks perfect Russian, when she men-mentions her last name, nobody gives her work.</span> <span id="s3591">So one of them said, you know what?</span> <span id="s3592">Don’t you worry.</span> <span id="s3593">Mama comes to work for my ministry, I’ll he -- make her a head of administrative si -- administrative de-department, and I’ll keep Mama’s dossier under key.</span> <span id="s3594">And as long as I’m the ch-chief, she -- her papers are in the si -- sealed, under a key.</span> <span id="s3595">No problems.</span> <span id="s3596">When I came back to ha -- Kaunas, Mama said, how did you dare to do that?</span> <span id="s3597">You know that I don’t want to be a prominent person.</span> <span id="s3598">I don’t, you know, that I’d want to [indecipherable] anywhere.</span> <span id="s3599">I said, Mama, we have to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s3600">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3601">A: So either or.</span> <span id="s3602">Either you will be a prominent person --</span></p> <p><span id="s3603">Q: And we’d eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s3604">A: -- or we eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s3605">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3606">A: And th -- that what we did.</span> <span id="s3607">Now, one day --</span></p> <p><span id="s3608">Q: So, which ministry was this part of?</span></p> <p><span id="s3609">A: [indecipherable] ministry.</span></p> <p><span id="s3610">Q: Commerce ministry.</span></p> <p><span id="s3611">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3612">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3613">A: Commerce ministry.</span> <span id="s3614">One day he pays us a visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s3615">Q: In Kaunas.</span></p> <p><span id="s3616">A: In Kaunas.</span></p> <p><span id="s3617">Q: And who was this man?</span></p> <p><span id="s3618">A: He’s in Canada.</span> <span id="s3619">Tevya Sheriss.</span> <span id="s3620">He said, Mrs. Gens, I have to tell you that I am not able to keep your papers under the key much longer, and I would advise you to do something about it.</span> <span id="s3621">She looked at him and said, what do you mean?</span> <span id="s3622">He said, I am Polish citizen.</span> <span id="s3623">I am going to Poland, I’m repatriating to Poland, and I would advise you to repatriate to Poland.</span> <span id="s3624">Mama looked at him, said, how can I repatriate?</span> <span id="s3625">I am Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s3626">I speak Polish perfectly, but I am not Polish and everybody in Kaunas knows who I am.</span> <span id="s3627">So he said, well, try to think of something.</span> <span id="s3628">And we had in each location, a Polish repatriating committee.</span> <span id="s3629">So repatriating committee would check your Polish ancestry, but then Lithuanian KGB had to stamp it.</span> <span id="s3630">So it wasn’t so simple.</span> <span id="s3631">So Mama -- we went to many places in the area of Vilnius, where nobody knew who Mama is.</span> <span id="s3632">And we tried the Polish committees, to talk to them.</span> <span id="s3633">They said fine, we’ll do it.</span> <span id="s3634">Because Mama had perfect documents from her high school and from work at the Polish refugee committee from the first war.</span> <span id="s3635">And they said -- another thing was, I spoke perfect Polish.</span> <span id="s3636">So, no Lithuanians in those years spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s3637">So she -- he -- she would tell, look at my daughter.</span> <span id="s3638">We’re Polish people.</span> <span id="s3639">But they said, what about the Lithuanian?</span> <span id="s3640">You will not go through the Lithuanian KGB.</span> <span id="s3641">So Mama came back to Kaunas and said, I don’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s3642">There is no way to get official papers, and there is no way af-after he unlocks his [indecipherable] and goes to Poland that they will keep me there.</span> <span id="s3643">So, I don’t know who was the person to help us, but we went through Polish committee legally, absolutely.</span> <span id="s3644">Now there was a question of getting Lithuanian exit stamps.</span> <span id="s3645">Somebody took the papers, somebody did the work and somebody got paid.</span> <span id="s3646">And in our transport were all the workers of Kaunas theater.</span> <span id="s3647">Ballerinas and drama, everybody was from the theater.</span> <span id="s3648">At that time my uncle and his wife were still with us, and Mama said Froizim, how about we try the same for you?</span> <span id="s3649">And he answered, Elenka, there is no way.</span> <span id="s3650">I am too -- too -- I -- I would show in between those people, I would stand out.</span> <span id="s3651">I cannot risk.</span> <span id="s3652">I went through so much, I cannot risk to be caught at the border.</span> <span id="s3653">Because we didn’t know the arrangement, was it enough bribe, not enough bribe, will we go through?</span> <span id="s3654">Because we could have been on one stretch to Siberia, crossing the Soviet border illegally.</span> <span id="s3655">When we arrived at Suwalki and crossing bord -- crossing point, we see that were two young ladies, they went to -- with big baskets with everything in the basket, to the guards, and we see that they handed the baskets and they returned to the -- there was three trucks -- two buses and a truck.</span> <span id="s3656">And we see that they are lifting up the -- the -- the big wooden plank that crosses the border.</span> <span id="s3657">We enter Suwalki.</span> <span id="s3658">We enter Suwalki and now, can you imagine, in the whole transport of our people, only Mother and I speak Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s3659">Q: And yet everybody’s a Pole repate -- repatriating to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s3660">A: Right, right, to Poland, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3661">Q: That’s a big bribe.</span></p> <p><span id="s3662">A: Yeah, the big bribe.</span> <span id="s3663">So anyway, Mama looked around at [indecipherable] we can’t stay here very long, because if they catch -- the Poles -- Pole -- Polish were under the Soviet influence.</span></p> <p><span id="s3664">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3665">A: We can’t stay here very long.</span> <span id="s3666">Let’s try and get out as soon as possible.</span> <span id="s3667">But was easy said, not so easy done.</span></p> <p><span id="s3668">Q: So you wanted to abandon all those drama and theater people from --</span></p> <p><span id="s3669">A: We -- we were -- yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s3670">Q: -- Kaunas.</span></p> <p><span id="s3671">A: -- yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s3672">Now what happened.</span> <span id="s3673">My aunt was on the same repatriation paper, there were three of us.</span> <span id="s3674">And at the last day she said, you know what?</span> <span id="s3675">I am afraid.</span> <span id="s3676">I’ll stay, I cannot go.</span> <span id="s3677">Because 75 percent was doubtful and it looked that we may not cross the border.</span> <span id="s3678">So she stayed behind.</span> <span id="s3679">Now, that friend of mine, Mr. Sheriss, before he left he gave us a name and address in Lódz and he told us look, you get in touch with that person.</span> <span id="s3680">Do you know what the Jewish aliyah is?</span></p> <p><span id="s3681">Q: Isn’t that transfer to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s3682">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3683">Q: Going to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s3684">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3685">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3686">A: From all over the world.</span> <span id="s3687">He said, she is a liaison for Jewish aliyah and when you tell her who you are, she’ll help you to get out of Poland to other destinations.</span> <span id="s3688">So we come to Lódz, we find the address and the lady who opened the door said, oh yes, she was in here, but about couple of weeks ago, she went west.</span> <span id="s3689">That was our only connection in Poland.</span> <span id="s3690">She went west.</span> <span id="s3691">Ah, but she says, you know what?</span> <span id="s3692">There is a doctor from Vilnius.</span> <span id="s3693">He lives in the same courtyard.</span> <span id="s3694">Dr. Romanofsky.</span> <span id="s3695">Go and talk to Dr. Romanofsky, maybe he’ll know -- because she is from Vilnius, he is from Vilnius, maybe he’ll know where did she go.</span> <span id="s3696">So Mama stays in the middle of the courtyard, I ring a bell to Dr. Romanofsky’s door.</span> <span id="s3697">The door opens up.</span> <span id="s3698">Mrs. Feigenberg opens the door, and the German nurse stands behind her.</span> <span id="s3699">And Mrs. Feigenberg [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3700">Q: A German nurse?</span></p> <p><span id="s3701">A: Yeah, worked for -- for her husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s3702">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s3703">And this is --</span></p> <p><span id="s3704">A: This is already free Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s3705">Q: Free Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s3706">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3707">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3708">A: I understood immediately.</span> <span id="s3709">I was sent to see Dr. Romanofsky and I found Dr. Feigenberg, one of the doctors that my father pulled forward to live in the hospital.</span> <span id="s3710">He couldn’t live -- he couldn’t leave vil -- Lithuania, so he bought himself papers of a deceased Polish doctor, Romanofsky, with his diploma and everything and he arrived Poland illegally himself.</span> <span id="s3711">The Russians wouldn’t let him go, and he lived in that apartment as Dr. Romanofsky.</span> <span id="s3712">That’s when -- Mrs. Feigenberg, when she saw me, she almost shouting me not to call her Mrs. Feigenberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s3713">Q: And there was a German nurse behind her?</span></p> <p><span id="s3714">A: Working for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s3715">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3716">A: She was a German national.</span></p> <p><span id="s3717">Q: I see, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3718">A: She was working for her husband as a nurse.</span> <span id="s3719">Not a German for -- but she was a German --</span></p> <p><span id="s3720">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3721">A: -- by -- by nationality.</span> <span id="s3722">So anyway, you see, that was a split second.</span> <span id="s3723">If I would have a blabbermouth, I’d say, oh, Mrs. Feigenberg, how nice to see you.</span> <span id="s3724">That would have cut into his career.</span> <span id="s3725">So now the Feigenbergs took us in and we stayed more than two months with them.</span> <span id="s3726">And in the meantime the aliyah started working to get us out.</span> <span id="s3727">Why did we go to Torun?</span> <span id="s3728">We went -- when we left Lódz, we went to Torun.</span> <span id="s3729">During the German occupation, when it was quiet in Vilnius, when they didn’t round up, you know, the young people, I used to take English lessons from a Polish lady.</span> <span id="s3730">And then you were -- we got very friendly.</span> <span id="s3731">Her father was a director of a theater in Toruni.</span> <span id="s3732">And somehow she’s jokingly told -- said, you know, Ada what -- if you ever happen to be in Poland, if you ever happen to be close to Torun, come and stay with us.</span> <span id="s3733">I used to help them a lot.</span> <span id="s3734">They were afraid to leave the apartment because of the [indecipherable] the -- the roundups.</span> <span id="s3735">I used to go get food for them.</span> <span id="s3736">So anyway, the relationship was very nice.</span> <span id="s3737">And Mama said, you know what?</span> <span id="s3738">We’re sitting with the Feigenbergs already two months.</span> <span id="s3739">How much longer can we sit?</span> <span id="s3740">They were very nice to us.</span> <span id="s3741">In the meantime, they discovered that Mrs. Feigenberg’s deported parents survived Siberia and are on the way back to Poland to join them.</span> <span id="s3742">So we went to Torun and we started to ask where is the theater.</span> <span id="s3743">We found the theater and we asked, by any chance is Mr. such and such with the theater?</span> <span id="s3744">They say sure, he returned back to his regular director of the theater.</span> <span id="s3745">So we went to see -- to see them and we stayed with them for awhile.</span> <span id="s3746">See, sometimes, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s3747">Q: That’s right, there’s connections.</span></p> <p><span id="s3748">A: -- there’s connections, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3749">Q: Mr. Sheriss, before I remember -- before I forget, how did you know him in Vilnius, was he in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s3750">A: One of the friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s3751">Q: He was a friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s3752">A: A friend of mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s3753">Q: A friend of yours --</span></p> <p><span id="s3754">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3755">Q: -- but was he in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s3756">A: In the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s3757">Q: He was in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s3758">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3759">Q: Okay, so you --</span></p> <p><span id="s3760">A: Well these -- that -- oh, the whole five or six, when I entered the room, they were all my friends from ghetto.</span> <span id="s3761">And when I told them, look, we have nothing to eat, do something, so they said, let Tevka do it for you.</span> <span id="s3762">He can do it.</span> <span id="s3763">He is a big chief and so he did it, yeah.</span> <span id="s3764">So now we were --</span></p> <p><span id="s3765">Q: In Torun.</span></p> <p><span id="s3766">A: -- in Torun, and we followed now aliyah.</span> <span id="s3767">There was a group, was supposed to go via Austria.</span> <span id="s3768">Our group was supposed to go through five borders [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3769">And we were placed -- we were brought to Berlin with a group of Jewish people and placed in the building for Jewish refugees.</span> <span id="s3770">And while in that building, next day, Mama said, you know, I don’t feel very good in here.</span> <span id="s3771">We are in the Russian zone of occupation.</span> <span id="s3772">The Jewish people are already shu-shu-shu-shu-shu-shu-shu, something is wrong with me and you.</span> <span id="s3773">They can see that I’m not Jewish and I don’t believe it’s safe for us to -- to be in here.</span> <span id="s3774">The man who was in charge of the group, his wife was eight months pregnant so he is -- was worried about his wife more than about the group, and I said Mama, we’ll have to do something, but I don’t know what, let me think.</span> <span id="s3775">What can we do?</span> <span id="s3776">And I found out from the group that in the west Berlin there is a huge refugee camp, but huge, for thousands of people.</span> <span id="s3777">And they were supposed to be transported to that refugee camp.</span> <span id="s3778">But before to get to the refugee camp, you had to go in Berlin through Jewish committee to be issued a certain ausweis, a paper to show that you are a -- a Jews --</span></p> <p><span id="s3779">Q: Identification paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s3780">A: -- I.D..</span> <span id="s3781">And when Mama went to that place, they look at my mother and said, sorry, you don’t look Jewish.</span> <span id="s3782">So I hoped that there was -- somebody would be from Vilnius.</span> <span id="s3783">I said, do you have anybody from Lithuania, from Vilnius in here?</span> <span id="s3784">They said no, we don’t.</span> <span id="s3785">So there was no way to say that I am Gens widow and daughter and so on, per -- they didn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s3786">So when we came back I said, Mama, you know what?</span> <span id="s3787">You stay here.</span> <span id="s3788">I’ll try to go to the west zone and see if I can get into that camp.</span> <span id="s3789">Because it was too dangerous.</span> <span id="s3790">We made through so much, so that suddenly, you know -- and I went to the camp, and I figured it’s no sense to talk to some employee.</span> <span id="s3791">The director was American General Taylor, not the famous Taylor, another General Taylor and asked his -- I asked his secretary that I would like to talk to the director.</span> <span id="s3792">And she looked at me, said well, young lady, you can sit and wait.</span> <span id="s3793">I don’t know if he’ll be able to see you, but at least you can wait.</span> <span id="s3794">I did wait probably three hours.</span> <span id="s3795">I sat in the waiting room, finally he saw me.</span> <span id="s3796">And you know what, it was nothing to hide.</span> <span id="s3797">I couldn’t lie.</span> <span id="s3798">I told him the truth.</span> <span id="s3799">I told him about my father.</span> <span id="s3800">I told the Jewish aliyah has do -- supported us as far as Berlin, but now we are stuck.</span> <span id="s3801">We cannot get Jewish I.D..</span> <span id="s3802">So the first reaction he said to me, you know young lady, this all sounds like a fairy tale.</span> <span id="s3803">I said, it sounds like a fairy tale, but this is truth.</span> <span id="s3804">Because there was no way out.</span> <span id="s3805">We were sitting in Soviet zone of occupation.</span> <span id="s3806">So he said, don’t worry at all.</span> <span id="s3807">Here are the two stickers.</span> <span id="s3808">Go and get your mother, get her to the camp and here you go, we’ll transport you through Hanover to American zone and that’s the end of your problems.</span> <span id="s3809">Now I come back to the Jewish house.</span> <span id="s3810">My mother is half alive.</span> <span id="s3811">The ladies are putting her cold compresses on her head because I didn’t return for so many hours.</span> <span id="s3812">Mother thought that maybe the-the Russian soldiers got me, or whatever.</span> <span id="s3813">She is half dead.</span> <span id="s3814">And I walk in, I says, Mama, don’t say anything.</span> <span id="s3815">We didn’t have much, I had a rucksack and she had a rucksack, it’s all we had.</span> <span id="s3816">I said, take your rucksack, get slowly dressed and we’re getting out from here.</span> <span id="s3817">She said, where to?</span> <span id="s3818">I said, we’re all set, we’re going to that refugee camp.</span> <span id="s3819">So, they didn’t see us walk out, you know, somehow you find a moment when people are in another room, we walked out.</span> <span id="s3820">And we got to the western Berlin and we got into the camp.</span> <span id="s3821">Naturally the first thing they did was put a DDT behind your clothes, but they gave us food, place to live and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s3822">Q: So this is the first time that you are not really under any occupation in years.</span></p> <p><span id="s3823">A: In years, right, yeah.</span> <span id="s3824">But we -- we were staying in the Jewish house in the Russian zone.</span></p> <p><span id="s3825">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3826">A: See, Berlin was, remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s3827">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3828">A: -- Russian, American, French and British.</span> <span id="s3829">And a huge, huge truck trailer took us to Hanover.</span></p> <p><span id="s3830">Q: What part of Berlin was this huge camp?</span> <span id="s3831">West Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s3832">A: Wa -- wa -- that was in th -- in the American zone.</span></p> <p><span id="s3833">Q: In Zehlendorf?</span> <span id="s3834">In -- do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s3835">A: I -- I don’t know whether it was in Zehlendorf.</span> <span id="s3836">I remember the name Zehlendorf, but I don’t know whether in connection with that or not.</span> <span id="s3837">It was one tremendous big --</span></p> <p><span id="s3838">Q: Camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s3839">A: -- camp.</span> <span id="s3840">They brought us to Hanover and when we disembarked in Hanover, we were told that’s the British zone of occupation, that the Britishers are returning the bolts and the Soviet prisoners of war back to Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s3841">And that already Soviet prisoners are war -- of war are committing suicide to the left and to the right because they know that their fate is going straight to Siberia.</span> <span id="s3842">That wasn’t very pleasant because we never expected that Baltic people would be returned to Baltic states.</span> <span id="s3843">Now, Britishers were as naïve as Americans.</span> <span id="s3844">They figured Baltic states are free, you -- you don’t have to be refugees --</span></p> <p><span id="s3845">Q: Go home.</span></p> <p><span id="s3846">A: -- go be home.</span> <span id="s3847">And while we were on the transport, somehow a young man attached to us and he said, you know what?</span> <span id="s3848">I know somebody in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s3849">I’ll take you there and we’ll see what we can do further.</span> <span id="s3850">So we stayed with that lady, afternoon and then we went to the railway station and got into the transport of coal, black coal.</span> <span id="s3851">And we hid in that carriage with coal -- there was a -- you know, a transport that had all kinds of merchandise and they had coal in between.</span> <span id="s3852">And we knew that nobody was going to look for us in that carriage with coal, and we went as far as Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s3853">Q: Wow, clear across the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s3854">A: We looked like a devil, black.</span> <span id="s3855">When we arrived Munich -- and you know, this is something that goes from mouth to mouth, a -- a place was called Deutsches museum, German museum.</span> <span id="s3856">That was a center for all refugees in American zone.</span> <span id="s3857">They used to come for i-information and everything in that Deutsches museum.</span> <span id="s3858">A -- End of Tape 10</span></p> <p><span id="s3859">Beginning Tape 11</span></p> <p><span id="s3860">Q: Okay, so now you’re in Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s3861">A: Now I’m in Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s3862">Q: Covered with coal dust.</span></p> <p><span id="s3863">A: Covered in coal dust.</span> <span id="s3864">So we -- we di -- we wer -- were in gi -- a separate room, we’re -- we were directed to a big, huge room with people, but we had food, we had showers, we could wash u-up, we could change our clothes, we had alrea --</span></p> <p><span id="s3865">Q: And you had the stickers from General Taylor.</span></p> <p><span id="s3866">A: And we had the stickers from General Taylor, right.</span> <span id="s3867">But that was only half of the story.</span> <span id="s3868">I went out to look for Lithuanians because we were already out of the cl -- not clutches, but out of being supervised by aliyah.</span> <span id="s3869">Their role was to bring us to west and we were already in west.</span> <span id="s3870">So I stepped into the hole and then right in front of me stood two men speaking Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s3871">So I approached and I said, by any chance -- but you know, that’s a stupid, stupid question.</span> <span id="s3872">I said by any chance do you know where the Venslauskas family is in Germany?</span> <span id="s3873">So he turned to me, said, you know Panana, what?</span> <span id="s3874">If you wouldn’t have found us two here, you would never find out where they are.</span> <span id="s3875">They are in a tiny farming village, living with a farmer.</span> <span id="s3876">He said, I can give you directions how to reach them, and you can take a train up to a certain distance, but from that distance you’ll have to walk about 10 kilometers.</span></p> <p><span id="s3877">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s3878">A: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s3879">And there it was winter and I figured, well that’s the only way to reach.</span> <span id="s3880">And these are the people who helped us escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s3881">Q: They had helped you escape --</span></p> <p><span id="s3882">A: Remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s3883">Q: -- when you had to hid -- hide --</span></p> <p><span id="s3884">A: Hide, and th --</span></p> <p><span id="s3885">Q: -- in ji -- in Zemaitji.</span></p> <p><span id="s3886">A: -- that’s the people -- person who took us from the train to his estate.</span></p> <p><span id="s3887">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3888">A: So now, okay, I take a train.</span> <span id="s3889">Mama stays safe now in the west and I disembark.</span> <span id="s3890">The s -- name of the station was Donoverte.</span> <span id="s3891">Hm, 10 kilometers, 10 kilometers, big deal.</span> <span id="s3892">You know, you’re on skiing five kilometers you don’t even feel it.</span> <span id="s3893">I start walking.</span> <span id="s3894">I go, I go, and I see a German military camp.</span> <span id="s3895">And [indecipherable] of the German military camp, you know, you have the s-sip -- open doors somewhere, I see German soldiers and the German ladies.</span> <span id="s3896">So I went as fast I could around the camp, and I kept walking and a car stopped.</span> <span id="s3897">He said, where are you going?</span> <span id="s3898">Would you like a ride?</span> <span id="s3899">I said, I’m going to such and such village, the farming village.</span> <span id="s3900">And he said, who are you visiting?</span> <span id="s3901">I said, I am visiting -- I want to find a Lithuanian family, and I mentioned the name.</span> <span id="s3902">Oh, he said, he lives with one of our people over there, so I’ll give you a ride.</span> <span id="s3903">So he gave me the last couple of kilometers.</span> <span id="s3904">I was already tired.</span> <span id="s3905">It’s winter, snow.</span> <span id="s3906">I’m not equipped with snow, any skis or anything.</span> <span id="s3907">He brought me to the door, I knocked at the door, I opened the door and here it is, I’m standing in the doorway and the person who was on the train stands inside of the kitchen.</span> <span id="s3908">He says to me, you are alive?</span> <span id="s3909">I looked all over Germany, between the refugees, trying to find you.</span> <span id="s3910">I said, you didn’t show up to take us away.</span> <span id="s3911">He was supposed to come with horses, take us away, across.</span></p> <p><span id="s3912">Q: From where to where?</span></p> <p><span id="s3913">A: For -- from where we were hiding two years.</span> <span id="s3914">Their estate was not too far.</span> <span id="s3915">He was supposed to come in and we waited for him to show up, he never showed up.</span> <span id="s3916">What happened, he was cut away, couldn’t cross any [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3917">The Russians were coming from that side, he couldn’t ge -- he couldn’t come in.</span> <span id="s3918">So he knew that we were left behind.</span> <span id="s3919">So when he saw me there he said, where are you from?</span> <span id="s3920">I said, from Lithuania.</span> <span id="s3921">He said, I don’t believe it.</span> <span id="s3922">Nobody comes out from Lithuania now.</span> <span id="s3923">I says, well, we came, we managed.</span></p> <p><span id="s3924">Q: And this was already winter of ’46, of --</span></p> <p><span id="s3925">A: ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s3926">Q: Winter of ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s3927">A: ’45, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3928">Q: Okay, the war is still going on --</span></p> <p><span id="s3929">A: So could have been the six, January, February, because it -- I remember snow.</span></p> <p><span id="s3930">Q: And the war is over?</span></p> <p><span id="s3931">A: Oh yes, war was over in May.</span></p> <p><span id="s3932">Q: All right, then it’s ’46.</span></p> <p><span id="s3933">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3934">Q: Winter of ’46.</span></p> <p><span id="s3935">A: ’46.</span></p> <p><span id="s3936">Q: Winter of ’46.</span></p> <p><span id="s3937">A: Beginning of -- the end of winter ’45, beginning of winter ’46.</span></p> <p><span id="s3938">Q: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s3939">A: So I said, where is everybody?</span> <span id="s3940">Where is Mama, where is grandmother, everybody?</span> <span id="s3941">He said, they are not too far from here.</span> <span id="s3942">They are in -- in the refugee camp.</span> <span id="s3943">And he came with me to see my mother, and then he took me to meet his family, already here, in -- in the west.</span> <span id="s3944">So now he explained to me the situation, he said now -- now you go to Lithuanian committee, get yourself a DP card.</span> <span id="s3945">I said, what’s a DP card?</span> <span id="s3946">All I have is from General Taylor, di -- ad -- written notes to accept the Lithuanian two women into the camp.</span> <span id="s3947">He said, oh no, no, no.</span> <span id="s3948">You go to your nationality committee and you get a displaced person’s card.</span> <span id="s3949">In short, DP card, that’s why the ec -- expression depokas.</span></p> <p><span id="s3950">Q: Did you ever have passports leaving Lithuania?</span> <span id="s3951">Did you ever any identity papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s3952">A: I was too young.</span> <span id="s3953">I was too young.</span></p> <p><span id="s3954">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3955">A: I was too young.</span></p> <p><span id="s3956">Q: Did your mother have a la -- let’s say, any identity papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s3957">A: She had her Lithuanian passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s3958">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3959">A: But not ta -- saying that she is Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s3960">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s3961">Just saying that she is Lithuanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s3962">A: She was Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s3963">And not Polish, either.</span></p> <p><span id="s3964">Q: That’s right.</span> <span id="s3965">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s3966">A: So now he explained to me that I have to go to Lithuanian committee in Munich and get Mama and myself DP cards.</span> <span id="s3967">So I go to the Lithuanian committee, and Mr. Carvalis was the head of the committee.</span> <span id="s3968">He listened to my story and he says, you know what Panana Nela?</span> <span id="s3969">I knew your father very well.</span> <span id="s3970">I’d do anything to help you, but my hands are tied.</span> <span id="s3971">Nobody at this date can get a displaced person’s card.</span> <span id="s3972">You are past the period.</span> <span id="s3973">Finished.</span> <span id="s3974">Everybody who came from Lithuania as refugees, everybody’s set, everybody has a card, everybody is registered.</span> <span id="s3975">No more cards.</span> <span id="s3976">And I cannot tell now Americans that you just came from Soviet Union via Jewish aliyah.</span> <span id="s3977">You see, too many -- too many contradictions.</span></p> <p><span id="s3978">Q: Too many aliases.</span></p> <p><span id="s3979">A: Too many aliases.</span> <span id="s3980">So I said, so Mr. Carvalis, so what do you advise me?</span> <span id="s3981">He said look, two blocks away is Jewish committee.</span> <span id="s3982">Go to Jewish committee.</span> <span id="s3983">Carvalis knew my father, said, go to Jewish committee, tell them who you are and have the Jewish committee help you because the Jewish people still kept escaping Soviet Union in those days and a lot of refugees came in ’46 - ’47 - ’48, running away from the Soviets.</span> <span id="s3984">So now I go to Jewish committee and naturally in the Jewish committee everybody knows who I am.</span> <span id="s3985">So I said, gentlemen --</span></p> <p><span id="s3986">Q: They didn’t in Berlin, but they did in Munich?</span></p> <p><span id="s3987">A: Munich were Lithuanian Jews.</span> <span id="s3988">In Berlin were German Jews.</span> <span id="s3989">So German Jews, me telling that I’m Gens’ daughter didn’t get anything.</span> <span id="s3990">Here when they saw me, their approach is, what can we do for you?</span> <span id="s3991">A different approach.</span> <span id="s3992">So I told them that I was brought by aliyah, that the lithu -- I went to Lithuanian committee, they cannot help me.</span> <span id="s3993">They says, what’s the problem?</span> <span id="s3994">We’ll give you here.</span> <span id="s3995">We’ll get you a DP card and that’s it.</span> <span id="s3996">And what they did for us, you know, like in each place there are two classes.</span> <span id="s3997">They sent Mother and me to Saint Ottilian.</span> <span id="s3998">Saint Ottilian was a German sanitory -- or -- or a --</span></p> <p><span id="s3999">Q: Sanitorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s4000">A: -- san -- sanitorium for SS officers.</span> <span id="s4001">So after the war, that sanitorium was taken away from the SS, they left some SS doctors working and gave it for the inmates of concentration camp, the Jewish inmates of concentration camp.</span> <span id="s4002">And since Vilnius is considered a concentration camp, we were given a status of concentration camp inmates and sent direct to Saint Ottilian.</span></p> <p><span id="s4003">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s4004">A: We come to Saint Ottilian and the first doctor who looked at my mother was Dr. Berman from Kaunas.</span> <span id="s4005">He said Mrs. Gens, how are you?</span> <span id="s4006">You look like the Jesus Christ crucified.</span> <span id="s4007">There’s nothing left.</span> <span id="s4008">Mama was awful looking.</span> <span id="s4009">All that tension, all those borders and everything, drained her completely.</span> <span id="s4010">And Dr. Berman was her doctor when she had pneumonia for the seventh time, he was treating her for pneumonia, he didn’t even expect her to survive.</span> <span id="s4011">So Dr. Berman did everything in his power to put her back on her feet.</span> <span id="s4012">So we had the most -- most wonderful conditions, except that we lived in a palatta, in a -- in a sickroom, I mean if -- a room for probably 20 people at least.</span> <span id="s4013">But we had wonderful food, and we could relax and the nervous tension was gone, you see?</span> <span id="s4014">And we stayed in Saint Ottilian for quite awhile.</span> <span id="s4015">But that was only for privileged people.</span> <span id="s4016">And then --</span></p> <p><span id="s4017">Q: So that your -- your friends from Vilnius --</span></p> <p><span id="s4018">A: They put us on the track --</span></p> <p><span id="s4019">Q: -- helped you -- helped you --</span></p> <p><span id="s4020">A: They put us with aliyah --</span></p> <p><span id="s4021">Q: Aliyah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4022">A: -- with -- the whole way -- you see, we lost connection.</span> <span id="s4023">We found Dr. Feigenberg, how to continue the connection --</span></p> <p><span id="s4024">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4025">A: -- and somehow we managed.</span> <span id="s4026">And we stayed with them very long, until Mama was back on her feet.</span> <span id="s4027">And then we decided that I’ll go to Munich and enter university.</span> <span id="s4028">So when I came to Munich and went to the university, they wouldn’t accept people born in ’26.</span> <span id="s4029">They were a -- they were having hordes of German soldiers coming from Russian prisoner’s camp, and priority was for the older ones, not for born in ’26.</span> <span id="s4030">How much I tried, how much the Jewish committee tried.</span> <span id="s4031">They said, we don’t make any exceptions to that regulation.</span> <span id="s4032">So I figured, well, if I can’t go to university, I’ll go to conservatory.</span> <span id="s4033">So I went to Munich conservatory, continued, you know, tra-la-la.</span></p> <p><span id="s4034">Q: Music.</span></p> <p><span id="s4035">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s4036">Then they -- they started to talk about registration to United States.</span> <span id="s4037">We registered to go to United States as refugees, but I was past 21, and my quota was very bad.</span> <span id="s4038">There were thousands of Lithuanians, but very small quota.</span> <span id="s4039">Lithuania was a small country.</span> <span id="s4040">So I had to wait years for my quota and my mother refused to go without me.</span> <span id="s4041">So we stayed, and one day a -- do you know Veruch’s reform --</span></p> <p><span id="s4042">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s4043">A: -- the monetary reform.</span></p> <p><span id="s4044">Q: Monetary reform 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s4045">A: One day we woke up, 20 marks a person.</span> <span id="s4046">Well, 20 marks a person, it’s a beginning.</span> <span id="s4047">You know, again, everything.</span> <span id="s4048">We were already very well set.</span> <span id="s4049">We had the [indecipherable] cards.</span> <span id="s4050">I was attending conservatory, and we weren’t rich, but we -- we managed to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s4051">Q: I have a question that [indecipherable] you said at one point when you were in Germany you were looking to see where is Hingst, where is Murer, where is W-Weiss?</span></p> <p><span id="s4052">A: Mama didn't want me, she was so f -- so against, but I wanted -- I wanted to find out what happened to these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s4053">Q: Were you able to find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s4054">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s4055">I found out later that Murer was arrested by the Soviets, spent several years in Soviet Union, but when he returned back to Austria, they found him not guilty, but at least I think he sat for six years in Soviet camps.</span> <span id="s4056">Well, that’s good enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s4057">Q: At least that much.</span></p> <p><span id="s4058">A: Weiss -- Weiss died in German c -- prison.</span> <span id="s4059">This is unforgettable things, I shouldn’t have listened to my mother, I should have gotten somehow to Weiss to find out about my father.</span> <span id="s4060">She wouldn’t let me.</span> <span id="s4061">She didn’t want anything to do with the Germans.</span> <span id="s4062">And that was the only liaison that could have helped me to find out about him.</span> <span id="s4063">He may not have wanted to talk to me, but maybe there are some memoirs or something, you know.</span> <span id="s4064">But Weiss was dead.</span> <span id="s4065">I went to see Mr. Wiesenthal when I was in Vienna and I asked Mr. Wiesenthal maybe he can help me to find out about what happened to my father.</span> <span id="s4066">He said he has absolutely no idea.</span> <span id="s4067">There are no --</span></p> <p><span id="s4068">Q: No traces.</span></p> <p><span id="s4069">A: -- no traces, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s4070">Q: No documents.</span></p> <p><span id="s4071">A: No documents, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s4072">Q: Do you know if there is any documentation in German archives that would have been passed on by the Gestapo or --</span></p> <p><span id="s4073">A: It could.</span> <span id="s4074">It could, it could.</span></p> <p><span id="s4075">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s4076">A: It could.</span></p> <p><span id="s4077">Q: But he didn’t have it at his fing --</span></p> <p><span id="s4078">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s4079">Q: -- he didn't have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s4080">A: He didn’t have an -- it.</span> <span id="s4081">No.</span> <span id="s4082">I think the Gestapo -- I think Gestapo kept paper work in order, so you see, the -- those -- when I worked for office of special investigations, they got lists of collaborators of the members of the sondercommando in the German documentation --</span></p> <p><span id="s4083">Q: Archives.</span></p> <p><span id="s4084">A: -- archives.</span> <span id="s4085">So there could be that something is in there, but how to find it, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s4086">See Mama is -- Mama is gone.</span> <span id="s4087">If Mama would be alive, maybe I could try to do something.</span> <span id="s4088">Now that she is gone, I mean that’s -- it would have given her a peace of mind at least, to know.</span> <span id="s4089">Now this way we don’t know anything.</span> <span id="s4090">So anyway, that’s it, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s4091">Q: Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s4092">Your daughter mentioned Nuremberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s4093">A: That I was in Nuremberg, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4094">Q: So how did this happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s4095">A: When I was -- now -- now I’m back to the Jewish side.</span></p> <p><span id="s4096">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s4097">A: There was a close [indecipherable] where we were staying was a huge Jewish camp, town of Landsberg.</span> <span id="s4098">And there was a big concert in Landsberg.</span> <span id="s4099">Dr. Feigenberg was one of the chief people in Landsberg, so he told me look, take a train, come to Landsberg.</span> <span id="s4100">I come to -- it’s like a ghetto concert.</span> <span id="s4101">All Jewish [indecipherable] everything, and Dr. Feigenberg came to the door, took me by the hand and marched me to the first row, like I was used to.</span> <span id="s4102">And I recognized on my way, our companions from the Berlin Jewish house.</span> <span id="s4103">And they’re looking at me and they know that Mama wasn’t Jewish, they could -- they could see it, her blue eyes and everything.</span> <span id="s4104">And they’re looking at me what I’m doing sitting in the first row.</span> <span id="s4105">The Jewish people had their -- well, how would you say?</span> <span id="s4106">I remember one expression, Papa tried to match -- if somebody had a yellow schein and had no wife, he would match them, not to sleep in one bed, but give a wife a chance.</span> <span id="s4107">He had one of his people who used to be chargé d’affair of Hungary in Kaunas, Mr. Browdig, of a very rich family, and he was given the work as a -- like a minister of foreign country.</span> <span id="s4108">And one day we were standing, Mama, Papa and I, Mr. Brownig -- Browdig comes over and he says, a -- well, in -- in -- I’ll tell you in Russian, see if you understand.</span> <span id="s4109">[speaks Russian here] The attached wife of Mr. Glassman sits in the first row, and my wife sits in second row.</span> <span id="s4110">You see the hierarchy?</span> <span id="s4111">It was -- in the ghetto it was very important who you are.</span> <span id="s4112">And during the concert, who you are sat in first row and second row.</span> <span id="s4113">And then came the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s4114">I’ll never forget that.</span> <span id="s4115">My mother smiled and said, Papa, I’m going to second row.</span> <span id="s4116">I’ll make place for Browdig in first row.</span> <span id="s4117">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s4118">Q: And she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s4119">A: She did, yeah.</span> <span id="s4120">But you see, to be insulted by the fact, could -- my God, you know, first row or second row.</span> <span id="s4121">Well, but that existed.</span> <span id="s4122">So anyway --</span></p> <p><span id="s4123">Q: You were in the first row and it was a concert.</span></p> <p><span id="s4124">A: It was a concert exactly like in ghetto, all Jewish faces.</span> <span id="s4125">Exactly.</span> <span id="s4126">But then we decided that’s enough sitting at Saint Ottilian and we moved to Munich, where I entered conservatory and we registered with the American consulate.</span> <span id="s4127">During those days of registration and all kinds of, you know, checking of the papers, th-this and that, I opened the door.</span> <span id="s4128">It was the big caserna, the --</span></p> <p><span id="s4129">Q: Canteen?</span></p> <p><span id="s4130">A: -- can -- no, no, army barracks where the immigration process was going on.</span> <span id="s4131">I opened the door and I see Mr. Josef Mushkat.</span> <span id="s4132">I’ll show you mush -- Mr. Mushkat on the big picture.</span> <span id="s4133">Mushkat was a member of Papa’s higher police, and he was in charge of orphans, orphanage, taking care of them, schooling, feeding, everything that was necessary to do for orphans.</span> <span id="s4134">He saw me, he came over.</span> <span id="s4135">The first question is, where is Mama?</span> <span id="s4136">I said, Mama is outside.</span> <span id="s4137">Cause I came to get some information, Mama doesn’t know anything, so she’s outside.</span> <span id="s4138">So he grabbed me by the hand, we went outside, they both cried.</span> <span id="s4139">And then Mr. Mushkat says, look, nobody knows me here as Josef Mushkat.</span> <span id="s4140">I am under a different name and I don’t want them to know that I’m Josef Mushkat.</span> <span id="s4141">I said, look, as far as we are concerned, you can be whoever you are.</span> <span id="s4142">So, I haven’t seen Mr. Mushkat from that day, any more, cause I had no business going for information, I got what I needed.</span> <span id="s4143">I cannot explain why -- I can’t explain -- I think he got tired to be a Jew.</span> <span id="s4144">He was Polish, high class, intelligent person.</span> <span id="s4145">Writer.</span> <span id="s4146">He gave us a book in Polish language that he just recently wrote, and I think he had enough being a Jew and wanted to be a regular Gentile.</span></p> <p><span id="s4147">Q: He wanted to just change his identity.</span></p> <p><span id="s4148">A: Yeah, he wanted to change his identity.</span></p> <p><span id="s4149">Q: An -- but you never saw him again?</span></p> <p><span id="s4150">A: I never saw him again, no.</span> <span id="s4151">If he -- if he was afraid to be exposed, why should I put a person -- I went through so much myself not to be exposed, why should I make someone uncomfortable by thinking that I might un-unknowingly tell somebody, you know.</span> <span id="s4152">So now I can talk about Mr. Mushkat because he would be my father’s age, so he’s definitely not alive.</span> <span id="s4153">But I never mentioned to anyone from --</span></p> <p><span id="s4154">Q: That you had seen him.</span></p> <p><span id="s4155">A: -- Vilnius that I’ve seen him here.</span> <span id="s4156">So -- aha, so after the financial reform, I got a letter from a classmate who lived in Munich very close to where I and Mama lived, her parents and she.</span> <span id="s4157">She wrote me a letter that, listen Ada, I’m working at the UNRRA in French zone of occupation.</span> <span id="s4158">We badly need a secretary for the office of communications to work with the director and there is a very big tension between Latvians and Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s4159">Everybody would like to have that job.</span> <span id="s4160">The problem is you need French to talk with -- the whole UNRRA personnel is French.</span> <span id="s4161">You need English to get through the directions from Switzerland, that they come in English.</span> <span id="s4162">You need German to talk to the German authorities, and you need Polish, Russian, whatever, and Lithuanian to take care of the refugees.</span> <span id="s4163">The Latvians have perfect people, no French.</span> <span id="s4164">Perfect English, perfect German, no French.</span> <span id="s4165">So Lithuanians are asking us do we know anybody that could fill.</span> <span id="s4166">And we all feel that the only person to fill that place is you.</span> <span id="s4167">So, I read that letter and said, Mama, French zone is so far away.</span> <span id="s4168">We are set in here, we’re waiting for departure.</span> <span id="s4169">What the hell will I be doing in the French zone of occupation?</span> <span id="s4170">I’d never --</span></p> <p><span id="s4171">Q: And the -- the French zone of occupation was in the north, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s4172">A: Sa -- it -- it -- no, Salzburg.</span> <span id="s4173">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s4174">Q: Salzburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s4175">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s4176">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s4177">So yes, of course, it’s quite far away.</span></p> <p><span id="s4178">A: Quite far away.</span> <span id="s4179">And said, I never worked in my life.</span> <span id="s4180">I don’t know office work.</span> <span id="s4181">We used to have class magazines, you know, class newspaper, so I would do it with one finger.</span> <span id="s4182">But we still had a typewriter at home, and the others didn’t.</span> <span id="s4183">So I said Mama, how can I work?</span> <span id="s4184">Couple of days after, I get another letter.</span> <span id="s4185">Two days after, I get a cable.</span> <span id="s4186">So Mama said to me, look, said, she started with 20 marks like you -- we did.</span> <span id="s4187">She already paid for the cable, she paid for two letters.</span> <span id="s4188">So get a ticket, go over there, explain to them that you’re not able to take the job, you never worked in your life.</span> <span id="s4189">And you’ll see the world and you come back.</span> <span id="s4190">I -- I come over and they -- they tell me the picture.</span> <span id="s4191">The secretary of communications was expecting a baby in two months.</span> <span id="s4192">The father of the baby to be was a director of YMCA, Polish nobleman.</span> <span id="s4193">So now the situation is awful.</span> <span id="s4194">The lady can’t bend down any more, the rumors that the father is a director of YMCA, they want to get rid of her as soon as possible.</span> <span id="s4195">It shows it very badly during, you know, the -- th-the entire, you know, community.</span> <span id="s4196">So I told [indecipherable] I spoke to him in French, I said, mon colonel, I -- I would li -- take the job gladly, but I have never worked in my life.</span> <span id="s4197">So he said, Mademoiselle, please just stay.</span> <span id="s4198">Whatever you can do, do.</span> <span id="s4199">Whatever you cannot, not.</span> <span id="s4200">At least stay until we find somebody to fill that place.</span> <span id="s4201">So that it -- that’s -- that what happened.</span> <span id="s4202">I started to work, I started to work and then I figured there’s nothing to it.</span> <span id="s4203">I handled the correspondence.</span> <span id="s4204">I handed the director his correspondence, I can handle correspondence to the others.</span> <span id="s4205">I see what has to be done and I accept, you know, instructions from Geneva in -- in English, I sort them out.</span> <span id="s4206">What’s there a -- what’s there to be afraid?</span> <span id="s4207">And you know, I started to work, I started to work and very soon I received an army uniform, and I -- I am a lieutenant of the French army, official.</span> <span id="s4208">So, my girl -- my lady -- my girlfriend who got me, she was always a civilian, so she can say look, you just came.</span> <span id="s4209">I’m already here several months and I’m a civilian and you’re [indecipherable] army officer.</span> <span id="s4210">So anyway, I stayed there and one day the director called two of us.</span> <span id="s4211">He said, look, the Australian military mission is coming to round up refugees for Australia.</span> <span id="s4212">Talk to your families and see if any one of you is interested to go to Australia.</span> <span id="s4213">I’ll attach you as UNRRA officer to the Australians to travel around that area, the whole French zone of occupation.</span> <span id="s4214">And then that’ll help you -- open you the doors in Australia.</span> <span id="s4215">So I talked to my mother, I went to Munich back, and M-Mama said, you know what?</span> <span id="s4216">Your quota is so far away and we’re sitting so close to Russian zone of occupation, why don’t we go to Australia and that’s it.</span> <span id="s4217">And then, later on if we decide that we want to go to America, the quota will follow you.</span> <span id="s4218">And the Estonian girl, she came back, she said no, my family is not interested to go to Australia, we’ll stay in here until our American priority date comes in.</span> <span id="s4219">So they attached me to the Australians and I traveled with them for a long time, getting refugees processed for Australia.</span></p> <p><span id="s4220">Q: How interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s4221">A: Very interesting.</span> <span id="s4222">So, not to take too much time for that, I -- when we had out of first ship, it was a 1,800 people on it and you had cream of the crop of UNRRA personnel.</span> <span id="s4223">Both s -- Hungarians, Romanians, Latvians, Estonians, Lithuanians sent whatever was left over, Ukrainians, Polish, Russians.</span> <span id="s4224">And we arrived Australia --</span></p> <p><span id="s4225">Q: I don’t want to get out of the European --</span></p> <p><span id="s4226">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s4227">Q: -- continent yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s4228">A: Yeah, yeah, not yet?</span> <span id="s4229">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s4230">Q: Not yet, because we haven’t talked about Nuremberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s4231">A: Oh, yes, so Nuremberg, what happened at that concert.</span></p> <p><span id="s4232">Q: [indecipherable] two minutes, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s4233">A: We can start.</span></p> <p><span id="s4234">Q: Well, in -- in that case -- in that case, let’s finish up when you get to Australia and then we’ll go back to Nuremberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s4235">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s4236">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s4237">A: On the ship I continued in the office processing the paperwork.</span> <span id="s4238">There’s tremendous paperwork because you are crossing Suez Canal.</span> <span id="s4239">You have to make lists and lists and lists to report to the British.</span> <span id="s4240">So when we came to Melbourne, and then we were sent to a reception center -- the same day we arrived reception center, I was put to work for immigration department already in Australia.</span> <span id="s4241">And our sh -- pol -- the policy to get those refugees was domestics and laborers, domestics and laborers.</span> <span id="s4242">So everybody hot -- got an I.D., men as laborers, women as domestic servants.</span> <span id="s4243">I was the only one, because of my Australian cooperation, with Australians in Europe, I was given office worker.</span> <span id="s4244">So I was not a domestic.</span> <span id="s4245">Two years contract, you do whatever the government says you to do.</span> <span id="s4246">You go wherever the government sends you to work.</span> <span id="s4247">No, yes, buts or anything, you just go.</span> <span id="s4248">Two years over, you’re a free person, do whatever you want.</span></p> <p><span id="s4249">Q: When you arrived in Australia, how old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s4250">A: In ’48, 22.</span></p> <p><span id="s4251">Q: 22.</span></p> <p><span id="s4252">A: 22.</span></p> <p><span id="s4253">Q: Boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s4254">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s4255">Q: Quite a life until age 22.</span></p> <p><span id="s4256">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s4257">Oh yeah, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s4258">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4259">A: Don’t wish anyone -- I don’t wish anyone -- so we’ll still have to -- End of Tape 11</span></p> <p><span id="s4260">Beginning Tape 12</span></p> <p><span id="s4261">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s4262">A: I mentioned -- I mentioned that I went to that -- the concert in Landsberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s4263">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4264">A: In Landsberg they already formed a symphony orchestra and the members were all survivors of Dachau.</span> <span id="s4265">And there were, from Lithuania, the previous members of our Kaunas symphony.</span> <span id="s4266">They all knew about me and they took me in, just took me in like a mascot.</span> <span id="s4267">I was the youngest one, and you know, I ha -- I didn't have anybody but my mother and I felt very secure with them.</span> <span id="s4268">So one day they told us that, you know what?</span> <span id="s4269">We have a possibility to go to attend Nuremberg trials, we want to take you with us.</span> <span id="s4270">I said, fine, why not?</span> <span id="s4271">Now, I don’t remember a concert before the trials.</span> <span id="s4272">I believe they gave a concert.</span> <span id="s4273">I remember the theater, remember sitting in the loge and remember being left by myself, so they must have been on the stage giving a concert.</span> <span id="s4274">And they gave a concert in the [indecipherable] uniforms, it’s a striped blue and white.</span></p> <p><span id="s4275">Q: As -- as concentration camp inmates.</span></p> <p><span id="s4276">A: [indecipherable] inmates, right.</span> <span id="s4277">So a day after that, we had a two day pass to the trials.</span></p> <p><span id="s4278">Q: Did you know who was on trial?</span> <span id="s4279">Was it widely publicized?</span></p> <p><span id="s4280">A: That was a big Nuremberg trial, with all of them, Goebbels, Goering, everybody, ger -- they all sat in a row.</span></p> <p><span id="s4281">Q: Okay, that one.</span> <span id="s4282">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s4283">A: And that particular day, they were trying finance minister Speer.</span> <span id="s4284">As you know, in a -- in a hall with all military it’s all drab.</span> <span id="s4285">Uniforms, uniforms, uniforms.</span> <span id="s4286">I had on a dress that was burnt orange.</span> <span id="s4287">Not yark -- not the sharp orange, but burnt orange, but still it stood out in that immense place.</span> <span id="s4288">And I was telling my children when I came back from that place that the heads of those German inmates automatically turned to see that s-speck of light, of different color than the drab uniforms.</span> <span id="s4289">Anyway, Mr. Speer was start -- was a -- a -- questioned, and he was told that, did you know -- he was asked, did you know about the concentration camps?</span> <span id="s4290">And he said no, I never knew about that.</span> <span id="s4291">And then they opened the big screen, and on the screen you could see golden frames of eyeglasses, golden teeth, golden jewelry.</span> <span id="s4292">And they said, how do you think, Mr. Speer, your treasury got all this stuff without you knowing where it comes from?</span> <span id="s4293">Speer kept s -- not -- no answer.</span> <span id="s4294">So that registered in my mind, it was so impressive.</span> <span id="s4295">Suddenly you opened the screen, you show the picture and he has no way to say any more, I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s4296">So that was how I ge -- came to be in Nuremberg, because that -- the s -- the survivor’s group took me with them for their concert and then we -- two days in a row we attended Nuremberg trials.</span></p> <p><span id="s4297">Q: Now, a lot of people have said that Nuremberg trials was victor’s justice, particularly because the Soviet Union was involved.</span> <span id="s4298">Did you feel that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s4299">A: No.</span> <span id="s4300">I think justice was done.</span> <span id="s4301">Soviet Union or France or -- or whoever, justice was done.</span> <span id="s4302">I feel no remorse about them being punished.</span> <span id="s4303">Let it be Soviet Union’s influence, so what?</span> <span id="s4304">So what?</span> <span id="s4305">Q: No, no, no, the question was not that the sov -- because the Soviet Union was there, that that’s a bad thing, because these were really criminals and they should have been.</span> <span id="s4306">But because the Soviet Union itself was guilty of so many crimes against humanity --</span></p> <p><span id="s4307">A: Yeah, oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s4308">Q: -- then, it -- di -- it made it a politicized event.</span></p> <p><span id="s4309">A: Okay, but that came out later.</span> <span id="s4310">In those days, how much did we know in -- in the west about the Soviet Union?</span> <span id="s4311">It started with Solzhenitsyn, with his books, with opening our horizon to see what’s going on in Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s4312">Just Lithuanians telling that we had three days of deportation was not enough crime.</span> <span id="s4313">The whole crime, the whole gulags and everything came after that.</span> <span id="s4314">So in those days we didn’t know about the gulags as much as we know today.</span></p> <p><span id="s4315">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s4316">A: So I would say that, nevermind what the world is telling today, naturally the Soviet Union found another way to kill the people.</span> <span id="s4317">More humane?</span> <span id="s4318">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s4319">Freezing and Siberian tigers?</span> <span id="s4320">Is that so more humane than sitting in a concentration camp and being gassed?</span> <span id="s4321">Wa -- how would you compare one with the other?</span> <span id="s4322">There is no comparison, both are equally bad.</span> <span id="s4323">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s4324">Q: In other words, that -- that sort of thought didn’t cross -- given that your parents had the political views that they had, given that your father had -- had spoken out against the Russo-Finu -- the Finnish war that the Soviet Union started, given the whole political proclivity that this -- your family was not a pro-Soviet family in that you were not happy with the Soviet Union coming in, those thoughts weren’t crossing your mind when you were sitting in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s4325">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s4326">Q: -- in Nuremberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s4327">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s4328">Q: You saw that at least --</span></p> <p><span id="s4329">A: I saw the criminal element who ruined my life, who ruined my mother’s life, who killed my father, who killed millions of people and that was what I thought.</span> <span id="s4330">Nothing about the Russian gulags or anything at that time.</span> <span id="s4331">Later on we started to compare one with the other, and as I say, what’s better, to be gassed or to be frozen to death, you don’t know what’s -- what’s better.</span> <span id="s4332">But the -- in those days, no.</span> <span id="s4333">I figured that justice was done and they deserved it.</span></p> <p><span id="s4334">Q: And their -- again, this was only, I believe, 21 or 22 --</span></p> <p><span id="s4335">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4336">Q: -- of an en --an entire machinery.</span></p> <p><span id="s4337">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s4338">Papa used to talk about Mr. Murer.</span> <span id="s4339">He was of impression that Murer was a drug addict.</span> <span id="s4340">He said that there were days when you could talk to him like to -- talking to normal person, and there were days when he went berserk, you couldn’t talk to him.</span> <span id="s4341">And he thought that the withdrawal symptoms when he didn’t have drugs, were main reason when he was so inhuman.</span> <span id="s4342">That was my father’s opinion because he said it’s impossible to have the same person behave this way and that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s4343">Q: The -- erratic.</span></p> <p><span id="s4344">A: Erratic, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4345">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s4346">A: He would come into the room and he would start, up, down, on your knees, up, down.</span> <span id="s4347">Don’t -- do -- he made workers jump up and down for no reason.</span> <span id="s4348">So Papa got suspicious that -- suspicious that he must be under influence of drugs, because he could compare Murer with the others.</span> <span id="s4349">Nobody behaved like Murer, nobody.</span> <span id="s4350">He was a single person with such bestiality.</span> <span id="s4351">And he said, well one day he’ll pay for it.</span> <span id="s4352">But you see, six years is not much.</span> <span id="s4353">Six years is not much.</span> <span id="s4354">Well, Soviet gulag for six years is quite a bit, but it’s not much.</span> <span id="s4355">And then to be exonerated by Austrian authorities?</span> <span id="s4356">And it’s strange because Austrians were always believed to be more away from Hitler, not such supporters of Hitler.</span> <span id="s4357">He turned out to be very, very supportive of Hitler.</span> <span id="s4358">So now that’s how I got to Nuremberg [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s4359">Q: So those were the two days that you --</span></p> <p><span id="s4360">A: The two days.</span> <span id="s4361">We spent -- I think we spent more than two days, but I mean, one day for the concert, then two days we spent in the trials.</span></p> <p><span id="s4362">Q: But it wasn’t -- and you also sa -- mentioned at another point that you were on your way to Australia at some point afterwards, but that wasn’t your first destination.</span> <span id="s4363">Didn’t you say --</span></p> <p><span id="s4364">A: No, America.</span></p> <p><span id="s4365">Q: -- the aliyah.</span> <span id="s4366">The aliyah to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s4367">A: Oh, I -- oh, you -- yeah, to Israel, you see, what happened, it was Palestine.</span> <span id="s4368">Some people manage -- probably you had to have big money -- managed to get it -- exact wording is l -- landing permit.</span> <span id="s4369">A permit to enter, legally, Palestine.</span> <span id="s4370">I was talking in the Jewish committee, I said look, for all that Papa did, try to get Mother landing permit.</span> <span id="s4371">I don’t care about myself, I can go with aliyah.</span> <span id="s4372">I don’t -- I’m not afraid of difficulties or whatever, but not my mother.</span> <span id="s4373">She went through too much, physically.</span> <span id="s4374">She can’t go with aliyah.</span> <span id="s4375">And they tried.</span> <span id="s4376">They tried, but they explained to me, you need the big money to be able to procure a landing permit, or you have to be very, very famous figure.</span> <span id="s4377">But not many people have received a permit.</span> <span id="s4378">And I was to be on this boat.</span> <span id="s4379">I believe that was the Exodus boat.</span> <span id="s4380">If you remember the story of Exodus, I was supposed to be on that boat, but when they couldn’t get Mama landing permit, I said, I’m not going alone and I’m not leaving my mother in Germany.</span> <span id="s4381">So, since there is no way to get her, I’m just resigning and I’m not going to go by myself.</span> <span id="s4382">That was the only reason why I didn't go, because a lot of my friends were already in Israel and we had family in Israel from before.</span> <span id="s4383">So I didn't mind going, and Mama didn't mind going, but not in her physical condition.</span> <span id="s4384">She was --</span></p> <p><span id="s4385">Q: Did she speak much about your fath -- you said that at some point she just stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s4386">A: Stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s4387">Q: Did she talk much about her life with your father, after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s4388">A: No.</span> <span id="s4389">Not much, no.</span> <span id="s4390">I -- I don’t believe -- I don’t believe she was able to.</span> <span id="s4391">I remember when we were in hiding, some days we did things around the house and Mama liked to take birds, geese, ducks, into the fields.</span> <span id="s4392">She said that gives her peace of mind, not to talk to people, she can talk to the birds.</span> <span id="s4393">And that would quieten her down.</span> <span id="s4394">Cause I told you, she would sit in one corner, looked -- look -- look at another corner.</span> <span id="s4395">She took it much harder than anyone I have seen.</span> <span id="s4396">Much harder.</span> <span id="s4397">And well, she was preoccupied with my children because I had a big number of children.</span> <span id="s4398">She helped me to raise the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s4399">Q: But it must have been very difficult for you to see that and know that there was very little you could do to relieve it.</span></p> <p><span id="s4400">A: I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s4401">And that’s what it was, you know, I tried -- I tried my best.</span> <span id="s4402">Look, I pulled her -- it was through [indecipherable] of let’s try, let’s go, let’s do, let’s do, but she -- I think the reason that we left, she was afraid.</span> <span id="s4403">Not for herself, she was afraid for me.</span> <span id="s4404">That’s the only reason why she agreed to try and risk crossing the -- we crossed probably five borders.</span> <span id="s4405">First one was to Poland.</span> <span id="s4406">Next one was to Berlin.</span> <span id="s4407">Next one was to American side of Berlin.</span> <span id="s4408">Next time to Hanover, and then to Munich.</span> <span id="s4409">Five borders.</span> <span id="s4410">And it’s not so simple.</span> <span id="s4411">Today when we speak, it seems like nothing.</span> <span id="s4412">It wasn’t so simple.</span> <span id="s4413">I forgot to tell you, when I mentioned to you that we were leaving Lódz with aliyah, my aunt remained -- my mother’s sister remained in Kaunas.</span> <span id="s4414">She gave up, she said she was too scared and she stayed.</span> <span id="s4415">And then, couple of days after we left, she figured out that she can’t stay by herself, she wants to join us.</span> <span id="s4416">So she went to the Polish commission and she told them the story and she said now, can you help me?</span> <span id="s4417">So they said fine, we’ll do now something different.</span> <span id="s4418">We had --</span></p> <p><span id="s4419">Q: Did she speak Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s4420">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s4421">They said, we’ll give you a copy of the original repatriation document, but it has two ladies and the youngster.</span> <span id="s4422">You take a lady with her daughter, instead of your sister and your niece.</span> <span id="s4423">And that was one of our known young ballerinas and her mother.</span> <span id="s4424">So they traveled on the repatriation document budreika a-and she brought them to Poland.</span> <span id="s4425">Now, on the way, since we knew each other and she -- she was helping the Jewish people very much, when she came to Berlin, the same story with aliyah, she doesn’t look Jewish.</span> <span id="s4426">So the -- our Jewish people got her on aliyah same way, and aliyah brought her to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s4427">Q: Can you speak a little bit about her?</span> <span id="s4428">We haven’t talked much about her role in the war, and so we’re going back.</span> <span id="s4429">But you said she worked closely with Ona Šimaitė.</span></p> <p><span id="s4430">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s4431">Q: How was she involved in the rescue of Jews, or how was she involved in Ona Šimaitė’s work?</span> <span id="s4432">How did -- how --</span></p> <p><span id="s4433">A: Tatta --</span></p> <p><span id="s4434">Q: -- how -- what role she play?</span></p> <p><span id="s4435">A: -- Ta-Tatta knew Šimaitė through us.</span></p> <p><span id="s4436">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s4437">A: She was in Kaunas, Šimaitė was in Vilnius.</span> <span id="s4438">I knew from discussions with Tatta, several names in Kaunas of people who helped Jewish people.</span> <span id="s4439">I don’t believe there was a connection of Kaunas people with Vilnius people, there was no connection.</span> <span id="s4440">And Šimaitė was connected to Tatta through us.</span> <span id="s4441">And Tatta did whatever sh -- was in her abilities to help Šimaitė.</span> <span id="s4442">Sh -- Tatta worked more in Kaunas, where there was a group, and all these people were Russian nationals in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s4443">They were Lithuanian Russians.</span> <span id="s4444">There was Dr. Kutraga.</span> <span id="s4445">There was -- you know, it’s difficult -- the lady, she had a beauty -- beauty salon.</span> <span id="s4446">Her -- her -- her son was in our basketball -- what was it, playing [indecipherable] I’ll -- I’ll remember the name.</span> <span id="s4447">Anyway, I knew the first names of some of them, and these people really did at most that was possible to do.</span> <span id="s4448">Pulling out, getting places to live, getting places to hide.</span> <span id="s4449">It was a very well organized group.</span></p> <p><span id="s4450">Q: And were any of them caught, as far as your knowledge was concerned?</span></p> <p><span id="s4451">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s4452">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s4453">A: Šimaitė was the only one that was caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s4454">Q: And do you know the circumstances of her capture?</span></p> <p><span id="s4455">A: No, because we weren’t there.</span> <span id="s4456">Tatta -- Tatta remained in Kaunas when we went into hiding and then one day she told us that Onos neera, Ona isn’t any more here.</span> <span id="s4457">So we understood.</span> <span id="s4458">So after I found out that she was very brutally beaten up, she was thrown into concentration camp, but we didn’t know whether she s-survived or not.</span> <span id="s4459">She never looked back.</span> <span id="s4460">She never looked back.</span> <span id="s4461">And later, from the press, I found out that she was in France and that she went to visit Israel, but they think climate didn’t work for her.</span> <span id="s4462">She returned back to France and she died in France.</span> <span id="s4463">And then when I found her brother’s article about her, I realized that she was who she was, a being that you couldn’t put on higher pedestal that she was, but she was also a communist.</span> <span id="s4464">Well, which -- nothing to do with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s4465">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4466">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s4467">But Tatta was cooperating with Šimaitė.</span> <span id="s4468">I -- I wouldn’t give you any details because I really don’t know how they did it, what they did, but I know that she helped her carrying the waste, getting food, you know, things like that.</span> <span id="s4469">Course Tatta was mostly spending her time in Kaunas and then she would come to Vilnius, stay with us and what -- help with Šimaitė.</span></p> <p><span id="s4470">Q: Your uncle when he returned from Dachau, you said earlier that he didn’t speak much about what had happened in Siauliai in the time that he was the ghetto police chief --</span></p> <p><span id="s4471">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4472">Q: -- but that he did talk about Dachau.</span> <span id="s4473">Which --</span></p> <p><span id="s4474">A: He talked about Dachau, talked about his experience over there.</span> <span id="s4475">He talked about the conversations they used to have, the inmates, what would the conversations be about.</span></p> <p><span id="s4476">Q: And what were they about?</span></p> <p><span id="s4477">A: And he said that most conversations were fantasies, what we would like to eat.</span> <span id="s4478">What we would like to be served.</span> <span id="s4479">And he said that at one point it was really tough.</span> <span id="s4480">Somebody said that he would like to have some herring, and the pain, not being able, was so obvious that people were telling him, shut up.</span> <span id="s4481">Don’t mention it any more, we don’t want to hear it.</span> <span id="s4482">See, y-you’re deprived for so long that even mentioning it makes it bitter -- bitter memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s4483">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4484">A: But he never complained.</span> <span id="s4485">And in his first letter that I received it, that was very interesting how I found him.</span> <span id="s4486">He wrote in his first letter that morally I am not broken at all, but physically, I am finished.</span> <span id="s4487">HIAS looked for him, Joint looked for him.</span> <span id="s4488">All those, you know, the bort -- the -- the -- the notices, everybody.</span> <span id="s4489">Nowhere.</span> <span id="s4490">Disappeared completely.</span> <span id="s4491">So one day I got a letter from HIAS.</span> <span id="s4492">We found --</span></p> <p><span id="s4493">Q: And HIAS is?</span></p> <p><span id="s4494">A: Hebrew aid -- aid -- like -- like Joint, same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s4495">Q: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4496">A: They’re two different organizations both -- both being the same thing.</span> <span id="s4497">We found trace of your uncle.</span> <span id="s4498">Get in touch with such and such person in Israel and you’ll get more information.</span> <span id="s4499">So what --</span></p> <p><span id="s4500">Q: And this is about what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s4501">A: Oh, that was quite a bit after.</span> <span id="s4502">Must be ’56.</span> <span id="s4503">Must be ’56 because I remember we were able already to send parcel.</span> <span id="s4504">When the Polish repatriation started in Soviet Union, they let the inmates from gulags join the families outside, repatriate to Poland.</span> <span id="s4505">One of those families on the way, the father joined from the gulag and the father was telling stories with whom he was in gulag and how it was in gulag.</span> <span id="s4506">They came to Poland and from Poland with aliyah they reached Israel.</span> <span id="s4507">After they reached Israel, very shortly after, the father died from heart, he was overworked in gulag.</span> <span id="s4508">Now, those people probably went to HIAS to join to look for their relatives, whatever.</span> <span id="s4509">His son saw my uncle’s name on the board, looking for, do you know about him.</span> <span id="s4510">And happily, he remembered that his father was mentioning my uncle’s name during his stories from gulag.</span> <span id="s4511">So he reported to HIAS that all I can tell you is that my father was in such and such camp together with him.</span> <span id="s4512">And that must have been already the time when they started to let them go from gulag.</span> <span id="s4513">Liquida --</span></p> <p><span id="s4514">Q: So you didn’t even know he had been in the gulag until that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s4515">A: No, no, he disappeared from the ground of the earth.</span> <span id="s4516">And they sent -- I mentioned to you that my aunt had to hide that her husband is in Vorkuta.</span> <span id="s4517">She didn’t know exactly where, but she had to hide, and she told that he found another woman, he left her and he is somewheres with that woman in Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s4518">And then when finally he was released, they found each other.</span> <span id="s4519">There is something that I don’t recall.</span> <span id="s4520">I know that somebody somehow was found through my uncle in Montevideo.</span> <span id="s4521">Whether he wrote to Montevideo, whether Mother’s brother wrote to Montevideo, but somehow members of the family got together through Uruguay, but I don’t recall now which one.</span> <span id="s4522">So anyway, when he returned, she told that he doesn’t want that other woman any more, he returned to the family.</span> <span id="s4523">Now the aunt, what happened when they arrested him in Klaipėda, she grabbed her daughter, same way like Mama and I, and disappeared.</span> <span id="s4524">She knew that it’s -- next is her turn, they -- she disappeared.</span> <span id="s4525">And as much as we all looked for her, Mama’s brother went through every nook and nook, wherever you could think to look for her and he wrote exactly, she disappeared from this earth.</span> <span id="s4526">[indecipherable] there’s nothing else I can do, I can’t find her.</span> <span id="s4527">So later on we learned that she had acquaintances in Moscow, she went to them.</span> <span id="s4528">They sent her to Moldavia and she was living in Moldavia.</span> <span id="s4529">She was a very intelligent person.</span> <span id="s4530">She got a job as a postmistress.</span> <span id="s4531">[speaks foreign language here].</span> <span id="s4532">That was her address.</span> <span id="s4533">Until he returned, and he told us that when he saw how she lived, it broke his heart.</span> <span id="s4534">In all those letters, I have so many letters from him, he described the misery, the conditions in that [indecipherable] unbelievable.</span> <span id="s4535">And he didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s4536">So when we found each other -- I believe he must have written to Montevideo.</span></p> <p><span id="s4537">Q: To be able to trace her back.</span></p> <p><span id="s4538">A: To trace -- no, to trace us.</span></p> <p><span id="s4539">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s4540">A: To trace us.</span> <span id="s4541">That was the way how we found each other later.</span> <span id="s4542">I mean, I got the -- from HIAS that he is alive, but I couldn’t trace him in Moldavia.</span> <span id="s4543">I believe he wrote to Montevideo, to Mama’s brother, cause we knew all these addresses by heart.</span> <span id="s4544">And that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s4545">Q: Did you ever see your uncle again?</span></p> <p><span id="s4546">A: No.</span> <span id="s4547">He died.</span> <span id="s4548">I see s -- I -- I went to s-see his wife, his her -- Elana, her daughter, but not him.</span> <span id="s4549">So after I mentioned to you -- I show you the pictures, you saw his face.</span> <span id="s4550">So physically he said he was gone.</span> <span id="s4551">Vorkuta pulls the last strength of your body, and that’s the underground work.</span></p> <p><span id="s4552">Q: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4553">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4554">Q: What year did he die?</span></p> <p><span id="s4555">A: He died -- he died -- he died -- she got married -- wa -- I have to look at the date when she got married, he died very soon after her wedding.</span></p> <p><span id="s4556">Q: So he never left the Soviet Union?</span></p> <p><span id="s4557">A: He never left the Soviet Union, no.</span> <span id="s4558">But Sonia and aha -- so Elana’s -- how did Elana get out?</span> <span id="s4559">Her husband was Polish citizen.</span> <span id="s4560">He was Ukrainian, from that.</span> <span id="s4561">So the way to -- or sh -- or they left when it was let my people go.</span> <span id="s4562">That could have been.</span> <span id="s4563">I think that was how the -- that let my people go time, and they left for Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s4564">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s4565">A: And when I went to Israel, I found more of my father’s relatives.</span> <span id="s4566">Distant cousins, closer cousins, they couldn’t believe that I am alive.</span> <span id="s4567">In Lithuania everybody thought that we are finished there, we don’t exist any more.</span> <span id="s4568">It was such a surprise to see me alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s4569">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s4570">A: You’re welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s4571">Q: Miss Ada.</span></p> <p><span id="s4572">A: You’re welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s4573">Q: For sharing so much with us today.</span></p> <p><span id="s4574">A: I think it’s the first time that I -- I really sat and thought about it, tried not to forget.</span> <span id="s4575">There is so much that it’s easy to forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s4576">Q: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s4577">A: And then don’t forget -- don’t forget how many years it’s ago.</span> <span id="s4578">It’s 1950’s or 60 --</span></p> <p><span id="s4579">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s4580">A: -- 60 something years, right.</span> <span id="s4581">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4582">Q: Well, without you we wouldn’t have --</span></p> <p><span id="s4583">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4584">Q: -- this view, this insight, this glimpse into a part of what was a catastrophe and how people lived through that catastrophe.</span></p> <p><span id="s4585">A: Yeah, people -- people can take quite a dose.</span> <span id="s4586">People can.</span> <span id="s4587">If you have an optimistic outlook and if you are not looking, you know, half full, half empty.</span> <span id="s4588">If you look at half full, that helps.</span></p> <p><span id="s4589">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s4590">A: That helps, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4591">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s4592">A: You’re
