<span id="s2">Mrs. Singer, could you tell me your name, your maiden name, your date of birth and your place of birth.</span> <span id="s3">And then anything you possibly can about your childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">My name is Flora Mendelovicz (that was my maiden name) Singer.</span> <span id="s5">I was born in Berchem, a suburb of Antwerp, Belgium in 1930, August 16.</span> <span id="s6">Things I remember most, my earliest recollections were going with my father on trips to buy merchandise.</span> <span id="s7">My father was a carpenter and he had a furniture atelier.</span> <span id="s8">He used to go and buy the new catalogs and furniture styles in a town named Mechellin [ph11] which later on unfortunately became Maline in French where many Jews were gathered during the war before they were transported to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s9">However, during the time that I'm talking about, I was around the age of five, six, my favorite times were going on those trips with my father.</span> <span id="s10">I went to an elementary school about a mile and a half from home with my two sisters.</span> <span id="s11">It was a public school.</span> <span id="s12">We walked, there was no bus transportation like in the United States.</span> <span id="s13">And then after school we'd go to Yiddish school.</span> <span id="s14">The boys would go to Hebrew school, the girls would go and learn Yiddish.</span> <span id="s15">We lived in what was called the Jewish neighborhood of Antwerp which was between the Pillicon Stradt[ph19], the Longakivicz Stradt[ph20] and the Leverik Stradt[ph20] and the Somer Stradt[ph20].</span> <span id="s16">It was almost like a self-imposed ghetto with butchers, bakeries, book shops, and the synagogues.</span> <span id="s17">We did not in those days speak about Reform, Orthodox, or Conservative.</span> <span id="s18">Everybody was just Jewish.</span> <span id="s19">We were either religious, a little bit religious or not religious.</span> <span id="s20">I remember enjoying going to the synagogue in the morning.</span> <span id="s21">In 1938, actually a little earlier, because of the depression, my dad had lost his shop and obtained a job with a ship's company.</span> <span id="s22">I think it was, [oh I have the thing upstairs somewhere], I'm not sure if it was the Star Line or the..., I have no recollection of the name of the line.</span> <span id="s23">I have it written down somewhere.</span> <span id="s24">Anyway he started traveling the seas as a ship's carpenter.</span> <span id="s25">During that time he befriended a German Christian.</span> <span id="s26">I don't recall his last name, his first name was Carl.</span> <span id="s27">It was important later on in our lives.</span> <span id="s28">He would come home only about every three months or so, stay a few days and then go off again.</span> <span id="s29">In 1938, November of 1938, we received a notice from the ship's company advising us that my father had defected and that if we heard from him to notify them and of course his pay check was going to be stopped.</span> <span id="s30">Mom was very upset.</span> <span id="s31">Remember we all cried.</span> <span id="s32">It was a terrible day.</span> <span id="s33">Meanwhile also at that time many refugees started coming in from Germany.</span> <span id="s34">It was right after Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s35">We had several people living with us.</span> <span id="s36">The whole Jewish community opened their doors and their homes to these German and Austrian refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Can we before we get to this, can I ask you this: Were your parents born in Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">No, my parents were not born in Belgium.</span> <span id="s39">My parents were born in Romania.</span> <span id="s40">My mother was born in Sighet and my father was born in Viso-de-Sus.</span> <span id="s41">They left in late 1928 or early 1929.</span> <span id="s42">A whole group of young people had decided that they didn't want to deal with the anti-semitism in Romania any more.</span> <span id="s43">I recall my mother telling me stories about Saturday night.</span> <span id="s44">The peasants would get drunk and then come into the Jewish street as they called it and break windows or beat a few people up.</span> <span id="s45">And it was also difficult to get jobs for Jews.</span> <span id="s46">Jews couldn't own land, etc.</span> <span id="s47">My father and mother decided, as I said, with a whole group of young people, to leave Romania and go to a country named Belgium where they had heard not only were jobs available, but that it was a country where the people were very tolerant and there could be Jews without worrying about getting beaten up.</span> <span id="s48">My mother, of course, left against her father's wishes because my grandfather was very religious and it was said that a girl does not leave home until the day after she's married.</span> <span id="s49">My mother was the second youngest of six sisters and the only one daring to pick up and leave home to make a life for herself.</span> <span id="s50">She did leave, however.</span> <span id="s51">Once in Belgium the group started marrying amongst themselves.</span> <span id="s52">One young couple would make a wedding for the next young couple.</span> <span id="s53">Anyway my father and mother decided to marry and they married in Antwerp, Belgium, 1929.</span> <span id="s54">I was the first of three girls who was born, August 16, as I said before, 1930.</span> <span id="s55">Things were difficult but they were happy because they felt very free, especially as far as religion is concerned.</span> <span id="s56">People were very tolerant, Belgians were very tolerant and Dad eventually opened a shop where he made furniture.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">What language did you grow up speaking?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">The first language I ever spoke was Yiddish until I went to Kindergarten and then I went to Kindergarten and I was surprised to find out there was another language and there were other people beside Jewish people.</span> <span id="s59">My world was my Jewish neighborhood.</span> <span id="s60">And I then learned Flemish and of course went to elementary school in the Flemish language until we escaped from Antwerp which is later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Okay, thank you for filling all that in.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">You're welcome.</span> <span id="s63">Do you want me to just go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Do you want to go back to the Kristallnacht...?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Okay, let me go back to 1938.</span> <span id="s66">Up to 1938 even after my father had left my childhood wasn't bad.</span> <span id="s67">We were, of course, very, very happy when my father would come home to visit because the thing that we did when he came home to visit which we had done earlier also was people were very friendly in our neighborhood and always seemed to be in groups with each other.</span> <span id="s68">On Sundays everybody used to take their bicycles and go to the Langakivicz Stradt[ph87] Park which was at the end of the street that we lived on and had picnics there.</span> <span id="s69">I would sit on the back of my father's bicycle and my sister would sit on the front of his bicycle.</span> <span id="s70">He had a little seat on the front and one in the back.</span> <span id="s71">My mother would have the third one on her bicycle.</span> <span id="s72">Then later on when I was old enough to have my own bicycle I would ride my own bike and we'd get together in the park and sit in circles and have picnics and sing.</span> <span id="s73">It was a wonderful time.</span> <span id="s74">Then when he came back occasionally we'd still go to the park but less and less often.</span> <span id="s75">The one nice thing though about his visits back was that Carl would come with him because there wasn't enough time for him to go back to Germany to visit his family so he would come to us.</span> <span id="s76">And we grew quite close to Carl and we loved him very much and he seemed to love us.</span> <span id="s77">Anyway, let me get back to 1938.</span> <span id="s78">In 1938 we had, as I said, several people living with us and one of them was a Mr. Gross, Mr. and Mrs. Gross.</span> <span id="s79">Herr Gross as we used to call him would talk about the things that had gone on in Germany.</span> <span id="s80">And I remember becoming very frightened--I was then about eight years old--and asking my mother about these things that Herr Gross would tell us.</span> <span id="s81">And she said, oh, don't worry, old people exaggerate.</span> <span id="s82">Speaking of old people, I think Mr. Gross was no more than about 45 or so at the time.</span> <span id="s83">I knew that later on when I grew up.</span> <span id="s84">But he was old to me then and to my mother who was only in her thirties.</span> <span id="s85">So she said, no he exaggerates.</span> <span id="s86">Those things couldn't possibly happen, that there was always anti-semitism and being a Jew we had to know that these things would happen.</span> <span id="s87">People would occasionally want to beat us up.</span> <span id="s88">Times would sometimes be better, sometimes worse for Jews.</span> <span id="s89">But that the very things Mr. Gross talked about couldn't possibly happen, especially in a country like Germany, that there was more anti-semitism in other countries than in Germany.</span> <span id="s90">However, I found out later that Mr. Gross was not wrong.</span> <span id="s91">Early 1940 there was a program in Antwerp whereby poor children would be sent to a camp near the sea for two weeks to sort of rehabilitate their health and their malnutrition and feed them good food.</span> <span id="s92">My sister and I were eligible for the program, the middle one and myself.</span> <span id="s93">She was at the time almost seven years old.</span> <span id="s94">As a matter of fact I think she was just about seven, right, because she had been seven in March.</span> <span id="s95">This was the month of late April, early May.</span> <span id="s96">So we were both sent away to camps for...they used to call it Etholunk[ph115] which was to get into better health, to become healthy.</span> <span id="s97">She was sent to one camp, I was sent to another.</span> <span id="s98">May 10, the morning that war was declared and the Germans marched into Belgium, I was at one camp, my sister was at another, and my mother was home with Betty who was not quite four at the time.</span> <span id="s99">All I know is coming down to breakfast that morning, on May 10, and there was a small radio in the dining room on a shelf and one of the monitors turned the radio on.</span> <span id="s100">The music stopped and an announcement was made that the Germans were walking into Belgium.</span> <span id="s101">I remember not realizing what that meant but suddenly chaos reigned in the dining room.</span> <span id="s102">The monitors were running around and rushing us to finish our breakfast and rushing us up to the dormitories, making us pack our bags, putting us on busses and they took us back to Antwerp.</span> <span id="s103">When I got back to Antwerp I remember chaos reigning there too.</span> <span id="s104">People were loading cars, they were loading horse wagons, they were loading bikes, and going.</span> <span id="s105">People were screaming and carrying on.</span> <span id="s106">When I asked my mother what was going on she said the Germans are coming in and they are terrible.</span> <span id="s107">They tortured people during World War I and she described some horrible things.</span> <span id="s108">Supposedly they cut off ears and breasts of women and all that.</span> <span id="s109">Whether it was a rumor or whether it actually happened of course I personally don't know.</span> <span id="s110">But everyone was terribly frightened of the German, not only the Jews, the Christians also.</span> <span id="s111">Everyone ran, Catholic and Jew.</span> <span id="s112">My mother was a little confused.</span> <span id="s113">She didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s114">Someone who had a car and had a trundle seat in the back offered us that seat.</span> <span id="s115">At that point there was myself, my mother and Betty, the youngest of the three.</span> <span id="s116">Charlotte was not with us yet.</span> <span id="s117">My mother didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s118">Should she wait and see if Charlotte would be brought home.</span> <span id="s119">She tried contacting the camp.</span> <span id="s120">Apparently either the phone lines were cut or no one was there to answer, but she couldn't make contact.</span> <span id="s121">She was very upset because the people who owned the car said, well look, we're leaving in an hour.</span> <span id="s122">If you go with us fine, otherwise we're giving this seat to someone else.</span> <span id="s123">I didn't know it at the time, however, later on I learned from my mother that she had a terrible dilemma to deal with.</span> <span id="s124">Her decision had to be does she stay and perhaps have her two children killed and lose all three because she started giving up on Charlotte at this point not knowing what happened to her, or does she take two children, run to France because that's where everybody was headed for, and save two children.</span> <span id="s125">Apparently her decision was to save two children because we got into the trundle seat, the three of us with two small valises.</span> <span id="s126">My mother carried Betty, who had the measles at the time and was feverish, and we went to France.</span> <span id="s127">The car broke down before we ever got to France or ran out of gas, I don't know which of the two but we continued on foot.</span> <span id="s128">We became part of the hord of refugees heading for Northern France that were preventing the allies from pulling back because the roads were crowded with refugees.</span> <span id="s129">We slept in the fields and occasionally in the barn.</span> <span id="s130">We got rid of one suitcase because Mom could not carry Betty and a suitcase.</span> <span id="s131">I could not handle both suitcases so we were down to one suitcase at one point and we continued walking.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">You were headed for northern France?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">For northern France, right, because see the Germans were behind us.</span> <span id="s134">They walked into Belgium.</span> <span id="s135">Troops were pulling back and we were following or getting mingled in with the troops that were pulling back because the Germans had not entered France yet.</span> <span id="s136">And northern France is the closest to Belgium, like Lille, Calais, and those areas.</span> <span id="s137">Anyway we got to Calais.</span> <span id="s138">We got to Calais and once in Calais, let me just retract a little bit.</span> <span id="s139">The reason we had gotten the letter that my father had defected from the ship was--of course I learned this after the war--he had a sister in New York who had been here since she was eleven years old, right after World War I when their father got killed on the front and my grandmother was left with five children, her sister in New York, an aunt in New York rather had offered to raise the girl.</span> <span id="s140">She was the only girl of five children, the others were all sons.</span> <span id="s141">So she lived in New York.</span> <span id="s142">My father was in contact with her.</span> <span id="s143">His ship docked in Canada and was going to be there for about three days.</span> <span id="s144">He called my aunt being he was so close and she immediately, as soon as she realized that it was her brother, said David, don't go back because Kristallnacht had already happened.</span> <span id="s145">She told him what happened; he wasn't aware of it.</span> <span id="s146">He insisted that he had to go back to Belgium, that he wasn't going to leave Fannie and the three children but somehow she convinced him that she would shortly after he would come to the United States, would bring Fannie and the three children out.</span> <span id="s147">She sent a car for him.</span> <span id="s148">They smuggled my father into the United States in a hollowed out seat of a car.</span> <span id="s149">So not only did he defect but he entered the United States illegally.</span> <span id="s150">I didn't dare say this for many years.</span> <span id="s151">It's only very recently that I started telling this story but it is typical of how people got into the United States when the United States closed its doors to so many.</span> <span id="s152">My aunt immediately under her own patronage and her husband's started working on getting us a visa after they had written my mother a coded letter letting her know, in Yiddish, letting her know that my father was safe.</span> <span id="s153">It didn't work.</span> <span id="s154">At the time the quota, especially for Romanian citizens and even though we were born in Belgium we were considered Romanian citizens, not from Roumania, Roumania did not recognize us, but as far as the Belgians were concerned, who did not recognize us as Belgian citizens.</span> <span id="s155">Anyway, we never made it.</span> <span id="s156">We remained in Belgium and the war started.</span> <span id="s157">So anyway, getting back to Calais.</span> <span id="s158">When we got to Calais it was evening and my mother noticed a big Red Cross ship at the port; we were at the port and she noticed a big Red Cross ship.</span> <span id="s159">She then made a decision.</span> <span id="s160">She decided if she could just find out where the ship went and if she could get on to that ship and make her way to wherever it was and from there to the United States we'd all be safe, the three of us of course, not Charlotte who we didn't have with us.</span> <span id="s161">Before we left, however, my mother told people, neighbors and friends who were packing and going off in different directions, that if anyone saw Charlotte to please take her, keep her, and she'd be back for her.</span> <span id="s162">Anyway she walked up to the ship, found out that the Red Cross ship was taking wounded soldiers to England, and asked them if they would take us on.</span> <span id="s163">They said that if we would wait they would see if they had room for us and they would then perhaps take us with them.</span> <span id="s164">We sat at the port on our little suitcase, the one that we had left, and waited until dawn.</span> <span id="s165">Dawn came and they told us that there was no more room, they could not take us.</span> <span id="s166">So we turned away from the port and we tried to find some food.</span> <span id="s167">The Red Cross was giving out food in churches and all kinds of places and so we were fed a little bit.</span> <span id="s168">We got some milk for the baby, I mean Betty who was not quite four and ill, to boot.</span> <span id="s169">I still don't know how she survived the measles without after effects because she's a fairly healthy woman today.</span> <span id="s170">We ended up in a shelter because an air raid came and Mom left the shelter after the alarm came on that people could leave the shelter.</span> <span id="s171">I was left in the shelter with Betty on my lap.</span> <span id="s172">Betty was thirsty, started to cry.</span> <span id="s173">There was no one left in the shelter but the two of us.</span> <span id="s174">It was dark.</span> <span id="s175">It was frightening.</span> <span id="s176">Mom wasn't coming back.</span> <span id="s177">I recall sitting there for the longest time and not moving because the one thing we always did - we always obeyed my mother.</span> <span id="s178">There was never any thought of disobeying her, Mama was always obeyed, even into adulthood it was rather difficult to disobey her for different reasons.</span> <span id="s179">I remember becoming so frightened at one point after having sat there for so long and Betty crying because she was thirsty.</span> <span id="s180">I was thirsty also, I was also hungry.</span> <span id="s181">Finally I was frightened enough to stray outside of the shelter.</span> <span id="s182">It was dark and I was even more frightened.</span> <span id="s183">There's something I never tell my children to this day and they are very comfortable in the dark.</span> <span id="s184">I am still frightened of the dark although I hate to admit it.</span> <span id="s185">That doesn't mean I don't go out, I'm not a prisoner of it, but there is that deep-seeded fear of the dark to this day.</span> <span id="s186">I went out; I started running; I started crying; I started calling Mama, Mama.</span> <span id="s187">There was no one in the street.</span> <span id="s188">Finally I heard a voice from a distance saying Flora, Flora.</span> <span id="s189">And I yelled Mama, Mama.</span> <span id="s190">And anyway we found each other, We tried to find a shelter and we ended up in a railroad station.</span> <span id="s191">We saw a train being mounted by a lot of people; we tried to get on the train.</span> <span id="s192">We didn't know where the train was going but anyplace was better than where we were.</span> <span id="s193">The train was so packed that we couldn't get on it, so we were left behind.</span> <span id="s194">It seemed like it was the last train out.</span> <span id="s195">We sat down in the corner of the railroad station and spent the night there.</span> <span id="s196">In the morning, I just couldn't carry the suitcase anymore.</span> <span id="s197">I felt very weak and tired and Mama just told me to leave the suitcase in a corner and we left.</span> <span id="s198">Mama was still carrying Betty.</span> <span id="s199">We made it all the way to Boulogne-Sur-Mer.</span> <span id="s200">Our goal at this point was Paris because my mother figured that if we can just get to Paris, we could get from Paris to London.</span> <span id="s201">We did not make it to Paris because the Germans caught up with us in Boulogne-Sur-Mer.</span> <span id="s202">We were taken in by a cafe owner.</span> <span id="s203">Her name was Marta, I'll never forget that.</span> <span id="s204">We stayed there for several weeks.</span> <span id="s205">There's something very interesting, a little side-tracking here.</span> <span id="s206">There was a lot of pillaging going on.</span> <span id="s207">Every time there was an air raid and stores got bombed, people were going in and pillaging.</span> <span id="s208">I was out when there was an air raid but I couldn't get into a shelter, I couldn't get home, so I crouched down in a doorway and sat out the air raid there.</span> <span id="s209">When I came out of my little corner I noticed people running into a store and taking things.</span> <span id="s210">It was a shoe store and I had noticed a pair of white boots there before.</span> <span id="s211">I noticed the white boots were still there.</span> <span id="s212">So everybody else was taking things.</span> <span id="s213">I didn't realize at the time that it was something wrong about it.</span> <span id="s214">I might have felt it deep down but I didn't realize there was something wrong with it.</span> <span id="s215">I took the white boots and I put them on and I went to the cafe where we were staying with them.</span> <span id="s216">Anyway Mom was very angry but she didn't have the heart to take the boots off.</span> <span id="s217">But a few days later, as I was walking the street, someone grabbed me by the collar in the back and pulled me into a store.</span> <span id="s218">It was the store owner, pulled me into his boarded up store and pulled the boots off my feet and I went back to the cafe barefoot.</span> <span id="s219">These are some of the side things that happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">What time of year was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">This was sometime in June of 1940.</span> <span id="s222">Meanwhile Germans were already in Belgium, they were in a good part of France.</span> <span id="s223">The Germans gave out a decree that all non-French residents had to return to the country of their origin.</span> <span id="s224">So we had to make our way back to Belgium having just a few francs given us by Marta to keep us fed on the road back.</span> <span id="s225">We couldn't afford transportation so we walked again.</span> <span id="s226">By now Betty was better and we walked.</span> <span id="s227">We hitch-hiked and one of the cars that we hitch-hiked was a German car and Mother gave me strict instructions not to understand either German, Yiddish, or Flemish.</span> <span id="s228">Anyway we made our way to Antwerp.</span> <span id="s229">When we got back to Antwerp, one of our neighbors had also returned and had Charlotte with her.</span> <span id="s230">Charlotte is alive today and is a grandmother and lives in New York.</span> <span id="s231">Things seemed slowly to return normal except that there were Germans there and in September school started again.</span> <span id="s232">There were air raids, there were bombings and all that but the Jews were not really bothered yet.</span> <span id="s233">We returned to school in September.</span> <span id="s234">The one thing that did happened within that following year I don't recall the exact dates but men were called up for labor.</span> <span id="s235">They were told that if they voluntarily present themselves for work in Germany that wives and children would not be bothered.</span> <span id="s236">I don't recall whether this was for both Christians and Jews or just for Jews.</span> <span id="s237">But anyway, my mother's youngest sister was also in Antwerp at the time.</span> <span id="s238">What happened after my mother had settled down in Belgium in 1929, she had eventually sent, when I was about three years old she sent for her youngest sister and brought her to Belgium.</span> <span id="s239">My youngest sister?</span> <span id="s240">[I assume her mother's youngest sister] had met a Polish emigree by the name of Alex Chechanoff [ph304] and married him and had a boy in 1940 by the name of Nathan, we called him Nunu.</span> <span id="s241">My uncle's name was Alex Chechanoff [ph307].</span> <span id="s242">Uncle Alex and his brother Adolph Chechanoff [ph309] who was also in Antwerp, they were called up and went to work in Germany with a lot of other men.</span> <span id="s243">They came back about three months later.</span> <span id="s244">This happened twice and twice they came back.</span> <span id="s245">When they got called up the third time my mother, she had an amazing instinct and very often her instinct served her well, had this gut feeling that something was wrong this time.</span> <span id="s246">She said, Alex, I wouldn't go.</span> <span id="s247">Alex said, come on Fannie you're always worrying.</span> <span id="s248">And she said, Alex please don't go.</span> <span id="s249">She said I have a bad feeling.</span> <span id="s250">Alex listened to her and he took his wife and child and moved to Brussels.</span> <span id="s251">He left because otherwise they would have probably come to arrest him.</span> <span id="s252">They moved to Brussels and they lived in Scarbec [ph323] on La Place de la Cage aux Zusa [ph324].</span> <span id="s253">The men who went this time did not come back.</span> <span id="s254">I don't know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s255">However, they never came back.</span> <span id="s256">Time went on.</span> <span id="s257">We were called up to register and buy, quote buy a Jewish star.</span> <span id="s258">My mother had to go to a Bureau and the Jewish star, they were cut off a bolt.</span> <span id="s259">It was like buying a yard or two of goods, fabric, textile.</span> <span id="s260">They decided how much each family needed.</span> <span id="s261">They cut it off the bolt and you paid accordingly.</span> <span id="s262">If you didn't have the money you had to find it somewhere.</span> <span id="s263">Anyway Mom came home with these Jewish stars, cut them out and very neatly had to sew them on, two inches from the top, two inches from the arm on the left side of our outer garments.</span> <span id="s264">So now I had to wear a star to school which was not very pleasant.</span> <span id="s265">Needless to say, my sisters and I started being subject to insults, to a few pushes, etc.</span> <span id="s266">And I started hating school whereas I had always loved school before.</span> <span id="s267">At about that same time, I don't know if it was two months, three months later we were told that we couldn't go to public school anymore, that we could only go to our Jewish school.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">What grade were you in at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">At that point I was in middle of fourth grade.</span> <span id="s270">I was in fourth grade.</span> <span id="s271">I was ten that August and I had entered fourth grade that September, so I was in the middle of fourth grade when I stopped going to school.</span> <span id="s272">My initial reaction was I hated not being able to go to school but at that point I was glad also because I really had a difficult time dealing with the children and with the crying of my sisters when they were pushed around.</span> <span id="s273">I said to my sisters, "Well don't worry so we won't go to school, we'll go to the park and play."</span> <span id="s274">We could always go to the park.</span> <span id="s275">The park was a beautiful park.</span> <span id="s276">It had a lake, it had swans, and we really loved the park.</span> <span id="s277">It was almost like a refuge.</span> <span id="s278">And we headed for the park.</span> <span id="s279">We get to the park and there was a sign, NO JEWS ALLOWED.</span> <span id="s280">Actually NO JEWS AND DOGS ALLOWED.</span> <span id="s281">But there was no gate, no door.</span> <span id="s282">There was no one around so we decided, well we'll go in anyway.</span> <span id="s283">We walked into the park and after we had gone just a few yards a guard appeared out of nowhere and he didn't say a word.</span> <span id="s284">He just shook his finger back and forth as if to say No, No, No, and pointing towards the exit.</span> <span id="s285">I remember making a face as if to say why can't I go in.</span> <span id="s286">He kept shaking his finger and pointing to the exit.</span> <span id="s287">So we left and I told my sisters, don't worry we can always go to the movies because I had a few francs.</span> <span id="s288">Mama always gave me a few francs to take care of my sisters.</span> <span id="s289">So we went to the movies, we get to the cashier's window - the same thing .</span> <span id="s290">There was a sign NO JEWS ALLOWED.</span> <span id="s291">By now I was getting pretty upset.</span> <span id="s292">My head started drooping.</span> <span id="s293">My sisters of course were upset also.</span> <span id="s294">We couldn't understand why we couldn't go in.</span> <span id="s295">Our clothes were clean, we didn't do anything that we knew of, so we decided to get some ice- cream.</span> <span id="s296">We get to the ice-cream parlor, the same thing, NO JEWS ALLOWED.</span> <span id="s297">And by the time we headed for home with our heads pretty low.</span> <span id="s298">But once we got near our house it was fine because there were other children there with stars who probably had experienced the same thing we had and we just played in the street.</span> <span id="s299">That became our playground for the next few months.</span> <span id="s300">As time went on things became worse and worse.</span> <span id="s301">It was not regular but all of a sudden the gestapo started coming around with little wagons, small wagons, they look like some of our own recreation wagons here in the United States where you can put in maybe ten, twelve people in the back.</span> <span id="s302">They would come around, they were unmarked and they would stop.</span> <span id="s303">Once they stopped a siren went on, several gestapo men would jump out, would go into a building and bring a few people out.</span> <span id="s304">In addition to the stars, in Belgium unlike the United States everybody had to carry an identity card.</span> <span id="s305">We have one here too.</span> <span id="s306">We have drivers' licenses, social security cards.</span> <span id="s307">However, there it was a regular identity card with your photograph, place of birth, date of birth, whether you were married or not, and if you were married - the children and when the children were born.</span> <span id="s308">It was literally an on-going record of your life that you carried with you at all times.</span> <span id="s309">The Belgian citizens' cards were green, foreigners' cards were yellow with a red band across.</span> <span id="s310">I still have mine from after the war.</span> <span id="s311">It still was yellow with a red band across and even though it says born in Belgium, it says in two languages "etranger" and stranger in both Flemish and French.</span> <span id="s312">In addition to that band and the word stranger or foreigner during that period of time Jews had a stamp put on just about the same time that the stars were handed out in both languages "Joff"[ph418] in Flemish and "Juif" in French and the size of the stamp, the letters were almost three quarters of an inch big so even if you couldn't read them from far, seeing those two stamps on the yellow part of the identity card, one knew immediately who you were.</span> <span id="s313">So my mother carried one of those.</span> <span id="s314">I was not old enough yet to have one.</span> <span id="s315">You weren't required to have one until you were fifteen years of age.</span> <span id="s316">But all Jews carried an identity card like that in addition to the stars.</span> <span id="s317">Well anyway when the gestapo then would jump out of these wagons and go into a building all they had to do was ask for documents and they were able to pick the Jews out and bring them in.</span> <span id="s318">In our neighborhood of course most of the people in our apartment houses were Jews, there were very few Christians.</span> <span id="s319">They came around irregularly.</span> <span id="s320">The men in our neighborhood built a sort of labyrinth between buildings.</span> <span id="s321">The buildings were attached.</span> <span id="s322">They built a labyrinth where they opened up a wall either in a closet or behind a wall, concealed doors, in basements and you were able to escape through these hidden openings from one building to another and exit several blocks away and be safe, temporarily anyway.</span> <span id="s323">It became a game.</span> <span id="s324">Every time we'd hear that little siren we would of course immediately be activated as you would say; we ran.</span> <span id="s325">It became a game with us kids.</span> <span id="s326">We knew it was dangerous.</span> <span id="s327">We knew lives were in danger.</span> <span id="s328">However, it was very exciting.</span> <span id="s329">The idea was well let's see who's going to get caught now.</span> <span id="s330">Anyway this went on for awhile.</span> <span id="s331">Meanwhile Jews were still able to work and earn some money but less and less so, depending on what you did.</span> <span id="s332">Mom worked at that point.</span> <span id="s333">She could only get work in a restaurant.</span> <span id="s334">She worked in the restaurant.</span> <span id="s335">Let me retract a little bit.</span> <span id="s336">Just before we put the stars on, Mom would smuggle food from northern France to Belgium.</span> <span id="s337">I won't go into all the details on it but I did accompany her occasionally.</span> <span id="s338">She would let me carry let's say like a box with five kilograms of sugar.</span> <span id="s339">I had to pretend that it was a doll and if someone, a custom's agent or someone else would come near me and would want to see in my box, I would start screaming and crying, don't touch my new doll.</span> <span id="s340">I just got it and you'll break it.</span> <span id="s341">Nine times out of ten people were sympathetic and they didn't touch my new doll.</span> <span id="s342">However, occasionally we did have things taken away from us and we had to pay a fine.</span> <span id="s343">After a while though it became too dangerous and Mom stopped doing that especially after we had to wear the stars.</span> <span id="s344">Then it was stopped totally.</span> <span id="s345">We also couldn't get rationing stamps anymore so it became a very precarious existence.</span> <span id="s346">You work, you try to buy things on the black market and make do that way.</span> <span id="s347">Mom also sewed in the evening and we kids helped her.</span> <span id="s348">We also did this after the liberation.</span> <span id="s349">Lace could not be gotten so Mom made slips.</span> <span id="s350">I did the hand-work where I made like a little escallop on the bottom of the slips and on the top.</span> <span id="s351">One of us turned the shoulder straps inside out that Mom sewed.</span> <span id="s352">The other one ironed.</span> <span id="s353">It was a family affair to earn a little money for bread.</span> <span id="s354">Anyway time went on and the Germans, the Nazis rather, - I won't say Germans because I feel very strongly that there is a difference between someone born on a certain soil and someone taking on a certain ideology - the gestapo kept coming around, as I said, occasionally, more and more often.</span> <span id="s355">Sometimes they'd stay away a week or two, sometimes they'd come day after day.</span> <span id="s356">It was very irregular and one could almost not prepare for it.</span> <span id="s357">Meanwhile, one day as Mom was heading home and try to beat curfew [curfew for Christians was at that time I believe eight p.m. if I recall correctly and seven p.m. for Jews] she was trying to make curfew when someone called her name and she started to run, she turned around and saw a German in a gestapo uniform.</span> <span id="s358">Actually he wore the black uniform and we found out later that he was attached to the commandanteur of Antwerp.</span> <span id="s359">She started running quicker.</span> <span id="s360">It was Carl, my father's old friend Carl.</span> <span id="s361">Carl caught up with her, wanted to know where my father was, how my father was doing.</span> <span id="s362">My mother told him she had had no news of him which was really a lie but she told him she didn't know where he was.</span> <span id="s363">Sometimes she changed; she said once that she did tell him that he was in America and other times she told me that she told him that she didn't know where he was.</span> <span id="s364">So I really don't know because that was hearsay by my mother.</span> <span id="s365">But what I know is that Carl was there.</span> <span id="s366">He started coming to visit, bringing us food.</span> <span id="s367">My mother asked him one day though to not come around anymore because our neighbors would ask questions.</span> <span id="s368">What is this a German is coming to your house.</span> <span id="s369">Anyway, he didn't come around for a few weeks or a couple of months maybe even.</span> <span id="s370">One day, I'll never forget that day, Carl caught up with my mother again.</span> <span id="s371">He didn't come to the house but he caught up with her in the street.</span> <span id="s372">Apparently he must have been waiting for her.</span> <span id="s373">He said, Fannie if you can go home, take the children and see if you can get yourself out of town.</span> <span id="s374">And she said why what's the matter.</span> <span id="s375">He said I can't tell you, just trust me and get out of town.</span> <span id="s376">And with that he turned around and left.</span> <span id="s377">Mama came home, very little was said.</span> <span id="s378">She took our stars off our coat, rubbed the coat with her nails to make sure that the markings weren't showing, put a double layer of clothing on each of us, took the albums in a bag under her arm and we left.</span> <span id="s379">We were going to go to Brussels.</span> <span id="s380">To go from Antwerp to Brussels is really a simple thing.</span> <span id="s381">It's almost no longer than going from Silver Spring to Washington.</span> <span id="s382">It's about a forty minute, forty-five minute train ride.</span> <span id="s383">You go to the train station, you buy a ticket, you get on a train, you get to Brussels, you get off the train.</span> <span id="s384">That's the extent of the trip, very simple.</span> <span id="s385">However, we had a few problems.</span> <span id="s386">We were illegal, we had taken our stars off, Mom had an identity card if it were asked of her to be shown which had Jew on there, it was yellow with a red band with the two stamps of Jew.</span> <span id="s387">So it wasn't that simple.</span> <span id="s388">But she acted as if it were.</span> <span id="s389">She went over to the ticket window.</span> <span id="s390">She bought four tickets.</span> <span id="s391">We went on to the train.</span> <span id="s392">We sat and made our way to Brussels.</span> <span id="s393">Occasionally trains would be stopped, gestapo would get on the trains.</span> <span id="s394">They would ask for documents.</span> <span id="s395">In this case for some reason we got to Brussels, no one stopped the train.</span> <span id="s396">Now we have to get out of the railroad station.</span> <span id="s397">....big, beautiful staircase that led down to the main level and to the exit.</span> <span id="s398">We get to the staircase.</span> <span id="s399">Mom was wondering, we were just following her, as to how she was going to handle this in case she was stopped.</span> <span id="s400">We get to the staircase, the staircase was packed with a mob of people.</span> <span id="s401">We could not get on to the steps.</span> <span id="s402">We didn't realize at first why but then Mom noticed at the bottom of the staircase there was a check-point and there were several gestapo men with some Belgian police.</span> <span id="s403">The Belgian police weren't doing anything.</span> <span id="s404">They were checking documents.</span> <span id="s405">Mom says to us, "pick a fight."</span> <span id="s406">We never questioned Mom, we always obeyed, especially once the war came.</span> <span id="s407">We start fighting, screaming, kicking.</span> <span id="s408">I'm the first one who started being I'm the oldest.</span> <span id="s409">I knew exactly what to do.</span> <span id="s410">I started pulling my sister's hair, pinching her, pushing her.</span> <span id="s411">One started to cry, the other one started to cry; we started to scream at each other and we knew we couldn't stop until we got orders from Mama.</span> <span id="s412">People were getting very annoyed around us.</span> <span id="s413">They were already tense, apparently.</span> <span id="s414">They started letting us through just so that we shouldn't bother them.</span> <span id="s415">Anyway we get to the bottom still screaming, kicking, fighting and one of the gestapo men said to my mother to the effect "stop those kids" and my mother made believe she didn't understand.</span> <span id="s416">We continued fighting and finally he said "take your kids and get out of here."</span> <span id="s417">Mom pretended not to understand even though that's exactly what she wanted to do and finally one of the French police, not French police, one of the Belgians, I really don't recall whether it was the Belgian or one of the French.</span> <span id="s418">Someone in French said why don't you take the kids and get out of here in a very curt voice.</span> <span id="s419">So we did.</span> <span id="s420">Mom took us and we left still screaming and fighting, but not too fast and not too slow.</span> <span id="s421">We made our way out of the station.</span> <span id="s422">We walked a few blocks and finally stopped and caught our breath.</span> <span id="s423">We stopped fighting and we felt very safe.</span> <span id="s424">We still don't understand.</span> <span id="s425">We had so many incidents like that where we felt that we had literally crawled out through the eye of the needle.</span> <span id="s426">We made our way to my aunt's house because we knew where she lived.</span> <span id="s427">We didn't know this through the mail.</span> <span id="s428">We knew it by word of mouth, people who had come to Antwerp.</span> <span id="s429">That's how we got the address.</span> <span id="s430">From there we found a small apartment, we got settled in and we never put the stars on again.</span> <span id="s431">And my mother had the audacity of enrolling us in public school.</span> <span id="s432">She entrusted a neighbor with our story.</span> <span id="s433">You had to trust.</span> <span id="s434">That was one of the big problems.</span> <span id="s435">You didn't know who to trust but you had to take someone into your confidence.</span> <span id="s436">Sometimes it worked, sometimes it doesn't.</span> <span id="s437">We were lucky.</span> <span id="s438">Most of the people that we trusted were trustworthy as we can attest because we are still here.</span> <span id="s439">The neighbor who we took into our trust let us use her name.</span> <span id="s440">Her name was Fiers.</span> <span id="s441">So my mother became Fannie Fiers, I became Flora Fiers, Charlotte Fiers, and Betty Fiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Your first names weren't...?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">We did not change our first names because they were Belgian names.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">It wasn't indicative that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">They weren't indicative and the reason that we didn't change them was my mother felt that it would be easier to remember if we were called by someone and we would not make a mistake of not knowing.</span> <span id="s446">She felt that just a last name was easier to work with, especially with the little ones.</span> <span id="s447">By this time it was early '42.</span> <span id="s448">I was eleven and Charlotte was just about eight and Betty was five so Betty at five was still very young.</span> <span id="s449">I, of course, would have understood but it would have been very difficult for them if their first names were changed.</span> <span id="s450">They could have probably done it but there was no need because they were such Belgian names.</span> <span id="s451">Anyway, she enrolled us in school with strict instructions not to ever tell anybody that we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s452">We started school and the teachers were frightened of one particular child who happened to be in my middle sister's class.</span> <span id="s453">Her brother was a Belgian Nazi.</span> <span id="s454">A Belgian on the whole was very anti-Nazi but there was a Flemish element that felt they had lost autonomy and looked to the Germans to give them back autonomy of their country which they thought had lost to the French speaking people.</span> <span id="s455">So there were Belgian Nazis.</span> <span id="s456">There was a whole group of mostly Flemish Belgian Nazis.</span> <span id="s457">Her brother was.</span> <span id="s458">We called them the Black Shirts.</span> <span id="s459">Some of them wore brown shirts.</span> <span id="s460">They wore brown or black shirts.</span> <span id="s461">Anyway my sister Charlotte had a fight with this girl and she threatened to get her big brother on her.</span> <span id="s462">Normally this would not be a big deal but in this particular case it was.</span> <span id="s463">The teacher told the principal.</span> <span id="s464">The principal called me in and said I'd better call my mother in to come to school.</span> <span id="s465">She wants to talk to her.</span> <span id="s466">I said, well why we didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s467">She said, no, no, it's okay, I just want to talk to your mother.</span> <span id="s468">My mother came to school and the principal said to her before we go on with our conversation and why I called you, she said I want you to know I know you're Jewish.</span> <span id="s469">My mother denied it up and down.</span> <span id="s470">She said "you have no proof, what do you mean I'm Jewish."</span> <span id="s471">Meanwhile don't forget she still had the yellow identity card.</span> <span id="s472">We were just lucky up to this point.</span> <span id="s473">Finally the principal seemed to convince her that she was to be trusted.</span> <span id="s474">My mother broke down and did tell her that we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s475">She said, look she says I want to help you.</span> <span id="s476">And she tells her the story about my sister.</span> <span id="s477">And also at that point, just about that time people started being caught in Brussels already too, not as much as in Antwerp.</span> <span id="s478">Let me just go back.</span> <span id="s479">Okay let me finish this and then I'll go back to Antwerp.</span> <span id="s480">There was something that happened right after we came to Brussels.</span> <span id="s481">She says "I'm going to help.</span> <span id="s482">I think it's time," she says " that your children be hidden.</span> <span id="s483">It's not safe for them to be in school.</span> <span id="s484">It's not safe for them to be with you."</span> <span id="s485">She says, " I will put you in touch with someone who can help you."</span> <span id="s486">Before I go on with this, let me just go back.</span> <span id="s487">After we were in Brussels, my mother didn't question Carl, she just acted.</span> <span id="s488">And this was basically what she did most of the time throughout the war.</span> <span id="s489">Whether it was just luck or my mother's actions in themselves, I think her acting quickly without hesitation, without pondering did help a lot in our being saved.</span> <span id="s490">Of course, not minimizing the work of the people who helped us, all those righteous Gentiles which I will tell you about later on.</span> <span id="s491">After we got to Brussels and we were settled down, about 48 hours or so later Mother suddenly started thinking about what Carl said, about getting out of town and why.</span> <span id="s492">She said to me, "you know what Florika," she called me by my diminutive name," you're going to go back to Antwerp and you're going to warn people.</span> <span id="s493">You're going to see so-and-so and you're going to tell them that something is going to happen."</span> <span id="s494">She said "because a child is not detected you can go safely."</span> <span id="s495">Being I wasn't wearing a star anymore a child at that point did not carry documents yet.</span> <span id="s496">So I went back to Antwerp, bought a ticket and went back to Antwerp.</span> <span id="s497">I walked into the Langakivicz Stradt[ph89] and it was very quiet.</span> <span id="s498">I didn't see anybody.</span> <span id="s499">The butcher shop was closed, the bakery was closed.</span> <span id="s500">It really was almost frightening.</span> <span id="s501">There I was walking through these streets and I didn't see anybody.</span> <span id="s502">I saw people in the Pellicon Stradt[ph92] which was where the station was.</span> <span id="s503">There it was very active; people were coming, people were going; the trams were operating.</span> <span id="s504">However, once I walked into the Langakivicz Stradt[ph94] and the Leverick Stradt[ph92] and the Somer Stradt[ph92] it was very, very quiet.</span> <span id="s505">I walked around.</span> <span id="s506">I was afraid to go back to Brussels because I hadn't carried out what Mom told me to do.</span> <span id="s507">Finally it was getting to be late afternoon.</span> <span id="s508">It wasn't quite dusk but I could see the sun starting to go under and I didn't know what to do, whether to go back or not.</span> <span id="s509">And as I was walking trying to decide whether to back to the station to go back to Brussels, I heard a knock near my ankle from a basement window.</span> <span id="s510">I looked down and a hand was pointing to one side of the street.</span> <span id="s511">I knew exactly what they were showing me, to come in.</span> <span id="s512">So I went to where I knew how to get through the labyrinth [this was on the Somer Stradt[ph104] and I made my way into that basement.</span> <span id="s513">There were five people in the basement.</span> <span id="s514">One of them was a distant cousin of Mom's through marriage.</span> <span id="s515">And I said Chanita, Mama said you should all leave.</span> <span id="s516">I said what happened, where is everybody?</span> <span id="s517">And they told me that they came in with big trucks and literally emptied the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s518">That was probably the thing that Carl warned us about.</span> <span id="s519">I told those people to come with me to Brussels.</span> <span id="s520">They said no, there's no place to run, we have food for about three weeks, we're not going anywhere.</span> <span id="s521">I never saw them again.</span> <span id="s522">I left and I never saw them again.</span> <span id="s523">I went back to Brussels.</span> <span id="s524">My Mom, who died April 7, 1992 her whole life she carried a terrible burden of guilt for not having told people before she left.</span> <span id="s525">However when Carl told her and she kept telling me this her whole life her immediate reaction was to follow his directions, take her children and go.</span> <span id="s526">She did not even think or ponder as to what might happen.</span> <span id="s527">But afterwards it bothered her.</span> <span id="s528">Let me just tell you one more thing about what happened in Antwerp before we had left for Brussels and before Carl had warned my mother.</span> <span id="s529">I found out after the war that the Belgian Nazis in Antwerp had gathered one night and had been shown a film, "De Avaga Juda[ph123]" which is the "Eternal Jew" which is a horrible film where human beings are transposed into rats and back and forth.</span> <span id="s530">The film is still available now and I understand in South America it's still being shown.</span> <span id="s531">One day a horde of Belgian Nazis stormed into our street, I'll never forget it, we were in our apartment looking out our window.</span> <span id="s532">The one thing that we were able to see from our window was them breaking the window of the book shop across the street and throwing the books and everything into the street and stomping them and dragging out the old man; he had payes[ph131], he had beard; this was a religious old man and beating him up and stomping him with their boots and all.</span> <span id="s533">I'll never forget the sight.</span> <span id="s534">My middle sister got hysterical.</span> <span id="s535">I had to slap her face to get her to stop screaming, "Charlotte, Charlotte."</span> <span id="s536">Also I witnessed the burning of the synagogue in Antwerp, I'll never forget that.</span> <span id="s537">I remember the fire trucks standing by.</span> <span id="s538">They were standing there doing nothing.</span> <span id="s539">First they threw out the torahs and the prayer books and then they put it on fire and it burned for hours.</span> <span id="s540">Nothing; nobody made any move to stop the fire.</span> <span id="s541">I found out after the war when I went back, I found out subsequently that the Belgians, the fire-fighters were given strict orders not to make any attempt to contain the fire unless it started touching buildings.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Do you remember when this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">To the best of my recollection it was late '41.</span> <span id="s544">I have it upstairs written down so I can give you the date.</span> <span id="s545">If you want I can fill that in at a later time.</span> <span id="s546">I think that was late '41 if I'm not mistaken but I will give you the correct date.</span> <span id="s547">I have it written down somewhere upstairs.</span> <span id="s548">I'm glad now that I wrote down a lot of things because my memory in small detail is starting to go, I noticed.</span> <span id="s549">Although I'm still very confident because many things that I'm not sure of sometimes keep being confirmed that my memory is good, many details because of a book that was put together from diaries from one of the people that was hidden, from Father Bruno Reynders, is confirming many details that I had in my memory so I feel pleased about that.</span> <span id="s550">But anyway coming back to Brussels, to the Mother Superior, we went home that day and she did put us in touch with a Mssr.</span> <span id="s551">Georges Ranson.</span> <span id="s552">I have his photograph.</span> <span id="s553">I've corresponded with him.</span> <span id="s554">I went back there after the war to see him.</span> <span id="s555">I've got a wonderful postcard that he wrote me, incredible Sharon.</span> <span id="s556">Anyway, Mssr.</span> <span id="s557">Ranson was a member of a group that was our school's patrons.</span> <span id="s558">Here we have PTA's, PTSA's.</span> <span id="s559">In Belgium we had industrialists, some of the wealthier members of the town who would become patrons of a school.</span> <span id="s560">They would help out with things a school would need, they were especially instrumental in providing vitamins, winter clothes and help with sending children to camps like the one we had been in, in 1940.</span> <span id="s561">And Mssr.</span> <span id="s562">Ranson, as I said, was instrumental in this.</span> <span id="s563">At that particular time, something I didn't know until later on, Mssr.</span> <span id="s564">Ranson was an active member of the Belgian Resistance.</span> <span id="s565">He had a factory that made mica for, I don't know whether they were used in guns or some kind of armor, for the German army.</span> <span id="s566">But in his cellar at night they produced and manufactured guns for the Resistance.</span> <span id="s567">Mssr.</span> <span id="s568">Ranson had a cousin who was a nun in a convent in a small town named Doel in the Flemish part of Belgium.</span> <span id="s569">He got in contact with his cousin and told her that he had three children who needed a hiding place.</span> <span id="s570">She was more than happy to help out.</span> <span id="s571">She did not tell the Mother Superior that we were Jewish children.</span> <span id="s572">She told the Mother Superior that three children whose father was a prisoner of war and whose mother had become ill needed a shelter for a short period of time.</span> <span id="s573">The evening before our departure Mssr.</span> <span id="s574">Ranson picked us up and he split us up.</span> <span id="s575">I stayed at his home, my sister Charlotte stayed in his brother's home and my sister Betty stayed in his secretary's home.</span> <span id="s576">His brother was against what he was doing because he worried about the family's well-being.</span> <span id="s577">However, he did obey his brother and helped shelter us.</span> <span id="s578">I found out later on that he also sheltered a family in an attic throughout the war.</span> <span id="s579">He took care of them, fed them, etc.</span> <span id="s580">Mr. Ranson the next morning personally transported us and I'll tell you how.</span> <span id="s581">But first I want to share with you a small detail of the evening that I was in his home.</span> <span id="s582">Naturally, needless to say we were kind of frightened of being separated from Mom and all that.</span> <span id="s583">Actually what was strange is that for some reason, even though we were young in years, we seemed to understand what this was all about and we didn't cry, did what we were told to do; we were what we called good children.</span> <span id="s584">And why am I saying good children because even children who were hidden had to behave a certain way.</span> <span id="s585">Children who were not good children, who created problems, were not kept.</span> <span id="s586">So even to be hidden one had to be a good child so our benefactors had no problems with us.</span> <span id="s587">So anyway we were three good children.</span> <span id="s588">I remember Mssr.</span> <span id="s589">Ranson putting me to bed and kissing me good-night, then leaving and closing the door.</span> <span id="s590">A little while later I heard an argument between Mssr.</span> <span id="s591">Ranson and his wife.</span> <span id="s592">She was screaming, "you're crazy, you're mad.</span> <span id="s593">All those things you're doing," she says, " you can do whatever you want.</span> <span id="s594">You want to risk your life, that's fine," she says, "but you have no right to bring this child here to risk my life and the children's lives because of a couple of Jews."</span> <span id="s595">I remember laying there, my heart starting to beat, getting very upset, starting to cry, then leaving my bed, running into the other room shouting, "Mssr.</span> <span id="s596">Ranson, Mssr.</span> <span id="s597">Ranson please take me back, I don't want to create problems between you and Mrs. Ranson," Mme Ranson, of course, in French.</span> <span id="s598">I'll never forget it.</span> <span id="s599">Mssr.</span> <span id="s600">Ranson was quiet for a second and suddenly pointed his hand and said," you get yourself back to bed immediatement," " retourne au lit," in French, but with a voice that could impose nothing else but obedience.</span> <span id="s601">And I went back to bed and lay there trembling not even daring to cry anymore.</span> <span id="s602">It was quiet afterwards.</span> <span id="s603">Anyway at dawn very, very early in the morning, Mssr.</span> <span id="s604">Ranson woke me and he had a little flat bed truck and I sat on it with him and we went to pick up my sister and the third sister.</span> <span id="s605">He had prepared the back of the truck in a very interesting way.</span> <span id="s606">He had gotten vegetable crates, the type of crates that were used, wooden crates that stored vegetables and fruit.</span> <span id="s607">He had turned three of them upside down, they were empty, and around it and on top of them he had put filled crates with vegetables and fruit.</span> <span id="s608">Apparently he must have gone out before he woke me to take me because the truck was all ready.</span> <span id="s609">And after we had picked up the third sister he put each one of us under the empty crate and covered us with the other crates and he told us that under no circumstances were we to make any sound, that he would stop, knock on the crate and take the crate off to let us go to the bathroom in an appropriate place, to feed us, give us a drink, etc.</span> <span id="s610">But unless he did so he didn't want to hear a sound.</span> <span id="s611">Now you have to picture Betty.</span> <span id="s612">Betty was at that point barely six years old.</span> <span id="s613">I don't even know if she was six.</span> <span id="s614">I think so because I think this was in the spring.</span> <span id="s615">She was quiet, it was amazing, she was quiet.</span> <span id="s616">And Betty basically was not a quiet child, she had a big mouth.</span> <span id="s617">Charlotte was a quiet child at all times.</span> <span id="s618">Charlotte sucked her thumb and would crawl into a corner even at home, would never really speak up.</span> <span id="s619">She was upset, she would just crawl into her little corner.</span> <span id="s620">Anyway, we remember the truck stopping at checkpoints because at that point there were checkpoints at the edge of every city, before you left the city.</span> <span id="s621">And the Germans asking for his documents, I remember at one point he asked, "Documenten," and he showed his document and everything was in order.</span> <span id="s622">And then they asked him, I remembered him asking what he had there and telling them that they could see it was vegetables, it was fruit.</span> <span id="s623">And then their coming and sort of knocking and looking around and letting us go.</span> <span id="s624">I'll never forget and I tell this to everyone I talk to because it still amazes me.</span> <span id="s625">I remember having at one of those checkpoints a tickle in my throat and remembering having to cough and thinking if I don't cough I will choke.</span> <span id="s626">However also knowing I may choke and die and don't cough but also knowing that if I coughed I would betray everyone and they would be killed and I would be killed because we were told that if we make one sound not only would we be killed but Mssr.</span> <span id="s627">Ranson would be killed and everybody else would be killed.</span> <span id="s628">I didn't know at the time how everybody else was going to be killed.</span> <span id="s629">Of course today I realize they probably would have tortured Mssr.</span> <span id="s630">Ranson and gotten the information from him or even from us.</span> <span id="s631">But anyway somehow, unbelievably, so I did not cough and to this day I have an exercise that I do every once in a while maybe to reassure myself that I can do it, if I have a tickle in my throat I'll hold off coughing for a few minutes.</span> <span id="s632">It sounds silly.</span> <span id="s633">Here's this middle aged woman who gets a tickle in her throat once in a while and tends to wait and not cough.</span> <span id="s634">That I did and I didn't cough and I survived the tickle.</span> <span id="s635">I coughed once I heard the truck really rolling.</span> <span id="s636">I do the same exercise once in a while with students of mine.</span> <span id="s637">I let them try because the kids will cough occasionally when someone's talking and I say okay, if anybody needs to cough see if you can hold out a couple of minutes.</span> <span id="s638">It'll help you.</span> <span id="s639">Anyway, it was serious.</span> <span id="s640">It sounds funny but it was pretty serious at the time.</span> <span id="s641">We get to the monastery.</span> <span id="s642">It turned out that we were going to be three only kids there with about a hundred and twenty nuns because it had been a boarding school.</span> <span id="s643">But because of the war there were no students at the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Could you tell me where it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">That was Doel, I mentioned that, that was where Sister Odonia, Mssr.</span> <span id="s646">Ranson's cousin was.</span> <span id="s647">It was right near the beach.</span> <span id="s648">As a matter of fact there's a big monument now right near the water within walking distance of this convent in honor of British soldiers who were killed there in a battle.</span> <span id="s649">It was that close to the battle scenes.</span> <span id="s650">Today also there's a nuclear plant there.</span> <span id="s651">The town is totally deserted.</span> <span id="s652">I went back and even the convent moved.</span> <span id="s653">It's empty because a nuclear plant sits right in that town.</span> <span id="s654">We arrived and we were placed in a parlor waiting for the Mother Superior to come in and Sister Odonia to come and we were sitting there with a nun who was not Sister Odonia kind of keeping us company till the others would arrive.</span> <span id="s655">And then finally they arrived and we were sitting there with several nuns, the Mother Superior and Sister Odonia.</span> <span id="s656">As we were sitting, my younger sister looked up and noticed a cross on the wall.</span> <span id="s657">And being Jewish children we grew up having to hold our heads down when we crossed a church.</span> <span id="s658">We had never been in a church because we weren't allowed to enter a church and of course we had never been inside a building where a cross was hanging on a wall.</span> <span id="s659">So there we are and suddenly Betty's gaze went up to this cross and she said to the nun, "what is that."</span> <span id="s660">And the nun looks at her and said very surprised, ---no the Mother Superior wasn't in the room yet, she came in afterwards, I'll never forget that.</span> <span id="s661">and she said, " of course little one this is our Lord on the cross," she says," you must have one like that at home, too."</span> <span id="s662">And she said "no we don't."</span> <span id="s663">Then she said, " well you must have one where you go and pray at church."</span> <span id="s664">And she says, "no we don't, we have something else."</span> <span id="s665">Meanwhile I was becoming very concerned and I sat next to Betty and I started pinching her under the table to be quiet.</span> <span id="s666">She knew that when she was pinched she had to be quiet.</span> <span id="s667">It was a code that we had.</span> <span id="s668">At this point, however, she chose not to obey me and says "leave me alone, don't hurt me, I'm not doing anything."</span> <span id="s669">And she says, " well I don't know what it's called but if you give me a pencil and paper I'll show you what we have" and she got a pencil and paper.</span> <span id="s670">She drew the most perfect Magen David, the Jewish star.</span> <span id="s671">The nun became hysterical, jumped out of her seat, ran out of the parlor and all of a sudden the Mother Superior came in and who I later found out was Sister Odonia came in with her and there was this big argument going on.</span> <span id="s672">I know now and I found out soon after that Sister Odonia had never told the Mother Superior that we were Jewish children as I said before.</span> <span id="s673">She just said we were children whose father was a prisoner-of-war and we needed a shelter.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">What language did you speak...?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Okay we spoke both French and Flemish, however, they were speaking Flemish.</span> <span id="s676">This was going on in Flemish.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">I was wondering like after you left Antwerp...?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">In Brussels we spoke French.</span> <span id="s679">We spoke French in Brussels.</span> <span id="s680">To this day in Belgium you have three languages, you have Flemish, French and Walloon.</span> <span id="s681">In the French speaking part of the country, in school, only French is taught.</span> <span id="s682">However, in the Flemish part of Belgium both languages are taught, Flemish and French.</span> <span id="s683">This is another thing that the Flemish resent to this day; they feel like they're second-class citizens.</span> <span id="s684">Their language does not have to be taught in the French part but the Flemish have to speak French.</span> <span id="s685">As a matter of fact, you'll go into many small towns, if you attempt to ask an address or something in French, even if they know French, they'll pretend not to understand French.</span> <span id="s686">Anyway this was in Flemish.</span> <span id="s687">This was really in the heart of Flemish Belgium.</span> <span id="s688">They had a dilemma now.</span> <span id="s689">They didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s690">They did keep us, however; they did keep us.</span> <span id="s691">We didn't stay too long.</span> <span id="s692">We stayed a little short of two months there because what happened is the Mother Superior, not because she was a bad person, she was really a good person, she was afraid to keep us because it was a real tiny town.</span> <span id="s693">And when I went back I first realized how small it really was.</span> <span id="s694">There was just the one church.</span> <span id="s695">You could walk across the whole town within less than an hour and a half to two hours.</span> <span id="s696">And there was a German post there.</span> <span id="s697">Not a Gestapo post, it was a military post, a small one.</span> <span id="s698">But still, the nuns, because of the war and the draft, they usually had a chaplain.</span> <span id="s699">But during the war the village priest doubled as chaplain so instead of having mass within the convent in their chapel, the nuns went to the village church for mass.</span> <span id="s700">One of the problems that they realized they would have is with me, the oldest, because I was old enough to have gone to Communion, to have had my first Communion and to go to Communion whenever there was mass, especially on Sundays.</span> <span id="s701">And of course I couldn't go to Communion now that they found out I was Jewish, so they couldn't let me go to Communion.</span> <span id="s702">They were, however, very very good to us.</span> <span id="s703">They knitted socks.</span> <span id="s704">They were as kind as could be, especially Sister Odonia who was with us almost constantly.</span> <span id="s705">We were really spoiled because we were like their three little pets for the two months that we were there.</span> <span id="s706">Anyway after two months George Ranson came back and took us back to my mother's the same way that he brought us.</span> <span id="s707">For a few days here and there we stayed with him and the secretary and the brother again but we were back with my mother.</span> <span id="s708">He made some other contacts for us and they found us another place.</span> <span id="s709">I realize today that the other place that we were hidden in was through Father Bruno although I had always been under the impression that the only place that he had been responsible for was the last hiding place in Ruisselede but I now know that Etterbeek was also through Father Bruno.</span> <span id="s710">We were hidden in Etterbeek in St. Joseph's Orphanage but it was really not only an orphanage; they also had some youngsters who were difficult to deal with.</span> <span id="s711">Someone said they were juvenile delinquents.</span> <span id="s712">We were there for about eight months and after eight months we went back home and a new place had to be found.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Could you tell me what it was like there?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">That's exactly what I'm going to do right now.</span> <span id="s715">Etterbeek was a very difficult place for us to be.</span> <span id="s716">The little ones went to classes.</span> <span id="s717">I was recruited to peel potatoes and help with the kitchen and with the cooking and things like that, to repair socks, and help with the little ones because I was one of the older children.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">What were you like twelve at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">At that point I was twelve, it was just before twelve, yeah I think I might have been just twelve at that point because I think we were there, we went there like in July and stayed throughout the period, past twelve.</span> <span id="s720">The place was dirty, I remember.</span> <span id="s721">I remember there was a garden but there was a big, almost like a - I thought it was a ten foot fence but it could be because I was little.</span> <span id="s722">And there were apples growing there and of course we couldn't get in there.</span> <span id="s723">But there was a small courtyard in the orphanage.</span> <span id="s724">We slept in a dormitory.</span> <span id="s725">I went back to visit it.</span> <span id="s726">On my second visit I finally rang the bell, on the first visit, I couldn't bring myself to ring the bell, I'll never forget that.</span> <span id="s727">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s728">I never found an answer to that.</span> <span id="s729">But the second time I did ring the bell to go in and I was received very warmly.</span> <span id="s730">There were just two people left of the ones that I knew.</span> <span id="s731">But anyway there were rats, but then there were rats all over Belgium at that point because things were dirty, things couldn't be kept up.</span> <span id="s732">And I remember there was a lot of water, the basement was always flooded.</span> <span id="s733">And I remember, being one of the older kids, I had to go help chase the rats.</span> <span id="s734">But anyway bathing was a problem.</span> <span id="s735">They would set up a big tub in the middle of the courtyard, of course not in the winter months, and we took turns going into the tub, washing, going out of the tub and getting a towel that was used by at least ten or more kids, and drying.</span> <span id="s736">And I'll never forget it, my middle sister, Charlotte, was very finicky and she refused to go into the tub.</span> <span id="s737">Anyway she finally did but they had to practically force her to go in.</span> <span id="s738">So these kinds of things.</span> <span id="s739">Another thing that I do remember from there is my mother did occasionally visit there because it was a Brussels suburb, Etterbeek, so she did occasionally visit and bring a little bread.</span> <span id="s740">The bread I'll never forget.</span> <span id="s741">It was war bread.</span> <span id="s742">The first day it was tough.</span> <span id="s743">The second day it was even tougher and the third day it started going moldy.</span> <span id="s744">It was heavy, but it was bread.</span> <span id="s745">Even at Etterbeek at the orphanage we would get a piece of bread that we had to save and we would only get it every three days or so.</span> <span id="s746">So I was responsible for the bread of my sisters.</span> <span id="s747">I slept with the bread under my pillow with one eye half open I would almost say, never sleeping very well because kids would steal from one another.</span> <span id="s748">There would be battles during the night with the kids; they would try to steal the bread.</span> <span id="s749">Another problem I had with the bread was I had to divide it between the three of us and hold it.</span> <span id="s750">The little one didn't quite understand that I didn't want to give her the bread because I needed it for the next day and the next day.</span> <span id="s751">And she always cried that I'm being mean and selfish and I wouldn't give her the bread.</span> <span id="s752">I also needed bread for another reason.</span> <span id="s753">We ended up having lice and I would take the lice out of my sisters' heads but I couldn't take my own out so I paid for it by the bread for every ten lice.</span> <span id="s754">I measured the bread and the other kids who took my lice out had to literally show me every louse that was killed, actually the nits that they would take out.</span> <span id="s755">I counted them very diligently and there had to be ten.</span> <span id="s756">Ten for a bite of bread and the bread was measured exactly from the nail on my thumb to my knuckle.</span> <span id="s757">So that was one thing.</span> <span id="s758">I had to help cook as I said before and I couldn't understand.</span> <span id="s759">I used to get very ill and vomit sometimes and then many years later when I was already in the United States, I remember that when I smelled cooked rhubarb, because Mom loved cooking rhubarb, I would feel nauseated.</span> <span id="s760">I recalled the reason perhaps why this happened was one of the vegetables that we had while we were at Etterbeek we used to cook the leaves of the rhubarb rather than just the stems and I learned since that the leaves of rhubarb have a toxin in them, not enough to kill one but enough to render one quite ill.</span> <span id="s761">Of course at the time we didn't know it and everything that we could eat, we ate.</span> <span id="s762">We even cooked the leaves of carrots.</span> <span id="s763">I used to steal, of course.</span> <span id="s764">I stole potatoes for my kid sisters all while I was peeling them.</span> <span id="s765">And we ate the peels while we were peeling them because that was going to be food, got ground into food.</span> <span id="s766">So they were not the easiest eight months.</span> <span id="s767">However, I remember there being a few nuns who seemed to me that they were a little different from the other nuns.</span> <span id="s768">I can't quite remember what struck me about their being different.</span> <span id="s769">One of them in particular, she was much stricter than the other nuns were.</span> <span id="s770">I found out after the war when I went back that those were Jewish young women who were also hiding in the orphanage, but since they were adults, they were dressed up in the nuns' habit.</span> <span id="s771">Therefore I realized something but I didn't quite understand it at the time.</span> <span id="s772">I learned all these things when I went back.</span> <span id="s773">Anyway, after about eight months things were getting pretty dangerous there also.</span> <span id="s774">We had some visits from the Gestapo but things were still fairly safe.</span> <span id="s775">But anyway we were very unhappy there and Mama said that she had made a contact and perhaps we could find another place.</span> <span id="s776">So we were taken home.</span> <span id="s777">We were home for awhile.</span> <span id="s778">Meanwhile my aunt and uncle's apartment had been raided and my aunt and uncle had moved into our apartment so we were all, my aunt and uncle and Nathan, we called Noonoo.</span> <span id="s779">Meanwhile while all this was going on, Mssr.</span> <span id="s780">Ranson had provided Mom with a cross from his wife, had provided her with false documents under the name of Fiers with a regular green card which he did for other people also.</span> <span id="s781">And he gave Mom a job at his factory.</span> <span id="s782">But between the job at the factory just before that, Mom had worked - we had friends who lived right across the elementary school that we had gone to, Ricard Premier[ph489], and for a moment I can't think of their name, it'll come to me, I wrote it down somewhere, it'll come back to me, maybe I could fill it in to you later on.</span> <span id="s783">For some reason I'm drawing a blank all of a sudden - oh no, Mr. and Mrs. Hotton.</span> <span id="s784">They had an old metal scrap yard.</span> <span id="s785">When we first met them, we were good friends, but since at the time Mama took any kind of work, before Mssr.</span> <span id="s786">Ranson gave her the job and a false document, she worked for them as a cleaning woman.</span> <span id="s787">They also helped her with a little bit of food and to bring back for my aunt and uncle.</span> <span id="s788">However, Mssr.</span> <span id="s789">and Mme. Hotton's son had joined the Black Shirts.</span> <span id="s790">He didn't live with them but he did visit occasionally.</span> <span id="s791">After a while so Mom shouldn't have to walk the streets back and forth to the apartment, Mom ended up sleeping in Mssr.</span> <span id="s792">and Mme Hotton's attic.</span> <span id="s793">But then they told her maybe she'd be better off not coming anymore and sleeping there because they were afraid their son just might find out and would betray her.</span> <span id="s794">So she stopped going.</span> <span id="s795">I went back after the war.</span> <span id="s796">Mssr.</span> <span id="s797">Hotton had died and I went to see Mme Hotton but perhaps because of age she did not recognize me, and I was a little saddened because of that because I did go back to see her.</span> <span id="s798">But anyway she then got the job with Mssr.</span> <span id="s799">Ranson.</span> <span id="s800">Then later on, after we were hidden again and I'll tell you the details of that, Mssr.</span> <span id="s801">Ranson provided Mom with sleeping accommodations in his office in the factory.</span> <span id="s802">She would leave at about five o'clock, leave work like everybody else and then she would hide in......Well, there are several things that happened.</span> <span id="s803">Mssr.</span> <span id="s804">Ranson provided her with a cot which was kept in a closet in his office.</span> <span id="s805">He also brought her food.</span> <span id="s806">He took her laundry to his apartment and believe it or not his wife did my mother's laundry.</span> <span id="s807">Some of it she did in the factory, but the things that she couldn't do, she did.</span> <span id="s808">With all that she still helped him.</span> <span id="s809">But anyway, he also brought her food to take to my aunt and uncle because after their apartment had been raided and they ended up staying in our apartment, they never left our apartment anymore.</span> <span id="s810">They never went out in the street again.</span> <span id="s811">So she took them food so that they would be well supplied.</span> <span id="s812">And she would sneak back to the factory and sleep in the factory.</span> <span id="s813">So she left with everybody.</span> <span id="s814">She then snuck back after dark.</span> <span id="s815">After she took the food and then snuck back and had a key to enter.</span> <span id="s816">There are also people working downstairs for the Resistance throughout all this period of time and sometimes she helped out with that.</span> <span id="s817">At this point my aunt is in our apartment, Mom is sleeping in Ranson's factory and we get contacted by a representative from Father Bruno.</span> <span id="s818">The person never gave her name.</span> <span id="s819">The one thing that it is they did not give their names because of fear that if their network got infiltrated and betrayed there would be a problem.</span> <span id="s820">But anyway, that there is a place where they could hide us and they gave us very precise instructions.</span> <span id="s821">My aunt's child, Noonoo, my little cousin Noonoo, was also offered a hiding place.</span> <span id="s822">My aunt was afraid to let him go because at that point some of the groups were infiltrated by traitors and sometimes children were picked up, taken away, and were never seen again.</span> <span id="s823">And they were aware of that; the Jews were aware of that.</span> <span id="s824">My aunt decided that her Noonoo had a 50% chance of surviving in this neighborhood But anyway to make a long story short my uncle and aunt were taken to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s825">My aunt and my little cousin were destroyed in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s826">So he was born during the war and he got killed during the war.</span> <span id="s827">My uncle survived but he met an ugly death in Poland after liberation.</span> <span id="s828">My mother was supposed to take us; she took us to the train station.</span> <span id="s829">We were supposed to go on the quai, wait at a particular train for a woman who was described as wearing a particular suit, a particular color, and we were not to address her.</span> <span id="s830">My mother was not to address her.</span> <span id="s831">We were just to wait until the train pulled in.</span> <span id="s832">Then the train pulled in.</span> <span id="s833">When this woman who was described to us very distinctly walked into the train, the three of us had to walk away from my mother without saying goodbye as if she were a stranger, without any acknowledgement that we knew her.</span> <span id="s834">Wherever the woman sat down we were supposed to sit down without acknowledging that there was any connection between us and the woman.</span> <span id="s835">I'm still amazed at times that we did it, but we did.</span> <span id="s836">Wherever the woman would get off the train, we would follow her, not to address her or anything else.</span> <span id="s837">We followed her.</span> <span id="s838">When we were several streets away from the station, and that was Ruisselede as we learned later on, she came over, took us around and said I'm gong to take you to a safe place.</span> <span id="s839">We then ended up at the Convent of Our Lady of Seven Sorrows, Notre Dame de Sept Douleurs.</span> <span id="s840">There we stayed till liberation.</span> <span id="s841">After several months, I received a coded letter from my mother.</span> <span id="s842">The Mother Superior called me into her office and read me the letter.</span> <span id="s843">The letter said, Dearest Flora, Tanta Leah, Uncle Alex and Noonoo went away on vacation to visit the rest of the family.</span> <span id="s844">I don't know when they'll be back.</span> <span id="s845">I don't know what to do in the meantime.</span> <span id="s846">The Mother Superior handed me the letter which she had opened and already read, said what is this saying.</span> <span id="s847">I said I think what it's saying is that my aunt and uncle were caught by the gestapo and were taken away to a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s848">Because by then we knew.</span> <span id="s849">We didn't know exactly what happened in concentration camps, that we didn't know until later on, but we knew at that point that they existed.</span> <span id="s850">Remember at the beginning when I told you about Herr Gross?</span> <span id="s851">Herr Gross had been taken to a concentration camp, somehow was taken out on a work detail or being transferred to another camp and he jumped from the train.</span> <span id="s852">They shot after him; he was wounded.</span> <span id="s853">They left him for dead but a farmer found him in the bushes.</span> <span id="s854">He was a good man; didn't betray him, nursed him back to health.</span> <span id="s855">He was never really healthy again but anyway he somehow made his way back to Brussels.</span> <span id="s856">After we had left Antwerp and we were in Brussels, accidently we once met.</span> <span id="s857">And that's how he knew that we were in Brussels.</span> <span id="s858">But anyway he made his way back and that's how we learned some of those things.</span> <span id="s859">He did survive and then died in the United States a few years after he emigrated.</span> <span id="s860">He was always a sick man though, for the rest of his life.</span> <span id="s861">But anyway, coming back there, the Mother Superior dictated a letter and I wrote, Dear Mama, while Uncle Alex, Aunt Leah and Noonoo are on vacation, why don't you come to visit us.</span> <span id="s862">My mother came.</span> <span id="s863">She walked a railroad track at night not to get lost, because by then even with false documents it was much too dangerous to go on trains, and slept under the bushes during the day; stole from the fields to survive the three days that she walked and came to the convent.</span> <span id="s864">The Mother Superior gave her a beautiful little room.</span> <span id="s865">But we were told that nobody was to know that she was our mother, that she was supposed to be a stranger.</span> <span id="s866">If we saw her we were not to acknowledge her but every once in a while she would take us to see her.</span> <span id="s867">So once a week she would take us very quietly.</span> <span id="s868">Mama would be waiting in that room and we would go and we were able to hug and talk and see each other for about a half-hour.</span> <span id="s869">But the rest of the week we had to stay away.</span> <span id="s870">There were a few close brushes because the Germans used to come and look for soldiers who at that point started defecting already.</span> <span id="s871">They weren't looking exactly for Jews but they were looking for soldiers but in the process there was always a fear they would find us.</span> <span id="s872">There was a chain in the convent.</span> <span id="s873">Every time that door bell would ring the command went down the chain and we were taken and quickly rushed down into a cellar.</span> <span id="s874">At one point we were sitting in a cellar with a nun, hugged in a corner behind a big pile of potatoes; they stored vegetables in the cellar.</span> <span id="s875">Somehow we were always involved with vegetables.</span> <span id="s876">But anyway, we were hiding behind that pile of potatoes and the Germans did come down to that cellar to look.</span> <span id="s877">They poked, I don't know whether it was with their guns or their bayonets or whatever but they did poke into the pile because we heard potatoes rolling and everything.</span> <span id="s878">And they left.</span> <span id="s879">I mean it was amazing because all they had to do was walk around the pile a couple of feet further and they would have seen us.</span> <span id="s880">Luckily we didn't make a sound, nothing, and we were safe.</span> <span id="s881">And this happened several times.</span> <span id="s882">But anyway the end did come.</span> <span id="s883">I had one close brush.</span> <span id="s884">I still don't know whether this person would have betrayed me or not.</span> <span id="s885">Every once in a while traveling preachers came to the convent and this one time one of those traveling preachers who came to preach grabbed me in the courtyard and he says you're a Jewish little girl, aren't you?</span> <span id="s886">And I said No.</span> <span id="s887">I'll never forget it.</span> <span id="s888">I remember him shaking me and yelling at me.</span> <span id="s889">And he says you know what happens to little girls who lie?</span> <span id="s890">They go to hell and they burn in a fire and they suffer and he was screaming.</span> <span id="s891">Finally I said, you're mean.</span> <span id="s892">You're going to burn in hell and I literally fought him physically.</span> <span id="s893">He finally let me loose.</span> <span id="s894">I had the marks of his fingers on my arm.</span> <span id="s895">They were red marks.</span> <span id="s896">I'll never forget that.</span> <span id="s897">I literally got loose and I ran to the Mother Superior's office sobbing and told her what happened.</span> <span id="s898">She immediately stormed out and of course I don't know.</span> <span id="s899">She must have had a talk with him or whatever.</span> <span id="s900">As I said, to this day I'll never know.</span> <span id="s901">It was very strange, why he grabbed me like that, I still don't know because there were other children there.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Did you look particularly Jewish do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Well compared to a lot of other kids, my hair was darker.</span> <span id="s904">Don't go by the hair color, you know.</span> <span id="s905">It was dark, real dark brown.</span> <span id="s906">This is sort of between gray and a cover-up job.</span> <span id="s907">My hair was dark brown.</span> <span id="s908">It was a little more of an ethnic look.</span> <span id="s909">Many of the kids in that area were blue-eyed, light-haired.</span> <span id="s910">My sister was a little more sallow skinned with almost pitch black hair.</span> <span id="s911">She certainly did not look Flemish.</span> <span id="s912">So I don't know.</span> <span id="s913">As I said I have no explanation.</span> <span id="s914">Maybe he sensed something, I don't know.</span> <span id="s915">But anyway maybe it was curiosity or what but I never found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">That was pretty cruel.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">But it was one of my closes brushes.</span> <span id="s918">It was cruel.</span> <span id="s919">And after the war I found out that Father Bruno who supplied the food stamps for us had to get them illegally.</span> <span id="s920">He had some arrangements with someone in the rationing office.</span> <span id="s921">But the Mother Superior also managed to get some stamps in a very interesting way which I didn't find out from her until after the liberation when I went back to visit.</span> <span id="s922">She told us that she knew little things about every one of the residents in the town.</span> <span id="s923">What she called she blackmailed the mayor into .....When they buried someone, what they did is they buried them quietly and would not register the death.</span> <span id="s924">In that way the mayor was able to take those stamps and give them to the convent to feed us.</span> <span id="s925">But Father Bruno did most of that.</span> <span id="s926">He supplied most of the stamps.</span> <span id="s927">Father Bruno Reynders.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Do you want to tell who he was?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Father Bruno Reynders was a Benedictine Monk from a monastery in Luvin[ph100].</span> <span id="s930">Father Bruno got involved into hiding children without actually planning to.</span> <span id="s931">Someone asked him to hide a child and he couldn't say no.</span> <span id="s932">And then someone asked him to take another child and another one and before he knew it he was actively involved in hiding children.</span> <span id="s933">He ended up hiding three hundred children, most of them boys because boys were very hard to hide because they were circumsised.</span> <span id="s934">Most people were afraid to take boys but he managed to find places for boys especially in monasteries, even in his own.</span> <span id="s935">His brother Jean who is a dentist and is the only one of the three siblings still alive.</span> <span id="s936">There was a nun, Sister Bernadette who has died since who helped with hiding the children.</span> <span id="s937">Jean is still alive in Belgium and at any given time, I understand, Jean was hiding about twenty-five people in his cellar.</span> <span id="s938">Father Bruno Reynders was also helped by his nephew Michel Reynders who presently is the honorary Consul for Belgium in Denver, Colorado.</span> <span id="s939">He was fourteen years old at the time, Michel Reynders, and he would carry messages.</span> <span id="s940">Occasionally he would accompany a boy to a hiding place because he was able to get on a tram with him and he would face the people and the boy would face him and sort of make their way to a hiding place.</span> <span id="s941">Father Bruno almost got caught by the gestapo several times.</span> <span id="s942">One time they came to his monastery.</span> <span id="s943">A monk escaped from the back while the gestapo was in the front and was able to warn Father Bruno who kept a small apartment to do his work in Brussels.</span> <span id="s944">Father Bruno instead of going underground exchanged his cassock for secular clothes and continued doing his work until the end of the war.</span> <span id="s945">He survived and he died in 1981 at the age of 78.</span> <span id="s946">There is a monument in Utinyey[ph123] the town where he died, Utinyey[ph123], Belgium in honor for him.</span> <span id="s947">There is also a tree and plaque for him at Yad Vashem in the Alley of the Righteous.</span> <span id="s948">Not only did Father Bruno hide me but Father Bruno--after liberation I was working in a soap factory to help my mother feed my two sisters-- came to visit and when he found out that I was working instead of going to school, asked me if I wanted to go to school.</span> <span id="s949">I said of course but I can't, I have to help Mama feed the kids.</span> <span id="s950">And he spoke to my mother and he offered to bring more food just so I could go to school.</span> <span id="s951">He enrolled me in a Catholic School.</span> <span id="s952">Even though at that time I already knew catechism very well he gave strict instructions that I should be excused when catechism was taught.</span> <span id="s953">In addition to that he paid for private piano lessons and they would let me practice in the convent which was across the street from the school.</span> <span id="s954">They would leave the door unlatched in the morning before school and I would go in there and practice piano.</span> <span id="s955">He also paid for typing lessons.</span> <span id="s956">And to this day when I type, I say thank you Father Bruno because I'm a very good typist.</span> <span id="s957">He also paid for Art classes, extra-curricular Art classes.</span> <span id="s958">It was incredible that he wanted to continue that.</span> <span id="s959">Also from what I understand, what I found out after the war and had confirmed several times, the children who did not have a parent or parents to come back to after the war, what he did - instead of leaving them in the monasteries to become good Christians, he took them out and handed them over to the Jewish agencies.</span> <span id="s960">In other words, these are your children, you take them.</span> <span id="s961">That was Father Bruno, a real Saint.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Tsadik.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Yeah, Tsadik.</span> <span id="s964">So was the Mother Superior, Marie Chrysostome, the head of the monastery, and Sister Odonia, and Mssr.</span> <span id="s965">Ranson, and the principal whose name I don't remember.</span> <span id="s966">I just found out the name also of the woman who took us to the train.</span> <span id="s967">I never knew her name until the last few weeks.</span> <span id="s968">In fact I have to call Michel Reynders in Denver.</span> <span id="s969">Hopefully he'll know whether she's still alive or not.</span> <span id="s970">If she's alive, I'm going to go back to Belgium and thank her.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Are there any other incidents or episodes during the time that you were.......?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Oh there were several.</span> <span id="s973">Between Etterbeek and having gone to Ruisselede, another person had jumped the train and had come back to Brussels.</span> <span id="s974">His name was Appel.</span> <span id="s975">Appel had been sort of a boarder in our apartment just before we had to wear the stars.</span> <span id="s976">He had lost a wife and four children in 1948.</span> <span id="s977">Exactly how he lost them I don't know but I know he did lose them to the Nazis.</span> <span id="s978">I remember him as being a very dour quiet sort of angry looking man.</span> <span id="s979">He always sat near the window almost in total silence.</span> <span id="s980">I remember disliking him because he was very unfriendly.</span> <span id="s981">Of course I learned later on why.</span> <span id="s982">You know, poor man, was so unfriendly.</span> <span id="s983">But anyway he was a boarder and it did help pay our rent a little bit.</span> <span id="s984">He was caught after we were in Brussels already.</span> <span id="s985">He knew where we had gone and so he knew where to find us.</span> <span id="s986">These things were sort of by word of mouth from one Jew to another.</span> <span id="s987">People ended up knowing where people were, where you could find people.</span> <span id="s988">He also jumped from a train and he did come and in touch with us.</span> <span id="s989">But there was absolutely not even space in the apartment because by that time my uncle and my aunt lived and the whole apartment was just two rooms.</span> <span id="s990">It was a real tiny apartment.</span> <span id="s991">We tried to find him another place.</span> <span id="s992">He was with us meanwhile.</span> <span id="s993">And then one morning he was gone and then he came back again and we were feeding him.</span> <span id="s994">He decided to find shelter in another building.</span> <span id="s995">That building was eventually bombed but he was outside the building when it was bombed.</span> <span id="s996">He then returned and he stayed in the bombed-out building figuring he was safe in a bombed out building because nobody knew him.</span> <span id="s997">He was pretty sick by then.</span> <span id="s998">So I was in charge of taking food to Mr. Appel.</span> <span id="s999">I remember I took food every day.</span> <span id="s1000">He was wrapped in his blanket.</span> <span id="s1001">At that point we asked him to come back to the apartment but he didn't want to.</span> <span id="s1002">He said it's better if he's there.</span> <span id="s1003">He's safer in the bombed out building.</span> <span id="s1004">All I know is one day when I went to take him the food his blanket was there but he was not.</span> <span id="s1005">And I've never seen him again.</span> <span id="s1006">So I don't know what happened to Mr. Appel.</span> <span id="s1007">And afterwards we went to Ruisselede.</span> <span id="s1008">We were liberated in Ruisselede.</span> <span id="s1009">We went back to Brussels.</span> <span id="s1010">My sisters stayed in the convent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Could you tell us when that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">That was in October of 1944.</span> <span id="s1013">We were liberated.</span> <span id="s1014">By the time it was safe it was around November.</span> <span id="s1015">In November my mother and I made our way on foot to Brussels.</span> <span id="s1016">We almost didn't make it because of the shooting and the bombing.</span> <span id="s1017">We got caught on the roads and everything.</span> <span id="s1018">But anyway we did make our way back to Brussels.</span> <span id="s1019">We didn't go back to the old apartment.</span> <span id="s1020">We found a place.</span> <span id="s1021">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1022">I think Mom might have gone back but found it totally emptied.</span> <span id="s1023">What happened was which I didn't tell you.</span> <span id="s1024">My mother went back to the apartment every day to bring food for my aunt and uncle and one night when she came there was a gestapo seal on the door.</span> <span id="s1025">They were gone.</span> <span id="s1026">Normally about two or three days after an apartment or a house was raided and people were taken away, they would come in with a truck and they would empty the apartment or the house.</span> <span id="s1027">It was called meublation[ph198].</span> <span id="s1028">What my mother did, she was incredible, she took the seal off, went in, took out the photographs and the bedding and left and put the seal back.</span> <span id="s1029">No-one else would have had the guts to do it but my Mama.</span> <span id="s1030">That's when the letter was written that I spoke about earlier.</span> <span id="s1031">So we made our way to Brussels after liberation and we found a small place to live.</span> <span id="s1032">We furnished it with crates and whatever we could find.</span> <span id="s1033">About four or five weeks later Mama managed to find some work and I was sent back to pick up my sisters from the convent.</span> <span id="s1034">Transportation was a little bit more back to normal by then.</span> <span id="s1035">We were able to come back by train.</span> <span id="s1036">So we came back to Brussels.</span> <span id="s1037">We enrolled the two kids back into the same public school that we had been in before we were put into hiding and I went to work.</span> <span id="s1038">And then Father Bruno came to visit.</span> <span id="s1039">He was already bringing us some food and I would visit him in his small apartment when he was there.</span> <span id="s1040">He stayed in Brussels so he could give all the kids back, get them back from all the different monasteries and give them back to Jewish agency.</span> <span id="s1041">He was incredible that way.</span> <span id="s1042">So he asked me if I wanted to go to school.</span> <span id="s1043">I said of course I want to go to school.</span> <span id="s1044">He asked my mother then, he said he'd like to enrol me in a school, he knows of a good school and she said well I can't, she has to help me feed the kids.</span> <span id="s1045">So he said, I'll bring you enough food.</span> <span id="s1046">He said, I'll bring you more food.</span> <span id="s1047">Let her go to school.</span> <span id="s1048">So my mother did.</span> <span id="s1049">And he enrolled me; it was a Catholic School.</span> <span id="s1050">And even though I knew catechism well already, he gave specific instructions that I would be excused from catechism.</span> <span id="s1051">In addition to that he paid for private piano lessons.</span> <span id="s1052">I didn't have a piano, of course, so I went to practice before school in the convent across the street from the school.</span> <span id="s1053">They left the door unlatched.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Can I ask you, at this point after you were liberated, did you have any contact with your father...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">No, not yet, not yet...</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Okay, so you didn't know.</span> <span id="s1057">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">At that point, no.</span> <span id="s1059">As a matter of fact what we learned afterwards, my father was very, very depressed.</span> <span id="s1060">He had come out of the army and he wasn't working for awhile.</span> <span id="s1061">He was just sort of laying around feeling life was not worth living because he was sure he had no wife and no kids because there was no way he felt that a woman and three babies could have survived.</span> <span id="s1062">Especially he knew that my mother had no money, she didn't have anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Where was he stationed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">He was stationed in Florida.</span> <span id="s1065">He had hoped to...that's how he became legalized and became a citizen.</span> <span id="s1066">He had hoped that he would be sent overseas, but they didn't.</span> <span id="s1067">He was - most of his army career was spent somewhere in Florida.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">When did he find out about you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">In 1945 through a British soldier who made inquiries through the Red Cross and everything.</span> <span id="s1070">As a matter of fact I have a photograph upstairs.</span> <span id="s1071">I'll bring it down to show it to you.</span> <span id="s1072">So what happened we realized that contact was made when one day the door bell rang, it was Christmas morning as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s1073">We were on the second floor and I ran down to open the door.</span> <span id="s1074">It was an American soldier standing there with a box like this and he says, Merry Christmas.</span> <span id="s1075">I didn't know what Merry Christmas meant.</span> <span id="s1076">Merry Christmas - and then leaves.</span> <span id="s1077">Just hands me this thing.</span> <span id="s1078">First he says, are you Flora Mendelo - is this the home of Fanny Mendelovicz?</span> <span id="s1079">I said, yes it is.</span> <span id="s1080">He says, okay Merry Christmas.</span> <span id="s1081">And took off.</span> <span id="s1082">And there I was with this big box.</span> <span id="s1083">We go upstairs.</span> <span id="s1084">There was a letter on the box, an envelope, taped to the top of the box.</span> <span id="s1085">I'll never forget Mama took off the envelope, didn't even look in the envelope, we looked first in the box.</span> <span id="s1086">It was filled with food, cans of Spam, I'll never forget, Spam.</span> <span id="s1087">We ate it though, everything, all kinds of food.</span> <span id="s1088">And the best part was a couple of bars of chocolate.</span> <span id="s1089">So we ate and we ate and we ate.</span> <span id="s1090">We were so sick, all of us.</span> <span id="s1091">We laid stretched out, we threw up, it was really....we overate.</span> <span id="s1092">We weren't used to having that much food.</span> <span id="s1093">We were so sick, I'll never forget it, especially me because I was a "chaza."</span> <span id="s1094">So that's what happened.</span> <span id="s1095">Then she opened the letter and it said we have been notified that you are the spouse and that there are three children who are the family of David Mendelovicz, Private whatever and we should present ourselves with that letter at the army headquarters.</span> <span id="s1096">So we did.</span> <span id="s1097">The first thing we got invited to a big Christmas party.</span> <span id="s1098">Meanwhile we had gone to a big Chanukah party because we met an Israeli soldier who was interested in me.</span> <span id="s1099">Of course I couldn't move without my mother so I went with her when somebody wanted to go with her and she came with me when somebody wanted to go with me.</span> <span id="s1100">But anyway we went to the Christmas party and everything.</span> <span id="s1101">And then the next thing Mom went to headquarters a couple of times and we were told that the army was going to provide us with transportation to the United States but for some reason they couldn't do it out of Antwerp, that it would be done in France.</span> <span id="s1102">But we had to make our way to Le Havre.</span> <span id="s1103">The one problem that we ran into is Mama had to get a passport, which was fine.</span> <span id="s1104">I was past fifteen.</span> <span id="s1105">I had to have my own passport.</span> <span id="s1106">I became a slight problem because the other two were on her passport so they were my father's children.</span> <span id="s1107">I had to be an individual so it created a few problems.</span> <span id="s1108">So they shelved[?</span> <span id="s1109">275] us.</span> <span id="s1110">They said, don't worry about it, they'll take care of it in Paris.</span> <span id="s1111">So we went to Paris.</span> <span id="s1112">In Paris they still didn't, they said, okay why don't you go to Le Havre, maybe they can take care of it there.</span> <span id="s1113">In Le Havre they still had a problem with my individual documents and they suggested that my mother leave me in Le Havre and that somebody would take care of me, somebody from the army, and when she got to New York to finish up.</span> <span id="s1114">But she said she's not going without, at this point, without the three children, you know.</span> <span id="s1115">And so they said, I'll tell you what, they were nice, it was right after the war like, you know things were crazy, this was 1946 by that time, you know time went by.</span> <span id="s1116">So he said, you know what, why don't you go on the ship.</span> <span id="s1117">If they give you a hard time in New York, worse comes to worse they'll hold her.</span> <span id="s1118">They let us on the ship.</span> <span id="s1119">We got to New York, they just didn't say anything because we didn't go through Ellis Island or anything like that because it was an army ship.</span> <span id="s1120">We came right into port and they just let us off the ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">What day did you come?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">We came May 29, 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Is there anything else that you'd like to add about your story that you didn't tell me now or we could keep it for our next meeting.</span> <span id="s1124">when we talk about your relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">If you want to keep it for our next meeting, I'll check up on the dates, double-check on the dates.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Okay, so for the time being I want to thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">You're welcome.</span> <span id="s1128">(Tape is turned off and then turned on again.)</span> <span id="s1129">One never realizes the little details that create problems, you know what they call cultural shock.</span> <span id="s1130">There we were on the ship.</span> <span id="s1131">And we had boarded late at night and the next morning we came into breakfast.</span> <span id="s1132">We were there with soldiers, with war brides, all kinds of people.</span> <span id="s1133">My mother was the oldest war bride.</span> <span id="s1134">They thought she was a war bride.</span> <span id="s1135">But anyway, people thought that I was the war bride and that my husband had brought my mother and my two sisters and everybody was very surprised.</span> <span id="s1136">When they found out it was my mother who was the soldier's wife they were even more surprised.</span> <span id="s1137">But anyway here we come down to breakfast and we sit down at these long tables that were lined up, don't forget it wasn't a luxury ship.</span> <span id="s1138">It was a luxury liner that had been converted to an army ship.</span> <span id="s1139">I still have a postcard somewhere of the ship, if you want to see it.</span> <span id="s1140">Well, anyhow, there I am sitting and I see something in my plate but it wasn't food.</span> <span id="s1141">It was a box; it was a little box.</span> <span id="s1142">My mother is looking at me and I'm looking at my mother, my sisters.</span> <span id="s1143">We were turning it and turning it, we didn't know what to do with it.</span> <span id="s1144">They were looking around and finally we see some soldiers tearing the box open very neatly, a line, other line, another line, folding it back, and pouring milk into the box.</span> <span id="s1145">And we thought that was the craziest thing.</span> <span id="s1146">How can you pour milk into paper.</span> <span id="s1147">Well, anyhow, we figure well we'll do the same thing.</span> <span id="s1148">Then we noticed, not only did they pour milk in, they started eating right out of the box, not from the plate.</span> <span id="s1149">We thought that was so stupid and so ridiculous.</span> <span id="s1150">But we did the same thing and that's how we made our acquaintance with our dry cold cereals.</span> <span id="s1151">I'll never forget it, we sat there looking at it.</span> <span id="s1152">And the other cultural thing is when I met my first Mello Roll in New York.</span> <span id="s1153">You know what a Mello Roll is?</span> <span id="s1154">It's an ice cream that comes wrapped in paper.</span> <span id="s1155">But there is no stick or anything and what you have to do is you have to push it up from the bottom.</span> <span id="s1156">But I didn't know.</span> <span id="s1157">I see this thing and since the one thing I had learned in the many convents I was in were good manners, I wasn't about to eat with my fingers.</span> <span id="s1158">So there I was sitting in a high school cafeteria where my husband had taken me, that's Jack, and everybody looking at me and he had ordered this ice cream for me, a Mello Roll, he didn't say it was ice cream.</span> <span id="s1159">And it's laying there and laying there.</span> <span id="s1160">And since I didn't have any utensils and I wasn't about to embarrass...I couldn't speak and that was enough, I wasn't about to embarrass myself with eating with my fingers.</span> <span id="s1161">As much as I was dying to have it, I left it on my plate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">That's funny, okay, anything else?</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">No, I don't really think so, except one little incident.</span> <span id="s1164">I went to high school and I remember the kids were laughing in class every time I opened my mouth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">In New York City?</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">In New York City.</span> <span id="s1167">I enrolled myself in Central Needle Trades High School.</span> <span id="s1168">I remember the kids laughing in class whenever I tried to open my mouth.</span> <span id="s1169">And one day I couldn't take it anymore.</span> <span id="s1170">I bust out crying and I ran out, sobbing, and I swore I was never going to walk into that classroom again.</span> <span id="s1171">And the teacher ran out into the hallway after me, took me around, consoled me, and took me back in.</span> <span id="s1172">From that talk it came out that I was determined to learn English.</span> <span id="s1173">Not only that, I'll never forget, I came back into class and I started screaming at everybody, I want to see if you talk French like I talk English, I'll laugh too.</span> <span id="s1174">I'll never forget that I screamed.</span> <span id="s1175">Well, the classroom was quiet, nobody ever laughed at me again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">That's right, you're right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">There were a few things over the years, like one of them when my son came home crying from school, the first grade, because I had a very strong accent yet at that time.</span> <span id="s1178">And he came home crying and he said, Mommy please when you come to school, don't talk because everybody says you talk funny.</span> <span id="s1179">Well at that point I really started to practice with a radio and listening carefully and working in front of a mirror to correct my accent.</span> <span id="s1180">Eventually I did become certified to teach English.</span> <span id="s1181">I don't know whether it's something I had to prove or what.</span> <span id="s1182">But I made my way.</span> <span id="s1183">I did leave high school after a while.</span> <span id="s1184">I had to leave because I had to go to work.</span> <span id="s1185">I had to help feed the family.</span> <span id="s1186">I never finished high school.</span> <span id="s1187">Never finished elementary school.</span> <span id="s1188">Never finished Junior High School.</span> <span id="s1189">I took an exam.</span> <span id="s1190">I got a diploma, GED by examination and I was allowed into college, actually on the dare of my son who was entering his first year of college then.</span> <span id="s1191">I had to show the kids that Mama wasn't going to back off and he said why don't you go get an education.</span> <span id="s1192">I knew I was going to fall flat on my face.</span> <span id="s1193">As it turned out I didn't totally although I was sitting at Montgomery College, I'll never forget.</span> <span id="s1194">I had gone to American U., spoke to someone there.</span> <span id="s1195">They gave me a stack of books to read and said come back in two months, I'll see if you're college material.</span> <span id="s1196">So I went back two months later.</span> <span id="s1197">Most of the books I had already read because I was teaching myself English at the library and apparently I had chosen good material, Classics.</span> <span id="s1198">So the person felt that yes I was college material and they'd be glad to enrol me, except being that my kid already started college for me to go to a private college...So I found out that Montgomery College existed.</span> <span id="s1199">So I went to Montgomery College and they let me in as a Special student.</span> <span id="s1200">I had to get a "C" or better.</span> <span id="s1201">I got A+ on my first paper.</span> <span id="s1202">I described the beach that's right out my window here in the fall.</span> <span id="s1203">It's gorgeous in the fall.</span> <span id="s1204">But anyway I got an A+.</span> <span id="s1205">I didn't know an adjective from an adverb and when they start discussing grammar I was totally lost because I had basically just photographed in my mind structure and paragraphs.</span> <span id="s1206">So I wrote well but I didn't know why.</span> <span id="s1207">I read and I understood but I had never really learned the grammar.</span> <span id="s1208">So there we were in class and the teacher asked some things and I didn't know and I raised my hand to ask questions.</span> <span id="s1209">There I was this old mature woman with nineteen year olds and I'll never forget this little frog came out of my mouth.</span> <span id="s1210">I just (croaking sound).</span> <span id="s1211">I could barely speak.</span> <span id="s1212">I was so embarrassed.</span> <span id="s1213">I kept quiet after a while.</span> <span id="s1214">I said to myself, what am I doing here, am I crazy, who needs this.</span> <span id="s1215">And I vowed that I wasn't going to come back again but being who I am, I did go back, went to the teacher and said, look this is my story, I don't know grammar.</span> <span id="s1216">She said, no, I can't believe that, not the way you write.</span> <span id="s1217">I said, I'm telling you, I don't understand what you're talking about.</span> <span id="s1218">She gave me her lunch hour, very nice.</span> <span id="s1219">I spent several weeks with her during her lunch hour.</span> <span id="s1220">She helped me understand grammar, gave me a couple of good grammar books to study, which I studied on my own.</span> <span id="s1221">And the rest is history.</span> <span id="s1222">From there I went on.</span> <span id="s1223">I was offered a scholarship to Maryland.</span> <span id="s1224">It was supposed to be on need so at the last minute someone else got it because Thank God, I didn't have the need.</span> <span id="s1225">Went to Maryland, graduated magna cum laude.</span> <span id="s1226">Did not intend to become a teacher but one of my teacher's said, well what are you going to do with your education?</span> <span id="s1227">I said well nothing because I was working with my husband at the time.</span> <span id="s1228">I said I just wanted an education.</span> <span id="s1229">I told her the story.</span> <span id="s1230">She said, " have you ever considered.....?</span> <span id="s1231">There are two things you'd be good at, public relations and teaching.</span> <span id="s1232">Have you ever considered?"</span> <span id="s1233">I said, " Well no, not really, I just want an education."</span> <span id="s1234">She said, "you never know in life, Flora, what would it hurt?</span> <span id="s1235">Why don't you get a degree in teaching?"</span> <span id="s1236">So I said, " well, what do I have to do?"</span> <span id="s1237">because at that point I had started English Lit and then I majored in French literature and civilization.</span> <span id="s1238">I said, " what do I have to do?"</span> <span id="s1239">She told me what I had to do and I said, "oh it's no big deal."</span> <span id="s1240">I went, took those courses with Dr. Lorenzo, I'll never forget it, and graduated with my BA, with a certificate to teach.</span> <span id="s1241">We were going on vacation.</span> <span id="s1242">I went out shopping.</span> <span id="s1243">Finally, I had time to go shopping for some clothes.</span> <span id="s1244">I come home.</span> <span id="s1245">The phone rings.</span> <span id="s1246">My husband's on the phone.</span> <span id="s1247">He says, "are you standing or sitting down."</span> <span id="s1248">I said, "who died, who's sick?"</span> <span id="s1249">He said, " does somebody always have to die or be sick?"</span> <span id="s1250">I said, "well, what is the matter."</span> <span id="s1251">He says, "do me a favor, sit down, I have something to tell you."</span> <span id="s1252">I sit down.</span> <span id="s1253">He says, "I just got a call from Maryland."</span> <span id="s1254">I said, "yes, is something wrong with my transcript, with my diploma, because it was just before the actual graduation ceremony."</span> <span id="s1255">He says, "no, they want to know if you want to come teach and go to graduate school.</span> <span id="s1256">They're also willing to waive the GREs."</span> <span id="s1257">I said, "what are the GREs?"</span> <span id="s1258">So they waived the GREs and I was invited to be an assistant.</span> <span id="s1259">I said "what shall I do, Jack?"</span> <span id="s1260">because he really didn't enjoy my going to school but he was supportive.</span> <span id="s1261">Because I was up typing at night and every time he wanted to go out with friends I had to say well, Jack, I have no time, blah, blah, blah.</span> <span id="s1262">Well, anyway to make a long story short he said, well you have no choice.</span> <span id="s1263">I had already taken a job as a tri-lingual tour guide.</span> <span id="s1264">But anyway, I turned down the other job.</span> <span id="s1265">He felt that I had no choice, I had to do it.</span> <span id="s1266">I said, what about you?</span> <span id="s1267">He said, I'll survive it.</span> <span id="s1268">And he's really been my best friend and supporter.</span> <span id="s1269">So I went to Graduate School, got my Master's, finished, taught.</span> <span id="s1270">You said about Baltimore.</span> <span id="s1271">They offered me a job in Baltimore because the French Department had gone downhill and they thought I could build it up again.</span> <span id="s1272">And I had accepted it but Jack started complaining.</span> <span id="s1273">What are you going to do in the wintertime?</span> <span id="s1274">You going to drive to Baltimore in the snow and everything.</span> <span id="s1275">And he nudged me.</span> <span id="s1276">He said, it's not like you have to feed ten kids anymore and all.</span> <span id="s1277">He nudged me so much that I finally called the dean and let him know.</span> <span id="s1278">He understood.</span> <span id="s1279">He was sorry.</span> <span id="s1280">He understood.</span> <span id="s1281">And then I went to visit my Mom who was at the time in Florida.</span> <span id="s1282">I get a phone call in Florida.</span> <span id="s1283">Flora, there's a job open in Montgomery County.</span> <span id="s1284">They need a French teacher, how would you like it?</span> <span id="s1285">I said, what level.</span> <span id="s1286">He said, high school.</span> <span id="s1287">I said, you're crazy, me teach.....at that point I was a big shot, I taught at college, why should I go teach high....me teach high school, you're crazy.</span> <span id="s1288">Well, he says, you know, you might want to try it, you haven't tried that yet.</span> <span id="s1289">So I came home, wrote resumes to several.....and I went to Einstein High School and I liked the idea of having kids and knowing their names because in college, one semester and they're out.</span> <span id="s1290">And the rest is history.</span> <span id="s1291">I've been with Montgomery County ever since.</span> <span id="s1292">Then I went back for a year to Maryland.</span> <span id="s1293">I was under the sponsorship of Montgomery County and the university.</span> <span id="s1294">Taught for a year in the Honors Department, not French.</span> <span id="s1295">It was called a Learning Community.</span> <span id="s1296">But I had my own agenda.</span> <span id="s1297">I was able to incorporate the Holocaust and all that because I taught Victor Frankel, "Search for Meaning," "Nature of Man," "People in Society."</span> <span id="s1298">I had a ball.</span> <span id="s1299">It was fantastic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Really.</span> <span id="s1302">It was really great, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Well I'm glad you could participate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Good.</span> <span id="s1305">This is good stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">All right, thanks.</span></p></body></html>
