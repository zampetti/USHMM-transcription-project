States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ruth Heiman, conducted by Agatha Lysis (ph.) on the 16th of October at the Kindertransport Association conference in Arlington, Virginia.</span> <span id="s13">I apologize in advance that you would have to repeat, but we will just -- now that I've heard more, maybe it will even be more helpful that I can direct questions in a way --</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Answer: Okay.</span> <span id="s15">My name is Ruth Heiman.</span> <span id="s16">You know that already.</span> <span id="s17">I was born December 31, 1923, at 7:00 in the evening, five hours before 1924; tax deduction, exactly nine months after my parents got married.</span> <span id="s18">My mother was -- my parents had a textile business.</span> <span id="s19">My uncles -- I had -- my father had several brothers.</span> <span id="s20">It's a large family, and they had a wholesale business.</span> <span id="s21">And my father, who was totally disinterested in business -- I had to go back to that -- however, they set him up in the textile business.</span> <span id="s22">And we lived comfortable, but no comparison to my uncles who were all very wealthy.</span> <span id="s23">And my father was, by nature, highly musical, would have liked to be a musician, which was out of the question.</span> <span id="s24">And as I mentioned before, he had been in America before the war.</span> <span id="s25">At the age of 18, he had come to America like some of his brothers.</span> <span id="s26">Were in LouisianA: I don't know for how long.</span> <span id="s27">And when World War I broke out, his brothers insisted he come back to Germany.</span> <span id="s28">If you refuse -- and they said if you refuse, then you will not belong to our family anymore.</span> <span id="s29">He went back, married my mother who had a profession, which was unusual for women.</span> <span id="s30">She was a chemist and worked for the Germany equivalency of General Electric, it was called IB, until she got married, and then she always worked.</span> <span id="s31">My mother always worked.</span> <span id="s32">We had a business, she worked in the business.</span> <span id="s33">Very strong, very strong, very powerful woman.</span> <span id="s34">As I say, most women were much stronger and more able to cope than men.</span> <span id="s35">And my childhood, as such, was quite pleasant, until I was about 5 -- until I was about 10 years old.</span> <span id="s36">And even then, our parents protected us to the umpteenth degree.</span> <span id="s37">We really didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s38">They kept -- I knew from nothing.</span> <span id="s39">To the extent that -- I don't know if it's right or wrong.</span> <span id="s40">Today you would probably consider it wrong.</span> <span id="s41">At that time, it was the thing to do.</span> <span id="s42">You didn't talk to your children about -- I know we covered the telephone.</span> <span id="s43">We thought somebody was listening in.</span> <span id="s44">This was in the late '30s.</span> <span id="s45">And I went to a German grade school, and the teacher was very anti-Nazi.</span> <span id="s46">I think because they told them that songs which were forbidden, famous song, and had two children who they sent to Switzerland; so they would not have to go into the Germany Hitler Youth Movement.</span> <span id="s47">But Nuremberg was extremely antisemitic always.</span> <span id="s48">And I was -- since my father had been in the World War I and fought at the front, I was -- the Jewish children whose parents fought, their fathers fought in the front, they were allowed to go to German high school.</span> <span id="s49">I refused to go, because I knew what was going on more than my parents.</span> <span id="s50">All of my friends went to the Jewish high school, which was very difficult to get into.</span> <span id="s51">You had to pass an exam.</span> <span id="s52">I don't know how I did it.</span> <span id="s53">I copied somebody else's notes.</span> <span id="s54">Got in when I was 10 years old and managed to graduate.</span> <span id="s55">We were forced to graduate with an equivalency of a high school exam at the age of 15.</span> <span id="s56">That is when schools shut down.</span> <span id="s57">It was a very orthodox school, where I learned -- we had Hebrew every day.</span> <span id="s58">I learned nothing.</span> <span id="s59">I had a good life.</span> <span id="s60">I had a good social life there.</span> <span id="s61">And then somehow or other, I got to -- my parents got me on the Kindertransport.</span> <span id="s62">I remember my father coming to Berlin and saying, you are going to immigrate to England.</span> <span id="s63">Sounded great to me.</span> <span id="s64">Anything to get out at that time.</span> <span id="s65">Berlin was not as bad as Nuremberg, because, of course, there was more of an international community there.</span> <span id="s66">So I was sent to England on a ship.</span> <span id="s67">I remember, as I said, being on the -- my mother pushed me on the train.</span> <span id="s68">That was it.</span> <span id="s69">Nothing told -- all she said, you forgot your washcloth.</span> <span id="s70">Got on the train with a bunch of other kids.</span> <span id="s71">And the Nazi officer came through just before we got to the Dutch border.</span> <span id="s72">And he said -- I had a watch, a very cheap watch.</span> <span id="s73">And he said, a Jewish kid doesn't need a watch, and he took my watch.</span> <span id="s74">I had nothing.</span> <span id="s75">We got to Holland.</span> <span id="s76">They gave us hot chocolate.</span> <span id="s77">Some people can remember the ship.</span> <span id="s78">I have no recollections of how I ended up in London where I was taken in by a Jewish family arranged through relatives my mother had in England, I think, who were pretty poor.</span> <span id="s79">They were -- the woman, she was a young woman, very volatile.</span> <span id="s80">One minute she would hug me and kiss me, the next minute she'd hit me.</span> <span id="s81">And she had a little boy.</span> <span id="s82">I took care of him.</span> <span id="s83">I used to -- now he calls me all the time.</span> <span id="s84">Now he is 70.</span> <span id="s85">We are still in touch.</span> <span id="s86">He called me.</span> <span id="s87">He got in touch with me, I have to add, ten years ago.</span> <span id="s88">He wanted to know what happened.</span> <span id="s89">I don't discuss this thing.</span> <span id="s90">I don't discuss it.</span> <span id="s91">And I lived with him for a year and a half until I was interned at the Isle of Man.</span> <span id="s92">Because I was 15 when Holland and Belgium and France were invaded, and we were considered enemy aliens.</span> <span id="s93">And I was not yet 16.</span> <span id="s94">So we had to pass a tribunal at the age of 16.</span> <span id="s95">I was -- I don't know how I got there.</span> <span id="s96">I was at the Isle of Man, which was an interesting experience in itself.</span> <span id="s97">I was there for nine months.</span> <span id="s98">You want me to tell the story?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: It's about the spy.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: That's okay.</span> <span id="s102">If you could, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: We were put up in a hotel.</span> <span id="s104">And we had a house committee.</span> <span id="s105">Of course, I thought it was fantastic.</span> <span id="s106">I was there.</span> <span id="s107">I was 16 years old.</span> <span id="s108">I didn't have to do a thing.</span> <span id="s109">Read all day long, went to the beach, had a good time.</span> <span id="s110">And the food wasn't bad.</span> <span id="s111">We were not being bombed.</span> <span id="s112">And there is a place on the Isle of Man, there's a holiday camp.</span> <span id="s113">It's a resort areA: And they had stationed German nuns there.</span> <span id="s114">German nuns were interned there, I think about 19 or 20.</span> <span id="s115">And they all had separate camps, because they were very devout nuns.</span> <span id="s116">They were all completely covered.</span> <span id="s117">And for the fun of it, we used to count them every morning.</span> <span id="s118">They were praying every morning on the beach.</span> <span id="s119">And to backtrack, when I was -- I remember lights coming, flickering back and forth at night.</span> <span id="s120">And I mentioned it to somebody that I see these lights all the time.</span> <span id="s121">It must be -- are they German ships, or are they British search lights or whatever.</span> <span id="s122">Nobody took any notice.</span> <span id="s123">I don't know what happened.</span> <span id="s124">But one day I saw, instead of 20 nuns, there were only 19.</span> <span id="s125">So what happened to the other nun.</span> <span id="s126">There's a nun missing.</span> <span id="s127">And it turned out, that particular nun, I found that out only much later after I was released, a German spy had parachuted.</span> <span id="s128">They used to parachute.</span> <span id="s129">This was in the early '40s.</span> <span id="s130">They parachuted spies into England and disguised as whatever.</span> <span id="s131">This guy was disguised as a nun and tried to get off the Isle of Man by signaling to Ireland.</span> <span id="s132">And a week later, I was released.</span> <span id="s133">I was not told why.</span> <span id="s134">But I only found out later, I don't remember how, that he was a spy, and he was frantic trying to get out.</span> <span id="s135">So that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Could you please tell us a little bit about your earlier life in Germany, and maybe also about any anti-Semitism that you personally experienced or that you witnessed.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: I experienced a lot of anti-Semitism pretty early on, as I said.</span> <span id="s138">I had very curly, very kinky hair.</span> <span id="s139">They called it Juden Haare.</span> <span id="s140">My brother, who did not have it, didn't have any problem at all, because he had -- he was rather Slavic looking.</span> <span id="s141">And he could have easily passed for the Hitler youth, while I did not.</span> <span id="s142">And I remember walking out very often having rocks thrown at me.</span> <span id="s143">However, I had good German friends whose parents -- I was invited to birthday parties.</span> <span id="s144">All this stopped around 1934.</span> <span id="s145">Then people got scared.</span> <span id="s146">You know, they wouldn't -- I still have pictures of birthday parties where I was invited, and there was -- we had carnival.</span> <span id="s147">We were dressed up in costume and stuff.</span> <span id="s148">I have pictures of that with my German friends.</span> <span id="s149">And that stopped around 1934, '35, because the parents actually got scared, except one.</span> <span id="s150">We had a family living -- we lived in an apartment house, had a big apartment.</span> <span id="s151">My parents and my uncle lived with us.</span> <span id="s152">There was a family, he was a count.</span> <span id="s153">And they were pretty decent.</span> <span id="s154">I think, if I remember, they did invite us and talked to my parents and didn't greet us with "Heil Hitler".</span> <span id="s155">But I was more aware -- I don't think I was more aware, but I was anxious not to go to a German school and forced my parents to send me to a Jewish school by the simple method -- I was 10 years old.</span> <span id="s156">I drank a whole bottle of castor oil on the day of the exam.</span> <span id="s157">That way I don't have to go.</span> <span id="s158">I did not take the exam.</span> <span id="s159">Because you had to pass an exam to go to high school.</span> <span id="s160">And in Germany, you went to high school at age 10 for six years.</span> <span id="s161">I went to this Jewish high school, where my grades were very mediocre, except in sports and in socializing.</span> <span id="s162">And I belonged to a Jewish youth group in Berlin, and we had a great time, because we stayed enclosed, you know.</span> <span id="s163">We were very much protected by our parents.</span> <span id="s164">As far as possible they protected us.</span> <span id="s165">However, children realize things that they don't tell their parents either.</span> <span id="s166">We tried to protect our parents, too.</span> <span id="s167">My brother was too young.</span> <span id="s168">I don't remember much.</span> <span id="s169">He was just a nuisance, as far as I'm concerned, at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: And what do you think that you might have noticed that your parents weren't seeing as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: That were what?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Do you have an example of something you feel that you were noticing that maybe you were saying that you were protecting your parents a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Yes, by not telling them that people attacked me on the street.</span> <span id="s174">I didn't tell them that.</span> <span id="s175">I found another way of going.</span> <span id="s176">I did not tell them that I read Der Sturmer, whichever.</span> <span id="s177">I was an avid reader, in fact, to the extent that I was told by my mother, stop that incessant reading and do something.</span> <span id="s178">So I bought a Sturmer or I found a Sturmer, and I hid it, and I read it.</span> <span id="s179">And it was totally the most horrendous thing.</span> <span id="s180">And as I said, to this day, I cannot understand how a people of so-called literate, cultured people can read pornographic stuff like that.</span> <span id="s181">There was somebody in our community, I don't -- I only remember the name.</span> <span id="s182">His name was Katzenberger, was accused of Rassenschande because he had a Chekhov girlfriend.</span> <span id="s183">And what happened to him, I don't know, something rather awful.</span> <span id="s184">And all of this was in Der Sturmer.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Can you talk about your brother a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s187">My brother was -- he was 3 years younger than I was, very attached to me.</span> <span id="s188">To me he was a nuisance, because he read my diary.</span> <span id="s189">And he was sent to -- I was already in England when I found out.</span> <span id="s190">But after the war broke out, they managed to -- my parents managed to get him out to Palestine, where I have my uncle and my aunt and my mother's brother lived and my cousin.</span> <span id="s191">All our relatives were in Palestine already, the ones who had survived.</span> <span id="s192">And he told me this only later on.</span> <span id="s193">He was sent -- he and two other children, ages 12, 11 and 13, he was 12 years old, were put on a train to Trieste, where they were supposed to get a ship to Palestine.</span> <span id="s194">And when they got to Trieste, the ship wasn't there.</span> <span id="s195">I ask him, this is not long ago, a few years ago, what did you do.</span> <span id="s196">He said, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s197">They must have wandered the streets of Trieste.</span> <span id="s198">I don't know what they did.</span> <span id="s199">After about three or four days, the ship came.</span> <span id="s200">They got on the ship.</span> <span id="s201">He told me, nothing -- he has no recollection of it.</span> <span id="s202">And all of the letters that my parents wrote, he has them.</span> <span id="s203">Now, I have to say, what I do now, as a volunteer, I work for the -- I do translations for the Leo Baeck Institute.</span> <span id="s204">And presently, I'm also going to have -- I just finished a lot of translations for a pastor minister in Germany who published pamphlets for small towns, what happened for Jews who lived there from the 12th Century on, just background of this particular village, and I translated all of that into English.</span> <span id="s205">That is what I'm doing at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: That's great.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: They asked me to come to Germany next year to see -- for the publication.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Oh, that's great.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: I got a little sidetracked.</span> <span id="s210">What were we talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: About your brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: About my brother, yes.</span> <span id="s213">He has the letters of my parents, which I could have -- should have translated.</span> <span id="s214">I can't do it.</span> <span id="s215">He speaks English fluently.</span> <span id="s216">So he can handle this.</span> <span id="s217">I left it to him.</span> <span id="s218">I never discuss this with my -- I never showed it to my children.</span> <span id="s219">They couldn't read it anyway.</span> <span id="s220">They are in German.</span> <span id="s221">But I did read two letters from my mother.</span> <span id="s222">That was all.</span> <span id="s223">When I was -- about 1939, '40, they wrote to these people very concerned about me, because I was 15 years old, what would happen to me.</span> <span id="s224">And also, I was at a very vulnerable age.</span> <span id="s225">What kind of trouble can I get into.</span> <span id="s226">In fact, I was sent to America with the following sex education.</span> <span id="s227">When you go out with a boy, keep walking, and don't sit down.</span> <span id="s228">That was it.</span> <span id="s229">That's all.</span> <span id="s230">That's all I learned.</span> <span id="s231">And that came in very handy.</span> <span id="s232">After Dunkirk, I met a young guy who was from Vienna, and we went out.</span> <span id="s233">We went to the park, and we sat on the bench.</span> <span id="s234">And then, I found out what they were talking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s236">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: That was my sex education.</span> <span id="s238">That was, to me, unforgivable how little we knew.</span> <span id="s239">You know, that was those days, just not good enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: And then my parents, I found out my parents were deported very early on.</span> <span id="s242">And I didn't tell anybody.</span> <span id="s243">I had -- my mother had a cousin in Sweden.</span> <span id="s244">And I don't remember, I think he wrote.</span> <span id="s245">He told my aunt, who was my mother's aunt, my great aunt what happened.</span> <span id="s246">He found out that my parents were deported immediately to Sobibor and that they were gassed within three weeks after they got there.</span> <span id="s247">And I didn't tell anybody because I could not, simply cannot handle, and not to this day, any kind of pity.</span> <span id="s248">I didn't want any -- this is my business, you know.</span> <span id="s249">My brother is the same way.</span> <span id="s250">My brother and my sister-in-law, they lost a son in the war, in the Lebanese war.</span> <span id="s251">My sister-in-law, who was Hungarian descent, was able to really let go, and he didn't.</span> <span id="s252">We're just too inhibited, to this day.</span> <span id="s253">So be it.</span> <span id="s254">It's nothing.</span> <span id="s255">I don't apologize for it.</span> <span id="s256">You know that is how we were made, in a way, how we were brought up.</span> <span id="s257">Pretty unemotional, which made it difficult, but also was a help at times.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: And do you -- maybe you don't remember if we had talked about it -- if you remember the Kindertransport?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: The Kindertransport, yeah, I remember coming to England.</span> <span id="s260">You know, the people who took me in, they were, in a way, they were very -- I spoke very little -- very little; I spoke no English.</span> <span id="s261">I spoke whatever English I learned in school.</span> <span id="s262">And they invited people, young people to the house who lived nearby so that I learned English.</span> <span id="s263">And I learned English by playing Monopoly and not speaking a single -- nobody spoke German.</span> <span id="s264">They took me to the movies, and that was How Green was My Valley, and within six months I spoke English.</span> <span id="s265">I was sent to a school.</span> <span id="s266">In England, you went to a private school.</span> <span id="s267">You didn't go to public school.</span> <span id="s268">Of course, there was no money.</span> <span id="s269">However, there was -- school was impossible.</span> <span id="s270">You could get a teacher certificate by finishing high school.</span> <span id="s271">And I went to a school, Pitkin (ph.).</span> <span id="s272">I got a uniform, and I got a hat and a uniform, the whole bit.</span> <span id="s273">And I met a young girl there who became my friend and whose parents owned a pub.</span> <span id="s274">And we've been friends.</span> <span id="s275">We were friends all our lives until she died last year.</span> <span id="s276">And I do remember, they were talking -- the first two or three weeks I was in school, they were talking about somebody called Enemy.</span> <span id="s277">Now, my cousin's name was Anime (ph.).</span> <span id="s278">And I said, why do they keep talking about Anime, Anime.</span> <span id="s279">That was the only word I understood.</span> <span id="s280">But within six months, I spoke fluent English, and until I came to America, I spoke English without an accent, with a British accident.</span> <span id="s281">I said buttuh instead of butter.</span> <span id="s282">That was my -- the people were not bad.</span> <span id="s283">It was okay.</span> <span id="s284">But I was always the outsider, no question about it.</span> <span id="s285">And they always -- and people started feeling sorry for me.</span> <span id="s286">And many years later, when I went back to England with my husband after my children were grown, I bought all new clothes.</span> <span id="s287">I wore all the jewelry I had, which wasn't a lot, to show that I made it.</span> <span id="s288">And there were -- because I felt so inferior, and they had -- the people I lived with after I came out of the internment camp, was the sister of the woman before, which was very strict, very clean and very neat.</span> <span id="s289">They had three daughters, one my age and twins who were two years younger.</span> <span id="s290">One was deaf.</span> <span id="s291">So I had -- she was totally deaf.</span> <span id="s292">But they were pretty good.</span> <span id="s293">The husband was very compassionate.</span> <span id="s294">The wife less so.</span> <span id="s295">She was very demanding.</span> <span id="s296">But I learned a lot.</span> <span id="s297">I learned how to be a marvelous house cleaner, best cleaner in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Do you want to talk a little bit more about your time on the Isle of Man?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: The Isle of Man, yes.</span> <span id="s300">The house committee, the story of the house committee.</span> <span id="s301">Ms. Brahms, I think her name was Abraham, she became Ms. Brahms, called me one day.</span> <span id="s302">Oh, there was another story.</span> <span id="s303">I was by far the youngest.</span> <span id="s304">I was six years younger than the next young woman.</span> <span id="s305">There were only women there.</span> <span id="s306">And there was two women who were always fighting.</span> <span id="s307">One was from Vienna, and the other one was from Berlin.</span> <span id="s308">I found out afterwards they were prostitutes.</span> <span id="s309">And I got sick.</span> <span id="s310">I had the flu.</span> <span id="s311">And these women were desperate for children.</span> <span id="s312">They wanted to take care of me.</span> <span id="s313">So they both came, and they came with a hot water bottle.</span> <span id="s314">One came with hot water.</span> <span id="s315">And they were screaming and fighting.</span> <span id="s316">I was lying in bed pretty sick.</span> <span id="s317">I think I had flu.</span> <span id="s318">And one opens the hot water bottle and pours the water over the other one.</span> <span id="s319">But I recovered and recuperated.</span> <span id="s320">I was like a pet to them really, so.</span> <span id="s321">And life wasn't bad on the Isle of Man.</span> <span id="s322">And then I came back to London.</span> <span id="s323">I started working first in dressmaking, supposed to be a dressmaker.</span> <span id="s324">Totally unsuitable for it.</span> <span id="s325">Totally hated it.</span> <span id="s326">And then got a job.</span> <span id="s327">I wanted to go -- oh, yes.</span> <span id="s328">I wanted to go to the ATS, but I wasn't old enough.</span> <span id="s329">I was 17.</span> <span id="s330">They had a girl's training course, something.</span> <span id="s331">However, for some reason, my relatives wouldn't let me.</span> <span id="s332">I don't know what say they had over the matter.</span> <span id="s333">No, you can't go to the ATS, too many men around or whatever.</span> <span id="s334">So I ended up in a factory working four years, and I did a good job.</span> <span id="s335">I started out as a toolmaker's helper.</span> <span id="s336">And then one day I was promoted to a very big machine that had just arrived from America, a milling machine came from Pittsburgh, size of this room.</span> <span id="s337">And I was making little blocks.</span> <span id="s338">And I got a wide apron, learning how to do this.</span> <span id="s339">I was 18 years old.</span> <span id="s340">And they had a minister of -- the war minister, and they were showing him the factory.</span> <span id="s341">Ms. Heiman, will you demonstrate the milling machine.</span> <span id="s342">I demonstrated the milling machine showing off, put my finger right through it and cut off half my finger.</span> <span id="s343">I still have no sensation.</span> <span id="s344">So after that, I couldn't work for a while on the machinery, because I could only use one hand.</span> <span id="s345">So they put me on sorting out stuff with old people of 30 and 40, and I worked.</span> <span id="s346">And then I was promoted.</span> <span id="s347">I became -- I'm not that stupid; so I don't have to sit there all day.</span> <span id="s348">I became an instrument inspector.</span> <span id="s349">And we made something to do, put into planes, airplanes.</span> <span id="s350">And I worked there for close to 60 hours a week with overtime.</span> <span id="s351">Not bad.</span> <span id="s352">Made good friends.</span> <span id="s353">Learned a lot about life from ordinary people, very, very ordinary people and had very -- I always say, my best friends were the British, the ordinary working class people.</span> <span id="s354">They were kind.</span> <span id="s355">They didn't question me about my background.</span> <span id="s356">They were never judgmental.</span> <span id="s357">And if it hadn't been -- if I hadn't met my husband, I would still be in England.</span> <span id="s358">I would now be an English woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: And can you tell me the story of how you met your husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s361">My husband -- as I say, no nice girl went out with an America, you know.</span> <span id="s362">They had a reputation.</span> <span id="s363">They were called overpaid, over here and oversexed.</span> <span id="s364">So you didn't go out.</span> <span id="s365">You know, you had to be introduced.</span> <span id="s366">You had to be very careful.</span> <span id="s367">And my husband was -- I had two cousins who were distant relatives of mine.</span> <span id="s368">I met one when they came.</span> <span id="s369">They were stationed in London.</span> <span id="s370">And I met Marty.</span> <span id="s371">He was ten years older than I was.</span> <span id="s372">He knew me because he was 14 when I was 4, but I didn't know him.</span> <span id="s373">And his family had given him my address, and we met.</span> <span id="s374">And that's another story.</span> <span id="s375">Piccadilly was an American -- a club for the American soldiers, and there was a newsstand there.</span> <span id="s376">And I'm standing there waiting for Martin.</span> <span id="s377">I didn't know what he looked like.</span> <span id="s378">The lady who owned the newsstand said, you can't stand there.</span> <span id="s379">I said, why not.</span> <span id="s380">It's somebody else's stand.</span> <span id="s381">I said, I have a right like anybody else.</span> <span id="s382">I didn't know that Piccadilly was a place especially for prostitutes.</span> <span id="s383">So she said, young lady, I'll advise you; move.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Oh, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: And I don't know.</span> <span id="s386">I met him.</span> <span id="s387">Somehow we met.</span> <span id="s388">And we only spent a few days together because he was sent overseas.</span> <span id="s389">That was it.</span> <span id="s390">And then he wrote me during the war.</span> <span id="s391">We kept in touch, but I had another boyfriend.</span> <span id="s392">He was engaged to somebody else.</span> <span id="s393">That's a long -- he was engaged to a girl in ArgentinA: I had a boyfriend in England, but that broke up.</span> <span id="s394">And we got -- he got -- we came to AmericA: We couldn't get a ship because we were called GI issues.</span> <span id="s395">We were only fiances.</span> <span id="s396">On the same ship came -- we came over on a ship and landed here January 1, 1947, they had a bunch of German war brides who had children who were already married to Americans.</span> <span id="s397">And there were the British girls and the German girls.</span> <span id="s398">They had to separate us.</span> <span id="s399">Fights broke out.</span> <span id="s400">We were furious that they let the Germans on while we had to wait for a year to get to America, while the Germans came.</span> <span id="s401">So that was quite a to-do.</span> <span id="s402">And the ship, I remember the steward said to us, young ladies, you don't know what you are in for.</span> <span id="s403">I take as many of you back as I bring over.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Oh, wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: It happened very frequently.</span> <span id="s406">I met one guy, I met a man, a soldier from Kentucky.</span> <span id="s407">And he couldn't read or write.</span> <span id="s408">He said, the first time he had ever worn shoes was in the Army.</span> <span id="s409">So these young girls from England, they all looked alike, and they all had money.</span> <span id="s410">So that was -- and I came here, and my parents owned -- my parents-in-law -- my father-in-law was a cousin of my father.</span> <span id="s411">And they owned a chicken farm in New Jersey, in Lakewood.</span> <span id="s412">And we came here.</span> <span id="s413">We got married in March '47.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Could you talk a little bit about the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: About what?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: About the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: The war, yes.</span> <span id="s418">It was, at times, it was frightening.</span> <span id="s419">I remember, I was not there.</span> <span id="s420">I missed most of the blitz.</span> <span id="s421">However, the British were always very calm.</span> <span id="s422">And I remember the outbreak of the war, where we lived, I lived with this family Robinson.</span> <span id="s423">Across the street lived a family, a man and a wife, called Atkinson.</span> <span id="s424">And the British were very calm.</span> <span id="s425">Nothing ever shook them.</span> <span id="s426">And on the -- I think it was the 3rd of September, when the war broke out, I was sick.</span> <span id="s427">I threw up, and I came back.</span> <span id="s428">Everybody, let's have a cup of teA: And Mr. and Mrs. Atkinson came over and sat down to have tea, very calm.</span> <span id="s429">And Mrs. Atkinson had a coat on.</span> <span id="s430">And she opened her coat, and she was totally nude.</span> <span id="s431">She was a nudist.</span> <span id="s432">They were nudists, and she forgot to get dressed.</span> <span id="s433">That is how they show their excitement.</span> <span id="s434">I remember, she quickly went like that.</span> <span id="s435">She had forgotten to get dressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: That was the outbreak of the war.</span> <span id="s438">And another scary thing, I was out on a date, also with a distant relative, a cousin, an American officer.</span> <span id="s439">We were in London in Leicester Square.</span> <span id="s440">Now, I saw subways here like that, with an enormous long escalator.</span> <span id="s441">We were going up an escalator.</span> <span id="s442">Air raid siren had just stopped, and another one started.</span> <span id="s443">And that's the only time I saw British panic, the people were going up the escalator, other people going down.</span> <span id="s444">Everybody fell backward.</span> <span id="s445">And fortunately, this guy held up ten people.</span> <span id="s446">Otherwise, we would have all been killed.</span> <span id="s447">We did have a shelter in the house, a table like this, a heavy table.</span> <span id="s448">We were supposed to sit under the table.</span> <span id="s449">And the children were evacuated.</span> <span id="s450">I was not evacuated.</span> <span id="s451">I didn't want to.</span> <span id="s452">I was old enough.</span> <span id="s453">I stayed in London, on the outskirts.</span> <span id="s454">You know, it was scary.</span> <span id="s455">And I remember, the Robinsons, whose original name was Robinowitz, said at the big outbreak of the war, if the Nazis -- if the Germans set foot in England, we're going to turn on the gas.</span> <span id="s456">That I remember.</span> <span id="s457">We did not starve.</span> <span id="s458">We had enough food.</span> <span id="s459">Except, I weighed 30 pounds more then than I do now, because we ate a lot of bread and potatoes.</span> <span id="s460">And since I worked in a factory, we got extra rations.</span> <span id="s461">I got extra rations.</span> <span id="s462">And we got food rations, coupons, and clothing coupons.</span> <span id="s463">I sold my clothing coupons for sweets.</span> <span id="s464">I'd rather having candy than clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: That's a good ideA: I think I would do that, too.</span> <span id="s466">Maybe then, let's then jump a little bit ahead to your life in the United States.</span> <span id="s467">Do you want to talk about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: I had a good life.</span> <span id="s469">I came, as I said, got married.</span> <span id="s470">We used my husband's pay to buy a house.</span> <span id="s471">It was impossible to get an apartment, and I had a good -- as I said, my uncle insisted that I come to Palestine, and my husband too, to see my brother and my family.</span> <span id="s472">And I was just married three months, and I left.</span> <span id="s473">I have all of the letters.</span> <span id="s474">That was not easy to be -- it was a long trip in those days to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s475">It was like three weeks.</span> <span id="s476">We had a change in Genua, stuff like that.</span> <span id="s477">And so I was gone.</span> <span id="s478">And then, when I came back, we -- my husband was in the spice business.</span> <span id="s479">He worked for a spice company.</span> <span id="s480">We had two children.</span> <span id="s481">My son is now 61 years old.</span> <span id="s482">My daughter is 58, and I have grown grandchildren.</span> <span id="s483">And we had a wonderful life until he died ten years ago.</span> <span id="s484">He was 83 when he died.</span> <span id="s485">He had a stroke.</span> <span id="s486">And we had a very good life together.</span> <span id="s487">What attracted me to him at the time was also as a father.</span> <span id="s488">He was very protective.</span> <span id="s489">He took care of everything.</span> <span id="s490">I felt -- I was very anxious that someone would take care of me, instead of having to take care of myself.</span> <span id="s491">And yet, I was still very independent.</span> <span id="s492">I got a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Your children or your grandchildren, do you talk about your experiences with them?</span> <span id="s494">A: My children, to some extent.</span> <span id="s495">My grandchildren, not at all.</span> <span id="s496">They don't even know.</span> <span id="s497">That is why I just bought a book.</span> <span id="s498">Not at all.</span> <span id="s499">Both of my grandsons live in Pittsburgh right now.</span> <span id="s500">One is a web designer, and the other one is going into physical therapy.</span> <span id="s501">Never.</span> <span id="s502">Even my daughter complained about the fact that I never talk about it.</span> <span id="s503">And she said, all I ever learned -- she was in Israel.</span> <span id="s504">She spent two years in Israel.</span> <span id="s505">And she said, everything I learned about what happened is from your brother, from my brother, not from me.</span> <span id="s506">I wanted to get on with my life.</span> <span id="s507">I did not want to dwell on the past.</span> <span id="s508">It was my fault up to a point, but I didn't want to.</span> <span id="s509">And my husband talked to them about it, but I didn't even tell him everything.</span> <span id="s510">That was my shtick.</span> <span id="s511">It was just too difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Thank you for sharing.</span> <span id="s513">And is there anything else that you would like to add, or is there a memory or --</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: All I can say is, always -- it's what I said in my last interview too.</span> <span id="s515">People have to learn to be tolerant of each other.</span> <span id="s516">I get terribly, terribly upset when I see what is going on now with the gays, with this -- anybody who is different, different color, different persuasion.</span> <span id="s517">As long as you are a decent human being and don't hurt anybody else, you can do whatever you want, as far as I'm concerned.</span> <span id="s518">Intolerance, and the advantage I think we have in America is that it's not a homogenous society.</span> <span id="s519">There are so many cultures, so many religions.</span> <span id="s520">We've got to accept them.</span> <span id="s521">You can do what you want.</span> <span id="s522">Leave me alone.</span> <span id="s523">But be tolerant towards other people.</span> <span id="s524">I go to the -- we have in New York -- I don't know if you've heard of it, The Holocaust Tolerance Center, The Tolerance Museum, and my emphasis is on tolerance.</span> <span id="s525">That is what you have to teach children and not be bullies and not look down on other people's color or because they are a different race or a different background or a different education.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: Great.</span> <span id="s527">Anything else?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: I can't think of anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s530">Thank you so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: You're welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">End of File One</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Beginning File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: This is a continuation of an interview with Ruth Heiman on October 17, 2010, regarding the Kindertransport.</span> <span id="s535">Please go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: The interview yesterday I left out the most important thing to me that I pushed out of my mind all along.</span> <span id="s537">When my son was born, when I was in the hospital giving birth to my son, I was furious at my mother for not being there.</span> <span id="s538">And I needed her so much.</span> <span id="s539">I was 24 years old.</span> <span id="s540">She had been killed six years earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: I want to thank you for sharing that.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: I knew that, but nevertheless, I never got over the anger.</span> <span id="s543">How could she leave me at a time like that.</span> <span id="s544">Totally irrational.</span> <span id="s545">My husband was there, of course.</span> <span id="s546">It was totally irrational.</span> <span id="s547">I never forget it.</span> <span id="s548">This was '49.</span> <span id="s549">She was killed in '43.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Did she die in a concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: My parents went in 1942 to a death camp.</span> <span id="s552">That is the addition.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: You're welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">End of File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
