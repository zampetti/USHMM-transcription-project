with Freida Treitel, Survivor</span></p> <p><span id="s3">May 16, 1986</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Sarasota, Florida Today is Friday, May 16, 1986 and I am at the home of Friedel Treitel at Sarasota, Florida.</span> <span id="s5">Mrs. Treitel is a survivor of the Holocaust and has graciously consented to be interviewed so that there will be a historical record of her experiences during the Holocaust period.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Q: Mrs. Treitel, so that we may have an overall picture of you and not just your experiences during the Holocaust years, could you tell us a little bit about your childhood?</span> <span id="s7">What can you remember of it?</span> <span id="s8">How many children were in your family, what type of work your family was engaged in, where you came from.</span> <span id="s9">That is probably the best thing to start with – where you came from.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: Yes, I was born in Essen.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: Essen, Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: Essen, West Germany.</span> <span id="s13">An industrial city, about population of 650,000.</span> <span id="s14">And, ummm, I was born in 1922.</span> <span id="s15">My parents had come from Poland.</span> <span id="s16">I’m not sure, probably in 1919.</span> <span id="s17">And in 1921 my sister was born and in 1922 I was born.</span> <span id="s18">And we lived in a neighborhood that, ummm, I mean it was a very primitive neighborhood (laughs) as I remember.</span> <span id="s19">And we moved from there when I was about five.</span> <span id="s20">We moved a little bit out of the city.</span> <span id="s21">My father, uh, tried his best to make a living; he was probably more a salesman in the textile business, and at one time he was self-employed.</span> <span id="s22">But in 1928 things became a little bit unsafe (pause) and...and...and</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: Unsafe in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: No, actually, the business just, uh, disintegrated.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: The times were very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: This was during the Weimer Republic?</span> <span id="s28">And just before the…</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: That I really don’t remember.</span> <span id="s30">I never remember anything political.</span> <span id="s31">If you were (laugh) to ask me that, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: But I do remember we, uh, my mother, my sister and I took a trip to Poland just at that time after my father lost his job and his business.</span> <span id="s34">A very meager existence really.</span> <span id="s35">We took this trip to Poland with some of the families that had left behind.</span> <span id="s36">And, but the school demanded that we immediately return.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: This was a public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Yes, this was a public school and my sister had already been enrolled in the first grade.</span> <span id="s39">And I entered the first grade following our return and was sent home because I was very small and very frail.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Frail?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Frail.</span> <span id="s42">Though I had to wait until I turned seven.</span> <span id="s43">Instead of six.</span> <span id="s44">But, uh, the first two years were not the most pleasant for me in school because I could already feel (laugh) that there was something against me.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Because of being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: I do remember…just being the only girl in the class.</span> <span id="s47">The only Jewish girl, and my teacher…was…I could feel that she showed, uh, really resentment towards me and, in fact, one time she slapped me.</span> <span id="s48">She slapped my face.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Did you think…understand that it had something to do with being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Yes, I think it did.</span> <span id="s51">If I recall, that was really my impression.</span> <span id="s52">That this must be the reason, and she did, or tried everything to certainly not show her affection, because it turned out to be the opposite.</span> <span id="s53">Now, after the second grade, we were lucky to move back into the city.</span> <span id="s54">Where I attended a Jewish school.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: All day long?</span> <span id="s56">This was like your regular education, plus some religious education?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Yes, the complete elementary school.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Yes, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: And also, we had a beautiful Temple that we would go to the Temple regularly, and of course I made a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s60">At that time, of course, things started to develop.</span> <span id="s61">And when I turned 10, about I think about 10, I joined the Zionist, um, Habonim.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Uh, uh.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Youth school.</span> <span id="s64">We had a beautiful building.</span> <span id="s65">That was erected in about 1934 or 5, I believe</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: What did the Habonim do?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Where we met, we met regularly.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: What kind of activities did they engage in?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Um, now they were trying to inform us about Israel.</span> <span id="s70">Erwetz as it was called.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Yes, there was no Israel at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: No.</span> <span id="s73">Erwetz.</span> <span id="s74">They usually termed it this way.</span> <span id="s75">And, umm, well, they tried perhaps to influence us to emigrate to Israel.</span> <span id="s76">But I don’t believe I was a candidate because my parents would not let me leave.</span> <span id="s77">My sister, however, did go to a Hafsharah.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Hafsharah?</span> <span id="s79">What does Hafsharah mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: The Hafsharah is a preparation for the, umm, for the, uhh, you know, for the life in a kibbutz.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Like learning to live on a farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: And doing things with your hands?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A; In Israel you learn your agricultural skills.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: And you remain there for several months until you get some idea of what life would be like.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: And you sister went through this?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: My sister went and, umm, and she returned.</span> <span id="s89">And, umm, somehow she did not pursue her idea of going to Israel.</span> <span id="s90">Somehow she must have met someone, she was a nice looking young lady (laughs) and we, uh, we, uh,we were, let’s see, she was working, already.</span> <span id="s91">We had to leave school after the eighth grade.</span> <span id="s92">After we graduated we left school.</span> <span id="s93">In fact, for one thing you could not continue your education at that time, it was already restricted.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Even in Jewish schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: No.</span> <span id="s96">No.</span> <span id="s97">To go to High School.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: There was no such thing as a High School.</span> <span id="s100">It was like a middle school, and, umm, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Just for Jewish people, or for most people?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: No, that would be a general, uh, attendance, you know, any students.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: I believe, but it was restricted.</span> <span id="s105">Although I am not quite sure.</span> <span id="s106">Some of the girls that I remember did go to a middle school, but, of course, you had to pay for that.</span> <span id="s107">It was not accessible to me at all because we (laugh) could not afford anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: So you were about fourteen years old then?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Yes, but I was fifteen when I left school.</span> <span id="s110">And, that was in April, around Easter we would be dismissed.</span> <span id="s111">And in May I already took on my first job that my sister had just vacated to take on another job with a family to be a nursemaid, to keep house and so.</span> <span id="s112">This is what she did.</span> <span id="s113">And so she had moved out from our home and lived with these people.</span> <span id="s114">Now I had left school and started my job, I learned office work and was trained to type a little bit, and continued, it was pretty hard, difficult because we lived under very, very primitive conditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: When you said primitive, can you describe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Food, food was not available.</span> <span id="s117">My, my father had to change jobs continuously because, it just wasn’t possible for him to hold on to, not because of his abilities, he was very capable, but somehow things changed, and he had to change too.</span> <span id="s118">He then worked for a family, a business, outside of Essen, somewhere in the suburbs.</span> <span id="s119">And he had to travel by bicycle, I remember him coming home very tired every night, and on Sunday he would sole our shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: He would do this himself?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s122">In fact, I used to sit and watch what he would do.</span> <span id="s123">He used to cut our hair.</span> <span id="s124">And he was, umm, very musically inclined.</span> <span id="s125">He would practice his mandolin.</span> <span id="s126">He was a very accomplished mandolin player.</span> <span id="s127">He also belonged to an orchestra.</span> <span id="s128">That would perform on weekends occasionally and he would take me there, um, for the, umm.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Concerts?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Concerts, but to the… you know, before the concerts…the training.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: The rehearsals?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Rehearsals (laughs).</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Now by this time you are already talking about 1937.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: I was still very young, when he took me to the rehearsals.</span> <span id="s135">But I became very, very interested in music.</span> <span id="s136">Of course, I still am.</span> <span id="s137">This is still a great part of my life.</span> <span id="s138">Which I enjoy immensely.</span> <span id="s139">So I was working, and, umm, I had to put in three years apprenticeship.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: In the office?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: In the office.</span> <span id="s142">And, I was half-way into this process, that was 1938 now.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Five years after Hitler came into power?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Yes, and in 1930, I never really knew that anything would happen, that we would have to leave town, and start a new life somewhere else, however, it became evident and I do remember that my mother had a sister living in New York.</span> <span id="s145">They would correspond and I remember, not much of it, but I remember that papers were being, um, prepared for immigration.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: I want to stop you for a minute, you used the term “it became evident”.</span> <span id="s147">In what ways, do you recall, that it became evident?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: At that time, umm, you would hear, oh yes, I do remember, in school, I was still in school.</span> <span id="s149">Now I remember.</span> <span id="s150">You see, my memory is failing me at times.</span> <span id="s151">In school we would have to interrupt our, our, uh, studies, and listen to the Chancellor.</span> <span id="s152">I believe, I believe, it was regularly once a week that we would have to assemble in one room, and listen to the radio, where he would make a speech.</span> <span id="s153">Now, I didn’t really pay that much attention, because, ummm, actually, I was always very, very hungry, and my mind was (laughs) not on anything but getting home from school and, uh, helping my mother, and doing things.</span> <span id="s154">But we did have to listen to the radio.</span> <span id="s155">And, somehow, it was, it became a little frightening to me, the voice, the voice of Adolf Hitler was very penetrating.</span> <span id="s156">I mean, it was not the most pleasant thing.</span> <span id="s157">And, uh, we were told by the Dean of the School, I think it was a director, not a dean, in elementary school, you would have a school director.</span> <span id="s158">He would yell at us.</span> <span id="s159">We shouldn’t belong, we should be cautious, we should not make too much noise, because we are not that well liked.</span> <span id="s160">I think this is how he expressed it.</span> <span id="s161">I don’t know precisely what he said, but I do remember some of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: This was in the Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: That was in the Jewish school, but we were adjacent to the other school.</span> <span id="s164">In one building, therefore he wanted us to behave well and…</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: As though if you behaved well, nothing worse would happen to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Ummm, well, at least, it wouldn’t cause any unpleasant incidents.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Uh, uh.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: This was a time when I became aware of what was going on.</span> <span id="s169">At least a little bit.</span> <span id="s170">And then, ummm, I remember on our street, there was a, umm, an auto repair shop.</span> <span id="s171">They had to provide the, umm, back yard or something for the SR.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: SR?</span> <span id="s173">What does that stand for?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: The Storm…how shall I explain it?</span> <span id="s175">It is not the SS.</span> <span id="s176">But it was already the Nazi organization, the Brown Shirts.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: The Brown Shirts.</span> <span id="s179">They would march in.</span> <span id="s180">I could see from the window.</span> <span id="s181">They would march in.</span> <span id="s182">It was right across our street.</span> <span id="s183">And sing, and hold their meetings.</span> <span id="s184">And they had the roll call right in the middle of the street (laughs).</span> <span id="s185">And it was a small street.</span> <span id="s186">But I could see it (laughs), and feel it (laughs).</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Uh, uh, since it was happening right outside your window.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: And that was the beginning of my awareness that, uh, life was becoming a little bit uncomfortable, unpleasant.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Do you think, at least in retrospect, that your father’s difficulties in maintaining employment was related to anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: I can’t say.</span> <span id="s191">I can’t say.</span> <span id="s192">I think that business was doing so poorly he had to change jobs.</span> <span id="s193">In fact at one time he was unemployed, and he received a very small amount from the welfare organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Uh, uh.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: And also from our Jewish community center.</span> <span id="s196">It was a very, very dedicated place.</span> <span id="s197">We were helped with small additional gifts, from a grocery.</span> <span id="s198">For instance, we were given a certain amount and I would have to go, it took about an hour (laughs) to walk for me.</span> <span id="s199">To get some groceries.</span> <span id="s200">That was an additional help from the Jewish community center.</span> <span id="s201">And also we were provided with clothing.</span> <span id="s202">Used clothing, most of the time.</span> <span id="s203">I don’t ever remember having anything new, at that time.</span> <span id="s204">Until I worked, until I started to work.</span> <span id="s205">There wasn’t much that we were paid because of my apprenticeship you don’t get (laughs) a large amount.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: It was meant to be a training period?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: But this was the first time I had anything new to wear.</span> <span id="s208">It is now 1938 and I was working faithfully, and, uh, during the night of November 9th, we heard, we were living in a small apartment on the third floor.</span> <span id="s209">We had Jewish neighbors.</span> <span id="s210">With three small children.</span> <span id="s211">And we were in communication and I would, in fact, on Friday night, I would, umm, we had to wash, to clean the, the stairs, every week.</span> <span id="s212">We would take turns, all families in that building.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Uh, uh.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Would take turns.</span> <span id="s215">And I would do that for them.</span> <span id="s216">And they would give me a bowl of freshly made chicken soup.</span> <span id="s217">And all this.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Considering you were always hungry, that was good.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Ya, very appreciated (laughs)…anything edible.</span> <span id="s220">Although I would go over there and bathe the children, the two little girls, and I would also, probably babysit, I do remember something, uh, oh, yeah, it was the night of November the 9th when we heard noises.</span> <span id="s221">We heard crying, in the meantime, they had a new little baby that was born in ’37, I believe.</span> <span id="s222">It was a small baby and, uh, we heard that baby cry, and we heard some man’s voices.</span> <span id="s223">My mother said to me, I got dressed, I got dressed, my Mother said why don’t you go over and see what is going on?</span> <span id="s224">So I did.</span> <span id="s225">And when I entered there were two people.</span> <span id="s226">I don’t remember if they were in uniform or not.</span> <span id="s227">I don’t believe they were in uniform.</span> <span id="s228">People who picked up the, uh, the Jews, were not necessarily in uniform.</span> <span id="s229">Just to disguise whatever they had in mind.</span> <span id="s230">And, uh, I was, I was, remaining there for a little while and offering my help, and she was kind because they were taking her husband away.</span> <span id="s231">Now, we were stateless.</span> <span id="s232">You see, we had never become German citizens, My parents.</span> <span id="s233">No, we were born there, my sister and I were born there.</span> <span id="s234">But we were given at the age of 16 a passport that said “stateless”.</span> <span id="s235">That means we had no country that we belonged to.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Neither Germany or Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s238">Now, ummm, the people next to us were in the same position.</span> <span id="s239">And, for that reason, if they had been Poles, they would not have, they would not have let him go.</span> <span id="s240">They were taking him in, I think for a couple of days.</span> <span id="s241">And he returned.</span> <span id="s242">My father was not picked up, because they probably did not know who we were.</span> <span id="s243">We were not Polish and we were not German or anything.</span> <span id="s244">Uh, though, he returned and my father who would know what was going to happen, packed and went to Holland.</span> <span id="s245">Now Holland was the closest place to get away.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Without financial means.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: He went alone?</span> <span id="s249">The rest of you, you and your mother and your sister stayed?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: He went alone.</span> <span id="s251">Oh, I forgot to say something else that concerns immigration.</span> <span id="s252">But, the ninth of November, the following morning.</span> <span id="s253">I was going to work as usual.</span> <span id="s254">Now, it was called the Crystal Night and I could see what happened that night.</span> <span id="s255">I went to work.</span> <span id="s256">Everything was smashed to pieces, and uh, my employer and his wife and I, we were trying to clean up the mess.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Your employer was Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Yes, everything was smashed to pieces, and I really was so uninformed.</span> <span id="s259">I was really not a very mature 16 year old.</span> <span id="s260">Yeah, I was 16.</span> <span id="s261">Uh, I never asked questions, my parents did not tell me much.</span> <span id="s262">In fact they never told me anything political.</span> <span id="s263">I only knew I was Jewish, and, uh, and I have friends and we try to sing and laugh and, uh, make the best of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Were you still active in Habonim at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Yes, yes, we were regularly meeting.</span> <span id="s266">And, uh, so I went to work, and I knew that would be my last day, because they had to give up.</span> <span id="s267">I believe so.</span> <span id="s268">I discontinued going.</span> <span id="s269">I think it was too dangerous.</span> <span id="s270">We were afraid to go on a street car, which was actually the electric tram-tram?</span> <span id="s271">What is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Tram.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: We were becoming very fearful of being on the streets, and ummm, gradually my mother was trying, my father had left for Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s274">We had no idea where he would be living, but then I remember we must have received some mail.</span> <span id="s275">And then we knew the address and everything.</span> <span id="s276">He was living with a family in a large house that would later become a uh, what you call it, you know for many families that would be living there.</span> <span id="s277">They would be taking on families.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Like a refuge?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s280">That’s what you might call it.</span> <span id="s281">So gradually my mother would not tell me anything specific.</span> <span id="s282">What we will be doing.</span> <span id="s283">But she began to make arrangements.</span> <span id="s284">Not much, we tried to get a few things and send them off to that address that we had possession of.</span> <span id="s285">We had a wicker basket, a very large one, and we would fill it up with linen, or whatever we had available.</span> <span id="s286">And, umm, then at one time, the family next to us, had decided to leave.</span> <span id="s287">Also to try to get to Holland.</span> <span id="s288">It was the easiest.</span> <span id="s289">And it became known as the most accessible.</span> <span id="s290">So, they offered, or they asked, if I would come with them.</span> <span id="s291">I don’t know why I ever decided this.</span> <span id="s292">But it was meant to, it was meant to be more like a fact finding tour.</span> <span id="s293">We would go to a city, I think it was Aachen, double a, ch, en.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: In Holland?</span> <span id="s295">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: Er, on the border of Holland and Germany and Belgium.</span> <span id="s297">We would go, they asked me if I would go along.</span> <span id="s298">My mother made every effort that she would, that perhaps, I would be able to, uh, find a place that we would all get together again.</span> <span id="s299">I think this must have been the idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Would there have been any difficulty in?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: I don’t recall any conversation about this.</span> <span id="s302">Do you know it was all done and you would not discuss much.</span> <span id="s303">You would just do things.</span> <span id="s304">(laughs) So I would go with this family, and we lived in a place, I think, in a hotel…</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: In Aachen?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: For a day or two, and I became very sick.</span> <span id="s307">They had to take me to the hospital where I remained four days.</span> <span id="s308">I remember, in the meantime, they had left, they had left me behind.</span> <span id="s309">And went back, because there was no possibility.</span> <span id="s310">The arrangement, actually, to cross the border would be, uh, a farmer with a horse and wagon…to take us across the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Hiding you?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Well,</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Hiding you, so they wouldn’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Uh, not necessarily hiding us.</span> <span id="s315">Just to get us across.</span> <span id="s316">But it did not work out.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: So let me see if I understand.</span> <span id="s318">You went from Essen to Aachen and then… A; With this family.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: And then they went back to Essen.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: They went back because things did not work out.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: You were still in the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: The arrangement did not work out.</span> <span id="s323">He did not show up, and I don’t know what happened, but I did, after 4 days recover.</span> <span id="s324">I was running a very high fever.</span> <span id="s325">I recovered and I returned home by myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: What was it like to be left behind like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: Ummm, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s328">I really……</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Weren’t you a little worried?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: I was worried just to travel on a train by myself, which I had never done before.</span> <span id="s331">All by myself.</span> <span id="s332">But this was a Catholic hospital, and they made arrangements for me to meet the train on time and I traveled home.</span> <span id="s333">And my mother, in the meantime, had, uh, sold, the only thing we had, we had a kitchen and bedroom, the only thing sellable, reasonable sellable was like a breakfront that my father had put together and painted beautifully.</span> <span id="s334">He was very, very talented.</span> <span id="s335">He was, he was a decorator, also.</span> <span id="s336">Interior decorator.</span> <span id="s337">He, he, I think he majored in his Gymnasium, I think that is what they call it in Poland, the high school, he was very talented and, uh, I believe she sold it to someone.</span> <span id="s338">We had nothing else.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: And what was this money used for?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: I only recall thirteen marks, that we had in our possession, when my mother and I finally left for Holland.</span> <span id="s341">We had closed up the apartment, and I remember going to the police department, to, we, that is what I know now.</span> <span id="s342">We had to turn in the key.</span> <span id="s343">They would take possession of the apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: And whatever was left behind?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Consisting of two rooms, not much in it really, a table and chairs, and two beds, three beds, and I believe my mother sold the breakfront, which, I still believe, in my opinion, very, the most attractive piece of furniture.</span> <span id="s346">So, my mother and I went to the police.</span> <span id="s347">It was in the late afternoon.</span> <span id="s348">We, I don’t know, we were, she was conversing with them, and I really don’t recall much.</span> <span id="s349">I only remember that somebody took us to the border.</span> <span id="s350">I don’t know if we traveled by train or we, I don’t recall that at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: I do remember arriving at the border, where we were questioned a lot.</span> <span id="s353">That began to frighten me, because they called me in singly.</span> <span id="s354">They called in my mother first.</span> <span id="s355">And, then they called me in and showed me a little picture of my mother’s brother.</span> <span id="s356">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s357">They acted as though they were suspicious of something.</span> <span id="s358">I don’t remember what they meant.</span> <span id="s359">But I do remember them asking me do I know this man.</span> <span id="s360">And I said this was my uncle, one of so many.</span> <span id="s361">They had both large families.</span> <span id="s362">Uh, so it now, got to be very late.</span> <span id="s363">I think it was two o’clock in the morning, when we were taken to the border.</span> <span id="s364">When we were taken across the border, by someone, he was a friendly person, that is all I remember.</span> <span id="s365">He would show my mother where to go, and cross the border to Holland, into Holland.</span> <span id="s366">And, uh, so we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Were you in a car or bus?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: No, nothing, on foot, just walking.</span> <span id="s369">In a distance I could see the tramway.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: What did you have with you?</span> <span id="s371">Just a suitcase?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: I don’t think we had a suitcase.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Not even a suitcase?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: To be perfectly honest.</span> <span id="s377">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s378">I remember having a shoulder bag or something.</span> <span id="s379">It was very cold.</span> <span id="s380">It was 1938 that was supposed to be the coldest winter in Germany.</span> <span id="s381">That’s what I remember.</span> <span id="s382">It was so cold, I was crying.</span> <span id="s383">And I wasn’t dressed properly to begin with.</span> <span id="s384">It was a very light spring coat that I wore.</span> <span id="s385">And, uh, I remember not much, during that night.</span> <span id="s386">I think we stayed with a family in Mostrich.</span> <span id="s387">That is what I remember.</span> <span id="s388">And the next morning we would go on to Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Is that where your father was?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: That is where my father was supposed to be.</span> <span id="s391">But when we arrived at that address, all the men had been taken to the police department.</span> <span id="s392">For just to register.</span> <span id="s393">I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s394">We were told by the, umm, proprietor of this place, that they had not returned.</span> <span id="s395">That was the very day that they had left in the morning.</span> <span id="s396">They had not returned.</span> <span id="s397">And, uh, what really happened was the men were taken to the first camp outside of Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s398">Right near the, North Sea.</span> <span id="s399">I think, it’s the North Sea, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: North Sea, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s402">To a place called Hochvonholland.</span> <span id="s403">And we began to correspond.</span> <span id="s404">With open cards.</span> <span id="s405">We were living with this family, many rabbis would come.</span> <span id="s406">It was like a pension.</span> <span id="s407">What do you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: A pensioner?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Had the Germans invaded Holland at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: No, not yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: I didn’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: No, that was in 1940.</span> <span id="s414">I lived, we lived, my mother and I were given a room.</span> <span id="s415">And I, um, helped out in the house, serving food to all the people who came and were, um, what shall I say?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Let me just interject for the purpose of the record.</span> <span id="s417">A pensioner was like a small hotel, or a rooming house.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: It is a rooming house.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Not very fancy, but clean.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: A rooming house is a better term for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: OK.</span> <span id="s423">Umm, it was provided for a certain number of people by the committee, or Jewish Community Center of Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s424">That they would eat, and get their meals there-one or two meals a day.</span> <span id="s425">And I remember many rabbis coming there and we would, uh, on weekends, we would sit and sing the Hebrew songs together.</span> <span id="s426">And, uh, the grace after meals, and, uh, it became a little more pleasant, and, but, uh, immigration was certainly going on for those who had money.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Why was your father in a camp at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s429">They began already gathering Jews, I believe.</span> <span id="s430">And, uh, what surprises me is that my mother and I were able to remain until 1940.</span> <span id="s431">This was 1938, the end of 1938, December, to be exact.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Where was your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Oh, yeah, my sister.</span> <span id="s434">My sister, oh, I have to go back to 1938.</span> <span id="s435">My sister came home one afternoon.</span> <span id="s436">And she was showing us a ring she had received.</span> <span id="s437">Now, I was never told much, I had no idea what this ring was all about.</span> <span id="s438">But it was presumably an engagement ring.</span> <span id="s439">She was probably engaged and, uh, she asked my father where she could turn this into a little money.</span> <span id="s440">Because she is about to leave with her fiancé.</span> <span id="s441">They had to leave.</span> <span id="s442">They were taken to Poland at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: I remember so little of this.</span> <span id="s445">I only remember the ring.</span> <span id="s446">That she would take it to a Jewish jeweler.</span> <span id="s447">I think my father took her there.</span> <span id="s448">And she said, I only want some money.</span> <span id="s449">And she, she said good-bye.</span> <span id="s450">But I don’t recall that vividly.</span> <span id="s451">Really, this is way back in my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s453">So you and your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: So she left.</span> <span id="s455">She was gone.</span> <span id="s456">In Poland, we had absolutely no idea what happens in Poland.</span> <span id="s457">We had no idea, at least I didn’t.</span> <span id="s458">So um, the men were taken to this camp.</span> <span id="s459">That was the beginning of concentration camps.</span> <span id="s460">And in 1940, my mother and I were called to the Police Dept. In fact every month we would have to report to the Police Department in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s461">Promptly.</span> <span id="s462">Who we are, and what we are doing, where we were living.</span> <span id="s463">We were not allowed to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: How did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: We were not given permission.</span> <span id="s466">At least I was looking for a job.</span> <span id="s467">But officially you were not given permission to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: So just the Jewish Community supported you.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Supported us.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: What did you do with yourselves all day?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Oh, I was working in this pension.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Oh, that’s right.</span> <span id="s473">You said you were helping.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A; I was cleaning.</span> <span id="s475">I was serving, when mealtimes came.</span> <span id="s476">I was very busy and hardworking.</span> <span id="s477">I was also, um, became acquainted with a little group.</span> <span id="s478">Again we have a name.</span> <span id="s479">And we would gather occasionally and would sing together, and you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: It sounds like as much as possible people did things to maintain their morale.</span> <span id="s481">To make them feel better.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: Yes, you really did not know.</span> <span id="s483">Realize what was happening around us.</span> <span id="s484">So in 1940, however we were told, we would all be reunited with my father, or husbands.</span> <span id="s485">Families would be reunited in Vestiborge, Holland.</span> <span id="s486">The outskirts of Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Vestiborge?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Vestiborge, yes.</span> <span id="s489">That was, uh, more a family camp.</span> <span id="s490">And we were about 1,100 people.</span> <span id="s491">We were put to work.</span> <span id="s492">We were given a small place to live.</span> <span id="s493">Each family was given a two room, uh, not what you would call an apartment.</span> <span id="s494">It’s what you would call a barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: But you had two rooms which was yours.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: We had two rooms, and even a bathroom.</span> <span id="s497">Not to take a bath, a toilet.</span> <span id="s498">And we would remain there in the camp.</span> <span id="s499">We were put to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Were you in fact reunited with your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Yes, we were.</span> <span id="s502">Yes.</span> <span id="s503">We were put to work.</span> <span id="s504">In various departments.</span> <span id="s505">On the fields.</span> <span id="s506">I was probably.</span> <span id="s507">In the hospital.</span> <span id="s508">In the kitchen.</span> <span id="s509">Washing dishes.</span> <span id="s510">That is what I remember.</span> <span id="s511">And in the linen supply.</span> <span id="s512">In the laundry department where I would have to iron all day.</span> <span id="s513">The girls or boys.</span> <span id="s514">There were a large number of boys which were living by themselves.</span> <span id="s515">They were without parents.</span> <span id="s516">That is what I recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: What kind of food did they give you?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: It was, well, very minimal.</span> <span id="s519">We would get two slices of bread in the morning with an apple spread.</span> <span id="s520">Something like a spread, probably some margarine.</span> <span id="s521">I think that there was margarine available.</span> <span id="s522">And then around noon there was the main meal, I believe.</span> <span id="s523">Some potatoes and, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s524">I remember potatoes a lot.</span> <span id="s525">But never enough really.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: Any meat at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: But never enough really.</span> <span id="s528">I continued to be so hungry that, that it was indescribable.</span> <span id="s529">Because, as I was growing up, there was never enough and certainly not what I would have liked to eat.</span> <span id="s530">Like butter and bread.</span> <span id="s531">That is my most favorite food.</span> <span id="s532">And I certainly learned to spread it.</span> <span id="s533">(laughs).</span> <span id="s534">But we were working very hard.</span> <span id="s535">On the field, it was where your appetite would be building up.</span> <span id="s536">We would take a small sandwich out with us, but, it was hard work.</span> <span id="s537">We would wear overalls-one piece blue denim.</span> <span id="s538">We would go off to work, and sing along the way.</span> <span id="s539">It was a little walk.</span> <span id="s540">About a half an hour to walk to the fields.</span> <span id="s541">Where we would have to, umm, clear the weeds</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Uh, uh.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: From the potato fields.</span> <span id="s544">And in the meantime there was different possibilities for me to work-in the sewing center, we had one room and we had one instructor and we would learn how to sew and we would also provide various articles for the people of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: How did the people that were in charge treat you?</span> <span id="s546">Were they cruel?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: No, Those were our own people.</span> <span id="s548">They were still our own people.</span> <span id="s549">But we had a commandant who was, uh, of Dutch origin.</span> <span id="s550">He was the commandant and it was I don’t remember anything cruel.</span> <span id="s551">There was a jail.</span> <span id="s552">There was a jail, there was a hospital, and uh, a kitchen where people would work.</span> <span id="s553">That was probably the best place to work (laughs).</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Did you get a little extra food?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Yes, I remember some of my girlfriends whose fathers were working in the kitchen and, of course, they had a little more than we did, but, uh, this camp was at this time was called a transit camp.</span> <span id="s556">Which we would be the original camp inmates and we would remain as such for the next four years.</span> <span id="s557">But in the meantime, it was a transit camp, and it meant as soon as the Dutch people were picked up by the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s558">They would have to travel through this camp.</span> <span id="s559">They would arrive in the middle of the night and, uh, they were registered and sent off for deportation.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: Were these Jewish Dutch people or Christian Dutch people?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: No.</span> <span id="s562">These were all Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: All Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: All Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: The entire camp.</span> <span id="s566">Now by 1942 it changed a little.</span> <span id="s567">We had a German commandant.</span> <span id="s568">I don’t know if the Dutch commandant was still in existence, but I remember a German.</span> <span id="s569">And he was not what you would call a cruel person.</span> <span id="s570">He would do his thing and keep everything under control, but things became a little more serious with the deportations.</span> <span id="s571">That had begun in 1940.</span> <span id="s572">Even some of our own people.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: That came with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s575">Some of them were also deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Did you realize when these people were coming through the camp that they were possibly going to die?</span> <span id="s577">Or did you have any idea what was happening to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: I only knew they were going to be deported.</span> <span id="s579">We did not know who or when.</span> <span id="s580">Deportations took place once a week.</span> <span id="s581">From then on.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Meanwhile you stayed there?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Yes, we must have had some prominence because we were always going to leave from this camp.</span> <span id="s584">And we were working and we were trained and, uh, just to do our job.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Did you have much interaction with these people?</span> <span id="s586">Going through the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: No, I didn’t know them.</span> <span id="s588">We didn’t know them.</span> <span id="s589">No, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: You lived a separate life from them?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s592">We had, I had girlfriends.</span> <span id="s593">We were also keeping group assemblies.</span> <span id="s594">It was creating everywhere.</span> <span id="s595">We would get together and sing and get together, and sit and take walks around the premises.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: So, while the quality of your life was not too great, it was not too terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: No.</span> <span id="s598">It was something you, you practically, accepted.</span> <span id="s599">What, uh, what was available at that time.</span> <span id="s600">We, we…</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: And this continued for four years?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: We had no idea what we will become.</span> <span id="s603">I never thought of the future.</span> <span id="s604">It probably did not exist for me.</span> <span id="s605">Only the present existed for me, and the only problem was that there was not enough food.</span> <span id="s606">This was really something that affected me throughout the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: Did people die from lack of food in that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: Uh, not that I know of.</span> <span id="s609">It was not an extermination camp.</span> <span id="s610">And I remember some people died of illnesses.</span> <span id="s611">But, uh, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: You say that continued for four years.</span> <span id="s613">What happened at the end of the four years?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: Oh, now in the meantime, deportations would continue.</span> <span id="s615">Every Tuesday and in, umm, January, of 1944, yep, we were called to get ready for deportation- my parents and I- but, the only difference being-we were told we were going to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s616">I had no idea what Theresienstadt was.</span> <span id="s617">Did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Yes, I have heard of Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: Yep.</span> <span id="s620">Yes.</span> <span id="s621">We were taken there.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: And Theresienstadt was in what country?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: We would take our knapsacks that we had in the meantime.</span> <span id="s626">Uh, made available.</span> <span id="s627">I was sewing all those things.</span> <span id="s628">Even for other people.</span> <span id="s629">We took old sheets and we would make knapsacks out of them.</span> <span id="s630">And, uh, I got a little extra piece of bread for doing this, because I did it for some of our friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: How did you get to Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: We were packing up, and a large number of our original camp inmates were included in this transport.</span> <span id="s633">To go to Theresienstadt by train.</span> <span id="s634">There was a train going.</span> <span id="s635">And that was a moment when I became very emotional.</span> <span id="s636">You were living for four years with wonderful people.</span> <span id="s637">With doctors, professors and all kinds of intellects.</span> <span id="s638">And, we were really communicating with all kinds of interesting people.</span> <span id="s639">And, of course, needless to say, my girlfriends, I was going to be separated.</span> <span id="s640">In fact, none of my girlfriends were included in this transport.</span> <span id="s641">And, I, umm, yeah, we were leaving the barracks, we were leaving the barracks, and, uh, uh, getting ready to board the train.</span> <span id="s642">It was not an ordinary train.</span> <span id="s643">It was a pretty primitive.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: A passenger train or cattle car?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s646">I think it was a cattle car.</span> <span id="s647">There were no passenger trains.</span> <span id="s648">No, it was a cattle car.</span> <span id="s649">It was very crowded.</span> <span id="s650">I was very tired.</span> <span id="s651">And I was looking for a place to sleep, and there was only a little place on the floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: There was actually room to lie down?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: In that train probably.</span> <span id="s654">Not much.</span> <span id="s655">I think you would sit in a position, not necessarily stretched out.</span> <span id="s656">You would probably sit.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Probably huddled up?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: I only remember that night.</span> <span id="s659">Going through the whole night.</span> <span id="s660">And we were now in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s661">Something new again.</span> <span id="s662">New surroundings.</span> <span id="s663">New atmosphere.</span> <span id="s664">And, uh, that was already a bit more depressing.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Besides your feelings of sadness about leaving your friends, and your more predictable way of life, did you have any tremendous fears about the future- where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: No.</span> <span id="s667">The strange thing about me- I never thought about the future- I never really thought about tomorrow.</span> <span id="s668">It did not exist for me.</span> <span id="s669">Only (laughs) the present.</span> <span id="s670">Uh, I don’t know how to explain it.</span> <span id="s671">It is one of those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: It probably helped you preserve some composure.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: I was probably was hoping we would always be, uh, remain together.</span> <span id="s674">My mother, my father and I.</span> <span id="s675">This was one thing I was probably taking for granted.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: And by this time you were twenty- three years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: In 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s680">In Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s681">Oh, yeah, we were put to work, naturally.</span> <span id="s682">It was like washing the floors in the hospitals.</span> <span id="s683">And doctor’s offices.</span> <span id="s684">And, uh, I met a very nice young man from Czechoslovakia from Prague.</span> <span id="s685">And, and, I had, oh, yeah, I used to play the guitar.</span> <span id="s686">My father taught me to play the guitar since he played the mandolin.</span> <span id="s687">He told me to play the guitar and I would sing various songs in many languages.</span> <span id="s688">So I learned this over the years.</span> <span id="s689">And in Theresienstadt I had my guitar.</span> <span id="s690">I still had one.</span> <span id="s691">And I met this young man and he also was playing the guitar.</span> <span id="s692">Somehow we were introduced.</span> <span id="s693">Obviously because we were carrying the guitar around.</span> <span id="s694">And, um, we would go to hospitals.</span> <span id="s695">We became acquainted and we would go to hospitals and entertain some of the very terminally ill practically.</span> <span id="s696">But then I knew him for a few months and then he was deported with his whole family.</span> <span id="s697">So that was a short relationship.</span> <span id="s698">Very, very minor.</span> <span id="s699">But interesting.</span> <span id="s700">Very interesting.</span> <span id="s701">And, uh, then, uh, oh, yeah, now we were in Theresienstadt for the next eight months.</span> <span id="s702">In September, on the 23rd of September, all the members were separated from their families.</span> <span id="s703">We were not living together.</span> <span id="s704">The young people were in one area, and the men in the other and the women in yet another.</span> <span id="s705">All separated.</span> <span id="s706">On the 23rd the men were all assembled.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: 23rd of September?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: September, 1944.</span> <span id="s709">They were assembled again.</span> <span id="s710">And, uh, they were prepared for deportation.</span> <span id="s711">Where to, I don’t recall what they were told.</span> <span id="s712">I do recall that when we asked the authorities, my mother and I, we wanted to know what is going to happen to my father.</span> <span id="s713">In fact, I remember the afternoon we were going to say good-bye to him.</span> <span id="s714">He really broke down.</span> <span id="s715">It was not very pleasant.</span> <span id="s716">Um, we were asking the authorities where they were going.</span> <span id="s717">They told us not to worry, we would all be reunited in Litzig.</span> <span id="s718">Yeah, in Litzig.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: In East Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: Which is what I remember.</span> <span id="s721">And we promptly believed them.</span> <span id="s722">That we would be reunited.</span> <span id="s723">That was the 23rd.</span> <span id="s724">Uh, I mean the 28th.</span> <span id="s725">On the, two or three days later, my mother and I were called for deportation.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: With a lot of other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A; I don’t know how that was done.</span> <span id="s728">It was probably announced.</span> <span id="s729">I don’t recall any papers.</span> <span id="s730">But I know we were packing our little bundle and we were waiting throughout the night, with this number.</span> <span id="s731">Because it was just that we were hanging around with a number.</span> <span id="s732">I think it was a number.</span> <span id="s733">And, we were told, we had to wait throughout the night.</span> <span id="s734">I was so tired.</span> <span id="s735">I was trying to sit in a corner somewhere to get a little sleep.</span> <span id="s736">And we were hoping that we would be put on the train and get going.</span> <span id="s737">The waiting was very tiring and disturbing.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: I can imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s740">So finally we were put on the train.</span> <span id="s741">That was even more crowded.</span> <span id="s742">I mean, that was just women and children and we were given a small piece of blanket and a small piece of bread, I believe, and a tin with something in it.</span> <span id="s743">And I was sitting next to my mother.</span> <span id="s744">Uh, by the window, and I told her that I would keep this for my father.</span> <span id="s745">This small piece of food.</span> <span id="s746">I would keep it for my father and, uh, we were traveling for, I think, for two days and one night.</span> <span id="s747">I don’t know precisely.</span> <span id="s748">But, on the way, now that was not our way to Litzig.</span> <span id="s749">On the way my mother noticed a sign in Polish “Auschwitz”.</span> <span id="s750">The name “Auschwitz’.</span> <span id="s751">I don’t know if she knew what it was all about.</span> <span id="s752">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s753">She never told me anything.</span> <span id="s754">We never discussed deportation or what we will be doing or where we are going.</span> <span id="s755">But she had recognized something and probably in her mind she realized or had heard what this place was all about.</span> <span id="s756">But I had no idea.</span> <span id="s757">We arrived there finally.</span> <span id="s758">We got out of the train.</span> <span id="s759">And there was this shouting and running of these men in striped uniforms.</span> <span id="s760">The inmates.</span> <span id="s761">There was such a wide group.</span> <span id="s762">Nothing would have frightened us if they had remained a little bit civilized.</span> <span id="s763">They came storming into this train and told us to get out and we, we got out as good as we could.</span> <span id="s764">We dropped everything.</span> <span id="s765">I remember I had my shoulder bag and this little food product and we had to drop everything right before the train.</span> <span id="s766">I remember the picture still, and, uh, then, uh, we were supposed to go to a certain area.</span> <span id="s767">I remember at least three uniformed men standing there with their leather gloves, and hitting back and forth with their leather gloves.</span> <span id="s768">They used to do it like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: These were Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s771">They were the German SS.</span> <span id="s772">And we were supposed to line up in two groups.</span> <span id="s773">Yeah.</span> <span id="s774">In two groups.</span> <span id="s775">No, actually we were one line that was divided in two.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: This was the famous selection process?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s778">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: The selection process, where people in one line lived and the others died?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s781">I recall, uh, I was still next to my mother and we were lining up and this, this one person with the leather gloves.</span> <span id="s782">I don’t know, you couldn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s783">I mean, one thing we knew, we refuse anything or anything that they did not like they would hit you or shoot you.</span> <span id="s784">I did not see any shooting.</span> <span id="s785">But I saw the hitting, in the faces with the gloves.</span> <span id="s786">I mean they would hit you with the gloves.</span> <span id="s787">And, uh, I was still next to my mother and we would come to this person, and he could see who was young and who was old.</span> <span id="s788">My mother made the mistake of saying I am very sick.</span> <span id="s789">That was a mistake.</span> <span id="s790">She was indeed a heart patient.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: And, she was on my right, and of course he would separate us.</span> <span id="s793">At that moment I must have, you know, you gradually lose your emotions.</span> <span id="s794">I did not respond to anything that I remember.</span> <span id="s795">I only knew this man was standing in front of me and he was taking me to this side and my mother to the other side.</span> <span id="s796">And she would march down that way.</span> <span id="s797">I remember it was about in this direction and I would turn around and look at her and she never turned around.</span> <span id="s798">She just was walking on.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: But you had no premonition what that meant?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: No.</span> <span id="s801">It is, emotions were nonexistent from that time on.</span> <span id="s802">I fact we did not know how to cry, we did not do anything.</span> <span id="s803">We didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s804">We were just trying to obey or not really obey, but you knew you ha to avoid any abuse.</span> <span id="s805">Especially physical abuse.</span> <span id="s806">So, I remember then we were in this group on the left with some of my friends.</span> <span id="s807">There were some people I remember.</span> <span id="s808">And, uh, we were taken with a very tall fellow and a dog.</span> <span id="s809">And, uh, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: A gun?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: Yes, he was armed.</span> <span id="s812">He would walk us down very very slowly.</span> <span id="s813">He would walk us down to the first, the first building where I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s814">I remember walking in and there was, uh, a very large room.</span> <span id="s815">We were told to undress.</span> <span id="s816">Yeah.</span> <span id="s817">We were told to undress.</span> <span id="s818">I pulled my precious little things I had knitted so many nice sweaters and I was always keeping them in a neat place.</span> <span id="s819">We were folding them up and putting them in a neat pile against the wall.</span> <span id="s820">But I kept on a pair of old boots that someone had given me.</span> <span id="s821">Boots, black boots, that I had kept them on and, we were still in line waiting probably to go into a shower.</span> <span id="s822">Well, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s823">Before that, we weren’t ready for that.</span> <span id="s824">Because we were first taken to a, barber shop.</span> <span id="s825">Shaved off all the hair, down to the scalp.</span> <span id="s826">Completely everywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: What a shock that must have been.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s829">That is true.</span> <span id="s830">That was one of my better possessions (laughs).</span> <span id="s831">My hair, it was long and very.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: And how dehumanizing, to be made to undress.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: That was a moment when you really felt it.</span> <span id="s834">Yes.</span> <span id="s835">You would sit there and this girl.</span> <span id="s836">This is something I could never stand.</span> <span id="s837">When a girl would do this to me.</span> <span id="s838">She would shave off everything and then we would try to recognize one another.</span> <span id="s839">And we eventually did.</span> <span id="s840">I don’t know, by the sound of your voice.</span> <span id="s841">We were, I was still wearing my boots, and, we were standing in line and this Polish girl, a young girl, she was an older inmate from this Auschwitz camp.</span> <span id="s842">It was Bechenhold.</span> <span id="s843">Where we arrived.</span> <span id="s844">She was trying to tell me to take off my boots.</span> <span id="s845">She said give me these boots.</span> <span id="s846">I said no.</span> <span id="s847">It was the first time I dared to say no.</span> <span id="s848">I didn’t fear.</span> <span id="s849">I was very offended that this girl would want to take my boots.</span> <span id="s850">It was the last thing I was having.</span> <span id="s851">And I refused.</span> <span id="s852">I got very angry at that moment.</span> <span id="s853">And I never thought I would show anything.</span> <span id="s854">I got very angry and my friend behind me said Friedel, take them off, don’t, don’t, uh, try anything.</span> <span id="s855">Take them off.</span> <span id="s856">And I was very, very upset about the whole thing.</span> <span id="s857">I must have.</span> <span id="s858">I don’t remember if I took them off, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s859">But I remember being very angry.</span> <span id="s860">So eventually we were taken to, the adjoining room.</span> <span id="s861">That was the brosabot.</span> <span id="s862">It was a shower.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: A legitimate genuine shower??</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: Yeah, it was a large, very large room, with outlets.</span> <span id="s865">And, uh, we didn’t know anything about gassing.</span> <span id="s866">At least, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s867">I had no idea what, what this, what cremation meant.</span> <span id="s868">I had never seen it before.</span> <span id="s869">But I did following the bath.</span> <span id="s870">But we were in the shower and we were disinfected.</span> <span id="s871">But, being disinfected was pretty nice, but then we were given the clothes that came out of the dryer somewhere.</span> <span id="s872">They were still warm.</span> <span id="s873">And they were still, uh, traces of lice.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: In the clothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: Yeah, in the clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: You had not talked about lice before.</span> <span id="s877">Was that a big problem for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: No, very, oh terrible.</span> <span id="s879">It was unbearable.</span> <span id="s880">I mean, you could feel it all the time.</span> <span id="s881">It was in, even in your short hair.</span> <span id="s882">It would even get into that.</span> <span id="s883">So we were naked and this man was, uh, operating this whole, shower (laughs) business.</span> <span id="s884">And we weren’t.</span> <span id="s885">we weren’t given any towels to dry off.</span> <span id="s886">I think we just had to dry off (laughs).</span> <span id="s887">As it was.</span> <span id="s888">We were given these clothes, but we had no underwear yet.</span> <span id="s889">We had to wait another day for that.</span> <span id="s890">We were marching off to a, to a barrack.</span> <span id="s891">Our first barrack in Berchenoff.</span> <span id="s892">Very, very large with bunk beds.</span> <span id="s893">Not to each person.</span> <span id="s894">One bunk about the size of this settee in a square.</span> <span id="s895">Uh, to six or eight women.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: Like one huge bed?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A; One huge bed.</span> <span id="s898">Food was nonexistent.</span> <span id="s899">I don’t remember any food at all for the next few days.</span> <span id="s900">Then I remember.</span> <span id="s901">I mean we were not even sleeping.</span> <span id="s902">We had to line up at night all six or eight of us and when one of us wanted to turn the entire group had to turn.</span> <span id="s903">It was they were so mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: What month was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: That was October.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: October, 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: In fact we arrived October 2nd.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: So it was getting towards winter?</span> <span id="s909">Towards light fall.</span> <span id="s910">It would be getting cold?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A:L It was, yes, it was on the cold side already.</span> <span id="s912">We were standing outside for roll call.</span> <span id="s913">Or we were standing for hours, I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s914">I just know I was hungry.</span> <span id="s915">And at one time I think they gave us at one time a little piece of cheese, a very strong scented cheese, just cheese, it made you thirsty, and it, but who cared?</span> <span id="s916">I didn’t see, I don’t recall any food, except that one time, only one time, I remember a little bowl with some cold cooked cabbage, cooked cabbage.</span> <span id="s917">It was grabbed by the whole group you could never see it.</span> <span id="s918">It was grabbed away.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: And you never got any?</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: I would never bother.</span> <span id="s921">Fighting for it?</span> <span id="s922">It was no sense.</span> <span id="s923">There was nothing left.</span> <span id="s924">When you know there is something about a person either you are aggressive or you suffer a great deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: And you were not aggressive?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: I was not aggressive.</span> <span id="s927">(laughs).</span> <span id="s928">I was very shy, very shy.</span> <span id="s929">But once I got acquainted with people I would warm up with them very easily.</span> <span id="s930">And make friends very easily.</span> <span id="s931">Yeah, when it came to food, I don’t recall any food.</span> <span id="s932">It was about going to the bathroom at night.</span> <span id="s933">It was not allowed.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: Where were the bathrooms?</span> <span id="s935">Outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: There were no bathrooms.</span> <span id="s937">There was a ditch behind the barracks.</span> <span id="s938">Way back.</span> <span id="s939">And once I did leave.</span> <span id="s940">I once left and then I returned.</span> <span id="s941">Oh, it was so terrible.</span> <span id="s942">I don’t know how you even completed your necessities there.</span> <span id="s943">When I returned, now we were given these wooden shoes.</span> <span id="s944">And when I returned, one was gone, one shoe was gone.</span> <span id="s945">And walking in the mud.</span> <span id="s946">These roads were not paved.</span> <span id="s947">And walking in this mud!</span> <span id="s948">And this shoe got stuck, so I left it.</span> <span id="s949">So I went barefoot.</span> <span id="s950">Until a few days later we were given some underwear.</span> <span id="s951">I remember a black pure silk (laughs) undershirt, or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: Pure silk.</span> <span id="s953">That was really ludicrous.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: It must have been pure silk.</span> <span id="s955">Yes, they had all kinds of things there.</span> <span id="s956">And, uh, we were given a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s957">Of course they did not fit.</span> <span id="s958">And, uh, you didn’t care.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: Well it was terribly important to keep your feet covered.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: Yes, very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: And dry.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: Yes, it was getting very cold.</span> <span id="s963">And I believe, we must have been there ten days.</span> <span id="s964">And one evening we were told, we are leaving.</span> <span id="s965">A small group is going to leave by train.</span> <span id="s966">And we boarded the train.</span> <span id="s967">I remember boarding the train.</span> <span id="s968">And the conditions were even worse than the first and second time I had traveled by that, uh, cattle train.</span> <span id="s969">It was so crowded that we had to stand up, definitely stand up, for the entire…we were not told where we were going.</span> <span id="s970">I do not remember.</span> <span id="s971">No.</span> <span id="s972">We were standing up this whole night.</span> <span id="s973">We weren’t saying anything.</span> <span id="s974">It was dark.</span> <span id="s975">But when it came, that the person had to go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s976">I remember a little tin can was passed around and there was a hole in the ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: In the floor of the car?</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: In the floor of the car.</span> <span id="s979">So we had to use it the best we could.</span> <span id="s980">It was really an absolute torture.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: How did people behave under these conditions?</span> <span id="s982">Did they scream and cry, or did they frightened or silent?</span> <span id="s983">Do you remember this?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: Yes, I remember it, um, I remember, yeah, in my stay in Berchenhold, the Polish women were very aggressive.</span> <span id="s985">They would punch you, and push you and they didn’t, they had no decency or compassion.</span> <span id="s986">Yes, I would feel it all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: These were Polish Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: Yes, and that bothered me.</span> <span id="s989">That bothered me so much.</span> <span id="s990">That, um, to this day, I never wanted to belong to anything that would consist of a group of women.</span> <span id="s991">If you excuse me (laughs).</span> <span id="s992">This is how I felt about it.</span> <span id="s993">I was so offended, and I felt so abused by their behavior.</span> <span id="s994">I don’t know, it probably.</span> <span id="s995">I didn’t behave that way.</span> <span id="s996">I was a quiet, little kid.</span> <span id="s997">And obeying, though, we were traveling under conditions indescribable, especially when it came to this having to go.</span> <span id="s998">It was an absolute torture.</span> <span id="s999">So, I think we, we traveled through the night and we arrived in Lipsitz.</span> <span id="s1000">There we finally got to Lipsitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: You finally got to Lipsitz?</span> <span id="s1002">Let’s see, you were in Westerbrook, Theresienstadt Berchen, Auschwitz, and now Lipsitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: Lipsitz, that was not a camp.</span> <span id="s1004">We were brought out there to go to work in a factory.</span> <span id="s1005">Iberg, Saxony.</span> <span id="s1006">That was the province.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: Yes, Saxony.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: Yes, so we were brought to this factory.</span> <span id="s1009">I know we were from the train marching through the night.</span> <span id="s1010">It was quiet.</span> <span id="s1011">And, uh, the dogs next to us.</span> <span id="s1012">All these women assigned to us, young women, Germans.</span> <span id="s1013">Oh, they were impossible.</span> <span id="s1014">Um, we were arriving at this factory, an airplane factory.</span> <span id="s1015">And we, we were assigned to one bed, two people.</span> <span id="s1016">I was not too lucky.</span> <span id="s1017">The girl with me was quite a heavy girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: She was lucky, because you were small.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: Yes, so we had to share this bed.</span> <span id="s1020">And a small towel, a small linen towel.</span> <span id="s1021">(laughs).</span> <span id="s1022">She was the first one to take her, to wash up in the morning.</span> <span id="s1023">And, it was, the conditions became so impossible.</span> <span id="s1024">And there were bedbugs.</span> <span id="s1025">The place was infested.</span> <span id="s1026">These bedbugs.</span> <span id="s1027">I couldn’t stand them.</span> <span id="s1028">I would get out of bed in the night and, and I would stretch out on the table.</span> <span id="s1029">In the center of the room.</span> <span id="s1030">And it didn’t help much.</span> <span id="s1031">They just got everywhere.</span> <span id="s1032">It was really nauseating.</span> <span id="s1033">And, uh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: And painful and uncomfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: Oh, yes, and of course getting up early to a cup of, what they would call coffee.</span> <span id="s1036">I was told that was made out of the rind of tree.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: Tree bark?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: Yeah, tree bark.</span> <span id="s1039">I think that is what I was told.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: Like a air sot coffee.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: Yes, something brown.</span> <span id="s1042">(laughs).</span> <span id="s1043">And, uh, hunger was indescribable.</span> <span id="s1044">It never ended.</span> <span id="s1045">And your body will adjust to the emptiness.</span> <span id="s1046">And, eventually, you don’t feel it anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: You had been hungry since you were a little child?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1049">So, we were working in this factory.</span> <span id="s1050">That was very strenuous, and long hours – 14 hours.</span> <span id="s1051">And, uh, I became ill with a, with an inflamed gall bladder, somehow.</span> <span id="s1052">There was a lady doctor from Czechoslovakia and there was a woman doctor from Russia.</span> <span id="s1053">And they, they.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: They were prisoners also?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1056">They were assigned to take care of things.</span> <span id="s1057">Medical things.</span> <span id="s1058">And, uh, they examined me.</span> <span id="s1059">And she pressed down and it was very painful.</span> <span id="s1060">And, uh, but, um, you were hoping to be allowed to go to the sick bay.</span> <span id="s1061">That wasn’t so easy, unless you were running a fever.</span> <span id="s1062">And I never did.</span> <span id="s1063">What I did have was a lot of pain.</span> <span id="s1064">And, uh, the girls around me, now by that time I had met a Polish girl who was very compassionate.</span> <span id="s1065">She was very, very sweet and another girl, a German girl, we were working together at one table.</span> <span id="s1066">And we had a foreman, a Polish man, he was also very nice and very friendly.</span> <span id="s1067">And he would, he would assure us that our things would be over soon.</span> <span id="s1068">And, the war was on, needless to say.</span> <span id="s1069">We could hear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: You could hear the bombings?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: We could hear the bombings and one night when the air raid, what do they call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: The air raid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: Yes, the air raid, when that was sounding, the SS would lock us up in the factories, and they would go to the shelters.</span> <span id="s1074">We would be locked up in this factory and the bombs would be coming all over us, but the factory was never bombed.</span> <span id="s1075">Um, you see, what we understand and were told later that the army was told just where factories with prisoners were located – that they should not bomb it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: Isn’t that amazing that they should do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: That took place most of the time, and what I heard later on.</span> <span id="s1078">And, uh, but it was so powerful.</span> <span id="s1079">There was, it was near Lipzig.</span> <span id="s1080">It was Freiburg, near Lipzig.</span> <span id="s1081">And Lipzig was a place that they wanted to hit hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: Lipzig was an important industrial town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: I’d like to ask you a question about your experiences.</span> <span id="s1085">You said people wanted to get sent to the hospital?</span> <span id="s1086">Were there medications available?</span> <span id="s1087">If someone needed surgery, was there a way to do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1089">I think surgery was performed, but, uh, I don’t remember where it was done.</span> <span id="s1090">Yes, surgery was performed, but, uh, I overheard a conversation between a Slavic women that experiments were conducted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: Uh, uh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: But that was still in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1093">These experiments were being conducted in Auschwitz, but they were talking about them later on in Dach(?)</span> <span id="s1094">.</span> <span id="s1095">Maybe one or two of these young women had been the victims of the experiments.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: There were a lot of sexual experiments done on women.</span> <span id="s1097">And children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: Yes, especially sterilization.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: Uh, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: So, um, oh, yeah, where was I now?</span> <span id="s1101">We were working, oh, yes, we were working.</span> <span id="s1102">I was very sick and it was very painful, but I was not sick enough to go to the sick bay.</span> <span id="s1103">And one afternoon I simply walked up to the, to the Oberstunker(?)</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: The overseer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: Yes, in uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: Uh, huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: He, he was, had mild manners and was soft spoken, he would just talk to us in a firm, not a cold manner.</span> <span id="s1108">He would tell us where to line up for roll calls, we were told to, I don’t know exactly what we were told.</span> <span id="s1109">But we were always told something.</span> <span id="s1110">At the roll call.</span> <span id="s1111">I would walk up to him one afternoon.</span> <span id="s1112">I used to be very shy.</span> <span id="s1113">Never even thinking of doing anything like that.</span> <span id="s1114">Could I be sent to the sick bay, because I am very sick and in great pain?</span> <span id="s1115">And he said, go back to work.</span> <span id="s1116">He didn’t want to shout, he, he made no, he, just said go back to work.</span> <span id="s1117">I had no chance to be privileged to go to the sick bay.</span> <span id="s1118">And I was suffering a lot of pain.</span> <span id="s1119">And one day a girl said your eyes are all yellow.</span> <span id="s1120">Your all yellow.</span> <span id="s1121">It evidently must have been the jaundice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: Jaundice?</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: Yes, resulting from the gall bladder.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: uh, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: And I couldn’t, when I heard of food, I even got sicker.</span> <span id="s1126">It was unbearable.</span> <span id="s1127">I was, it was really affecting me.</span> <span id="s1128">I couldn’t eat anything at all.</span> <span id="s1129">And, the foreman, he tried to be nice.</span> <span id="s1130">He brought me a little roll one morning.</span> <span id="s1131">And I don’t think I could eat it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: You must have been pitifully thin?</span> <span id="s1133">With all this deprivation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: Yes, I was.</span> <span id="s1135">We were all eighty pounders, I think.</span> <span id="s1136">But, uh, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: Do you remember when you heard the war had ended?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: Oh, it hadn’t ended yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: No, but when it ended do you remember what it was like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1141">I do.</span> <span id="s1142">I do.</span> <span id="s1143">Now we were working, and it was the cold of winter, and things were getting rough with the cold.</span> <span id="s1144">I mean we had nothing on our legs, and we were given little pieces of paper for the entire week to go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s1145">To be used.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: Toilet paper?</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: It wasn’t toilet paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">Q: Just any?</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">A: It was from magazines, from newspapers.</span> <span id="s1150">I was so cold and I just couldn’t tolerate it.</span> <span id="s1151">I used to, to cover my legs.</span> <span id="s1152">Now, the way we did it.</span> <span id="s1153">The first thing when we got hold of a blanket.</span> <span id="s1154">This had started in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1155">We would unravel the entire fringe part.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: The border.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: The outside.</span> <span id="s1158">The border.</span> <span id="s1159">(laughs).</span> <span id="s1160">It was the first thing the girls did.</span> <span id="s1161">To get a little thread to make that available for whatever it was needed for.</span> <span id="s1162">I would use a little bit to wind the paper around my legs.</span> <span id="s1163">I was so cold.</span> <span id="s1164">It was unbearable.</span> <span id="s1165">And the windows were open in the factory.</span> <span id="s1166">And we would stand there all day, and I had to finish a part called the, the rudder.</span> <span id="s1167">The rudder of the airplane.</span> <span id="s1168">I had to, I used a pressure hammer.</span> <span id="s1169">An air pressure hammer to go around the edges.</span> <span id="s1170">I don’t know what it is called.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: To fasten the edges together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1173">There is a term for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: Welding?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: Welding.</span> <span id="s1176">It is probably a type of welding.</span> <span id="s1177">Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1178">With a pressure hammer.</span> <span id="s1179">It would, it would press this little part you would put in the hole.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: Rivet?</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: Rivet?</span> <span id="s1182">Right.</span> <span id="s1183">And into a flat position.</span> <span id="s1184">It would hold it together.</span> <span id="s1185">This is what I had to do all day.</span> <span id="s1186">And, uh, the food was still scarce.</span> <span id="s1187">And sleep was impossible due to the bed bugs.</span> <span id="s1188">It was interrupted, and, uh, we had to work in shifts.</span> <span id="s1189">And the day shift wasn’t too bad.</span> <span id="s1190">But the shift that required you to get up at midnight was really a bit much to take.</span> <span id="s1191">But you get used to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: They had this in this country during the war, they called it the swing shift.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: Yes, you get used to many things.</span> <span id="s1194">So, we worked there and, around the middle of April I remember a girl, one of the girls, had overheard from her foreman.</span> <span id="s1195">He must have told her Roosevelt had died.</span> <span id="s1196">That was in the middle of April?</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A: I remember that day when what I didn’t know much about America.</span> <span id="s1199">I didn’t know much about politics.</span> <span id="s1200">And, um, one, uh, lady friend, that I was very close to.</span> <span id="s1201">She always told me, she always told to several of us, there will be an invasion and, things will finally end.</span> <span id="s1202">She must have known something.</span> <span id="s1203">But, uh, it was April, and things for the Germans were getting desperate.</span> <span id="s1204">And that was almost…</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: Could you tell that from the way they behaved or from the intensity of the bombing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1207">For one thing that we were told that we were going to leave this factory, and moving on.</span> <span id="s1208">Where to I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1209">We were put into this cattle train again.</span> <span id="s1210">For the next ten or fourteen days, I don’t recall.</span> <span id="s1211">It was a long time.</span> <span id="s1212">And, it was an open train.</span> <span id="s1213">Open.</span> <span id="s1214">And it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: Open on the sides or open on the top?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: On the top.</span> <span id="s1217">By then it was spring.</span> <span id="s1218">It was April and we traveling, I don’t know we were crisscrossing throughout Czechoslovakia again.</span> <span id="s1219">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1220">They were trying to get us out of that area probably.</span> <span id="s1221">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1222">We were never told anything.</span> <span id="s1223">(laughs).</span> <span id="s1224">But we were finally arriving after all these days in Malthausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: Malthausen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: Malthausen.</span> <span id="s1227">In Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: Which was in Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1230">In Austria.</span> <span id="s1231">That was a very large extermination camp again.</span> <span id="s1232">I didn’t know much about Malthausen.</span> <span id="s1233">It was towards the end of April.</span> <span id="s1234">And, uh, we were, I mean our condition was so poor.</span> <span id="s1235">We were probably not all realizing what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: You were probably more dead than alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: No, we were taken down somewhere into a lower area.</span> <span id="s1238">It was 180 steps down.</span> <span id="s1239">Into an area that was used originally to slaughter cattle, I think.</span> <span id="s1240">Because it had something like, it was a large area with faucets, water faucets, and it was made of stone, and it was I don’t recall, I only remember their taking us into this large room and we were lying down on the floor and that’s where we were lying until May 5th.</span> <span id="s1241">No food whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1242">I don’t recall any food, I don’t even recall going to the bathroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: Well, you wouldn’t have to if you had had no food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: No, we were laying on that floor, I remember that.</span> <span id="s1245">I remember one girl coming with some potato peel.</span> <span id="s1246">She was chewing on it.</span> <span id="s1247">And the next girl was chewing.</span> <span id="s1248">So we now have been without food for quite some time.</span> <span id="s1249">It was May 1st, or?</span> <span id="s1250">Then one morning, it would have been May 5th we were hearing some voices, some happy voices, like we had seen the white flag, or something, we are all free.</span> <span id="s1251">The war is over and we are all free.</span> <span id="s1252">So we were free, but we were laying on this floor and we didn’t know how to really get up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">Q: Down 180 steps you said?</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1255">And now up the 180 steps because there was nothing around for us to, to support us in any way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: And for days and days you had not seen fresh air or daylight.</span> <span id="s1257">Or had food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A: Daylight, yes.</span> <span id="s1259">There was daylight, but we were just on the floor, and we had to try and get up.</span> <span id="s1260">We were told the war is over and we were free and we were getting ready to.</span> <span id="s1261">I don’t know if we showed any emotion really.</span> <span id="s1262">From speaking for myself, I don’t remember anything.</span> <span id="s1263">We were looking for some clothes.</span> <span id="s1264">There was…I remember a pile of clothes and I found a…uh…English tweed coat with a KL painted on the back.</span> <span id="s1265">Well, I got hold of this coat.</span> <span id="s1266">I wanted to be sure I have something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: What would KL have meant?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: Koncentration Lager.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: Ah!</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: Lager.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: Actually painted on the fabric?</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s1273">Yes.</span> <span id="s1274">Well, I got hold of this and we were starting up those steps and when we arrived up there, we were met by some French – speaking people.</span> <span id="s1275">I don’t know…at least with a French accent…or…I don’t recall much of that…</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: Even though you were in Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: We were still lingering.</span> <span id="s1278">We didn’t know what to do next.</span> <span id="s1279">But then we were finally…we saw, we saw the first…oh yes.</span> <span id="s1280">I remember one thing very vividly.</span> <span id="s1281">On the outside, we saw a group of Americans.</span> <span id="s1282">American soldiers marching through the camp.</span> <span id="s1283">And, I saw the first black person, really…in my whole life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: In your whole life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1286">I didn’t realize much what it meant, but I remember that.</span> <span id="s1287">And, obviously, we were liberated by Americans, and followed 24 hours later by Russians.</span> <span id="s1288">In the same area, in the same camp.</span> <span id="s1289">They had met right there in Malthausen.</span> <span id="s1290">And, we were then…we remained, and we</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: Did you have any particular feeling, one way or the other, about being in the control of the Americans, or in control of the Russians?</span> <span id="s1292">Did you have any preference?</span> <span id="s1293">At that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A: No, I think we were…we were conversing with the Americans.</span> <span id="s1295">I think the Russians were not that much around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: Did you speak English at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: No.</span> <span id="s1298">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: How did you converse with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1301">I probably…must have picked up a few words.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q: Did they make food available to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1304">Well, they tried.</span> <span id="s1305">There wasn’t much, really.</span> <span id="s1306">I remember only some cheese that was full of bugs…full of worms.</span> <span id="s1307">It was…but, we had to have something…then, you know…when we were…then there was a Committee.</span> <span id="s1308">A Committee had been created.</span> <span id="s1309">I have I.D. from this camp, that tells them that I was liberated and the Committee had started to look after our repatriation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: Who made up the Committee?</span> <span id="s1311">Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: O. K. Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: I think one of the stamps tells me it was Sergeant Levy.</span> <span id="s1315">So, he, most probably was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1316">But the other man was German.</span> <span id="s1317">There were Germans in the camp too.</span> <span id="s1318">And, we…they made preparation…they were asking us where we want to go, and I couldn’t decide anything at all.</span> <span id="s1319">I had been told, in the meantime, that my mother…that transport had been gassed immediately, and, I…</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: When did you learn that?</span> <span id="s1321">While you were still in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: Yes, during that last…during the month that we were traveling, and all, being there, and, I could not decide what to do, and one of the girls that I became acquainted with only shortly, and she said, “Why don’t you come with me to Hamburg?”</span> <span id="s1323">And, that was then my decision to go with her.</span> <span id="s1324">Because, I was not what you call an independent person.</span> <span id="s1325">I was in need of having someone tell me what to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: Well besides that, I can see, given your situation, it would have been hard to know where to go because the places that had been home were no longer there for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s1328">Yah.</span> <span id="s1329">I was told that my city – my place of birth – was destroyed at least 80% and I had no desire, really, to go into such a situation.</span> <span id="s1330">Or, by myself, at least.</span> <span id="s1331">There was no other person from that same area.</span> <span id="s1332">So, I decided to go with her, and it took many weeks for us to get ready and leave.</span> <span id="s1333">We were…I don’t know…we were together with some other people, who were going in the same direction, and they suggested, “Why don’t we all stick together and we’ll just hitchhike to Hamburg from Austria.”</span> <span id="s1334">Which we did.</span> <span id="s1335">It took a long time and we arrived in Hamburg in…</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: Why would you have hitchhiked?</span> <span id="s1337">Did no one arrange for you to go home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: No.</span> <span id="s1339">Very difficult.</span> <span id="s1340">We went into Linz, Austria first and stayed there maybe, I don’t know where we were staying…we were all dumped out to places, and we must have been staying in one of those places.</span> <span id="s1341">I remember always remaining structures that were completely demolished, and we were…Oh, yah, that night, we came into an area, into the Russian zone, and we were a little bit, I don’t know why we felt this way, but we felt that they are a little more aggressive, and, I don’t know, but we felt…at least I did…I have to speak for myself…I don’t know…I didn’t know much about the Russians, but I heard they are a little bit on the wild side, and, uh, but they were…we met a very friendly group.</span> <span id="s1342">We met a general – a Russian general and I became acquainted with a Russian soldier.</span> <span id="s1343">He was a student from Moscow.</span> <span id="s1344">He started to talk to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Q: How did you get food during this time?</span> <span id="s1346">After you left the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1348">Now, this group…would go to a…I don’t know how they did this.</span> <span id="s1349">They would go to a certain place where people were assigned to hand out stamps or permission to receive some nourishment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">Q: Like ration stamps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1352">Something like that.</span> <span id="s1353">I have still the dates to prove it on that.</span> <span id="s1354">It is like a card.</span> <span id="s1355">Like a permission that you will seek, and that you will be treated fairly wherever you go from here on.</span> <span id="s1356">Because I was a prisoner of that camp, and so …so, we managed to gradually…we slept in farms.</span> <span id="s1357">We were traveling by train, partially.</span> <span id="s1358">We were walking a lot, and our feet were…my feet were so swollen I couldn’t get any shoes on.</span> <span id="s1359">And, we were eventually arriving in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s1360">This girl and I. she knew where to go.</span> <span id="s1361">We went to the Jewish Community Center and ask for assistance, which they gave us.</span> <span id="s1362">They gave us some money.</span> <span id="s1363">They gave us a place to…Oh, no.</span> <span id="s1364">She knew a family, because she was married, and her husband had not returned so far, and she took me there.</span> <span id="s1365">We stayed with that family and she went to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1366">She had broken her wrist during the war…during her stay in that camp, and it had not properly healed, so she decided to go to the hospital and have that corrected.</span> <span id="s1367">During that time, I was all by myself, not too independent, but I managed.</span> <span id="s1368">I…I uh, looked for a job.</span> <span id="s1369">That I remember.</span> <span id="s1370">I looked for a job, but it didn’t work out.</span> <span id="s1371">It was nothing much to speak of.</span> <span id="s1372">Somebody said, “Why don’t you go to this DP camp.</span> <span id="s1373">There is one on the outskirts of Hamburg, and you will meet some people – people, you know, that you will have something in common because they are all DPs”</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: Displaced persons?</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">A: Displaced persons.</span> <span id="s1376">So, I did.</span> <span id="s1377">And that…I think it was a Wednesday afternoon…I did arrive there and I was walking around when I met somebody I had previously met, and he introduced me to my future husband.</span> <span id="s1378">This is where I met my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A: That was…it was still ’45.</span> <span id="s1381">It was November…it was November or so, ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: So quite a few months had elapsed from the time of the end of the war in May until November?</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1384">It tool all that time to repatriate.</span> <span id="s1385">To return wherever a person wanted to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q; And, as I recall, when I talked to your husband, he said you were unable to emigrate for another four years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">A: Uh, hum.</span> <span id="s1388">Yes.</span> <span id="s1389">It…</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q: Now, before when we talked, before we started taping, you and your husband were saying that there were people that wanted at that point to be identified as Jews because you had to prove some things.</span> <span id="s1391">Would you repeat that again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">A: I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s1393">I don’t recall anything about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">Q: Do you want to come and tell us about this, Mr. Treitel?</span> <span id="s1395">You mean that there were people that tried to appear as Jews?</span> <span id="s1396">Do you know any specifics?</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">[male voice: Yes, I have it in writing.</span> <span id="s1398">Later, later…]</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: You said earlier there were two things you had to prove.</span> <span id="s1400">You had to prove you were Jewish… [male voice: From the…after the liberation, I had to prove that I am Jewish while we got from the American Joint rations and religious things that came over there, so I had to prove that I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s1401">How can they know I am not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1402">And, later, when we…before we emigrate to the United States, we had to prove that we are…that during the Nazi time, that we are not…no connection with any Nazi]</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: Activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q: O.K.</span> <span id="s1406">But you also started to tell us how people that weren’t Jewish wanted to be known as Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s1408">Yah, sure.</span> <span
