time.</span> <span id="s66">But my father was the only one in that wide area what he had college, because he was only son from that f -- you know, from that big farm.</span> <span id="s67">So he had

up on a hill, and was singing and yodeling, and I heard my voice back from the forest and I-I -- I was by myself and I just loved that.</span> <span id="s73">And I was just a happy young kid, that’s all I can say, you know?</span> <span id="s74">And I learned good in school, I was good in school.</span> <span id="s75">But later on it -- when the -- we got out of school, well we all had to work on the farm because the father need us.</span> <span id="s76">You know, couldn’t get any workers, and was hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: But when you got older, did you have some idea of what you would be later on?</span> <span id="s78">Did you see some kind of -- did you want to have a profession to do work, maybe, or did you see yourself --</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Mm, not really, we -- we -- that all we h -- were teached, you know, to be a farmer, that’s all, you know?</span> <span id="s80">Oh my God, you know, there is some -- some -- sometime -- some f -- I remember some friends from my father came over, also had big farm, and very well off, you know.</span> <span id="s81">They were saying, oh, they got a son, you know, I would like to have one of your daughters someday, you know, to -- my son marry your d -- one of your daughters, you know?</span> <span id="s82">You know, matching -- in the old da -- in them olden days they were matching up some younger people, but didn’t bother me that I didn’t -- that it doesn’t -- you know, don’t want to hear that.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Before Julian came on the scene, have you been in love a little bit?</span> <span id="s84">Did you know somebody --</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: No, I -- I know someone, yeah, and that was v -- a ver-ve-very big farm, but I di -- I didn’t -- really wasn’t interested, you know.</span> <span id="s86">So it was just a little -- maybe a little flirting, a little, you know, things, because I don’t know anybody else, but he was from a very, very good family.</span> <span id="s87">And they also had -- he had four sisters, and they were very similar to us, you know.</span> <span id="s88">But it was nothing, we were wha -- not involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Did you have -- did you have good friends, good girlfriends?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Oh yes, in school.</span> <span id="s91">We’re -- we didn’t -- oh, there were girls in our school, on our way to school what I still get mail from them now, that they were so proud that they were with us -- friends with us, and that we didn’t hate any -- any -- that we are better like them, you know, and don’t even -- not even cross our mind that we are better than others what they’re from a poor family, you know, we were just alike, you know, and we didn't had any -- any -- whatever reason to be -- be -- think ourselves too much or th -- whatever, you know, that we were regular.</span> <span id="s92">We wanted to be regular girls, yeah, to grow up, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: But anyway, your family had a large farm and your father -- there were hunting grounds as well [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Did you -- wh-what kind of social standing did your family have in that community, though?</span> <span id="s96">Did your father have any kind of positions in the community?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Well, he was a -- actually at that time was just a -- a -- there weren’t so many positions on a -- in -- on a -- on a -- in them days, you know, there was just a -- a mayor and a small office over there, and there was not -- but he was very respected.</span> <span id="s98">When there were m-meeting or the something, you know, like the farmer’s meeting or the something, he was all -- had to always be there, you know, that there -- well, he had that hunting area, all the whole area was -- belonged to -- to my grandfather, later on to my father, and it was about hundred years on a -- on a -- on that farm.</span> <span id="s99">And big rich guys from the city, or th -- whatever, they came on the farm hunting.</span> <span id="s100">And that’s why my father was so liked, and so popular and my father was a very educated, smart man, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Now, when -- when the National Socialists came to power, did your father have a party book too?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Well, he no want to, but he had to.</span> <span id="s103">That was like you have to belong to the party.</span> <span id="s104">If not, you’re not going to get any machinery, or the -- no workers.</span> <span id="s105">So they were actually forced to that, you know?</span> <span id="s106">But later on they had a meeting and that was something about I d -- I don’t -- I don’t know that, you know, but they -- my father didn’t like something what they said, you know, what [indecipherable] or whatever, and he just throwed that -- whatever here -- this -- that he belongs to the party.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: The membership book?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Membership book, yeah.</span> <span id="s109">He just throwed it into it, and he took off and -- and -- and he left.</span> <span id="s110">He said he never going to be back, he don’t want to belong to the party.</span> <span id="s111">So, that ma -- they gave him a real hard time, you know.</span> <span id="s112">We couldn’t get any workers, and machinery were hard to get.</span> <span id="s113">Just when you belong to the party.</span> <span id="s114">So there was already a tractor on a way for us, a big tractor, you know, to -- to -- that we get on the farm and that was very important.</span> <span id="s115">But then [indecipherable] my father have the tractor, just keep going on, just couple small machineries he got, you know, what he really, really needed, you -- and he really begged for it, you know.</span> <span id="s116">But they gave him a hard time.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: You also said in your videotaped interview that your brother was drafted into the army eventually.</span> <span id="s118">Whe -- when was that?</span> <span id="s119">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Not exactly d -- that -- that date when h -- when he left, you know, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: But the year?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Yeah, well, he had to go.</span> <span id="s123">They always were saying if you got one son, you’re not [indecipherable] be drafted.</span> <span id="s124">And for some reason that’s why he throwed that membership away.</span> <span id="s125">So they put my -- my brother had to go in the army.</span> <span id="s126">And that time he was in France.</span> <span id="s127">He came home once for -- for furlough and he got married, and he had to go -- when he go back, he had to go to Russia.</span> <span id="s128">He never, never came home.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Was -- was that -- do you remember, was that before Julian came to the farm, or was that while he was there?</span> <span id="s130">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: No, but -- I think Julian was already -- yeah, uh-huh, in a -- yeah -- I’m not sure the date, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: One -- one more question perhaps, with regard to political opinions of your parents.</span> <span id="s133">This was not the time probably, and especially not on a farm where talk was not that much, I guess you didn’t really talk all the time to each other because work was so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: No -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: But did you ever overhear, or did you know outright about political opinions of your -- of your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: It never, ever interested me, never ever, you know?</span> <span id="s137">And there were some friends came over to my father’s -- to our farm.</span> <span id="s138">Oh, my father had a extra room, he was not in -- in a -- in a big [indecipherable] every day, where the people are.</span> <span id="s139">Just extra room, with a office and -- and his [indecipherable] friends came, you know, they talk.</span> <span id="s140">When I was a kid, you know, I just heard them when they were talking [indecipherable] war.</span> <span id="s141">I mean, you know, such -- so ugly, you know.</span> <span id="s142">But we kids, we were -- actually we were never interested and never were told actually what is going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Did you -- did you feel sort of the op -- before the war, and then when the war broke out, sort of the -- the feel in the village or in the communities about the situation in -- in Europe or about the persecution of -- of people.</span> <span id="s144">Did you get to hear any of this, did you know how people felt?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Well, a -- everybody felt very bad about that war, why -- why something like that happened, see?</span> <span id="s146">All of us certain that was in September, I think it was, yeah, in September when they were saying the German marched into Poland.</span> <span id="s147">And th -- i-it is a war, a wa -- how come a war?</span> <span id="s148">You know, so everybody was shook -- shook up, you know.</span> <span id="s149">Why a war?</span> <span id="s150">Why they do that, you know?</span> <span id="s151">So that’s all I remember, I was a kid, you know, I was really unaware from -- you know, not interested actually, you know, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: And did you -- did you ever overhear anything about anti-Jewish, or anti-po -- anti-Slavic [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: I heard something when they were saying once that they’re -- they’re -- they’re -- what there was some Jewish store in Krieskiren where I usually -- we -- we went shopping Krieskiren, it’s a little bigger city.</span> <span id="s154">And there was some -- some -- some one -- a -- a clothing store, they were saying that he was arrested, for what?</span> <span id="s155">But tha -- we just heard that he was Jewish, what that go to do with it?</span> <span id="s156">See?</span> <span id="s157">And one guy I -- I remember he was friend with us, he always came on the farm.</span> <span id="s158">His name was Sibel, he used to bring to our house, to our farm, that soap, know, the smelling -- nice smelling soap and perfumes and things.</span> <span id="s159">He had a -- a store like that, but he always asked Mom to give him enough butter that he have enough butter and enough -- enough whatever he needs at home, and my mom always give it to him, you know.</span> <span id="s160">And he brought us special [indecipherable] girl, oh yes, we got a nice s-soap and a little bit of perfume for your girls, you know, and we were happy about that and we liked him a lot, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: And then -- and then Julian came one day.</span> <span id="s162">Your father had applied for workers because he lacked workers --</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: -- and he got -- you got two Polish workers who were working -- supposed to work on your farm.</span> <span id="s165">Did -- you -- you don’t -- do you know how it came that those two were chosen, by any chance?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Well, that -- the community, they were -- they were saying my -- my -- my -- my father had to put applications in to need some workers, and he did.</span> <span id="s167">He wanted more, but they decide to give him one.</span> <span id="s168">Then later on they said two because they really saw we needed -- we re -- really need workers because they all -- they all wants to go -- you couldn’t get Austrian workers because they’re all going to war, you know?</span> <span id="s169">And my brother also.</span> <span id="s170">And so they said not -- December eight, that there going to be -- got to be -- two Polish workers got to be picked up.</span> <span id="s171">So my father went and want to pick up the Polish workers.</span> <span id="s172">At the time they were saying from -- from Poland, to Austria, to Vienna, a -- such a snowstorm came, you know, so the train got stuck somewhere, they couldn’t get to Austria, you know.</span> <span id="s173">So my father was waiting, the -- all the farmers were there, they were waiting in -- in -- in [indecipherable] on a -- on a -- on a -- on a -- you know, on a ha -- s -- what the -- get the workers who -- they’re supposed to come in the office, and they had to go home because they didn’t came.</span> <span id="s174">Well, my father do -- was about four or five kilometer, almost five kilometer to walk home in that snowstorm, so he got real sick.</span> <span id="s175">He was -- had a bad cold.</span> <span id="s176">The next day he had said he -- he just can’t go, you know.</span> <span id="s177">And we need them workers, what we going to do?</span> <span id="s178">So he said Frieda, you want to go?</span> <span id="s179">I said, yeah, I go.</span> <span id="s180">We couldn't go with any -- any -- any horses or the -- or the wagon or the -- anything like that, so I had to walk and walk in that snow and there was no snowplowed or anything.</span> <span id="s181">And I walked for kilometers to get to this -- for the wor -- get the worker, yeah, workers.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: And then they started to work for you, and -- and you got to like Julian slowly.</span> <span id="s183">Did you like him right away, or was it a slow proce -- what did you like about him?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Well, actually, when -- when -- when th-the man in the unem -- unemployment off -- when the unemployment office said, you know, you get this worker and this worker.</span> <span id="s185">Doesn’t mean anything to me, you know, so okay, let’s go home.</span> <span id="s186">It got dark already, was almost 4:30, something like that.</span> <span id="s187">And that man from the -- from the unemployment office, he -- he know my father very well.</span> <span id="s188">I -- I n -- even thought about that he didn’t trust them two guys, you know, with a young girl to walk home for four kilometer in the dark.</span> <span id="s189">Never even came -- came to my mind, you know?</span> <span id="s190">He said, listen, I called taxi for you, you going to go home in a taxi with them two guys.</span> <span id="s191">So they all -- we almost got home with the taxi, but up on a hill there was so much snow that we have to walk, you know, we had to walk to the farm.</span> <span id="s192">And we did.</span> <span id="s193">And we came home to the farm, they all was waiting for -- for us.</span> <span id="s194">My mom had a big supper ready.</span> <span id="s195">My sisters were there, even my grandpa was there and my father.</span> <span id="s196">And we walked in, here they are, you know, so okay.</span> <span id="s197">My father, he knows a few words in Polish, right, because he was in the first World War, he was in Poland.</span> <span id="s198">And little by little, you know, they got -- you know, friendly, yeah, and -- but didn’t came into my mind that I had a -- you know, I really -- I just liked, you know, that we got workers, and got help on the farm, you know?</span> <span id="s199">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: So how did that change, though?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Well, he was very, very helpful, very f-friendly, Julian, you know?</span> <span id="s202">And we liked that, we girls, we really liked that, that he was friendly, and very pleasant and we got along good and things.</span> <span id="s203">But still, you know, gee, I would never, because you could never, ever -- they were saying, you know, don’t you ever get involved with someone -- they said, you shouldn’t eat even on the same -- by the same table.</span> <span id="s204">But my mom said no, not such a thing, she said, you know, you all -- we’re -- we -- we girls had to eat by the same table what the workers was wer -- eating.</span> <span id="s205">But Mom and Dad, they eat in the other room, you know, but you girls, we always -- and we did.</span> <span id="s206">We’re at the same table, eating at the same table.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: What did you like -- what did you like about Julian, though [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: I don’t know, he was friendly and happy and this and that, and I think we girls, we needed someone to, you know, to be nice, and bring some -- I don’t know, it’s just little by little, very little by little, and he was nice and -- and once we -- he helped me to carry something in the barn, you know, and he just -- just lean over and -- and -- and kissed me.</span> <span id="s209">I said, oh, don’t you dare, you know?</span> <span id="s210">He stole a kiss from me, you know.</span> <span id="s211">And gee, I got all shook up that he did that, I didn’t expect that, you know?</span> <span id="s212">And I didn't look at him for three days, I didn’t even look at him.</span> <span id="s213">I got so -- so scared.</span> <span id="s214">And then little by little, you know, he was nice, you know, really very, very gentle and little by little, we got -- yeah, like -- liked each other a little bit, you know.</span> <span id="s215">But, oh my gosh, this can’t happen, this is out of question, you know, this just --</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: You were very much aware of how dangerous this is?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Yes, oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s218">First of all, for myself and for him too, you know, because if they find out if I just mentioned something that he is friendly or something, you know, they would put him away and he would be gone forever, you know, so -- they were so strict that time, you know, so -- and I wouldn’t do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Then, at one day, you allowed him to listen secretly to the radio.</span> <span id="s220">Now that was also dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: It was also dangerous, yes, yeah, because it was just a -- from the big room would a -- where we usually eat, you know, was a door to the smaller room where my father had the radio, you know, that was very -- was just one radio in the house.</span> <span id="s222">And he wanted to listen to that, you know, and [indecipherable] I just keep the door unlocked and he went in and listened to that radio, you know.</span> <span id="s223">Nobody knew that, you know, so -- he didn’t do anything wrong, nor any harm, you know, but I -- I did let him do that, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: What wou -- I always have to ask why, but you know, so you were a young person, and -- but it was -- it was dangerous.</span> <span id="s225">Why did you -- I mean, it almost seems as if you were courting danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Why would you do that -- what --</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: I don’t know myself.</span> <span id="s229">I don’t know myself, you know.</span> <span id="s230">Little by little we fell in love, I think, you know, and that’s how it happened, you know.</span> <span id="s231">My father noticed that, m-my father -- and somebody else must too, you know, must -- somebody -- somebody else must have saw something.</span> <span id="s232">And my father said no, that can’t go on like that, and -- and once he did slap me, you know, and I was so hurt because it was my father what I loved so dearly and he loved me, too.</span> <span id="s233">And that --</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Did somebody see you -- did somebody --</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: -- see him while he was listening and [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s238">Somebody must have see us, you know, what -- we were friendly to each other, or whatever.</span> <span id="s239">Yeah, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: And then eventually your father called both of you -- first separately and then both --</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: -- of you into a room and gave you an ultimatum basically because --</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: -- it was too dangerous --</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: -- one of you had to leave, so you decided to -- to go --</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: -- and s-say that --</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: It was a big step for me, that was -- I knew if I don’t go that he is in danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Julian?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Julian is in danger, yes.</span> <span id="s252">And I couldn’t let that happen, I just couldn’t, you know?</span> <span id="s253">It’s something -- something tells you that, you know, it -- you -- you can’t do that, something -- something going to happen to him and he would be gone forever, you know?</span> <span id="s254">And so I said, I go.</span> <span id="s255">That was terrible, you know, it was a big st -- big step for me.</span> <span id="s256">And my father was stubborn too, you know, he said well, if you like that, you know, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Did anybody in the family try to hold you back or to change your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: No, my mom tried, you know, but some sisters even said, n -- n -- later on they were saying when -- if the -- if th -- I came home, they were saying, why don’t we stick together, why didn’t -- we were there for you?</span> <span id="s259">So they just let me go, just like that, you know, and I had no one to turn to.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: So Julian stayed on the farm --</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: -- and you went to another small farm, but you -- you --</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: No, actually, that was a big farm.</span> <span id="s264">It was a big farm, that first one.</span> <span id="s265">Was a big farm, yeah.</span> <span id="s266">And I was there, working there and somebody must have see us, or the -- something, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: So you cont -- you continued to see each other [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Yes, oh he came immediately, every Sunday, you know, yes.</span> <span id="s269">Like we said, you know, at that time, you know, when I left, we were saying that I know that that -- that gonna be far away, so far away it’s not in our area over here that they put me to work because you have not a choice what a -- the u -- employment office puts you, you have to go, you know, so there was no other choice.</span> <span id="s270">So I know that’s going to be in Eferding.</span> <span id="s271">And I sen -- I said, in Eferding going to be a church, I know that.</span> <span id="s272">And near the church over there we’re going to meet -- you’re going to be here at one o’clock, we going to see each other Sunday, that following Sunday.</span> <span id="s273">And that’s what had happened, a way -- we saw each other.</span> <span id="s274">He came, and we were very happy to saw each other, and that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: But then eventually you got denounced and you were arrested and you were interrogated by the Gestapo in -- in Linz?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: And you took the -- basically you took the blame on you that --</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Oh yes, oh yes, I took it --</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Say something a little more about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: Well, I take the blame on me, I -- I said, you know, well, was nothing actually -- it was nothing wrong, you know, he just came as a friendly, you know, friend and told me what’s going on at home because I wanted to know what’s going on at home.</span> <span id="s281">And there’s -- they said then later on -- I said that was not his fault, and we didn’t do anything wrong, so that’s how that time they couldn’t prove it, and then they said I -- I -- I was there I think 11 days, something like that, and they lef -- let him go Friday and they kept me over the weekend that we don’t meet because they gave him a -- a-a -- a job far away, that wa -- in completely different direction, and me too, you know, so I already had that place that was on a small farm way up on a hill by the woods, but you know, you couldn’t -- it’s just a -- a -- a -- a lost town, you know, really.</span> <span id="s282">They put me there what nobody would find me over there, into a farm, you know.</span> <span id="s283">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: So you had to sign papers though, both of you, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: Oh yes, we had to --</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: -- you would never see each other again.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: -- right, we’d never see each other again.</span> <span id="s288">And I signed the paper, you know, I hadn’t a lot of choice.</span> <span id="s289">And I thought, my gosh, you know, I not going to fi -- we find -- no find each other anyway again, you know, that’s all.</span> <span id="s290">I felt like I was lo-lost, you know, so I -- they let me out Monday morning about 9:30, something like that, and I walked around on a train station, there were a lot of people there, and all kind of people, was a big train station in Linz.</span> <span id="s291">And I thought, my gosh, where I am going now, so -- what going to happen to me now?</span> <span id="s292">And then I looked up, oh my gosh, it was like a miracle, you know?</span> <span id="s293">Julian walked in from another train that came out, you know, came on for -- for another station.</span> <span id="s294">I couldn’t believe it, you know, that was like God dropped him down from the heaven, you know, and that at least I’m not alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: And then you decided to see each other again after all?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: Yes, immediately.</span> <span id="s297">He had my address where I go, and I had his, you know?</span> <span id="s298">I said, where we going to be, no matter what, you know, this next Sunday, with the bi -- our bicycles, we had our bicycles, we going to be by -- by Lanstrasser.</span> <span id="s299">From Linz to Wells, up, you know, that’s -- that’s Lanstrasser, that’s a beautiful --</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: It’s a count -- count -- it’s a country road kind of --</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: It’s from the country, it’s from Gunskirchen, goes to Wells, and it’s a big, big road to Linz, that’s a -- a very popular street.</span> <span id="s302">And that’s where we found each other then, you know, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: But eventually you were denounced again.</span> <span id="s304">The farmer where you worked found out earlier, but he decided not to say anything, but when you decided to give up work on the farm --</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: -- he denounced you and you were interrog -- you were brought again to the Gestapo and you were interrogated, and this time I think you had to stay a little longer, but I need to change cassette, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Mm-hm, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: -- we’ll talk about that.</span> <span id="s309">This is the end of tape one, side A, interview with Frieda Noga.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Frieda Noga.</span> <span id="s312">This is tape number one, side B.</span> <span id="s313">So you were back in Linz at the Gestapo headquarters and this time the situation was more serious because you had already signed papers that you would never see him again, and the interrogation was -- was much more harsh.</span> <span id="s314">And what -- what happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Right.</span> <span id="s316">Well, one, the Gestapo took me, and interviewed me.</span> <span id="s317">They -- they showed me -- they told me that I was already here, that I must -- you know, second time here and that was more serious.</span> <span id="s318">And how come, what happened?</span> <span id="s319">And you sees -- sees -- see still that Pole, you know, they were saying, you know, to make him -- you know, make me -- humiliate me, you know?</span> <span id="s320">And I said, well, you know, once in awhile, you know, we are friends, and things.</span> <span id="s321">Then -- then later on they were saying what -- you know, to -- to force it out on me, you know, that you had something to do with him, you know.</span> <span id="s322">It was no other way, you know, that just force it out of me there’s some poss -- well, yes, I had something to do with him, we had something to do each other.</span> <span id="s323">Okay, that’s about it.</span> <span id="s324">But, I said, it’s my fault.</span> <span id="s325">I took it on me, blame on me, and I -- I thought that going to be better for Julian, you know, because if it’s the opposite then -- then to take it out on him, and they’re going to -- I know they’re going to -- not going to kill me.</span> <span id="s326">I know that, I was sure, you know.</span> <span id="s327">But I took it -- everything on me, on -- that is everything my fault, you know, that we got together and had something to do with each other.</span> <span id="s328">And -- okay, so they -- they were saying, you know what’s -- what’s going to happen to you, you’re going to be black and blue, and you’re going to be sent to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s329">Well, I had nothing to say, you know, so what I could say?</span> <span id="s330">And I got back to the prison cell again, only in two days, I remember, my father came to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s331">And he talked with them.</span> <span id="s332">He had a lot of friends over -- you know, some people told him, you know, to go there and do something about it.</span> <span id="s333">And my father came, he wanted to see me, so they called me out from the cell, and a special -- there were a special room where you visit us and my father was there, I was scared to death, you know.</span> <span id="s334">And then -- he was very gentle to me.</span> <span id="s335">He said, what happened?</span> <span id="s336">He said, please tell me the truth, he said, you got to tell me the truth.</span> <span id="s337">If you tell -- you -- nothing happened between you two, you know, and I do anything to get you out of here, you know, get you home.</span> <span id="s338">Did you -- what you say?</span> <span id="s339">I said, yes, we ha -- da -- we had something to do with each other.</span> <span id="s340">Then he was just shook up.</span> <span id="s341">He said -- he hugged me and hold me for awhile.</span> <span id="s342">He said, I can’t help you now, he said.</span> <span id="s343">And he was very sad about it.</span> <span id="s344">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: But that you took the blame on yourself, that you were the one who initiated the relationship --</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: -- that actually really saved Julius, because otherwise --</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: -- if he had -- if -- if -- if they thought that he was th -- had started the whole thing --</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: -- they would have killed him?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: Oh yeah, definitely, definitely, yeah.</span> <span id="s353">Because they killed many out -- and in [indecipherable] they were saying they were -- they were saying that some of them were hanged out in the woods, and some Polish people have to come and see it, how they were hanged in the woods, you know, because he had something to do with German girl, and on -- once they were saying that was a -- a German girl in some town far away from us.</span> <span id="s354">A German girl that she had something to do with a Polish young man, and then there were a nasty mayor over there in that town.</span> <span id="s355">They shaved her head, put her on a wagon, and with -- on a h -- on the horse, and drove her around in town.</span> <span id="s356">And that there was a sign up there, I had sexual something to do with a Polish Auslander [indecipherable] yeah, foreigner, you know?</span> <span id="s357">And that was terrible, that was just ugly, you know, it was -- and that was -- you know, heartbreaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: But --</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: But at least it didn’t happen to me like that, you know, so I was glad that they didn’t put me out in the open like that.</span> <span id="s360">So they were saying that I got to go to the concentration camp, and they were -- we were about seven or the -- eight girls there, all the same problem, all -- all the same thing they had in a cell, all the same thing, you know?</span> <span id="s361">And they said, well that’s all it is, you know.</span> <span id="s362">If we survive, we survive, if not, you know, then that’s it, you know?</span> <span id="s363">And then I was there til November, in the Gestapo, locked up.</span> <span id="s364">And then they came, I had to signed a pink slip -- a pink paper, sign my name.</span> <span id="s365">And that was -- dos -- th-that slip was for the concentration camp, that I got a -- they sent me to concen -- yeah, I will know it, you know, if they come with the pink slip, they know that’s a concentration camp, and I was one of them, you know.</span> <span id="s366">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Did -- did you -- have you heard -- what did you know about concentration camps at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s369">Nothing.</span> <span id="s370">Just supposed to be bad there, that’s all.</span> <span id="s371">I didn’t know where it is, I never know where is Ravensbrück, they were saying to Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s372">I never know where is Ravensbrück, and I didn't know what is there, what’s going on over there on -- we’ll see, you know, so I -- I went along the way there, the [indecipherable] pushed me along, that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Ha-Had you heard about what kind of people were supposed to be in concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Well, at -- what happened when they took us there, the -- on a train to Salzburg, and when we went through the station, through the train station, the police, you know, we were all transport by police to -- one were in front, on the side, on -- they had the -- the -- the -- the army guns [indecipherable] we were heavy, were -- I don’t know, murderers or th -- something, you know.</span> <span id="s375">And some people were there in the train station, older people and a lot of people, what happened, what happened, what kind of people are this, you know?</span> <span id="s376">And, well they go to the concentration camp, the police were saying, you know.</span> <span id="s377">Oh, they don’t want to work?</span> <span id="s378">Oh.</span> <span id="s379">And they start spitting on us, you know, and -- some of them, you know, some of them.</span> <span id="s380">And then they took us, we were -- stayed there in Salzburg in a cell for a day.</span> <span id="s381">The next day we went on to Munich, and in Munich we stayed two days, or or the -- three days, something like that.</span> <span id="s382">And Dresden we stayed a couple of days over there because other trains what were coming together, you know, it was a -- a big, big thing, you know, big transport.</span> <span id="s383">And then we went into Leipzig.</span> <span id="s384">Leipzig, you know, in Leipzig I was very, very -- no, i-in Dresden, I think, in Dresden I was very, very sick.</span> <span id="s385">I had a cold, you know, because it was the winter.</span> <span id="s386">Was raining and snowing and blowing and everything and -- and in a cattle train, you know, was no heat in there, nothing, you know.</span> <span id="s387">And then in a cell I was -- I just thought, you know, hi -- I was shaking, I was very cold, I had the chills, you know.</span> <span id="s388">And they brought the f -- some food in here, some soup, whatev -- whatever.</span> <span id="s389">I couldn’t even look at it, you know, I couldn’t eat nothing, you know?</span> <span id="s390">Then they saw that I was really sick, I mean, you know, that lady what took care of the cell, she was saying something, you know, she’s sick, you know?</span> <span id="s391">So she brought me two pills.</span> <span id="s392">I don’t know what was -- what the two pills.</span> <span id="s393">And I took them two pills and in about two hours I got up and I was feeling good, and by day -- the next day we went on the transport and went to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s394">They must be two aspirin, or something, or the -- whatever, two -- two pills to get me up on my feet, you know?</span> <span id="s395">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: So what -- when did you arrive in ravens -- Ravensbrück?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: In Ravensbrück we arrived November 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: What year?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: ’41, I thin -- I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s400">I got mixed -- get mixed up in them years already.</span> <span id="s401">And they took us from the train station, on open trucks, and they took us and it was cold, and windy and snowy, and we had to march, it was dark already, a concentration camp, oh my gosh, they’re going through the -- through the -- through the whole thing, you know, we went in there, was all kind of barracks here, and hardly could see anything because it was almost dark already.</span> <span id="s402">And then they took us somewhere downstairs, somewhere in a -- in a tunnel.</span> <span id="s403">And when we walked downstairs I got scared, it was the most scary things.</span> <span id="s404">They were like on a -- on a -- on a -- when you walk down it, alls you could see was caskets.</span> <span id="s405">What the caskets are doing here, why?</span> <span id="s406">We were so unexperienced, you know, so we didn't know what’s going on here.</span> <span id="s407">All caskets there, and then we were -- we went down even lower and there were cells, there were concrete floor, was cold down there.</span> <span id="s408">There were cells there to put us in there, and we heard some screaming, hollering, a girl was please help, please help.</span> <span id="s409">And the dogs were barking and screaming, we -- we thought, what happened, what happened, what is this, with -- you know if -- if you -- if you -- you don’t know what’s going on here.</span> <span id="s410">But then in a little while she -- little by little she stopped screaming.</span> <span id="s411">The -- the [indecipherable] master killed her or something, you know, that’s what we thought, but it sound like it, you know.</span> <span id="s412">The next day they brought us up and we were -- I had to go in a -- go for a shower and get the clothing over there, and the concentration camp clothing.</span> <span id="s413">And they said we going to go on a block 16, that was the [indecipherable], the -- the newcomer block.</span> <span id="s414">And we were -- all went there, the -- the block 16 and from block 16 later on, they took whatever they got room for, for the prisoner what they coming, the new ones.</span> <span id="s415">And from block 16, when they called us, they called me and other girls, they called us.</span> <span id="s416">You be -- you gotta come up to the [indecipherable] you know, we gotta come up there, you know.</span> <span id="s417">So they shaved us, because we were the Polish -- you know, the -- we had something to do with Polish young men, so they put us to shame, you know, they shaved our hair up.</span> <span id="s418">And that was the biggest shock to me in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: So, when this -- when the people s-s-spit on you on your way to the camp, it seemed that people thought that --</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: We were good for nothing girls, just nothing, we’re just a -- bad gir -- bad pe -- people that don’t want to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Oh, they thought that lazy people went to camps --</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: -- and -- and criminals, probably --</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: -- so when you were there you found out that was different.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Yes, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: What -- what kind of people did you meet there?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Well, usually there were a lot of -- there were on -- one block Jewish, and two -- I think two blocks Gypsies.</span> <span id="s429">They had their -- all their own block, you know, certain numbers.</span> <span id="s430">And there were a couple blocks about the -- the Jehovah Witness.</span> <span id="s431">Jehovah Witnesses.</span> <span id="s432">And criminals and what the people what had the -- the [indecipherable] their times and then they them out.</span> <span id="s433">They -- they have to -- they put them in the concentration camps, you know, certain people what they had problem with the -- the law, yeah.</span> <span id="s434">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Well, i-in -- in the videotaped interview you talked in some detail about your experience in Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s436">So first you had to work outside and it was really, really difficult and cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: Then they were looking for seamstresses, and you passed yourself off as one.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: And it was -- it was a little easier.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: How long -- how long did you stay actually, in Ravensbrück?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: I stay in Ravensbrück f -- til about in August, en -- end of August, I think it was, or the September, something like that.</span> <span id="s444">I forgot.</span> <span id="s445">I really forgot the date already.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: So that was -- that was about a half -- a half a ye-year?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: No, more than that, I think was 10 months or 11 months, something like that, yeah.</span> <span id="s448">Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: And then you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: 11 months.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: -- then you were let go.</span> <span id="s452">Was that unu -- that was unusual?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Very un -- no, it was very unusual.</span> <span id="s454">All of a sudden -- we went to work and some SS lady came with the dog, and -- on my -- on the job where I was working she called out my number [indecipherable] that means 8446, that was my number, there was no -- no name called, just the number.</span> <span id="s455">Yeah, it was me, what -- this what happened.</span> <span id="s456">So that lady wa -- she was in the -- our chief, you know, at work, our boss lady.</span> <span id="s457">She was saying, is it you?</span> <span id="s458">What happened to you?</span> <span id="s459">What did you do?</span> <span id="s460">I said, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s461">And so I had to go with her, because nobody expect that I go free, you know, so [indecipherable] was something unusual.</span> <span id="s462">Oh, she said, we’re going to go in a [indecipherable] to -- to the SS chief, and I -- w -- I thought, you know, my God, you know, to -- to execute me or something [indecipherable] or to put me someplace else, what did I do?</span> <span id="s463">And then he told me, you know, you’re lucky.</span> <span id="s464">You dumb lucky girl, she said -- he said, you know.</span> <span id="s465">You know what?</span> <span id="s466">You’re going home, you go free.</span> <span id="s467">To me it was like a -- a -- you know, something from heaven.</span> <span id="s468">But they said, you’re going to go home to your parents.</span> <span id="s469">I thought, oh my God, I -- I’m homesick already, you know, but what I gonna have to face over there, though?</span> <span id="s470">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Did -- did you find out what happened?</span> <span id="s472">How it -- how it came that you got to be free?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s474">Well, when I got home, I remember they put me on a train and they took me on a train and she must have bought the ticket or th -- something, the -- they had to sit there in a train, to go to Austria.</span> <span id="s475">And that was about oh, about a six hour ride, something like that, far, far away, you know?</span> <span id="s476">So, I thought what happen now, I -- I just, please God, do with me what you think is right, you know, so I went to Austria, to Wells, it was still a little bit -- it was light out, it was still about four o’clock in the afternoon, something like that, five o’clock in the afternoon, it was light out.</span> <span id="s477">I was -- that nobody see me, I had no hair on my head, it was shaved, you know, that they’ll see that something -- I come fr-from a prison or -- or something, you know, I looked terrible.</span> <span id="s478">I was running on the side, you know, or -- from the -- from the train station.</span> <span id="s479">I was going somewhere to hide, there were some benches over there, a little park, you know.</span> <span id="s480">I was waiting, you know, I was sitting, there was nobody in the park, was nobody there, so I was sit there.</span> <span id="s481">I had the -- the continuing train, I had at eight o’clock, something like that, to go home to Krieskiren because the tr -- you gotta take another train from there.</span> <span id="s482">And to Krieskiren, the train gonna be there probably about eight, 8:30 or something like that.</span> <span id="s483">And I thought, oh my God, and that’s not going to be dark, you know, if somebody see me, everybody knows me, a lot of people know me in that hometown over there, on the train station, oh my, okay, I went home, scared like anything.</span> <span id="s484">And then I went -- Krieskiren I got out and I -- immediately I -- I didn’t go inside of the train because I was -- you know, somebody might see me.</span> <span id="s485">I went right on the side down in a f -- in a -- in the bushes, so I’m hiding away, and we’re going to a road what goes, you know, just the forest over there, and I was hiding out there, you know.</span> <span id="s486">And I was waiting til it’s really dark.</span> <span id="s487">And then it was -- after 10 o’clock, something like that, I started walking home, you know, what gonna happen now at home?</span> <span id="s488">And I -- it was -- from there it was about four kilometer to walk home, I did go home.</span> <span id="s489">And on the way home, on a -- not far from the hou -- from the house, about a half a kilometer from the house -- in Austria is that -- that ha -- thing when you meet somebody on the road to say goodnight, and I meet a -- i-it was a person go walking, said goodnight, and I said goodnight, you know, and I was afraid, you know, that then they recognized me.</span> <span id="s490">So I came to the farmhouse -- to the house, and I know what the -- the hofe door is the big, big door, you know?</span> <span id="s491">The other doors are locked, but this hofe door, I know how to open it, you know, so I open it, you know, and I heard a dog coming, the dog was barking, and I named him by the name.</span> <span id="s492">Immediately he know me, he recognized me, and that -- the other one came, we had the big hunting dog, too.</span> <span id="s493">The other one came and recognized me too, I called him by the name.</span> <span id="s494">So we went inside, everybody’s quiet, dark, cause everybody’s sleeping, you know.</span> <span id="s495">So I went upstairs.</span> <span id="s496">First I looked around in the house, oh my God, you know?</span> <span id="s497">I went upstairs, what I gonna do?</span> <span id="s498">I went through -- around through the -- in the other room and through the doors, my sisters were sleeping, I heard them sleeping there.</span> <span id="s499">Through the other door another sister was sleeping, and I went -- I want to see my mother.</span> <span id="s500">I went to my mother and I kissed her.</span> <span id="s501">She said Frieda, it’s you.</span> <span id="s502">I said yeah.</span> <span id="s503">She clung [indecipherable] was sleep and heard him snoring.</span> <span id="s504">And she said come on, come on.</span> <span id="s505">And so we di -- went down to the kitchen together.</span> <span id="s506">My sisters heard something was going on, so they all came down to the kitchen downstairs.</span> <span id="s507">Oh my God, that’s you, that’s you.</span> <span id="s508">They were happy.</span> <span id="s509">But then they saw what happened to my head, I had no hair.</span> <span id="s510">They felt sorry, but Mom -- Mom said, make something hot for you, you want something to eat?</span> <span id="s511">I said no.</span> <span id="s512">Some hot to you -- for you, some hot cocoa, some hot tea.</span> <span id="s513">I just drinked a little bit, you know, what my mother gave me.</span> <span id="s514">That was about it, and then I went to sleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: So nobody -- nobody knew that you were coming, or when you were coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: What -- when you -- when your father -- when you saw your father, how di -- how did he -- how wa -- how was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: The next day in the morning, my mom said that it’s the room over there downstairs, you gonna sleep out there, and I have to sleep upstairs.</span> <span id="s519">So okay.</span> <span id="s520">There’s a extra room down there.</span> <span id="s521">And then I was afraid to get up to face my father -- anyway it -- people, you know, too, whatever, the way I look, where I came from.</span> <span id="s522">And I didn’t want to get up.</span> <span id="s523">Then my father came to me.</span> <span id="s524">Said, I’m so glad to see you.</span> <span id="s525">You’re home.</span> <span id="s526">He kissed me.</span> <span id="s527">Said, get up.</span> <span id="s528">That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: Did you -- did you find out later how it was possible for you to get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s531">You know, I just knew mis -- when my -- my sister later on was saying Dad had lot of connection so that he could get you out, now.</span> <span id="s532">But I was young, you know, and things you know, what kind of connection, there must be something, you know.</span> <span id="s533">I’m glad I’m out -- I’m out here, see.</span> <span id="s534">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: In -- in your videotaped interview, you also said that your father at one point at least said, you know, oh God, what -- what have you done to us.</span> <span id="s536">But did you learn whether there were in fact, some -- some real effect on your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: Were there repercussions?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: Oh yes, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: Talk about that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s542">Well, first of all my sisters, when they went someplace or th -- something, you know, that my father, oh Frieda is in a concentration camp, you know, this and that, she had something to do with a Pole, you know?</span> <span id="s543">And that time it was embarrassing, humiliating, and -- to them, not on -- to my parents also, you know?</span> <span id="s544">And when sometimes some -- my sisters, they g -- they went someplace, somewhere [indecipherable] doing, so the -- there was some [indecipherable] you know.</span> <span id="s545">One time some people were asking, you know, is that true that Frieda came home from the concentration camp?</span> <span id="s546">They say yeah.</span> <span id="s547">Well, you shouldn’t be embarrassed about, that’s her side, you know, sh -- that’s not you fault.</span> <span id="s548">That they were saying to the girl -- to my sisters, you know?</span> <span id="s549">And I was like, you know, when -- first time I don’t want to even go to church, nothing.</span> <span id="s550">I went on a Sunday sometime in the afternoon far away to a chapel and -- instead of going to church to [indecipherable] in -- in Michaelnbach.</span> <span id="s551">And then later on when somebody saw me they were saying, did you -- did you see her?</span> <span id="s552">She came back, did you saw her?</span> <span id="s553">I felt like a -- a terrible criminal, you know?</span> <span id="s554">I felt terrible.</span> <span id="s555">And -- but little by little, then later on, my hair were growing back and my mom said, no go down in that village, you know, who -- everybody knows you and knows us.</span> <span id="s556">Go -- it was hard for -- for someone to take you ahead -- you know hairdresser, you know, what they fix the hair?</span> <span id="s557">Said, go to Wells, that’s far away.</span> <span id="s558">Drive over there, I give you some butter, give you some meat, you know.</span> <span id="s559">If they’re not take you -- they -- they gonna take you if you give them that butter, because meat that -- money that time wasn’t important, just like meat and all that, you know, butter, you know, people in a city, they look forward to get something.</span> <span id="s560">So they took me and I went inside at this hairdresser and she looked at me, you know, he looked -- I look kind of funny, you know, see what happen.</span> <span id="s561">And then I give her -- I didn't say anything, I didn’t have to answer her.</span> <span id="s562">And then she did my hair, she gave me a permanent, and I came home and little by little I looked better every day.</span> <span id="s563">And then I start going even -- some friends saw me also, you know, go -- but I always feel so guilty, I was the guilty black sheep, you know, I was just bad girl or the -- something, I don’t know, you know.</span> <span id="s564">But I wonder what happened to Julian.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: Well, and then what’s -- I wanted to ask you -- so not all of your friends from -- from the earlier days left you alone, they also were still friends to you, some of them at least?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: Well, certain distance.</span> <span id="s567">Certain distance, you know?</span> <span id="s568">Yeah.</span> <span id="s569">But that was some dark clouds over, I noticed that, I see that, you know, so it wasn’t the same like it was, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s570">Because that time they didn't understood, you know?</span> <span id="s571">Now it’s entirely different, you know, now they are writing to me, the school friends and everybody, you know, they’re so happy for us and everything.</span> <span id="s572">But them days, you know, they were different times.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: But then one day you did hear actually from somebody who had a card from Julius, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: Well, a -- the -- a Polish guy that -- Polish guy still working on our farm, you know?</span> <span id="s575">The Polish guy what they had -- what -- what Julian came, you know, he was still working on that farm, you know?</span> <span id="s576">I remember once he was saying, you know, wh-when the war is over, when I going to go home, what I gonna told Julian’s mother how Julian died, you know?</span> <span id="s577">And what I gonna tell him?</span> <span id="s578">I had no answer for that, you know, I was hurting.</span> <span id="s579">And he received a card from Julian, you know, and that just happened that the mailman came, and well, he received some mail also from Poland, that Polish guy [indecipherable] a -- a card from Julian, and he said to me, look I got a -- a -- a -- a card from Julian.</span> <span id="s580">I said oh my God, where is he?</span> <span id="s581">And that said, concentra -- concentration camp Flossenbürg.</span> <span id="s582">Oh my God, you know.</span> <span id="s583">What we gonna do, how we gonna -- we gotta do something about, how we gonna help him, you know.</span> <span id="s584">So I wrote a card, and everything in secret, nobody knows, you know?</span> <span id="s585">And I told him to mail it out.</span> <span id="s586">I was saying I’m okay, I’m all -- I’m doing fine, and I’m healthy, and how about you?</span> <span id="s587">And please be strong [indecipherable] keep your head high, you know?</span> <span id="s588">And I put down, Uncle Franz, un -- Uncle Franz.</span> <span id="s589">And that way he recognized my s -- my -- my writing, Julian.</span> <span id="s590">We sent it to -- to that was the address, that -- that time I know he’s alive, you know.</span> <span id="s591">And then I thought oh my God, and th -- I thought to send him a package, you know, th -- something.</span> <span id="s592">And I -- I did -- I’m in a secret -- secretly I had a big box, you know, everything in hiding, in se -- that my sisters couldn’t see it, you know?</span> <span id="s593">And we all had our closet in a -- and all -- all our girls had our own closet, you know, and I had everything hiding in my closet in a big box.</span> <span id="s594">My sisters were going someplace and I was all by myself and that was in the fall.</span> <span id="s595">There was some pears [indecipherable] you know, they were really hard when you pick them, and in about three, four weeks they gonna get soft, you know?</span> <span id="s596">And some apples, you know, that were picked, it was in -- in s -- in October, something like that.</span> <span id="s597">And I put -- I rolled everything in a [indecipherable] to -- in a big box, and then I found still was some holes missing, I put some onions in there, I know that the onions are, you know, healthy for you.</span> <span id="s598">And I found a little bit of tobacco from my father, you know, put it on the side, you know, put mi -- mi -- a -- fill up the package.</span> <span id="s599">And packed that and put the address on and -- and I said to Franz, you gonna take this on the post office.</span> <span id="s600">He said, how I gonna -- how I gonna do that?</span> <span id="s601">You know?</span> <span id="s602">I said, I gonna give you a little bit schnapps -- because he used to like to drink -- give you a little bit of schnapps in a little bottle, and you gonna take this to -- but not here in our area, you have to go far away with this -- with this package, that they don’t know, hey, concentration camp does something, you know, who is this, you know?</span> <span id="s603">But over there in the post office, they don’t pay attention, it’s far away, it’s a big city, you know.</span> <span id="s604">And he did.</span> <span id="s605">And later on I found out that Julian received this package.</span> <span id="s606">Made me very happy.</span> <span id="s607">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: But you -- but you never knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: I never know, no.</span> <span id="s610">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: Well, maybe this is a good time -- oops -- this is a good time to say that this is the end of tape one, side B, interview with Frieda Noga.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Frieda Noga.</span> <span id="s614">This is tape number two, side A.</span> <span id="s615">So you didn’t hear -- after the package -- after you sent the package, you didn't really hear anything from Julian, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: No, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s617">Didn’t hear anything, just I keep praying the he gonna make it, that he gonna come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: And then one day the war was over --</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: -- and he actually did come back, and showed up at your door.</span> <span id="s621">Tell a little bit about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Yeah, that was in May, 18, I remember.</span> <span id="s623">And it was -- the -- the war -- when -- is -- was over in March 23, and I thought, I wonder if he come -- come here, or the -- it -- if he survived, and things, you know, and I keep thinking about it, you know, if he made it, you know, over there in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s624">And then it was already March, April, May.</span> <span id="s625">No, no, he not gonna come, that’s too long already, he would be here by now, you know.</span> <span id="s626">So, that was one day in a -- I think it was Friday or the Saturday evening, Saturday evening it was, May 18, and -- 1945, and I was -- it was a beautiful evening, the birds were singing in the -- in the -- in the big yard -- in the -- in the hofe out there, you know.</span> <span id="s627">And a -- I was sitting out there on a big bench, it was about seven -- seven during the evening.</span> <span id="s628">And my sisters were in the house, and I was sitting out there in a big bench, I was thinking, you know, what -- what my life gonna be.</span> <span id="s629">And isn’t much worth it, you know, so how my life gonna be, and things, and then I was thinking, my God, Julian not gonna -- he not -- he didn’t survived, he didn't make it, but how I can get in touch with his mother, because I know his mother loved him so much, and he was very close with his mother, that I’d want to let her know that he was not a criminal, that he was a good man, and that he lost his life because he loved me.</span> <span id="s630">And to let her know that.</span> <span id="s631">If he didn’t -- maybe he came back to Poland, you know, so I wasn’t sure, maybe he went straight to Poland from the concentration camp if he is alive.</span> <span id="s632">And I was thinking like that, and -- and the doorbell’s ringing.</span> <span id="s633">My sister went out -- out to the -- answer the door, the big door, and then she said, Julius, and when I heard that word, there’s just one Julius, you know, what I know.</span> <span id="s634">My God, this is unbelievable, that must be him, you know.</span> <span id="s635">And I came running up to the door, and that was him with another friend, both of them on a bicycle, you know.</span> <span id="s636">I said, oh my God, you’re here, and then he -- we hugged, and my sister stood there, and she went -- she went in the house, and we talked for awhile and then we said well, tomorrow we gonna meet somewhere, and that’s how I was so very happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: Did you feel that you still had to meet secretly, or did you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: Well, it was -- i-it wasn’t against the law any more, I know that, you know, but I don’t think my father would be very, very happy, but, you know, maybe, you know, it isn’t that bad like it was before, you know, we’ll see, you know, what gonna happen, you know?</span> <span id="s639">And we didn’t give up with each other, you know.</span> <span id="s640">He came and he say he love me, and I say that I love you, and, you know, you be the love of my life and he said the same thing and -- and that’s about it, you know, we gonna get -- I want to marry you, he said, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: But he didn’t stay at your father’s -- at your parents’s farm, he stayed somewhere else, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: Oh, he -- he was -- he was someplace else, on another farm, on his friends, and the people were very good to him, they let him stay there.</span> <span id="s643">But I was on my father’s farm, on our farm at home, yeah.</span> <span id="s644">And then we came, meet each other almost every day, you know, in the evening and things and then he said well, we’re going to get married, and he -- he used to visit my sister, my oldest sister, she was married, she was in Linz and her -- and her husband.</span> <span id="s645">And Julian, they were -- he liked him a lot, you know.</span> <span id="s646">He said, you know what, Julian said, I want to marry, I get married, you know.</span> <span id="s647">And then he said, well, I gonna help you.</span> <span id="s648">We’re gonna go and see the father together.</span> <span id="s649">And that’s how they did it, you know, so once he was th -- brought along, he came, and Julian came, you know, so they approached my father, you know, and I said without me, I didn’t go i -- I -- I -- I stayed out in the kitchen, I was just listening what’s going on in there, in the office.</span> <span id="s650">And then I went in, and then he said okay, you got my blessing, you can get married.</span> <span id="s651">You know, so we arranged everything.</span> <span id="s652">Well, actually Julian arranged everything and -- and we got married t -- like one year later when he got free.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Just --</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: 1946, in March, or in -- in April we got married, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: How -- how was the mar -- how was the -- the wedding?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: The wedding was -- actually it was, I couldn’t get married in the same town I wa -- I was going school and boy I was going to first communion and -- where we belonged, where we went to school.</span> <span id="s657">I just couldn’t get married over there because the people were still kind of, you know, that it wasn’t right, you know.</span> <span id="s658">So we said we no have to do that, we’re going to get married in a big city, in Linz.</span> <span id="s659">And my husband arranged everything, and arranged a big bus -- a -- a bus, you know, to come and take us all to the wedding, to Linz.</span> <span id="s660">My father, and my -- my sister, and the other sister were there, and some from the -- from that place where he was working, where he -- he later on got a job, and -- and he was the -- his -- his engineer.</span> <span id="s661">And some people were waiting by the church over there for us, with flowers and everything, and we didn’t arrived.</span> <span id="s662">Something happened with the bus, something -- the bus broke down.</span> <span id="s663">So we had to go the next day, arranged everything with the priest and everything, the priest you know, a -- a -- a -- yeah, everything was arranged the next day, we got married quick.</span> <span id="s664">But we celebrate that day before everything, in our house and our farm, yeah.</span> <span id="s665">Even my aunt came, my -- my [indecipherable] came, and -- and she was there and some other people, engineer [indecipherable] where Julian was working and his wife, and some other friends, Julian’s friends and my sisters, all my sisters and brother-in-laws and things were the -- all there.</span> <span id="s666">Was kind of strange, but was something.</span> <span id="s667">My mother made a good dinner, good food and everything, you know, she was very generous, my mom.</span> <span id="s668">And then next day we went to the church, we got married and we went straight to our little apartment what jul -- where Julian was working.</span> <span id="s669">There was two rooms, one kitchen, and one bedroom.</span> <span

and we were so happy, and from there we -- every day went to work.</span> <span id="s764">I went to work in the morning, from six to two, and he worked from three to 11.</span> <span id="s765">So all the time somebody was home with the little girl, so -- there was a lady living next door, a older lady, in between time, just in case he left a little early, put her 10 minutes there til I came home, you know, so she always had somebody to take care of my little girl.</span> <span id="s766">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: So you didn’t see each other very much then [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: No, just -- no, no, no, yeah, I know it.</span> <span id="s769">But I had this paycheck, I brought a paycheck home and little by little we had to buy

do?</span> <span id="s778">So -- well, they were saying that farm is for sale, a farm, but the house is very bad condition because that woman died and that house was just standing there, and the son, he was in a -- in a war, and he came back and he promised God he gonna go for a minister, and he did.</span> <span id="s779">And [indecipherable] the house was for sale.</span> <span id="s780">But the land was excellent, was 39 acre -- 40 acres of land there, and -- and we went there to look at the house and the land -- the land was excellent, I liked it, and the way the house was built, we said the house is repairable, it’s worth it to repair, and we did.</span> <span id="s781">My husband had good friends, Polish one from his town that came and helped him on a Saturday, Sunday I did the cooking, and they came and worked, and -- and -- and repaired the house and did the -- the fixing up the house and we were happy and we stayed there for five years.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: Was it -- did it feel good to go back to something that you had done before --</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: -- or was it something that you had to do, you really wanted to do something else?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: Both, both, yeah.</span> <span id="s786">I knew I can do it because I was raised like that, and if we’re gonna get this here,

we had chicken, I raised little baby chickens, 300.</span> <span id="s790">And then they’re turning in to be lay -- lay -- laying eggs and everything, you know, and we sold the eggs to the city.</span> <span id="s791">And later on we’re just keep them for two years, so they were hundred percent layhorn, you know, they were -- were the good chickens.</span> <span id="s792">Then we got rid of the chickens and then we start getting cattle.</span> <span id="s793">New wa -- new -- two cows and -- and young heifers, to -- I raise myself, I said, you know, so that’s what we did.</span> <span id="s794">Had 15 heifers and two cows, and we raised it ourselves and make the money.</span> <span id="s795">We kept them heifers for three years, and they were already turning into be a cow.</span> <span id="s796">We sold them.</span> <span id="s797">We took them to the auction, we sold them, we make a good money.</span> <span id="s798">And then we said now it’s time the children start going school, and it’s no -- no way to be on a farm so way up there in -- in -- in Vernon Center.</span> <span id="s799">Let’s go and see if -- they said it’s a good buy on Cottage Place, a

know?</span> <span id="s801">So we had a mortgage on it, but it wasn’t scary at all, the mortgage we paid out from the rent money, and later on even, we bought a nice little camp on the water, also paid off from the rent money.</span> <span id="s802">And our children went to Holy Trinity School.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: I wa -- I want to interrupt for just a second, because you said

concentration camp, too.</span> <span id="s825">And then he answered me, well everybody was in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s826">So then I didn’t talked any more, I was like scared off, and I thought I not going to tell anybody, bu -- nobody believe me anyway, you know, so I kept it to myself, yeah.</span> <span id="s827">They didn't understood, you know, that’s the way it was, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: When -- when you -- when you raised the children, did you have any ideas about how you wanted to raise them, something that was maybe like you were raised, or different from where you were raised, or something that had to do with what you experienced during the war, intolerance or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: No, this had nothing to do, we just want to give them [indecipherable] school, if they want it, if we would be able to, to give them a better education.</span> <span id="s830">If you be able -- we didn’t know if we will be able to

also some friends already, you know.</span> <span id="s907">[indecipherable], you know, so and so.</span> <span id="s908">And I thought they still, you know, they still no want to speak to me, or the -- something -- I still got that guilty conscious, you know.</span> <span id="s909">And later on I ask my sister what the people talk about me now, how they think about.</span> <span id="s910">Oh, she said, you know, all right, she said that’s okay, you know, things.</span> <span id="s911">But you know, just so much, you know.</span> <span id="s912">And how you doing, and -- and -- and they can see that we went to church, you know, they saw me and all that, I look all right, you know, and things.</span> <span id="s913">Then later on they ask them how we’re doing here, and they said good, good, and so and so to tell them -- told them that time, you know, that we got our own home and we’re happy and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: Did -- did you f -- did you feel -- I me -- I don’t -- I don’t know how often you s -- you were in touch with -- with people, but did you think there was a real change in -- in -- in --</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: Little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: -- thinking and in attitude?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: Yes, a little bit already, was a -- a change i-in -- you know that they accept me more than -- than, you know, when I was -- before I left.</span> <span id="s918">And when I went home the second time, was already better.</span> <span id="s919">Then I came with -- our daughter went to Austria for a couple of months.</span> <span id="s920">She was 18 then, you know.</span> <span id="s921">And they liked her a lot, you know, and they loved her and later on my husband, we -- we all went to Austria.</span> <span id="s922">We -- we were quite ma -- more often in Austria.</span> <span id="s923">And the more often they saw us, they accept us more and more and more, you know.</span> <span id="s924">So, things worked out okay, you know, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: In -- in -- in general, were your children interested to learn sort of where you were coming from and where Julian are coming from, or was it not really a d -- a deep interest to find out more?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: Oh yes, they’re -- they ask, you know, oh yes, yes.</span> <span id="s927">And when the children came, Frieda and Richard also was there, my husband and me, and all our -- of th-the daughters from my oldest sister, they made -- come to -- you know, pick -- they got a big backyard, it was in the summer, you know, a big, beautiful garden.</span> <span id="s928">And they invite all the family, and even friends if y -- they want to come and see us and they put on a big, big party, you know, so -- you know, all kind of food and they were really, really nice to us, and I -- I gonna -- I -- we remember that, that they were so nice.</span> <span id="s929">And also the other girl from the older sister, you know, she got a big farm and they put on, you know, the best -- the best Sunday afternoon what they can put on out in a garden, with tables there, with about 30 people all together, and I think that -- they did really the best what they could do for us.</span> <span id="s930">And that felt good, that felt all very good for me, you know.</span> <span id="s931">I no feel like I’m, you know, guilty of the something, you know.</span> <span id="s932">So every time, more -- the more often we came and other friends, they invite me, you know, invite us, we should come, but we never had a chance to.</span> <span id="s933">Some -- some of them died already, they’re gone forever.</span> <span id="s934">And some of them what we went to school, they always said, you know, want to see my sister.</span> <span id="s935">She write ever -- couple times a month, and she said, you know, certain ladies say hello to you and wish you the very best, and -- and they’re thinking of you and they’re so happy that you -- you -- you -- you have a good life with your family, and -- and that you got a good husband and a good children and everything is worked out good, you know.</span> <span id="s936">So that make me feel good, you know, it make me feel good.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: Since we are talking about Austria, let me ask you this.</span> <span id="s938">Did you follow a little bit the recent political developments in Austria, for instance with Jorg Heider, who is an ultra Conservative being now part of the government.</span> <span id="s939">Do you follow that?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: No, I’m just listen what I am -- I hear, but I would never ever -- politic never interested me, you know.</span> <span id="s941">So I, politic I throw away completely, it’s just out of my -- my -- my -- my life, I just n -- I’m not interested, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: Well let’s go back to America then, and let me ask you about your children, though.</span> <span id="s943">Did the -- the camp experience for -- for both of you, and your experience during the war, did -- did that come up when they were smaller?</span> <span id="s944">Did they ask questions, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: Well, when they were bigger already, you know, we explained to them, and we went there, and then -- then they understood what was this all about, and -- and why, you know, and things, and it’s hard to believe now in -- in the times now that something like that ever happened before, you know?</span> <span id="s946">That -- to punish someone for something like that, you know, if you fall in love, they punish someone like that and want to kill them, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: Did -- did they learn about the Holocaust, or the -- the second World War in -- in school in any detail?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: Prob -- probably they did, you know, but I don’t know exactly the -- the -- how much, you know, but they know that was a bad war, and there was a ba -- bad conditions for s -- a lot of people suffered, and it’s hard to explain.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: Di -- after the war, in America, did you see the people again who were with you in Ravensbrück, or did you hear about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: No, I just heard from one lady, she -- th -- Rosie Yolkman.</span> <span id="s951">She was later on in government, a big -- big position she had over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: She was a kapo, she was a kapo</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: She was a -- she wa -- no, she was -- sh -- she was a blockalteste.</span> <span id="s954">She had the whole block number on where we were.</span> <span id="s955">She had to -- she was our boss, you know, our blockalteste.</span> <span id="s956">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: And she was -- she was Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: No, she was a Vienna, Austrian.</span> <span id="s959">Maybe Czechoslovakian, but she was in Vienna and she spoke aust -- completely Austrian and that’s all I know, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Were there things in America that you didn’t like as much -- I mean, you liked a lot of things, I guess, but were there also some things you didn't quite agree with or that you didn’t like, in the earlier years maybe, or later on?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: In this country, you mean?</span> <span id="s962">Well, that was -- I missed holidays like with my family, and -- but other hand, we work late, we always together, with Julian, our children, and we had friends, a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s963">And tha-that’s my life, you know, the -- Julian and our children, you know, that’s my -- and grandchildren now, you know, that’s our happiest life, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: Did you -- do you feel there was any effect on you by certain events in this country, like for instance the Civil Rights movement when the -- you know, the -- did you -- did you know about that in -- in detail, were you interested in those kinds of --</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: No.</span> <span id="s966">Nothing interests me, I -- I no get involved with anything politic, it’s just -- to me it’s just out.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: And do you feel that your -- your own suffering, as -- as a Christian, as Austrian, has not been -- is -- is not quite so ingrained in the consciousness of people here in America, that they don’t know quite as much of was that than they know about the suffering, for instance, from Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: I think they don’t believe it that something like that happen.</span> <span id="s969">I don’t think that they believe in that, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s970">I don’t think they believe that’s Austrian, if they na -- were a criminal or the something, that they -- that they put somebody in a concentration camp, you know.</span> <span id="s971">But the people what come from over there, they knew them -- them laws that time, you know, they said, oh yes we know that that -- that was against the law, you know, to fall in love with foreigner at that time, you know, that was very much against the law, you know.</span> <span id="s972">But that we had to go through something awful like that, and -- but just God was with us, God was good wi -- to us that we made it, you know, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: Did you have any -- could you give any particular example when you realized that people really don’t know that much, when you told them that you were in a camp, and there was maybe somebody responding in a certain way?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: I don’t think they want to -- they want to listen.</span> <span id="s975">And they not -- they don’t want to know nothing about it, you know, so that just not much to talk about, you know, to them, you know, so that’s why I keep -- keep it inside and oh, Julian and -- and me, we can talk together, because we know what we had to go through and what was all about.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: When you talked -- when you gave the first interview, the videotaped interview for the Holocaust Museum, was that the first time you ever really spoke about that experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: Yes, yes, I always -- y-yes.</span> <span id="s978">When we were young we didn’t had time to think about, we were so busy with working, children and our life and things like.</span> <span id="s979">I always pushed it away.</span> <span id="s980">Sometime it came into my mind, oh, but I always pushed it away and -- and I don’t want to think about.</span> <span id="s981">That was like a dream, you know, something in -- and that’s just -- had to go away again, you know.</span> <span id="s982">But when I -- we went to the Holocaust mus -- that time when we had the interview, that night, you know, I was thinking -- all night I didn’t sleep and I was thinking from the first day what happened and what we had to go through.</span> <span id="s983">I was shook up, I mean, you know, I really was thinking to the bottom you know, how that happened, what happened, you know.</span> <span id="s984">Because I always pushed it out of my -- out of my mind, you know, before, you know.</span> <span id="s985">I don’t want to think about, you know.</span> <span id="s986">But then it came to me and it was hard to talk about, very hard to talk about.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: Are there any particular memories, that are especially difficult for you, or what -- what is it that still comes up now and then?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: The cruelty, I mean, you know, and that something like that could happen, I mean, you know, so -- so many people to put together and there were, you know, so many people in a concentration camp who didn’t do any crime, it was no crime, it was just their -- their life there, for what -- what they came from, you know, like -- like the -- the -- the -- all kind, like the Gypsies, there were Gypsies there, and wer -- there were the Jehovah Witness there, and there were so many young girls there.</span> <span id="s989">And politician also, what they -- they’re -- couldn’t help it, that was their thinking.</span> <span id="s990">And it was just hard to -- to accept.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: Julian, in his interview said that voting, to be able to vote was very important for him.</span> <span id="s992">Was it important --</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: In this country?</span> <span id="s994">Of course, yes, yes, very proud that we got an American citizenship and that we go vote, and we never miss it, and we never missed it since we are citizens.</span> <span id="s995">And we are very proud about to be -- to be American citizen.</span> <span id="s996">We want to be a good citizen, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: What -- what does it mean for you to be a good citizen here?</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: Good citizen?</span> <span id="s999">To be good, to not do anything bad against anybody, you know, so -- yeah, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: What -- what political ar -- you said you’re not so interested in politics, but what political directions do you feel -- direction party do you feel closer to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: The worker’s party, you know, the people, for the working people, you know, so I think when I vote, a lot of time I vote for the person who is there, who I know, if he’s a good person.</span> <span id="s1002">If not, I do not vote for the -- even if it’s my party.</span> <span id="s1003">And if it’s somebody there what is -- somebody el -- if he -- I think it’s a good person, do the job good, I vote for them, you know.</span> <span id="s1004">But since -- I think I’m pretty much democratic, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1005">Sorry, say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: Do you think the world has learned anything?</span> <span id="s1007">I mean, many years have passed now, do you think the world has learned anything from what happened during the second World War?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: I just hope never -- something like that never going to happen again.</span> <span id="s1009">I mean, I don’t know how it got that far, I mean that there so many, especially young people, or older people also, you know, and young men what they got lost in the war, also.</span> <span id="s1010">And concentration camps, and -- and anyway, that they had to live through such a difficult time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: Your two children, do you feel that -- are you close to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: Very much.</span> <span id="s1013">Children are always first.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: Do you think you were a prot -- very protective mom?</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: I don’t know, maybe sometime too protective.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: You wanted to give them the -- the best?</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1018">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: Is there anything that you would like to say that we think we haven’t talked about?</span> <span id="s1020">I mean, 50 years in America, that’s a long time, too, and you built a new life --</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: -- and is there anything sort of that was a highlight, that was especially important to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: I -- I’m very thankful that we’re -- we’re -- are in this country, and that we had a chance to make our life here, and our -- our children had the education -- well, our son is born here, and fr -- and our daughter is born in Austria, but she came here when she was 18 months old, and she got education here, and everything, and their life is in this country, and I’m very thankful that we are happy together and that we are here in
