July 14th, 1995.</span> <span id="s5">This is Nina Ellis and I’m interviewing Ruth Eberly Kirby.</span> <span id="s6">We’re in New Polz, New York.</span> <span id="s7">Please first tell me your -- your -- where you were born and where you grew up.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Answer: I was born in Grenridge, New Jersey and I grew up in West Hallwell, New Jersey.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s10">And when did you decide to become a nurse and why?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: I decided to become a nurse when I think I was about eight years old and I had been bitten by a dog in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s12">He had jumped and caught my ear.</span> <span id="s13">We were jumping rope on a porch and he was lying sleeping and I guess the boards may have pinched his skin.</span> <span id="s14">And he jumped up and caught my ear.</span> <span id="s15">And I went home, which was a few doors away, crying, with my ear hanging and my dad took me to the doctors office -- in those days that’s what they did.</span> <span id="s16">And the doctor sewed it back on and his nurse was so darling to me and I was so impressed.</span> <span id="s17">She had a crisp white cap and a sparkling white uniform and I was just impressed with her.</span> <span id="s18">I remember that my -- I was crying and my dad said oh, he’s getting all wet, my tears were rolling down his back.</span> <span id="s19">And she was just such a remarkable person and that -- I thought after that, “I’d like to become a nurse, too.”</span> <span id="s20">That was really the beginning.</span> <span id="s21">I always fell -- and I used to play with my animals and with my dolls and always took care of them and wrapped them up, bandaged them.</span> <span id="s22">It was just -- and my mother couldn’t tolerate the sight of blood, so -- it was my dad who was the one who really took over all the time, but that was really what -- I can still see the office, I can see the doctor and the nurse and that was -- that impressed me.</span> <span id="s23">So that -- as I grew older -- I was also interested in maybe becoming a kindergarten teacher, but because I wasn’t able to really play the piano the way they requested, I -- I decided well, nursing is the thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: And when -- what year was it when you went into nursing school?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: I went in in 1940, cause we graduated in ‘43.</span> <span id="s26">Graduated from high school, applied immediately, was accepted and went into nurse’s training in Presbyterian Hospital, Newark, New Jersey.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s28">And at that time then, the war was -- America wasn’t yet in the war in Europe, but I’m -- what was your consciousness about what was happening there?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Well, in ‘41, when we heard the announcement that Pearl Harbor was struck, then -- I knew then that I wanted to be in the army and my roommate wanted to be in the navy.</span> <span id="s30">I was just very anxious to serve my country in the army if the war was still going on.</span> <span id="s31">And of course, that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s32">As soon as I graduated in ‘43, applied to join the army and I was accepted and from there on, it was just -- I was very excited.</span> <span id="s33">It was a wonderful experience.</span> <span id="s34">It’s something that I cannot tell you all the experiences we had and what we learned and what we saw and did.</span> <span id="s35">And we were very young, as I said.</span> <span id="s36">It was a remarkable experience, one I shall never forget, treasure every minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Why the army for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: I don’t -- I wanted to be a hospital nurse and at that time they were -- the army nurses were on the hospital shifts.</span> <span id="s39">And that’s what I thought, I’d like to do that.</span> <span id="s40">And -- but then once -- and I also wanted to go overseas.</span> <span id="s41">That was -- when we had our basic training I knew I wanted to finish with all of this and I wanted to go overseas and work with the [indecipherable] right there -- right where everything was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Did you have any members of your family in the service?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: My brother was in the Coast Guard, that was all.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: And when are you -- when were you inducted then?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: In 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: What month, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: I think it was in September.</span> <span id="s48">I really don’t have that in -- yes, because I think our class was class number 10 and I think we graduated from basic training in September in Atlantic City.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: When did you start basic training, was it before or after the invasion -- the D-Day invasion?</span> <span id="s50">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Well, I think we had six weeks of basic training, so it would have been --</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Right in that summer?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Ah, D-Day was early June, so it --</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: -- might have -- might have been after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: I think it may have been after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: And once -- once you knew that American soldiers were fighting and dying in Europe, did that change your attitude in any way, about wanting so badly to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: I wanted to serve my country and do what I could.</span> <span id="s60">They were giving their all and dying for America, so -- and I felt that was my responsibility, I felt that calling, the same way I felt the calling to become a nurse.</span> <span id="s61">And I think it is a special thing and there are only certain people who -- who do these things.</span> <span id="s62">I always felt I wanted to help people and do things.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: What was your family’s response to your wanting to go and serve?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Well, my parents weren’t happy about my entering training, because in those days nurses were just considered people who handled bedpans and things like that.</span> <span id="s65">That was true in those days.</span> <span id="s66">That’s what they thought.</span> <span id="s67">And I pleaded with my family.</span> <span id="s68">And I needed 100 dollars to give in order to get into the hospital, into the program.</span> <span id="s69">And finally I convinced them and they did send the check in and I was accepted.</span> <span id="s70">But -- and as far as going overseas, my brother was in the service, but they knew then and they were the proudest parents to have a -- a nurse in the family.</span> <span id="s71">And they knew that if I wanted it, that was fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: So you finally got their blessing?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s75">T-Tell me about leaving -- leaving the US for the first time, what was that like?</span> <span id="s76">What -- what -- what -- what were you thinking about?</span> <span id="s77">What do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: We were all very excited.</span> <span id="s79">I was excited.</span> <span id="s80">And it was before Christmas.</span> <span id="s81">I knew we were going and of course we couldn’t tell anyone.</span> <span id="s82">And we were all packed and we had things pinned under our liners to our coats because we couldn’t get everything in our luggage.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Like what?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Like towels and strange things.</span> <span id="s85">Just extra things that we just couldn’t get into our foot lockers and into our duffel bags.</span> <span id="s86">And we were all dressed and it was -- I think in -- late at night that we looked up -- we -- we came from South Carolina up to the harbor and I shall never forget looking up and seeing Queen Elizabeth on that ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: You went up to New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s89">Huh.</span> <span id="s90">And it was so impressive, I could not believe it.</span> <span id="s91">This was the original Queen Elizabeth.</span> <span id="s92">Largest ship, at that time, in the country.</span> <span id="s93">And -- and then we were all huddled into staterooms with tier after tier, I don’t know how many, I guess about three or four, one on top of the other.</span> <span id="s94">But we had a porthole and that was important, cause we could look out of the porthole.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: And when you -- when you boarded, what -- what did you know about your destination?</span> <span id="s96">Did you know where you --</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: No, uh-uh.</span> <span id="s100">We just knew we were going to the European theater.</span> <span id="s101">And then we landed in Southampton.</span> <span id="s102">I remember seeing the White Cliffs of Dover, which I have since been there and I have a chunk of them home.</span> <span id="s103">And -- and then it was so bitter cold and rainy and damp and we were all hungry and we were all coughing.</span> <span id="s104">And our chief nurse lined us up every day, I’ll never forget this either, with the same spoon, doling out -- there’s your dose, everyone had a dose of cough syrup.</span> <span id="s105">We all survived.</span> <span id="s106">It was -- it was just a -- one big happy family.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: And -- and we still are, the girls who are left.</span> <span id="s109">We’re -- we have bonded well.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s111">On that crossing, was -- how long did it take to --</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Five days.</span> <span id="s113">We zigzagged.</span> <span id="s114">And I think we had saltwater in the faucets.</span> <span id="s115">Course you didn’t shower or do anything like that.</span> <span id="s116">We had special soap for saltwater, to wash.</span> <span id="s117">And it was very crowded, but we did play cards and talk and wonder what the future held.</span> <span id="s118">And we were always singing.</span> <span id="s119">I was always happy to sing, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Hold on just a second.</span> <span id="s121">What -- what were some of the songs that you all would sing?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: I’m having a hard time thinking now.</span> <span id="s123">They keep reminding me what they were.</span> <span id="s124">I kn -- I really don’t remember.</span> <span id="s125">The regular songs of -- you know, that everyone was singing at that time, in the 40’s.</span> <span id="s126">And we harmonized and we just in general had a good time.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: There was a high spirits going across?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s129">Yes, we were.</span> <span id="s130">We were all -- everyone was anxious to see what was going to happen next.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: How old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: 22.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: And most people were about the same age?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Basically, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Finished with nursing school.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: You arrived in England and -- and this was what month?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: In December, a few days before Christmas.</span> <span id="s141">It was the first Christmas that I would have been away from home.</span> <span id="s142">And my parents had -- they knew that something was -- we were going somewhere and they had sent a couple of gifts that we packed in our luggage.</span> <span id="s143">And then we arrived in England.</span> <span id="s144">As I said, it was bitter cold, rained a great deal.</span> <span id="s145">And we were billeted in a private home, which many of the people opened their homes to the Americans.</span> <span id="s146">And we had a very [inaudible] had a bathroom with a bathtub, we could take a bath.</span> <span id="s147">We had two bunks in our room and we were four girls who have always stayed good friends.</span> <span id="s148">We were -- served together, all of us.</span> <span id="s149">And we still -- we’re all still living.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: And how long were you in England?</span> <span id="s151">What did you -- and what were you doing there?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: We all -- we had a -- we went to work in a hospital -- bib -- in Wales, I think it was.</span> <span id="s153">And we had the GI’s from war, that we took care of.</span> <span id="s154">Our corpsmen were there helping us.</span> <span id="s155">We were transported there every day and back again.</span> <span id="s156">I did general duty and general nursing.</span> <span id="s157">And that’s when I first realized that these American boys are remarkable, because of the spirits they had, they were just the best patients you could imagine.</span> <span id="s158">They were wonderful.</span> <span id="s159">You knew they were Americans, they were very, very happy to be alive and happy to see a -- an American nurse and -- and thinking of going home, because that’s where they were destined for.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Were these men who had been wounded in the ba -- in the fa -- recently wounded --</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: -- in the Battle of the Bulge --</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: -- and the fighting --</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: -- that was taking place there, just before Christmas, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Some terrible fighting.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Lot’s of psychological trauma, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s172">Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s173">Things that we were seeing that we had never seen.</span> <span id="s174">But when you’re young, those things, you know, looking back you think how could you ever have done that?</span> <span id="s175">But you do it.</span> <span id="s176">If there’s a job to do, we did it.</span> <span id="s177">We were always happy when our shift was over, we could go back to our rooms and talk about what had happened and -- it was just repetitious.</span> <span id="s178">The next day would be the same or worse or better.</span> <span id="s179">And it was bitter cold, bitter cold.</span> <span id="s180">But -- and I remember -- which is something I had never seen, early in the morning when we were walking down to the mess hall for our breakfast, I saw a cart with huge pails of milk and that was the milkman delivering -- that’s how they delivered the milk in England, which of course was totally new to me, delivering it that way.</span> <span id="s181">And it was a -- it was beautiful where we were, it was a beautiful countryside, but we had a great deal of fog and rain.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s183">And when did you then go to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: I’ve forgotten when we crossed the channel.</span> <span id="s185">I think it’s in that literature, what month it was.</span> <span id="s186">We weren’t in England too long, just long enough to reorganize and get -- know what our next experience was going to be.</span> <span id="s187">What they wanted, where they wanted us to go.</span> <span id="s188">Landed in France.</span> <span id="s189">And we were in Germany, we were set up in a field, in tents.</span> <span id="s190">We were --</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Where -- where was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: In Germany, we were in --</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: We’re now -- we’re in -- let’s back up a little bit.</span> <span id="s194">I never asked you to tell me the name of your unit and who you were attached to, so tell me all of that and then let’s pick up with March of 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: We were with the 131st evacuation hospital, a semi-mobile unit and I think we were part of the first army and then we eventually joined General Patton.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Third army?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Third army, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s199">And you crossed the English channel to France in March of 1945, you had been in England.</span> <span id="s200">And were you sent directly to Germany?</span> <span id="s201">The fighting was moving closer and closer to Berlin at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: We were in France for awhile.</span> <span id="s203">I remember we were billeted in a castle.</span> <span id="s204">I don’t think -- I don’t recall working there.</span> <span id="s205">I think it was just a stopping off point.</span> <span id="s206">In fact, we were allowed to go on down to the beach, but I don’t think we were there long and then we went to Germany and that’s when we were in our tents, we were set up in tents and also had occasions -- soldiers coming in off the front lines.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Do you happen to remember wh-where you were?</span> <span id="s208">Near what town or city in those tents?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: I don’t know whether it was Düsseldorf or if that’s where we went through, I’m not sure what the town was.</span> <span id="s210">I know it was a valley.</span> <span id="s211">It was just flat land.</span> <span id="s212">And I’m not -- I’m really not sure of the name of the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: And there were wha -- 39 of you, 40 nurses?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: We always said 40 nurses and 40 officers and about 206 enlisted men.</span> <span id="s215">Mainly the enlisted men were from Oklahoma and most of the doctors and nurses were from the eastern seaboard.</span> <span id="s216">Just happened that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Hm, hm.</span> <span id="s218">So those officers were mostly doctors?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Uh-huh, 40 doctors and 40 nurses.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Doctors and dentists.</span> <span id="s222">We had two dentists.</span> <span id="s223">And let’s see -- they were me -- they were all doctors.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: And the 40 nurses.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: And there was a surgery that did surgery on the --</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s230">We had an OR.</span> <span id="s231">The enlisted men were the corpsmen.</span> <span id="s232">They were remarkable young men.</span> <span id="s233">They worked very hard, they knew what they were doing and they were cooperative and helpful.</span> <span id="s234">It was -- as I said before, just one big, happy family.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s236">In the spring of 1945, you must have known the war was coming to an end.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Yes, we did.</span> <span id="s238">We were aware, but had no idea that it was going to be as quickly as it was.</span> <span id="s239">And when they told us and then we left, from there we were -- from Germany we were going to Austria, but we didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s240">And through all the villages we saw all the white sheets and flags of surrender, out of all these little villages.</span> <span id="s241">It was very interesting, I had never seen anything like that before and they were all waving and very cheerful and happy.</span> <span id="s242">Everything was quiet.</span> <span id="s243">And that’s when we went on into Austria.</span> <span id="s244">I think we arrived there -- I think it was May eighth or ninth.</span> <span id="s245">I’m not sure when.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Right around the last day -- right around the surrender --</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Do you remember where you were when you heard about the German surrender?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Well, I think we were still in Germany.</span> <span id="s250">We had heard about President Roosevelt dying earlier in May, when we were in Germany, in that valley.</span> <span id="s251">And then we heard that the war was over and we were jubilant.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: What did you do?</span> <span id="s253">Did you have a -- did you have a party, did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: We all celebrated in our own way, I guess -- several of us did -- had a big party with all kinds of things, we were drinking.</span> <span id="s255">Just didn’t seem to matter, it was just a jubilant feeling to know that all of this has now ceased and that hopefully we could get our boys back home and I was looking forward to going to the South Pacific, but that didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s256">And we knew that we probably would be discharged after we returned back home.</span> <span id="s257">We didn’t know how soon that would be, because we had another chore to do.</span> <span id="s258">And that was when we arrived in the concentration camp in Linz, outside of Linz, Austria.</span> <span id="s259">And that was when we drove in in the two and a half ton truck and we were just overwhelmed at what we could see from where we were.</span> <span id="s260">And -- and the odor was something you’ll never forget.</span> <span id="s261">Once you have that in your nostrils, you’ll never forget that.</span> <span id="s262">And I know our colonel did say that it was up to us, either we -- we didn’t have to serve this duty.</span> <span id="s263">And I thought that was strange.</span> <span id="s264">And of course we all said yes we would and we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: And we were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: Were you told what it was going to be?</span> <span id="s268">What you would do?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: Well then, we did.</span> <span id="s270">They were -- they did tell us and of course we -- we were still -- we had no idea what we were going to see when we did go in the next morning.</span> <span id="s271">And we had to wear our fatigues with our leggings on and our sleeves tight and we all had olive drab turbans that we put on our heads so none of our hair was showing.</span> <span id="s272">And we went in like this and then the first thing they did was spray us with DDT powder, down the front, down the back, in our hair and down our legs.</span> <span id="s273">And then we went into the wards and there were just.</span> <span id="s274">They were all men that we had in that particular ward and it was just -- they were skin and bone, like skeletons.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: By wards, do you mean that these people had already been removed to hospitals or to some kind of temporary facility?</span> <span id="s276">Were they still in the concentration camp itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s278">They were in the camp and they were like barracks.</span> <span id="s279">We called them wards because they were all in -- they were all in cots -- bunkbeds.</span> <span id="s280">They didn’t have any sheets.</span> <span id="s281">Some of them were fortunate enough to have straw on their beds -- in their bunks.</span> <span id="s282">Just lying there, just with their wide eyes, because they were so emaciated.</span> <span id="s283">And they were suffering from many diseases and we were told we really couldn’t touch them and they were not to touch us, because of all the diseases they had.</span> <span id="s284">And our main thing to do -- we couldn’t give them any food, we started with sulfa drugs, sulfaphisol, because that was the antibiotic of that time.</span> <span id="s285">And when I tell you they had to take six or 10 pills at a time, it wasn’t easy for them.</span> <span id="s286">And I remember several days later, after they removed the dead, you would see all the pills left in there, under the straw, in their beds that they just couldn’t take.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: They couldn’t swallow them?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Couldn’t swallow them, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s289">But they were very happy in their way, that they could show their appreciation.</span> <span id="s290">They were so weak, it was just -- they could scarcely talk, half of them and -- but they knew you could tell where -- their eyes, that they knew we had come to liberate them.</span> <span id="s291">And that was just every day, the next day when you’d go to the ward, there’d be X number of inmates who no longer were there -- patients, I should call them, who were -- had died through the night.</span> <span id="s292">And that was day after day after day.</span> <span id="s293">It was very, very depressing.</span> <span id="s294">And -- and difficult to cope with even at that age, cause we had never seen anything like that and couldn’t understand why all this had happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: What were you told about it before you --</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: We really weren’t told that much, it’s just that this was a concentration camp the Germans had and that we were going to, you know, release these men and send them off to hospitals, where they could be treated properly, which is what they did, those that they could, they stayed until they were a little stronger.</span> <span id="s297">And they did eventually have liquids and some form of nutrition.</span> <span id="s298">But it was just total devastation to see what people could do to other people.</span> <span id="s299">Human beings, these were human beings and they were just unbelievable skeletons.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: You said you weren’t able to touch them?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: No, they didn’t want us to touch them because they had all kinds of diseases and they didn’t want us -- and there was nothing -- we couldn’t bathe them, they had the -- some others -- town people, I think come in and help clean them up or take care of them as far as minor little things.</span> <span id="s302">They were too weak to be handled or really treated in any way.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: These were the local Austrian citizens who volunteered or were pr-pressed to --</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: No, I don’t know where they really came from or who they were, but I know that someone else -- all we did mainly was just go from patient to patient and wait until they took all their pills, it was just constant -- cause there were many that we had in these large wards.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: And how long did that go on for?</span> <span id="s306">How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Well, let’s see.</span> <span id="s308">I guess maybe three or four weeks.</span> <span id="s309">And by that time, each day -- well so many had died through the night and then each day some would be moved to safer quarters, so that little by little, the camp was em -- being emptied.</span> <span id="s310">And we remember looking out of the ward window one morning and they were -- two patients were walking by with the carcass of a horse.</span> <span id="s311">You could see the frames of his bone structure and the ribs and couldn’t imagine what was happening and they were of course had ki-killed the horse and were eating the -- the meat.</span> <span id="s312">It was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s313">And down at one corner of our ward, one patient was cooking -- had collected some weeds from the yard, the campgrounds and he was cooking them and that -- that’s what they existed on, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: So some of the people there were able -- were up and around, not --</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Mm-hm, some were.</span> <span id="s318">Even though they were just skeletons, they were able to walk around.</span> <span id="s319">They were weak and they shuffled and -- but they still were determined and of course when they saw the Americans, they knew they were going to be all right, so that that encouraged them to use up every ounce of strength they had, which they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Did they try to talk to you at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Well, the communication, of course we didn’t speak their language, so it was difficult.</span> <span id="s322">But sometimes you could almost know what they were -- I -- they were grateful for our being there.</span> <span id="s323">And we were women, which they didn’t know at first what we were, cause we had everything covered up.</span> <span id="s324">But -- and then they realized that we were nurses.</span> <span id="s325">And we had Red Crosses on our arms, so they knew.</span> <span id="s326">It was just an unbelievable experience, cause then as we would go back through the courtyard, we saw all these mounds of bones and bodies and the huge trenches that they’d just tossed all the bodies in.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: They were opened --</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Trenches they had --</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Until they filled them to their capacity and then they would bulldoze the dirt back over all these corpse.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: That was going on while -- while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: While we were there, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s333">We saw that.</span> <span id="s334">It was horrible.</span> <span id="s335">It was a horrible thing that had happened.</span> <span id="s336">And I feel that’s why it’s important to -- this is part of history and it -- it should be taught in the schools, what happened there, because there are non-believers, which doesn’t -- hardly seems possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Had you known anything about the camps bef -- ear-earlier that spring, before you arrived there?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: No.</span> <span id="s339">I didn’t know anything about them, mm-mm.</span> <span id="s340">Had no idea, had no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s342">Hm.</span> <span id="s343">And how long were you there then?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: I think it was three or four weeks, I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s345">I know we were there in May.</span> <span id="s346">I think we must have come home in June.</span> <span id="s347">Our reward for the experience at the concentration camp was to come home, back to the States, which was -- we were very, very anxious.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: I bet.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: Were -- were you writing letters home during that time that you were there, trying to describe that?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: Yes, we did.</span> <span id="s352">My mother saved all of my letters and I have all of the -- I have them.</span> <span id="s353">All the ones -- and of course they were disbelieving, they couldn’t imagine what was going on and what we were going through.</span> <span id="s354">But they knew it was true, or it wouldn’t be there in the letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s356">Wh-When you came back -- excuse me -- when you came back and finished your service, was that experience something that you reflected on frequently in those years after the war, or was it something that you tried to forget about or --</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Well, you never forget about that.</span> <span id="s358">But sometimes it was difficult to talk about it.</span> <span id="s359">We didn’t discuss it all the time.</span> <span id="s360">They -- they were aware of what we had experienced.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Your family, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: And your friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: That’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Did people sort of tiptoe around you on that subject, not wanting to ask because they thought it would be hard for you to talk about?</span> <span id="s366">And was that the case, that it was hard to talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s368">For awhile I think it was difficult, but then as time went on and you reflect back and of course then when we’d get together with our girls or our nurse friends, we talked about it, but we didn’t really dwell on it, because it was painful, it was a horrible thing that had happened to these people who were just human beings.</span> <span id="s369">Innocent people.</span> <span id="s370">I never saw any women or any children there.</span> <span id="s371">We just seemed to have the men on our section.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: And has -- how do you think that experience, having seen what you saw at such a young age, it -- how did that affect your life?</span> <span id="s373">Did you think about it during the years at all, did it -- do you think it changed you in any way that you can measure, as a person?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Probably made me a stronger person.</span> <span id="s375">Not understanding of what I had gone through, but I knew that -- and a great compassion, I’ve always been compassionate, but I think this really encouraged me to be even more so and to -- to treat all kinds of people as you would yourself have treated.</span> <span id="s376">I think it’s -- we’re all created here and it’s -- you just don’t do these things to a human being.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Have your children asked you about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: My children, when I first mentioned something, they said, “What World War?”</span> <span id="s379">I said, “World War Two.”</span> <span id="s380">And of course they were young and they -- they really meant it, “Which war, Mom?”</span> <span id="s381">So after I told them.</span> <span id="s382">Then the main person -- I have twin sons and then a daughter and then a younger son.</span> <span id="s383">My daughter is the one who is the historian and she’s extremely interested and very understanding and kind of has relived part of this through my letters and through the things that she has read and that we have talked about.</span> <span id="s384">And she’s very patriotic.</span> <span id="s385">The anniversary of the end of the war, she took pictures of my uniforms and the flags and all my souvenirs.</span> <span id="s386">And this was her -- this is what she wanted to do, she wants to preserve this like a museum I guess, to pass on down.</span> <span id="s387">Cause she too says it’s part of history.</span> <span id="s388">It’s my legacy to my children.</span> <span id="s389">And they’re all very proud that I had served in the army.</span> <span id="s390">They think that was a wonderful thing to have done.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Sounds like you’re proud of it, too</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Yes, I am.</span> <span id="s393">I’m very proud.</span> <span id="s394">That’s a wonderful part of my life.</span> <span id="s395">That was very important to me, it was something that I -- I wanted to be a nurse and I wanted to join the army and I wanted to go overseas and I felt that I had really succeeded in all these dreams I had.</span> <span id="s396">And from then on, of course it -- true life is a little different, then.</span> <span id="s397">I married and had children and I’m still a nurse.</span> <span id="s398">I’m not working now, I’ve retired now, but th-that is a very important part of my life, too, being a nurse.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: I know it’s hot.</span> <span id="s400">Is there anything that you want to say or mention or a story that I didn’t -- [indecipherable] didn’t come across, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Okay, good.</span> <span id="s403">This is the end of tape one, side A, with Ruth Eberly Kirby.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">End of Tape One, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Conclusion of
