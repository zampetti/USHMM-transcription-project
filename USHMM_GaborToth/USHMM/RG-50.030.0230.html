My father was the youngest of six children.</span> <span id="s28">Uh, his father was a businessman.</span> <span id="s29">They were of more ethnic German background in Latvia.</span> <span id="s30">Uh, my father went to German schools in Latvia.</span> <span id="s31">My mother went to Russian schools.</span> <span id="s32">Uh, my parents always spoke Russian to each.</span> <span id="s33">My mother's father was a painter and a cantor.</span> <span id="s34">And uh died when he...when she was very young.</span> <span id="s35">Uh, some of his paintings were so outstanding that uh... My mother's house was always full of...my mother grew up in household full of paintings, and some of his paintings were so outstanding that she even was asked once to donate two of the paintings to the Louvre, but... In Paris, later on.</span> <span id="s36">But uh naturally, she only had a few of them and kept them with her.</span> <span id="s37">And she still has them.</span> <span id="s38">Uh, my parents met as teenagers, because uh...their older siblings (laughter) were married...got married.</span> <span id="s39">My mother's older sister got...was married to my father's older brother.</span> <span id="s40">Both my parents had magnificent voices.</span> <span id="s41">Uh, my father was a baritone.</span> <span id="s42">My mother uh...went to Riga to study at the Conservatory.</span> <span id="s43">Uh, she was known there as the girl with the golden voice.</span> <span id="s44">Uh, their home town was Liep_ja, which in Russian is Liyepaya [Ger: Libau].</span> <span id="s45">I..</span> <span id="s46">.</span> <span id="s47">They both when to Germany as poor students.</span> <span id="s48">My father went first.</span> <span id="s49">He uh registered both in engineering school and at the Hochschule für Musik, although he first started at the Hochschule für Musik in Berlin.</span> <span id="s50">My mother followed later.</span> <span id="s51">They were married in 1928 in Latvia, with both families present; and then they went back to study in Germany.</span> <span id="s52">Uh, one day my father sang...had the opportunity the audition for the composer Mascagni, who urged him to go to Italy with his beautiful voice.</span> <span id="s53">But he had no money, and he was on full scholarship in Germany.</span> <span id="s54">And so Mascagni said, " Italia."</span> <span id="s55">My father felt he had...had no choice but stay in Germany.</span> <span id="s56">Uh, my mother finished the Conservatory in Riga, and moved to Ber...to Berlin; and studied at the Conservatory there, too.</span> <span id="s57">Uh, shortly after they were married, my father got a job offer to sing at the Breslau [NB: Wroclaw] Opera Company.</span> <span id="s58">He took a stage name, Yasha Lenssen.</span> <span id="s59">Uh, his real name is Jacob...Jacob Levinsons.</span> <span id="s60">My mother is Pauline Levine.</span> <span id="s61">Uh, he was asked to sing the leading roles in 19 operas--the baritone roles.</span> <span id="s62">But soon after, they found out that uh his stage name, Lenssen, really was Levinsons--which, of course, he was not about to hide anyway.</span> <span id="s63">Uh, they decided to cancel his contract.</span> <span id="s64">This was in the early '30s in Germany.</span> <span id="s65">So my father, having completed some of his university studies at that time, decided to go into business in Germany.</span> <span id="s66">And his father helped him out by uh introducing him to someone who needed a contact in Germany for a business.</span> <span id="s67">And so my father became a representative in Berlin for a business firm abroad, and was quite successful at that.</span> <span id="s68">And they started uh...from being very poor students and living in very, very cramped one-room (laughing) without any money at all, both on scholarships, to being able to set themselves up in a little apartment in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">My father did quite well.</span> <span id="s70">Uh, I was born at that time--as I said, in 1934.</span> <span id="s71">And when I was about uh 6 months old, my parents decided that I should have a photograph taken of me; and my mother took me to a photographer.</span> <span id="s72">One of the best in Berlin!</span> <span id="s73">And he did...he made a very beautiful picture--which my parents thought, at least, was a very beautiful picture-- which my parents had framed and put on the piano that my father gave my mother as a present when I was born.</span> <span id="s74">And there was this picture on the piano.</span> <span id="s75">One day, the lady who came to clean...help my mother clean the apartment, Frau Klauke, said to my mother, "You know, I saw Hessy on a magazine cover in town."</span> <span id="s76">And my mother thought surely she must be mistaken, that there are many babies that look alike, and just told her, "Well, that couldn't be [the] case."</span> <span id="s77">Uh, the lady insisted; and she says, "No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s78">It's definitely Hessy.</span> <span id="s79">It's this picture.</span> <span id="s80">And...and just give me some money, and I'll get you the magazine."</span> <span id="s81">And so my mother did.</span> <span id="s82">And sure enough, this lady came back with a magazine, the front cover which said, "Sonne ins Haus"--which in German means, "the Sun in the Home."</span> <span id="s83">And there was the picture on the piano reproduced on the front cover of this magazine.</span> <span id="s84">This magazine was published out of Leipzig, and very definitely one of the few magazines allowed to circulate in Germany at the time, because it was a Nazi magazine.</span> <span id="s85">On the inside of the magazine were pictures of the Army with men wearing swastikas.</span> <span id="s86">There's a picture of the Führer himself reviewing the troops.</span> <span id="s87">There were pictures of the Hitlerjugend, and uh several of their activities, both in marching and in campfires and all other activities.</span> <span id="s88">It was a family magazine.</span> <span id="s89">My parents were horrified.</span> <span id="s90">They didn't know quite how this came about; except that my mother, naturally, rushed over to the photographer.</span> <span id="s91">She said to him, "What is this?</span> <span id="s92">How did this happen?"</span> <span id="s93">And the photographer quickly sort of closed the door, pulled the blinds, and told her to...very quietly admonished her to keep quiet.</span> <span id="s94">And he says, "Sssh...I will tell you the following.</span> <span id="s95">I was asked to submit the...my ten best pictures for a beauty contest run by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s96">So were ten other outstanding photographers in Germany.</span> <span id="s97">So ten photographers submitted their ten best pictures.</span> <span id="s98">And I sent in your baby's picture."</span> <span id="s99">And my mother said, "But you knew that this is a Jewish child."</span> <span id="s100">And the photographer said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s101">And this is a quote that I have always... My parents say he said, in German, "Ich wollte mir den Spass erlauben"--"I wanted to allow myself the pleasure of this joke."</span> <span id="s102">And then he told my mother, "And you see, I was right.</span> <span id="s103">Of all the babies, they picked this baby as the perfect Aryan."</span> <span id="s104">There was a beauty competition to select a baby that would represent the perfect example of the Aryan race to further the Nazi philosophy.</span> <span id="s105">That was pro...being promoted in Germany at the time.</span> <span id="s106">Magazine came out in early 1935.</span> <span id="s107">Uh, my parents were both shocked by the possible consequences that this could bring, and amazed at the irony of it all.</span> <span id="s108">But they felt at the moment to keep...that it was best to keep it quiet.</span> <span id="s109">(Cough) Well, before...there were several consequences that resulted from this.</span> <span id="s110">(Cough) (Drinking water) Uh, one, my parents noted right away that dress shops that advertised beauti...that had baby clothes, that were selling baby clothes had put the picture in their store front windows.</span> <span id="s111">Uh, post cards were reproduced made from that picture just for mailing.</span> <span id="s112">They were used...they were on every newsstand in the country.</span> <span id="s113">They were post cards.</span> <span id="s114">One day, one of my mother's...my father's sisters, Ida...my Tante Ida--who was living in Lithuania at the time--went into a store to buy me a birthday card for my first birthday.</span> <span id="s115">That was in May '35.</span> <span id="s116">And she picked up...she saw that picture with a statement on the bottom " "--"Best wishes to the Birthday"-- as a birthday card.</span> <span id="s117">And my Aunt Ida went to the cashier and said, "Where did you get this photo?"</span> <span id="s118">She says, "Oh, this is not just a picture.</span> <span id="s119">This is a real baby.</span> <span id="s120">It's a Berliner baby."</span> <span id="s121">And my aunt didn't say another word, but she bought the postcard uh...which my parents brought with them throughout the years.</span> <span id="s122">Uh, things were turning from bad to worse in Germany at the time, as we all know.</span> <span id="s123">Uh, one of the things that happened is that my mother was somewhat careful about taking me to the Tiergarten, and going with me places.</span> <span id="s124">She didn't want people to recognize me...uh certainly when I started to talk, [to] say what my name was.</span> <span id="s125">My Aunt Masha, my youngest...my mother's younger sister, came from Latvia at the time of my birth and spent a lot of time with me then, too.</span> <span id="s126">And uh...she too is often very careful about where she took me and where we went.</span> <span id="s127">Uh, my mother had one friend who...of the family, Mrs. Grossman, who went to visit a friend of hers...uh in a small town in Germany.</span> <span id="s128">Uh, I don't remember the name of the town, but it was not anywhere near Berlin.</span> <span id="s129">I think it was in the mountains somewhere.</span> <span id="s130">And this woman went to visit her friend, and found my baby picture framed on the wall in her house.</span> <span id="s131">And Mrs. Grossman said, uh, "My Gosh!</span> <span id="s132">Where did you get this picture?"</span> <span id="s133">She said, "Oh, this was...I got this from the magazine.</span> <span id="s134">Isn't that beautiful?"</span> <span id="s135">And Mrs. Grossman said, "But that is Hessy Levinsons."</span> <span id="s136">And the woman said, "What!</span> <span id="s137">Levinsons, did you say?"</span> <span id="s138">And she ripped the...her picture off from wall.</span> <span id="s139">Woman...and said, "Levinsons!?"</span> <span id="s140">And she was going to throw it away.</span> <span id="s141">And looked at it again and said, "No.</span> <span id="s142">This baby is too cute."</span> <span id="s143">And she hung it back on the wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Those were just few of the incidences that happened at the time.</span> <span id="s145">Uh, my parents had uh been warned before...even before I was born.</span> <span id="s146">They had consulted the Latvian Consulate about what to do, about how long to stay in Germany and so on.</span> <span id="s147">And the Latvian Consulate told them, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s148">German Jews... I mean, you're not Germans.</span> <span id="s149">And as Latvians, you don't have anything to worry about it.</span> <span id="s150">You'll... I let you know when it's time to leave.</span> <span id="s151">Don't...You don't have to leave yet."</span> <span id="s152">And my parents... That's why my parents stayed for awhile.</span> <span id="s153">But uh my sister was born at the end of 1936.</span> <span id="s154">And my father was set up doing fairly well, as I said.</span> <span id="s155">At one point, he had a very bad experience, however.</span> <span id="s156">He was sitting in his office with an accountant.</span> <span id="s157">This accountant was a devoted member of the Nazi party, but he also got to like and respect my parents very much.</span> <span id="s158">He became very friendly with my parents.</span> <span id="s159">Hieronomus (ph) was his name.</span> <span id="s160">And in fact, one day, my...Hieronomous (ph) came to the house and asked my mother to help him sew on his swastika armband, because it was coming loose.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Fortunately, it was a Sabbath and my mother said to him, "You know, as a Jew I am not allowed to sew on the Sabbath."</span> <span id="s162">So she got out of that one easily enough, cleverly enough, I thought.</span> <span id="s163">Uh, however, Hieronomus (ph) played a very important role in our lives.</span> <span id="s164">Uh, there was one day when the Gestapo marched into my father's office and simply arrested him.</span> <span id="s165">It had turned out that somebody had reported him, for some reason that remains obscure.</span> <span id="s166">One of the uh people with whom he was dealing apparently reported him.</span> <span id="s167">And my father was taken away by the Gestapo, and Hieronomus (ph) did (chuckle) a classic movie type scene.</span> <span id="s168">He got in his car and followed the car that my father was in.</span> <span id="s169">He was taken to some headquarters.</span> <span id="s170">And within minutes, Hieronomus (ph) had followed, threw open the doors, apparently screamed, "Heil Hitler!"</span> <span id="s171">He was immediately admitted to the room.</span> <span id="s172">And Hieronomus (ph) vouched for my father as not being uh in any way associated with anything anti the Regime.</span> <span id="s173">My mother also had some experiences that were sort of unpleasant.</span> <span id="s174">One of the neighbors in the house had uh reported her as having criticized Hitler once.</span> <span id="s175">She just...a comment she had made on one of...photographs that Hitler made once.</span> <span id="s176">And the landlord of the building vouched for my mother.</span> <span id="s177">[He] said, "No, she could never have said anything unpleasant about our leader."</span> <span id="s178">And so there were people who helped them here and there.</span> <span id="s179">But things got very, very tenuous.</span> <span id="s180">And so my father decided to move to Paris.</span> <span id="s181">And we moved to Paris before the war.</span> <span id="s182">During this time, my parents were very close to their families.</span> <span id="s183">And we had spent every summer in Latvia.</span> <span id="s184">Uh, in 1938, we had spent the summer in Latvia again.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Uh, that was the last time we went, because in the summer of '39 my father said, "This year we are not going."</span> <span id="s186">And probably if he hadn't made that decision, I wouldn't be here today.</span> <span id="s187">In any case, all those who were left behind were...died in the war.</span> <span id="s188">The only people who survived were one brothers of my mother's who came to America; some of my father's older brothers and sisters who had come here also when he was a child, long before the war; my Aunt Masha, who was with us in Germany, who went to England; and my aunt and uncle who had moved to Leningrad.</span> <span id="s189">Everyone else landed up being victims of the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">My...I..</span> <span id="s191">.</span> <span id="s192">I..</span> <span id="s193">.</span> <span id="s194">I should say... Let me back up a little.</span> <span id="s195">My two grandfathers had died before the war.</span> <span id="s196">My mother's father died when she was a child--the painter.</span> <span id="s197">Uh, my father's father died shortly before I was born, and I was named after him.</span> <span id="s198">His name was Hessel (ph).</span> <span id="s199">Uh, we moved to Paris, and life there was both interesting and difficult.</span> <span id="s200">Interesting, because my parents enjoyed the cultural life and excitement that the city has to offer; but difficult, because of the times, of course, and the difficulty of getting settled.</span> <span id="s201">My father was amazingly ingenious, and was able to set up business and start working again.</span> <span id="s202">Uh, after Paris fell, I became very conscious...I was told, "Don't speak German on the streets."</span> <span id="s203">And my sister and I were very conscious of the fact that we... somehow it was bad to speak German, and we...it was very difficult for us, who grew up speaking... At that time we spoke German and French.</span> <span id="s204">But uh I remember one time we were befriended by some German soldiers, and they gave us chocolates.</span> <span id="s205">And we started talking to them, until we realized that we had been told not to do that and then ran away, very quickly.</span> <span id="s206">(Chuckle) Anyway, uh we were in France altogether...uh we were in Paris when France fell, and...or became occupied.</span> <span id="s207">And at one point, the concierge of my parents' building--which was in the very elegant area of the 16th arrondissement in France, in Paris--uh told...warned us that Germans were coming and rounding up Jews, and suggested that we not go back to the apartment right away.</span> <span id="s208">My father then arranged for my mother and my sister and I uh to uh go to [Mimac (ph)]-sur-Mer.</span> <span id="s209">My sister is called Noemi.</span> <span id="s210">So Noemi, my mother and I moved to [Mimac (ph)]-sur-Mer, which is in...on the coast, on the Atlantic Coast of France--not far from Bordeaux.</span> <span id="s211">My father stayed in Paris trying to arrange ways to leave.</span> <span id="s212">He um...my mother had a rather difficult time in [Mimac (ph)]-sur-Mer.</span> <span id="s213">Uh, the...she was conscious of being the only Jew in this so-called resort hotel where we...my father had arranged for us to stay.</span> <span id="s214">I remember distinctly there was one Frenchman who was rather aloof and cold and severe looking.</span> <span id="s215">But he had a big dog that Noemi and I loved to play with, and we played with him quite a bit.</span> <span id="s216">Well, one day the landlady of the resort told my mother that she would have to leave.</span> <span id="s217">That she was under too much pressure, and that she could not keep us anymore.</span> <span id="s218">So my mother went to the Chief of Police of the town, and he was very cooperative.</span> <span id="s219">He said to her, "I believe that there are people in this town who are not acting in the best interest for France.</span> <span id="s220">I will see what I can do in your behalf."</span> <span id="s221">So my mother felt reassured.</span> <span id="s222">Shortly thereafter, the man with the dog disappeared.</span> <span id="s223">It turned out that he was spying for the Germans; and the Chief of Police was only too glad to have been able to accumulate enough evidence that I guess he had from other sources to arrest him.</span> <span id="s224">Nevertheless, my mother's life got to be more and more complicated and trying.</span> <span id="s225">And soon enough, shortly thereafter the concierge came and told my mother the same story again.</span> <span id="s226">But this time, there was no question that she would have to leave by the next day.</span> <span id="s227">My mother tried her friend, the Chief of Police, again.</span> <span id="s228">And he told her, "Madame Levinsons, I have done everything I can for you."</span> <span id="s229">He could handle French, but right now the Germans were down his back and now he couldn't do anything further for her.</span> <span id="s230">So that night, my mother tells me that she resorted to all praying and pleading for help...(long sigh)...at guidance for her family from the Lord for some way of trying to see what she could do so she would not get separated from her husband because that's how families got separated during the war, and she knew that if she had to leave, he would never find us again.</span> <span id="s231">And while she was up that whole night, pacing the whole night, around 4 o'clock in the morning there was a knock on the door, and the concierge was knocking said, "Madame Levinsons!</span> <span id="s232">Madame Levinsons!</span> <span id="s233">Votre mari est arrivé."</span> <span id="s234">--"Your husband is here."</span> <span id="s235">It was the most joyous moment my mother could imagine at the time.</span> <span id="s236">We packed up the car, and the four of us drove away and we drove to meet a group.</span> <span id="s237">And my own memory is rather vague of that at the time.</span> <span id="s238">But we joined up with a group that was going to take us across occupied territory to the Zone Libre [NB: "Free Zone"], which Nice was still in the Zone Libre at the time.</span> <span id="s239">We met some other people from Paris also, some other friends of ours.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">And...in this group; and we apparently at one point, we went by truck to a certain point, and then we had to go across the woods, walking through swamp that...and be very, very quiet-- because apparently a German encampment was behind the woods.</span> <span id="s241">At the end of that road, at the end of those...there would be another truck to meet us.</span> <span id="s242">Uh, I did not know those details at the time.</span> <span id="s243">(Chuckle) What knew is that this very ominous looking Frenchman, who had this enormous knife around his belt, took it out and told the children that any kid who opened his mouth would have his tongue cut out.</span> <span id="s244">Let me tell you, I have never forgotten that moment.</span> <span id="s245">(Chuckle) I went with my lips sealed like this throughout the entire escapade.</span> <span id="s246">Except that, at one point, I couldn't contain myself and I asked my father's friend--who held me by the hand- -I said, "What are we doing?"</span> <span id="s247">He said, "This is a sport.</span> <span id="s248">We're running.</span> <span id="s249">This is a sport."</span> <span id="s250">And I said, "I hate this sport."</span> <span id="s251">And then I saw this guy with a knife, and I contained myself.</span> <span id="s252">The babies, the children--including my sister Noemi--were all fed chocolates.</span> <span id="s253">They got all the chocolates one could round up during the war to keep these kids quiet.</span> <span id="s254">We got to the Zone Libre, and immediately my father applied for American immigration.</span> <span id="s255">Uh, I think, in fact, if-- although my memory is not quite sure about this at the time--I think, in fact, that my father had applied for it while he was still in Paris, and had been granted it at that point when we arrived in Nice.</span> <span id="s256">But when you get an American immigration visa--which is hard to get, because you need to prove that you can sustain yourself and, you know, you're not going to land up being on welfare or burden to anyone in this country, uh ...and that you are good health and so.</span> <span id="s257">But even after all this, you are told that you have 90 days to reach American shores.</span> <span id="s258">And my father realized, as time was going by, that there was no way in which he could get his family to the U.S. within the time timeframe left.</span> <span id="s259">Thirty days before the visa expired, he requested an extension from Washington.</span> <span id="s260">The Atlantic...you know, across the Atlantic, there were no commercial flights at the time.</span> <span id="s261">Uh, this was in 1941.</span> <span id="s262">Uh, the ocean was patrolled.</span> <span id="s263">Submarines...uh... Anyway, we waited for a reply from Washington.</span> <span id="s264">And [it] eventually came, and it said, "No."</span> <span id="s265">They denied us an extension.</span> <span id="s266">So, again, (sigh) I guess I could say it's not thanks to Uncle Sam that I am sitting here today.</span> <span id="s267">My father tried every avenue available to him.</span> <span id="s268">He went to a series of Latin American consulates in France, and uh...in Nice; and eventually landed up with a Cuban Consulate who would listen to him, also accept some money, and granted him visas to Cuba.</span> <span id="s269">Uh, we spent a relatively...my sister and I have relatively nice memories of Nice.</span> <span id="s270">Uh, it was...it was not much food.</span> <span id="s271">My parents never wanted to touch ratatouille again, because that's the only thing they ate for 8 months.</span> <span id="s272">(Chuckle) Uh, we didn't go to school, of course.</span> <span id="s273">We did try to lead some kind of normal semblance of life.</span> <span id="s274">I remember it was that time when I learned swimming.</span> <span id="s275">I learned to swim, had some swimming lessons.</span> <span id="s276">Somehow tried to lead a fairly normal life.</span> <span id="s277">The one very important person joined us at that time who had been left behind at Paris for a while, and that is our nurse, uh Gerta.</span> <span id="s278">Gerta was a German-Jewish nurse who came to take care of me when my sister was born.</span> <span id="s279">In other words, my mother hired her in Berlin.</span> <span id="s280">Uh, I was extremely spoiled at the time.</span> <span id="s281">(Laughing) I'm back tracking a bit.</span> <span id="s282">Gerta had a terrible time with me.</span> <span id="s283">(Laughter) Maybe partly because of all the fuss that was made about me.</span> <span id="s284">But anyway, she vowed that the next baby's not going to be so spoiled.</span> <span id="s285">Gerta was extremely attached to Noemi.</span> <span id="s286">To me, too, I think, eventually.</span> <span id="s287">In any case, my parents were very devoted to her; and we both grew up feeling very close to her, uh and Gerta was with us in Nice.</span> <span id="s288">My father...uh eventually got us a visa to Cuba, and was told that Gerta would get the visa eventually, too, to the United States, because she had a brother in the United States.</span> <span id="s289">So we left, and went to Marseilles.</span> <span id="s290">In Marseilles, we waited for a ship to take us to Cuba.</span> <span id="s291">It's funny, you know.</span> <span id="s292">When I think back, my mother says she was wonderful...very good student in school except in geography.</span> <span id="s293">And geography was her worst subject.</span> <span id="s294">She didn't even know where Cuba was on the map before she found out about us, and here we were going to go to Cuba.</span> <span id="s295">But, in any case, uh the uh one interesting thing happened before we left.</span> <span id="s296">My father heard that Gerta was not going to get the visa to the United States, and that she was left behind.</span> <span id="s297">And he was going to try to get her out.</span> <span id="s298">But by that time, there was a German line of control and you had to have special passes to go from Nice to Marseilles-- which we had, but my father did not have a pass to go back and get her.</span> <span id="s299">And he really wanted to go back and get Gerta out.</span> <span id="s300">So he thought he's going to try it anyway.</span> <span id="s301">He boarded a train in Marseilles without a pass.</span> <span id="s302">He had a ticket, but that wasn't the issue.</span> <span id="s303">And he got himself...he got on the train, and then he thought of a very clever way to foil the French.</span> <span id="s304">When he got to the border- -the "border" in the sense of the occupied zone--and, of course, at that time the Petain regime was cooperating with the Germans.</span> <span id="s305">Although they were all French patrolling, they were all cooperating with the Germans.</span> <span id="s306">And he thought [to] himself, "There is only one way to foil the French.</span> <span id="s307">What is it that is holy to the French?</span> <span id="s308">Dining and eating is holy to the French."</span> <span id="s309">So he went to the dining car, and started eating and eating and eating and drinking and wined.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">And they sat at that border for hours, and he kept on eating non-stop.</span> <span id="s311">He wasn't do diddling or daddling.</span> <span id="s312">He was eating.</span> <span id="s313">And he ate for several hours, and nobody touched him.</span> <span id="s314">And he made it to Nice.</span> <span id="s315">And when he made it to Nice, he had a gold cigarette case that he went to pawn to get some money.</span> <span id="s316">And he got that money, and was able to help Gerta in case she needed passage.</span> <span id="s317">And then he went back to the Cuban Consulate and said he needs another visa.</span> <span id="s318">And the Consulate denied.</span> <span id="s319">He says, "Impossible!</span> <span id="s320">Impossible!</span> <span id="s321">I am already in hot water for having given you all this.</span> <span id="s322">Impossible!</span> <span id="s323">I have given away too many.</span> <span id="s324">I cannot give another person."</span> <span id="s325">My father was not dis...easily to be dissuaded; and he persisted and persisted, and, of course, they got nowhere for awhile.</span> <span id="s326">And finally the Cuban Consulate said, "You know, there is an old law on the books that when you're given your visa, you can take all your possessions with you.</span> <span id="s327">Now, the old law says that slaves are a possession of the owner.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Would you say that this lady is...woman is your slave?"</span> <span id="s329">And my father quickly said, "Yes.</span> <span id="s330">She is my slave and my possession, and she needs to come with me."</span> <span id="s331">And on that basis, Gerta got the grant...visa to come to Cuba.</span> <span id="s332">But she did not have a pass to get back to Marseilles, and that was too dangerous.</span> <span id="s333">He somehow arranged for her to get to Casablanca.</span> <span id="s334">All of this was extremely complicated and extremely difficult to do.</span> <span id="s335">My father was really very ingenious.</span> <span id="s336">Uh, and somehow, again, he got himself back to Marseilles through the line.</span> <span id="s337">Apparently, on the way back there was not such a long border stop.</span> <span id="s338">But the big crisis was on one way.</span> <span id="s339">He had...he did have his visa to Cuba on...to show that he could get out.</span> <span id="s340">So on the way back, it wasn't quite as difficult for him as rationale for going into Nice.</span> <span id="s341">We sailed on a Portugese ship, the (ph), from Marseilles in the beginning of 1942.</span> <span id="s342">Uh, I remember stopping in Casablanca to an impression I will never forget.</span> <span id="s343">The dazzling sun, the enormous amount of sand, women were all veiled, long robes for men.</span> <span id="s344">I thought this was some storybook.</span> <span id="s345">I had no idea what was happening and where we were.</span> <span id="s346">I was absolutely stunned at this image.</span> <span id="s347">Uh, we were not...we did not get off the boat.</span> <span id="s348">But in Casablanca, Gerta got on.</span> <span id="s349">And that was a very emotional reunion.</span> <span id="s350">Then we proceeded across the Atlantic with a ship full of refugees.</span> <span id="s351">My dear father provided for his family.</span> <span id="s352">We had a first class cabin all to ourselves.</span> <span id="s353">Before leaving Europe, my...one of the things my father had arranged for, while he was still in Paris, is to have all our furniture stored someplace safely in Europe.</span> <span id="s354">And so he had it stored in Portugal.</span> <span id="s355">And the reason was not so much the furniture--although it was quite elegant Queen Anne furniture which my parent...father had set up this very lovely apartment on the Rue de Messine in Paris when we had lived there.</span> <span id="s356">But the thing that was critical in that...in...in...in that box that the furniture [was in] were my grandfather's paintings.</span> <span id="s357">There were three of them...three paintings in there, which my father managed to store in Portugal, and which we recuperated after the war and after we came to the United States.</span> <span id="s358">The three paintings are, one, a self portrait of my grandfather, who looks like Toulouse-Lautrec--big black hat, big fur coat, very distinguished looking.</span> <span id="s359">A picture...painting of his father-in-law, [ (ph)], in the morning.</span> <span id="s360">The light shining on him looks like that picture would come alive.</span> <span id="s361">I think that was the one that they wanted for the Museum.</span> <span id="s362">And a third picture, of a painting of a poor man who used to not always have enough food that my grandmother used to offer a cup of tea.</span> <span id="s363">She'd offer him some borscht or some tea, and would feed him.</span> <span id="s364">And so that's the portrait, the third painting that we have.</span> <span id="s365">My Aunt Masha brought two other paintings too.</span> <span id="s366">Uh, one is a magnificent...uh...paysage [Fr: "landscape"]--a scene of trees, the Berioshkas in snow.</span> <span id="s367">And another is uh a scene of a..</span> <span id="s368">.</span> <span id="s369">one of their brothers studying for Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s370">So those are the five paintings that we now have in New York.</span> <span id="s371">Anyway, we went on to Cuba.</span> <span id="s372">The boat...it took 3 and a half weeks to cross the Atlantic through a very circuitous route--to the very south, because we needed to avoid the war zones.</span> <span id="s373">Uh, we went far south, I believe, to cross and landed up first in Jamaica, which was again a very interesting uh sight for me.</span> <span id="s374">The...the trees, the climate, the people carrying baskets on their heads.</span> <span id="s375">I remember little things like that.</span> <span id="s376">Anyway, we went on to Cuba.</span> <span id="s377">This entire ship full of refugees, the entire hull of the ship, the basement people sleeping on the floor, all these people... (Sigh) We got off on Cuba and were put in a camp.</span> <span id="s378">It was called Camp Tiscornia.</span> <span id="s379">Uh, they didn't quite know what to do with us either.</span> <span id="s380">(Laughter) Which I guess was true of all the refugees, all from Europe and all different...many places.</span> <span id="s381">And we spent several weeks in Tiscornia, during which time my father figured how is he going to get started.</span> <span id="s382">He had pawned most of what he had in Europe to pay for visas and passage and boat; and we had just some, you know, few suitcases of personal possessions with us.</span> <span id="s383">He started to go to several banks in Cuba and asked for a loan to help him get started for a business.</span> <span id="s384">Uh, he had a lot of courage.</span> <span id="s385">He just walked into many of the banks, mostly American banks that were uh...had had, you know, large branches in Cuba.</span> <span id="s386">And (Laughter) they all asked, "What do you have for collateral?"</span> <span id="s387">"Myself.</span> <span id="s388">I am an honest man, and offer you me as collateral."</span> <span id="s389">And, as you can imagine, a bank doesn't deal with this kind of business.</span> <span id="s390">And they all laughed at him.</span> <span id="s391">Until, one day, he walked into the Royal Bank of Canada.</span> <span id="s392">And the Canadian uh officials at the bank looked at him and said, "You know what?</span> <span id="s393">We think we're going to give you a chance.</span> <span id="s394">We'll take our luck with you."</span> <span id="s395">And so they helped my father get started.</span> <span id="s396">He started first with uh some working in pin...with pineapple business, which was a wonderful product of Cuba, but realized that soon enough that wasn't going to be good for export to the United States because of competition from Hawaii.</span> <span id="s397">So he, by that time, got very clever about realizing that the Cubans had good cattle and were throwing away all kinds of meat casings and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Things that were...from the slaughter houses, things that were in ample use in Chicago.</span> <span id="s399">Uh, and he decided to set up a factory, the first factory...such factory in Cuba.</span> <span id="s400">Uh, we lived a very good life in Havana.</span> <span id="s401">We learned Spanish.</span> <span id="s402">Uh, we learned English, because my parents thought that we should go to a..</span> <span id="s403">.</span> <span id="s404">someday we might still come to the United States.</span> <span id="s405">So they wanted to send us to a English-speaking school.</span> <span id="s406">My parents were shocked at the American school in Havana.</span> <span id="s407">Uh, the American kids seemed to them totally undisciplined--chewing gum, the kinds of things (laughing) my parents were totally not used to.</span> <span id="s408">So Noemi and I landed up in a British school.</span> <span id="s409">A rather strict British school.</span> <span id="s410">And we had a few months of instruction of English; and then, the fall of '42, started in school.</span> <span id="s411">Uh, we knew neither language.</span> <span id="s412">We landed up learning English and Spanish simultaneously.</span> <span id="s413">We spoke German and French when we arrived.</span> <span id="s414">Uh, we didn't find it difficult, I must say.</span> <span id="s415">Kids learn very quickly, you know.</span> <span id="s416">It's a shame more people don't realize that.</span> <span id="s417">You learn...learning a language is very easy when you're a child.</span> <span id="s418">Uh, the one thing we did rebel against is French lessons.</span> <span id="s419">My father thought that French is a beautiful language, and he didn't want us to forget it.</span> <span id="s420">And so he hired a strict, fat, ugly French teacher to come and give us French lessons.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Now, I should back up as a little personal history.</span> <span id="s422">I grew up as a child not being able to stand ugly people.</span> <span id="s423">That's not a very good trait, but uh I couldn't stand an ugly nurse when I was a baby.</span> <span id="s424">I couldn't stand her to touch me.</span> <span id="s425">And this French teacher just turned me off.</span> <span id="s426">My sister didn't want to learn French at all.</span> <span id="s427">We both screamed and stomped, "We will never go back there!</span> <span id="s428">Whoever wants to go back to that place?"</span> <span id="s429">You know.</span> <span id="s430">Uh, my father persisted.</span> <span id="s431">And, of course, we've been back to France.</span> <span id="s432">So, anyway, we both learned.</span> <span id="s433">And Gerta, of course, was singularly untalented for learning any languages.</span> <span id="s434">She barely learned Spanish.</span> <span id="s435">She eventually learned English, and did go back to her brother in the United States.</span> <span id="s436">But not until I was 12 and Noemi was 10.</span> <span id="s437">So she spent a good time of...portion of time with us in Cuba, always speaking German to us.</span> <span id="s438">So we landed up speaking German and French, and German...I mean, and English and Spanish.</span> <span id="s439">We had a wonderful life in Cuba.</span> <span id="s440">My father became very successful.</span> <span id="s441">My mother had help.</span> <span id="s442">Life was easy.</span> <span id="s443">We enjoyed the schools.</span> <span id="s444">Uh, Noemi and I were...I was very, very reluctant to ever tell anyone that I was born in Berlin.</span> <span id="s445">I have not admitted that to anyone until I started telling people about the...my story.</span> <span id="s446">The magazine.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Until then, everyone always thought that I was French.</span> <span id="s448">My friends from Havana (laughter)...40 years later, I hate to tell them now.</span> <span id="s449">They still think I was born in Paris.</span> <span id="s450">It was very...it was something we didn't want to admit, about being German.</span> <span id="s451">Uh, even German- Jewish.</span> <span id="s452">We just didn't want any part of anything that had the German.</span> <span id="s453">We didn't want to talk German, except with Gerta.</span> <span id="s454">And I never did enjoy talking German after that; but now I guess I do.</span> <span id="s455">Uh, I can also say that years later--even after I was married--and my husband went to Germany on business trips many times, and I refused to go with him for years.</span> <span id="s456">But that's just an aside.</span> <span id="s457">Uh, eventually... Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: At what point did you come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: Uh, as soon as we got a visa.</span> <span id="s460">(Laughter) My father wanted us to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s461">He did not want us to live in Cuba forever, uh because...for two reasons.</span> <span id="s462">He did not want us to marry Catholics, and he did not want us to lead the lives of the Cuban housewife--which invariably meant staying at home while husbands had mistresses.</span> <span id="s463">And he realized that was...did not correspond to his value system-- or my mother's, for that matter.</span> <span id="s464">So it was again a matter of trying to get to the United States.</span> <span id="s465">After the war, of course, my parents being Latvian, they were...from citizens from behind the Iron Curtain.</span> <span id="s466">And it was very difficult to get another Lat...American visa.</span> <span id="s467">But we did come... eventually get the visa.</span> <span id="s468">Uh, and we uh...got the immigration visa in 1948, which meant that we came to the United States and immigrated.</span> <span id="s469">But we went back to Cuba to live.</span> <span id="s470">You don't have to stay here as an immigrant.</span> <span id="s471">I..</span> <span id="s472">.</span> <span id="s473">You know, once you immigrate, you don't...that doesn't stop you from travelling.</span> <span id="s474">So we went back to Cuba still for a year or so, then came back and eventually settled here.</span> <span id="s475">Uh, my sister and I were both teenagers at the time.</span> <span id="s476">I spent only two years in high school in New York, and was very miserable.</span> <span id="s477">Uh, I was really not geared to be a New York teenager.</span> <span id="s478">I wore pigtails and bobby socks, uh no make-up.</span> <span id="s479">I was really, uh as some of my friends said, "square."</span> <span id="s480">Uh, I was very unhappy in high school in New York.</span> <span id="s481">Big high school.</span> <span id="s482">Uh, I came from a small private school in Cuba.</span> <span id="s483">I eventually found my niche in New York when I went to college.</span> <span id="s484">I found I had very good scholastic background from the school.</span> <span id="s485">As I said, I only spent two years in high school here.</span> <span id="s486">I was able to, you know, finish my language study and I had good history background and I spoke English with a British accent- -which, by the way, landed me the privilege of landing up in a foreign accent speech class in the New York City high school, to get rid of my foreign accent.</span> <span id="s487">And there I found myself with all the Puerto Rican children, and we just had a wonderful time talking Spanish.</span> <span id="s488">In any case, I went to Barnard College.</span> <span id="s489">Uh, my father preferred that I go to Barnard rather than to Radcliffe, so that I would still be in New York.</span> <span id="s490">He was still commuting to Cuba.</span> <span id="s491">His business was still in Havana.</span> <span id="s492">He had met a friend of his who survived the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s493">A high...a childhood friend, who came out of the camp with the numbers and everything.</span> <span id="s494">And he said to Charlie Salkin (ph), was his name, "Charlie, why don't you go to Havana, run the factory for me.</span> <span id="s495">And I will do the export and the business end of it from New York."</span> <span id="s496">And so they did that.</span> <span id="s497">My father spent a lot of time commuting to Havana, which is why he had hoped that I would stay in New York for college.</span> <span id="s498">I didn't think I would like Barnard, but really began to find my niche there and really enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s499">I majored in chemistry and did graduate in biochemistry.</span> <span id="s500">Uh, my father's business eventually collapsed in Cuba.</span> <span id="s501">As you well know, the events in Cuba led to Castro, eventually.</span> <span id="s502">And my poor father lost his business again.</span> <span id="s503">And by that time, he was older.</span> <span id="s504">And his friends in New York, everyone, was very worried about how he was going to make it.</span> <span id="s505">My father was the eternal optimist.</span> <span id="s506">He always said, "I have survived Hitler.</span> <span id="s507">I will survive Castro."</span> <span id="s508">And he did.</span> <span id="s509">He did.</span> <span id="s510">He came to New York, and his business was taken from him.</span> <span id="s511">Charlie eventually immigrated to Miami himself.</span> <span id="s512">And his business apparently was sold to Poland, and eventually collapsed because they couldn't run it.</span> <span id="s513">They didn't have spare parts.</span> <span id="s514">So as far as we know, it's dead.</span> <span id="s515">Uh, I met my husband in New York.</span> <span id="s516">Uh, my husband is born American.</span> <span id="s517">His name is Earl.</span> <span id="s518">He is a mathematician.</span> <span id="s519">He has a Ph.D. from Yale, and was an instructor at Columbia when I met him.</span> <span id="s520">Uh, we were married in New York.</span> <span id="s521">My uh...we had children several years later.</span> <span id="s522">Our first daughter was born, Nina.</span> <span id="s523">Nina Chaya.</span> <span id="s524">We called ...named her after my paternal grandmother, whose name was Chaya.</span> <span id="s525">And uh...two years later, in 19... Nina was born in 1963, and Alexander Joseph was born in 1965.</span> <span id="s526">Alex was named after my mother's brother, Joseph, who had died shortly before he was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p></body></html>
