2015</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mrs. Erika Tamar, on December 18th, 2015, in Manhattan, New York.</span> <span id="s12">Thank you very, very much to – for agreeing to speak with us today, to share your experiences, your early years, and to acquaint some of the people who will be watching this interview about what the circumstances were of your leaving Europe and coming to the United States.</span> <span id="s13">I’m going to start with the most basic questions, and then we’ll go from there, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Answer: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: So, can you tell me what was the date of your birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: June 10th, 1934.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: In Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: That was my second question, where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Vienna, Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s22">And what was your name at birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Erika Tamar.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: Erika Tamar.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: I reverted back to my maiden name.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s27">Tell me – tell me a little bit about your family.</span> <span id="s28">What were your father’s na – what was your father’s name, and your mother’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: My father’s name is Julius Tamar, my mother is Pauline Hutterer Tamar.</span> <span id="s30">My father was a physician, and he practiced in Vienna.</span> <span id="s31">He graduated from University of Vienna Medical School.</span> <span id="s32">But both my parents were originally from Poland, which explains a little bit why my brother and I had to come separately, because we were Viennese born, which was one quota system.</span> <span id="s33">Polish born was a whole different quota system.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: We’ll get there.</span> <span id="s35">We’ll –</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: My – my parents –</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Much harder –</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: – to, you know, get –</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: To come to the United St –</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: – to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s43">Almost hopeless because there was a long waiting list.</span> <span id="s44">Am I going on too long, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: No, no, no, no, I will ask questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: What we’re going to start with though is, rather than the trip to the United States, I want to find out as much as I can about the years before then.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: About your family’s situation.</span> <span id="s50">Can you repeat again your mother’s maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Hutterer.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Hutterer?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Hutterer, h-u-t-t-e-r-e-r.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Okay, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: And both my parents born in Poland, my father came to Vienna to go to medical school, and remained in Vienna.</span> <span id="s56">And my mother had met him in Poland, th-then joined him at the university.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: I don’t know if she was a serious student, or she was following my father, frankly.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: And then they lived in Vienna, though they still had families in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Do you know what part of Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: What part of Poland?</span> <span id="s63">That – it was more than one town, but the one that my mother was from, and talked about the most was, if I pronounce this, Przemyśl.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Przemyśl.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Przemyśl.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: But they also had a lumber mill, which I believe was in Katowice.</span> <span id="s68">This was her parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Her parents, okay.</span> <span id="s70">Did she have brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Yes, she did.</span> <span id="s72">She had two brothers, one sister.</span> <span id="s73">My father had brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s74">I know less about his family than I do about my mother’s, because she talked more –</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: – you know, about her history.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Did these – did these brothers and sisters remain in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: And – from both sides of the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: The same with grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: There was one surviving member of my mother’s family, my cousin George, who at that time was Ludzic(ph) Saltman(ph), who was interviewed by the museum, and wrote a book, and you know, it – it’s easy to research him.</span> <span id="s85">He went through camps from the time he was 12 to the time he was 17.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: And when my mother heard that he had survived, of course, you know, she brought him over.</span> <span id="s88">On my father’s side, his brother survived, because he went into Russia with the Red Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: But his wife and 18 month old baby did not.</span> <span id="s91">The baby was lost, because apparently they had arranged with Christian neighbors to take the baby, and could never find the neighbors, never found the baby.</span> <span id="s92">So, big question mark.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: And he would have been too young to know his name or background, if he had survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: But those were the only survivors of what were rather large families.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: I me – I mean, huge, huge, as far as losses go, just huge.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: And it also illustrates just how much on the edge your situation was.</span> <span id="s100">That is, your parents’ situation and your own, how close your nuclear family was to the same fate.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Oh, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: My cousin George’s family and mine had many, many similarities, and it could have – George’s story could have been my story, and his – you know.</span> <span id="s104">I mean it did – we were the – the same type of people, the same type of family, and th – it’s just fate.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Do you want to hear more about life in Vienna, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Yes, I do, I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Remember that I was four years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Yes, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: So my memory is a little hazy.</span> <span id="s111">I’m going to tell you some things that I do remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Please.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: But they may be colored by things that my parents told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: So I don’t know if everything is really clear a memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: I do remember the Nazis coming in.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: I remember my father and brother, who was nine at the time, and my mother too, of course, avidly listening to the radio and Hitler shouting, but I didn’t necessarily understand what he said, I just knew he was a bad man, shouting all the time.</span> <span id="s120">On Kristallnacht, the morning after, my father took me for a walk, and we saw the broken glass, and the broken store windows, and I knew it was very sad, but I did not entirely understand what had happened.</span> <span id="s121">But I do want to tell you something about Kristallnacht, because –</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Yeah, do tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: – it was – you know, they said it was a spontaneous outpouring of rage, and that is simply not true, it was preplanned.</span> <span id="s124">My father had a patient, we don’t know who it was, my father never knew, who was apparently very high up in the Nazi party.</span> <span id="s125">And very often a Nazi had a favor due.</span> <span id="s126">And the day before Kristallnacht, th-the day before, my father got an anonymous phone call that said, stay at home, you and your wife, don’t leave the apartment tomorrow.</span> <span id="s127">Stay at home.</span> <span id="s128">And of course that day was the day when they were yanking Jewish men off the street, and arresting them, and humiliating Jewish women, and making them wash the sidewalks with toothbrushes, but my father had that really strange protection, and he didn’t know from whom, but getting in a call like that –</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: – he, you know, paid attention to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: And it does tell you it’s preplanned.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Ye-Yeah –</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: I mean, it –</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: It tells you, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Of course, because whoever made the call knew the day before that it was going to happen, exactly what was going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: So I think that’s historically interesting.</span> <span id="s139">But that’s less in my memory, and more my parents’ story.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s141">Now, do you – your father takes you out the next day, and you’re a four year old girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: I don’t know if it was the next day.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Okay, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: I –</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: – he takes you out soon after.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: We took a walk, and there was a lot of broken store windows.</span> <span id="s147">Whether it was the next day or not, I really don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: But I do remember that, I do, taking a walk with him, and a – a sense of sadness, even if I didn’t know exactly why.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: But did you also have a sense of fear, or – or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: I did.</span> <span id="s152">Not all the time, and not in terms of broken shop windows.</span> <span id="s153">Where my sense of fear showed itself – and I don’t remember any other incidents where I was really afraid, because I was very secure in my family, and I was very young.</span> <span id="s154">My mother sent me to the bakery, which was in our building, so it wasn’t very far for me to go, to pick up some bread, and I went, and there was a soldier with the big, black boots, and I forgot about asking for the bread, and I ran home.</span> <span id="s155">And my mother asked me what had happened, I said there was a Nazi soldier and I was afraid he was going to arrest me, so I ran home.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s157">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Now, part of that is clearer memory of mine, part of it is my mother’s memory, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: – everything I’m telling you is a little bit mixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Well, I – I – I appreciate that you’re making those – those comments, because – because it’s important.</span> <span id="s162">It’s important for us to realize when someone is relating an episode, how much of it is direct memory, and how much of it can be influenced by what you’re told.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Right.</span> <span id="s164">The direct memories, I remember feeling afraid and running home.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: The conversation with my mother afterwards of what I was afraid of, I don’t remember, that – that’s my –</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: That was told, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: That was told to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s170">Describe your home a little bit, in Vienna.</span> <span id="s171">What did it look like?</span> <span id="s172">Were you in apartment building, or single family house?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: It was an apartment.</span> <span id="s174">I don’t remember details.</span> <span id="s175">There was a park across the street.</span> <span id="s176">In the summertime before – y-you know, when life was good and prosperous, we usually went away somewhere in the country in the summertime.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s178">And – and you had one sibling, an older brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: I had an older brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Henry – Hein – in German, Heinzie(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: But when he came to the United States, Heinz became Henry.</span> <span id="s184">He was, when we left, I was going on five, he was nine.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: And I think the only reason the Krauses(ph) could take me, because I was so young, is because I would be traveling with an older sibling.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Alone, I think I would have just been too young.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s190">A-And what language did you speak at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: German.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: German?</span> <span id="s193">Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: If my parents didn’t want us to understand something, which went on forever, they spoke Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: But I didn’t understand Polish, we spoke German.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Did either of them speak Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: No, I think maybe my grandparents might have.</span> <span id="s201">But my parents were very assimilated.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: That’s what I was su – that’s what it suggested, is that – that they would have been – were you a religious family?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Not religious at all, definitely secular, but with a strong sense of being Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Which I may not have known when I was young, but you know later, I mean, there – there was a sense of being part of the Jewish nation –</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: – if not the religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Got it.</span> <span id="s211">And I get the impression also that since your father went to Vienna to go to medical school, he must have come from a family that could have afford to send him there.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: I’m not sure of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s215">I – I don’t think he came from wealth.</span> <span id="s216">I think his father might have been a grocer.</span> <span id="s217">He spoke much less about his background and his family.</span> <span id="s218">My mother seemed to come from a – happier circumstances, and talked a lot about her family.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Was her family well-to-do?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Was her family well-to-do?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Comparatively, yes, because they owned a sawmill.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: A sawmill, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: I don’t know how well-to-do that is, but they were a more prominent family than my father’s family.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s226">Were either of your parents storytellers?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: My mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: She was?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: She told wonderful stories, and my oldest son is a historian and had tried so hard to tape her stories, and the minute he put a microphone in front of her, or had a tape running, she froze.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Oh, that happens with so many people.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: So, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Yes, she was a great storyteller and she made her life in Poland and her life in Vienna very vivid for all of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s237">And what kind – do you remember any particular stories she told you about her own childhood, her own growing up years?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Yeah, a lot of stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: I don’t know if this is relevant, this – we’re talking about way –</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Yeah, that’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: – back in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: That’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Because they lived in a small town, she was boarded out to go to school to get a better education, which she hated.</span> <span id="s245">And at some point her father gave her a violin.</span> <span id="s246">I don’t think my mother was musical, but her father gi – did give her a violin.</span> <span id="s247">And the maid in the house that she was living in got angry about something, took the violin and smashed it.</span> <span id="s248">Not even angry at my mother, she was just –</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Angry.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: – had an argument with s-somebody else, and this was the object that she smashed.</span> <span id="s251">I also know that my mother hated being away from home.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Did she?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: You know, sh-she was young, she was maybe nine, 10, I’m not sure, and she really didn’t like being away from home.</span> <span id="s254">My mother’s father, for that time and that period, was, I think something of an original.</span> <span id="s255">My mother was very bright, and did well in school, and he appreciated that, and he was interested in furthering her education, even over the sons in the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: You know, though she was a girl –</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: – she had – he felt she had promise, and he was very interested in furthering her education.</span> <span id="s260">Which is, I think for that time period was a little bit unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Yeah, I would agree, I would agree.</span> <span id="s262">Did you ever visit your grandparents in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s264">My brother did.</span> <span id="s265">I was still too young, I stayed home in Vienna, and the following year I was going to, but then of course everything changed when Hitler came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: I will tell you that my mother, when she sent us, heard from the Polish family, and they said, how can you do this?</span> <span id="s268">How can you send your children away?</span> <span id="s269">He just wants German speaking lands.</span> <span id="s270">Come home to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Oh my.</span> <span id="s272">Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: But my mother was in Vienna and had a different picture of what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: It was today Germany, tomorrow the world, and she took that seriously.</span> <span id="s276">I do remember seeing the Hitlerjugend, the girls –</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: – marching down the street with, you know, pretty blonde braids, teenagers, and I thought they looked so wonderful and I so admired them.</span> <span id="s279">And I told my mother, when I’m a teenager, I want to join the Hitlerjugend girls, and my mother explained that I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s280">But when I came to the United States, I could join the Girl Scouts.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: She said that at the time in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: This was –</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: – you know, shortly when –</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Before.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: – she knew I was going to be leaving.</span> <span id="s289">Fast forward, once I actually came to New York, I had no interest in the Girl Scouts, but at that time, you know, the Hitlerjugend girls –</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: – teenagers, pretty, blonde, with – looked so – that’s what I wanted to be when I grew up.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Well, you know, little girls admire older girls, and latch onto them, and – and look up to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: Especially when they’re parading, with music –</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: – and, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: – I mean, I – I wasn’t admiring one girl, I was admiring a whole –</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: All of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: – marching column.</span> <span id="s300">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s302">Did your parents live in the center of Vienna, or in a residential area?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: I think it – within Vienna the city, but not in the very center.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: If I’m – Goldschlagstrasser –</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Goldschlagstrasser?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Which is what I remember.</span> <span id="s310">And I don’t remember which [indecipherable] I have it written down somewhere, but I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s311">I think it was a neighborhood of Vienna, but not the, you know, center of Vienna where the opera is.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: That was, you know, a side area, but still part of the city limits.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: And your father, did he have a specialty?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: No, he was a general practitioner.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: De – general practitioner.</span> <span id="s317">Do you have any other – you were too young to start any schooling I would take it.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: No, I didn’t go to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: My brother did, but then at – during the Hitler time, he stopped going to school.</span> <span id="s321">But I ne – I never went to school, I was too young.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: Did – do you have any other memories of coming into contact with any of the authorities, the – the Nazi authorities that took over?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: I really – I – you know, I was sheltered and protected as a little girl, so I really didn’t come into contact with authorities.</span> <span id="s324">I – we did have an au pair named Shteffie(ph), who was a girl from the country who came to live with us and became one of the family and I loved her, and I know she loved me.</span> <span id="s325">And during the Hitler time, her father had to come from the country and take her home because she wasn’t allowed to work for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: So that was huge in your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: I don’t know if I understood all the reasons why she left, I just – you know, I – she was wa – one of our family, and I –</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: – you know, I was an – to this day that I can remember her name, Shteffie(ph), you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: Because she was part of my life, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s333">When was the idea broached with you that maybe it – you will be leaving your parents in Vienna and going someplace?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: I can’t tell you exactly when.</span> <span id="s335">I drop – you know, in terms of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: The time,</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: – time frame.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: I would think shortly before.</span> <span id="s340">Before Henry and I left, we all took English lessons.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Excuse me for a second.</span> <span id="s342">There is some noise here.</span> <span id="s343">[break]</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: You had asked me about when my parents, you know – I – again, I don’t know when, but shortly before, we all took English lessons.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: My mother and father separately, on an adult level, while Henry and I waited, and then Henry and I took English lessons.</span> <span id="s347">And we learned English from the book, “Winnie the Pooh.”</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Did you really?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Yes, which I’ve always loved, and you know, though we didn’t really speak English, we called each other Heffalumps and Piglets, etcetera.</span> <span id="s350">The lady that taught us English, was British.</span> <span id="s351">And I went into foster care in Texas, I came into Texas talking about a frock and a lift and a pram.</span> <span id="s352">But you know, I – because I was so young –</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: – I learned English almost by osmosis.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: I – I mean I don’t – I’m sure there was a time when I had an accent, and didn’t know the words, but I don’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Of – cause you don’t recall –</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: – it was so easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: It was so easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: I just sort of fell into English.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Well, you know, it’s like two nations divided by a common language, is what I’ve heard about the British and the Americans, as far as American English and British English.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Well, the words were different, obviously.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: That’s right, those words were different.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: I don’t think I ever had a British accent, either –</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: – you know, I am sure I had an Austrian accent at first.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: But what a lovely way for a child to be introduced to the language, is through “Winnie the Pooh.”</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Lovely book, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: My parents did everything they could to prepare us.</span> <span id="s377">I don’t think I – I knew we were going, I don’t think I knew the ramifications of it as clearly as my brother at age nine.</span> <span id="s378">I just assumed that my parents would come.</span> <span id="s379">My brother had the burden of knowing that they might never come.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: You know, so I was very sheltered in that way, too.</span> <span id="s382">I came from a very easygoing family.</span> <span id="s383">We were European, we had good manners, dankeschön, bitteschön, you know, was very important.</span> <span id="s384">But my parents were basically quite easygoing, and for instance eating – this – peas are a –</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: – memory to me.</span> <span id="s387">Eating peas when I was a little girl, you know, they roll around –</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: – and I was perfectly free to pick them up with my fingers and eat them.</span> <span id="s390">Once we were ready to go to the United States, my mother gave me pea eating lessons, where I had to learn to eat them with a fork, so that wherever we went, I would make a good impression.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Impression, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: You know, an-and I remember the peas specifically –</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: – because it was so annoying.</span> <span id="s395">But I’m sure there were other things where she tried to prepare me, you know, to be a –</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: – a little bit independent, or on my own, or, you know, eat with very good manners, or you know, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: It must have been very hard for her, you know, a little girl, a li – you know, either child, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: For my parents it had to be unbearable, and I really understood that when I had children of my own.</span> <span id="s400">When I had a four year old and I thought, how did they do this?</span> <span id="s401">But they w – they didn’t know that they had a good chance of coming to the States.</span> <span id="s402">They wanted us to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: You know, however.</span> <span id="s405">But I – it had to be unbearable for them.</span> <span id="s406">My mother has said that she divided her life by, you know, the benchmark moment of when she sent her children away, before and after.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Well –</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: – what could be more memorable than that?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: Well, truly.</span> <span id="s412">I mean, truly, it is – it is – yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Conditions in Vienna na – again not – this is not personal knowledge –</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: – at all, this is something that my parents told me, because my mother is certainly a storyteller.</span> <span id="s416">From the time that Hitler came into power, every border imaginable closed.</span> <span id="s417">And I’m really angry when I read that, you know, the Jews didn’t want to leave their jobs, they – none of this is true.</span> <span id="s418">They wanted to leave, there was no place to go.</span> <span id="s419">Every border closed.</span> <span id="s420">The American consul made it as difficult as could be.</span> <span id="s421">My father was a practicing physician, a graduate of the University of Vienna.</span> <span id="s422">When he applied for American visa, or whatever, they insisted they needed his elementary school records from Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: No kidding.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Ye – I – it’s like –</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: No kidding.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: – things to delay, to stall, to make it more difficult.</span> <span id="s427">Also, when he we – came to talk to the American consul – for a European this was insulting beyond belief, maybe not for an American – he, the consul sat there with his feet u-up on the desk, and for a European man, that – you know, that’s the epitome of rudeness.</span> <span id="s428">There were very, very few places that took Jews.</span> <span id="s429">The Polish quota for the United States was horrible, though my father signed up as early as he could.</span> <span id="s430">Trujillo was, you know, considered a horrible dictator, but the Dominican Republic took as many refugees as they possibly could.</span> <span id="s431">Maybe with self-interest, feeling they were ed – getting educated people, or you know, who knows what.</span> <span id="s432">At the time that my father was trying to get in United States, the only place open to us was Haiti.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: No kidding.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: And he hesitated because at that point he felt that his number was getting close, and he thought, what future would we have in Haiti, I – you know, h-he took a huge risk.</span> <span id="s435">Maybe we would have all been better off going to Haiti as a family.</span> <span id="s436">But yes, my parents prepared me as well as they could.</span> <span id="s437">They tried to make it, you know, like a very positive, like I’m going to leave this bare place and go to this wonderful place.</span> <span id="s438">I do remember that there was an air raid in Vienna with, you know, sirens, a blackout, and I said – this I really remember, this I – because I was so puzzled by it.</span> <span id="s439">I asked my father, are the bad men coming to bomb us?</span> <span id="s440">And my father said, if anyone comes to bomb us, it’s the good men.</span> <span id="s441">And I – I had a real problem figuring that out.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Yeah, exactly, because it’s – you know, there’s a contradiction in logic.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Right.</span> <span id="s444">But it – I –</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: But there’s logic.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: But it’s the truth.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Another way of preparing me in terms of – my father had an original way of talking to me sometimes, to try to make me understand what freedom meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Like in United States we would be free.</span> <span id="s451">He said that freedom meant that I could go up to President Roosevelt, and call him a dummkopf, and nothing would happen to me.</span> <span id="s452">And of course that stuck in my mind –</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: – because it was amazing to me that I could say something an adult – of course, you know, I –</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: But it – it was a way of telling me that you could say what you want, without fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: And speak to whoever you want without fear.</span> <span id="s459">And that stayed with me, so I had a very positive image of going.</span> <span id="s460">I – I – though th – I think the reality was a little bit different, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: – being prepared sa – you know, to go to this wonderful place – they really tried very, very hard to prepare me and my brother.</span> <span id="s463">Much harder for my brother because he knew that the chances were very good that they would never come, and he had to take responsibility for me, and he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Well, for a nine year old those are big things –</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: He –</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: – those are huge bare – burdens on the shoulder –</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: He totally rose to the occasion.</span> <span id="s468">If you want to he – I’m trying to think what else I can tell you about Viennese background, because I’m almost about to jump –</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: That’s right, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: – to the transport.</span> <span id="s471">I don’t know what else I can tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Well, tell me a little bit about your brother, and what your relationship was like in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: In Vienna it was a normal, you know, brother –</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Did he have his friends and you had your friends, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: I was so young, I mean, my friends were like, in the American terms, play dates with mother –</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: – mother’s friends, some of whom I’m still in touch with, after all these years.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: You know, one of my very close friends was a little girl that I played with in Vienna, but it was through the parents.</span> <span id="s480">I – I wasn’t having independent friendships.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: I’m sure my brother had friends in school, I don’t know details of it at all.</span> <span id="s483">We had a normal brother-sister relationship, you know.</span> <span id="s484">I – I was enough younger than – than there really wasn’t sibling rivalry and I think he was protective of me.</span> <span id="s485">Our relationship changed extremely when we were on the Kindertransport.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: How?</span> <span id="s487">Tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: He was nine years old, and he rose to the occasion of taking care of me as if he was an adult.</span> <span id="s489">And what saved me from the emotional trauma was that he became my mother, my father, my hero.</span> <span id="s490">And he really was – took w-way beyond a nine year old.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: Can you give me any examples of – of how you felt safe because he was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: Well, he wa – well, he was my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: You know, I – I wasn’t alone.</span> <span id="s495">I mean, that was major that –</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: That’s right, he was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: – I wa – I was – I was with family.</span> <span id="s498">Years later I met some people who had been on the ship.</span> <span id="s499">You may know that there was a conference in 2002 in Chicago of 1,000 children who’d come unaccompanied, and I went to that, and some of the 50 children were there.</span> <span id="s500">I’m digressing now, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: It’s okay – it’s okay, we can do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: My three children went with me, because they thought it would be emotionally horrendous for me.</span> <span id="s503">Actually, when we got there, it was very triumphant.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: Was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Oh, for all of us, it’s like we’re here, we made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: So I met other people who’d been on the ship with me, and one of them was a lady named Helga Milgram(ph), who I serd – unfortunately has since passed away, and she remembered me.</span> <span id="s508">I was the baby of the group, so I was more noticeable, and she was maybe nine or 10, and she and a bunch of other eight, nine, 10 year old little girls sort of took over caring for me, and you know, being extra nice to me, and when we talked about it later she said she was working through her own pain by, you know, giving to me.</span> <span id="s509">And I didn’t remember it clearly until I met her.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Oh, and so it came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: And – and the memory came back to me.</span> <span id="s512">I – I didn’t remember the faces, or names, but I did know that on board ship all these older girls, you know, were very nice to me, and favored me.</span> <span id="s513">I asked her if she remembered my brother, and she said her only memory of my brother was, he was this hand –</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: – that I was forever holding.</span> <span id="s516">My brother wrote home to my parents that sometimes I really embarrassed him because sometimes I didn’t see him, and I had a panic attack and I cried, where’s Henry, where’s – or Heinzie(ph) at that –</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: Where’s Heinzie(ph), where’s Heinzie(ph)?</span> <span id="s519">And maybe he was going to the bathroom, and people were calling him, your sister needs you, she just wants you.</span> <span id="s520">So he – he wrote home that sometimes it was embarrassing.</span> <span id="s521">In terms of taking care of me, as a little girl I tended to be carsick on long trips.</span> <span id="s522">When we went to Texas, my memory that I don’t think was by car, I think it was by bus, I’m not a hundred percent sure, but he did write to my mother, and I had seen the letters at one time or another, that the whole way, he told me stories so that I would forget about being carsick.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Now that is over and beyond a nine year old.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: Are we on the ship, or sh –</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: No, we’re gonna come back.</span> <span id="s528">We’re gonna come back –</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Do wi – we –</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: – to Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: – do we want to go back to Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: We’re gonna go back to Vienna because I want to come to the moment – did you meet the Krauses(ph) in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: I have no memory of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: None at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: I’m sorry that I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: That’s okay, that’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: They were wonderful people I know, but I don’t remember them at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: Do you remember saying goodbye to your own parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: I remember going on a train –</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: – and my mother and father seeing us off.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s545">So it would have been you and your brother on the train, and them at the pla – on the platform.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: They were on the platform, we went on the train.</span> <span id="s547">And a – my parents made such an effort to make this positive for me, they certainly – my mother didn’t cry in front of me, you know, they made this extreme effort to say oh, this is an exciting train ride adventure, you’re going to United States, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: So whatever you saw, it was enthusiasm and excitement, rather than pain and tears.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Well a – I think other children cried.</span> <span id="s550">Older children perhaps, who understood more.</span> <span id="s551">I did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: I – I mean – I don’t know if enthusiasm –</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: – is the proper word, because I was leaving my parents.</span> <span id="s556">But I don’t think I was as upset as you would imagine, because they made it such a positive thing [coughs] – excuse me – and they did lead me to believe that they would –</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Come.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: – come.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s560">And what about your brother, do you remember how he was reacting, or being at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: Well he – I know that he knew that there was a good chance that he wouldn’t come – that they wouldn’t come, and I think there was much more sadness for him, and also he had the responsibility of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: You know, he was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: That’s huge for a nine year old to have the knowledge that there – that your parents may not come, you know, tha-tha-that they may not ar – go to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Well, you know, it was a – at that time in Vienna, there was a lot of talk about getting a visa, getting an affidavit.</span> <span id="s566">We knew no one in the United States at all.</span> <span id="s567">It was part of family conversation.</span> <span id="s568">We wound up getting, I think, the affidavit from a comparative stranger, yes.</span> <span id="s569">Actually somebody – a Christian who worked for Sears Roebuck.</span> <span id="s570">A distant relative of my mother’s couldn’t do an affidavit because he – he wasn’t well positioned enough, he wasn’t making enough money.</span> <span id="s571">He went to his boss at Sears Roebuck and said that, you know, these people will not be a burden, the man is a doctor, he’ll come to United States, he’ll practice medicine here, but he needs this affidavit.</span> <span id="s572">And this absolute Christian stranger, who had some position at Sears Roebuck gave us the affidavit.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: As a – from the relative, from your mother’s relative.</span> <span id="s574">In other words, he himself could not, but someone else he worked for could.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: His – his boss, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: – somebody who – who worked –</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: – who he worked for.</span> <span id="s580">I don’t know who – the man’s name, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s581">I wish I knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: So it was the basis of that that you – the Krauses(ph) could accept you and take you?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: I – from my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Oh, for your parents, excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: My parents had to have the affidavit to come over.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: Now, I don’t know that the Krauses(ph) needed it – an affidavit.</span> <span id="s588">What the Krauses(ph) did, and again, I know this from Steve Pressman’s(ph) book –</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: – and not personal knowledge at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: They had visas that would go in – to waste in [indecipherable] they were able to collect 50 visas for the 50 children.</span> <span id="s593">If I remember correctly, Mr. Kraus(ph), where the children were concerned, made himself legally and financially responsible.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: I see, okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: So that was –</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: That was one set –</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: – and the oth –</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: For my parents, they needed affidavit.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Which they got from a stranger.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: So, do you remember more about – let’s go back to the transport over.</span> <span id="s603">You leave by train, where do you go after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: At the time I didn’t know – I didn’t find out until the conference in 2002, where I got a lot of information.</span> <span id="s605">We stopped in Berlin.</span> <span id="s606">I did remember that we stayed somewhere.</span> <span id="s607">I didn’t know it was Berlin at the time, and it was my first taste of what it was like to be institutionalized, where we stood on line for a towel, and we stood on – you know.</span> <span id="s608">Not that we were mistreated, it was just for the first time in my life, it was like this institutional thing, and that stayed with me.</span> <span id="s609">I didn’t know it was Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s611">And from then on – from there, another train?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: I – I – I know the traveling was by train.</span> <span id="s615">I know there was an overnight stop at – in Berlin.</span> <span id="s616">If there was more than one overnight stop, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s617">I sort of doubt it, I think maybe it was just one.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: But my next memory is being on the ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s621">Do you now know the name of the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Yes, well I found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: I didn’t know at the time, the President Harding.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s626">Do you have any memories, any vision in your mind of what the ship looked like?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: I do remember that it was very large.</span> <span id="s628">I remember the – the tone of when meals were served, which I – I – I have no – you know, I – I’m tone deaf, but there’s like three notes for meals being served.</span> <span id="s629">And I heard that much later on radio about something else, and I immediately perked up –</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Perked up.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: – and got the familiarity.</span> <span id="s632">I do remember being onboard ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: I had an adventure onboard ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: Tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: There was a young woman, I think quite young, from Chicago, an American, traveling from Germany with her birds.</span> <span id="s637">She went by ship because she ha – she was bringing birds home.</span> <span id="s638">She was an American, but she had lived in Germany for a while.</span> <span id="s639">One day on deck I was swamped by a wave, and my leggings, or whatever I wore, were soaked, and I was just standing there by myself helplessly, and I didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s640">And this young woman saw me, and took me to her stateroom, and got me out of my wet leggings and gave me something dry to wear.</span> <span id="s641">And I remember a stateroom full of colorful birds.</span> <span id="s642">Now, this is a four year old’s memory.</span> <span id="s643">It’s perfectly possible that there were three birds.</span> <span id="s644">I just remember all these birds, ma – I have no idea.</span> <span id="s645">And I believe she spoke German, so – because she had lived in Germany, so we communicated easily.</span> <span id="s646">And now here’s the mystery.</span> <span id="s647">I slept in her stateroom, and I don’t know how that came to be, whether she talked to the people who were supervising me, or if she just had me there.</span> <span id="s648">I know I spent time there, and I do know I slept there at least once, and that it wasn’t my imagination because she sent a letter to my mother, she got my mother’s address.</span> <span id="s649">She put me to sleep, and she says, sweet dreams, and I said, I’m going to dream about my mother.</span> <span id="s650">And she wrote that to my mother.</span> <span id="s651">So that clarifies that I really did sleep in her stateroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: I don’t know how much time I spent there.</span> <span id="s654">I know I was very, very fond of her, and fascinated by these wonderful, colorful birds.</span> <span id="s655">And that’s a major shipboard –</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: – memory for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: I – I –</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: It’s very exotic for a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Well, and also she was young, and she spoke German and she was very warm and generous, you know, she appreciated that I was a little girl traveling alone.</span> <span id="s662">Otherwise I – you know, I spent a lot of time hanging onto my brother at all times.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: But for sleeping arrangements, girls were separate from boys.</span> <span id="s665">I don’t remember who I shared a stateroom with, I have no memory of that at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Do you remember –</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: I do remember these older girls were nice to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: Do you ha – do you remember what the staterooms looked like?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: Just the one with the birds.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: The birds.</span> <span id="s673">Just the one with the birds.</span> <span id="s674">And the ship itself, was it – well it – for a child it must have been huge.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: It was large, but I don’t have any real geographic memory of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Do you remember being rocked?</span> <span id="s677">Were you seasick at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: I was not seasick, no.</span> <span id="s679">That I – I am sure I was not.</span> <span id="s680">I’ve – you know, I was fine.</span> <span id="s681">I do remember, I think when we were getting close to New York harbor, we were all on deck, to be taught the worl – words to the “Star Spangled Banner.”</span> <span id="s682">And by that time I knew a little bit English.</span> <span id="s683">But I do remember being mystified, oh say, can you see – I thought that was gibberish.</span> <span id="s684">It made no logical sense.</span> <span id="s685">I don’t have a lot of shipboard memories really, except that I – I was – yeah, I hung onto my brother and also there was – there was the lovely lady with the birds.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: What about the Statue of Liberty?</span> <span id="s687">Do you remember seeing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: I’ve seen photographs of all the children looking at the Statue of Liberty, I don’t remember seeing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s690">Do you have a memory of arriving in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: The immediate arrival, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s693">What would be your next memory?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: The camp.</span> <span id="s695">The – in – there was a summer camp outside of Philadelphia where we were kept.</span> <span id="s696">And from there we were supposed to go to foster care.</span> <span id="s697">What I do remember, both onboard ship, and also in the summer camp, there was a real difference, there were the kids who were going to relatives, and the kids who had no one, and who were going to foster care.</span> <span id="s698">And the kids who were going to relatives were the lucky ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: All right now, here’s a memory which may not be true.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: I do remember people coming to look us over, who were potential foster parents.</span> <span id="s703">I do – that is true, but I do also remember that they looked at us through a wire fence.</span> <span id="s704">Whether – that seems strange, but that’s my memory of it, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: – when –</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: So you’re not a hundred percent sure of that wire fence part?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: I’m not, I – this is what I remember, but as a grownup, I think, wouldn’t that be strange, to have children on one side of a wire fence, and the people –</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: – looking them over on the other side?</span> <span id="s711">I don’t – but I remember this wire fence, but it could be that I imagined it, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s712">I think I did get that awful sense of being looked over, so maybe I translated into being like an animal in a zoo, with the wire fence.</span> <span id="s713">Whether there was a wire fence or not, I can’t tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: I do know that I was very, very angry at being looked over.</span> <span id="s716">I felt it very extremely, and because of that I wouldn’t talk, and I wouldn’t smile, and you know, I was – my brother recognized the importance of finding foster family, so he was all charm and smiles and showing his intelligence, you know.</span> <span id="s717">So everyone wanted my brother, and who wanted this angry little girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: The camp was not winterized, they had to get rid of all of these kids – I – I don’t mean get rid in a bad way –</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: They had to – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: – but they needed a place for these kids to go.</span> <span id="s722">And they couldn’t publicize us that much, because the idea of 50 Jewish children being brought to the States wasn’t that popular.</span> <span id="s723">So they had to do things a little quietly.</span> <span id="s724">So on one hand they needed foster care for us, but it was difficult for them.</span> <span id="s725">And when people kept wanting my brother, they thought it might be harder to place two children, and they were going to separate us.</span> <span id="s726">And that is when my brother came into his full nine year old powers, and absolutely refused, and you know, then when someone wanted to take him, like if I don’t go with my sister, I’m going to make your life miserable.</span> <span id="s727">You won’t want me in your house.</span> <span id="s728">You know, so – and he also adamantly spoke to whoever, that he – my parents were promised that we will be together, that – whether that – they were or not, I don’t know, but also that he was going to be with his sister, he was going to take care of me, we were not to be separated.</span> <span id="s729">And really, I do remember him making a scene with someone who wanted him, but wasn’t going to take me.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: Amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: And you know, when he got through, they didn’t want him any more.</span> <span id="s732">If I had been separated, I would have been emotionally devastated.</span> <span id="s733">It would – I’d have been traumatized beyond belief.</span> <span id="s734">Because we weren’t separated, I – my brother carried the burden, and I didn’t, because I had my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s736">So who eventually agreed to take both of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: We went to a foster family in Texas, in Houston.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: Well, that is a long distance from Pennsylvania.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: And they – was it sight unseen?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: No.</span> <span id="s742">No, they came.</span> <span id="s743">They were among the people who looked us over.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: Uh-huh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: But in spite of my, you know, recalcitrant ways, they took both of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: When my mother got word that we went to Texas, she was beside herself.</span> <span id="s748">She thought oh – you know, she – maybe New York, Philadelphia, but Texas?</span> <span id="s749">You know –</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: – cowboys and Indians, the Wild West, where are my children?</span> <span id="s752">I’m going on and on, I want to leave you –</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: Oh please, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s754">You’re –</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: – no, I want to leave room for you to ask the questions that you need.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: Li – you’re anticipating so many of my questions –</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Oh, I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: – that I’m just – that’s great.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: It’s just, one thing I say sort of triggers another memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: That’s fine, that’s fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: But, you know, go ahead –</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: So now, my next question is, aside from hearing the stories that your brother tells you on the bus to Texas, so that you wouldn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: Be carsick.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: – be carsick, do you have any other memories of the – of the journey?</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: Tell me about –</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: I do remember being on a bus, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: – you know, like a long journey, but vaguely, and no, I don’t really.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s773">Tell me about your foster family.</span> <span id="s774">Who were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s776">They were not very nice people.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: They were very – well, they’re dead now, so I can – I guess I can say that.</span> <span id="s779">They were very insensitive.</span> <span id="s780">They – I don’t think they especially liked children.</span> <span id="s781">They certainly knew nothing about children.</span> <span id="s782">They were, you know, rather cold people.</span> <span id="s783">And I think they took us – and there were things that make me believe that – to show their community and their neighborhood how idealistic and charitable they were.</span> <span id="s784">But it had nothing to do with flesh and blood real-life children.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Did they have no children of their own?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: How did they come into contact with the Krauses(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: I think they had a connection in Philadelphia with – Brith Shalom was the brotherhood that the Krauses(ph) were part of, and that ran the camp, and I think they had, at one time had a connection with that, because I think they were originally from Philadelphia before they moved to Texas.</span> <span id="s791">So they would have gotten the newsletter, or you know, what have you.</span> <span id="s792">I – I don’t know beyond that, but I think there was that connection.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Okay, what – what happened, or what was their behavior like that –</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: – you know, that has this im – you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: You have to understand that I came from a very warm, easygoing family where we had to have good manners, but you know, it was – it was like just really a warm, laissez-faire kind of family.</span> <span id="s797">Their theory of children was children should be seen but not heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: Don’t speak unless you’re spoken to.</span> <span id="s800">That was totally foreign to us.</span> <span id="s801">Because I was learning a new language and because I was fairly bright, I also asked her a lot of questions.</span> <span id="s802">And she turned to me and said, stop asking questions or I’ll wash your mouth out with soap.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: So, you know.</span> <span id="s805">She – I don’t believe she ever really washed my mouth out with soap.</span> <span id="s806">I do remember the taste of soap in my mouth, but I think what that was about was I thought that was so bizarre –</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: That you went to taste it.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: – that I took some soap and, you know, put it in my mouth and see how do you wash a mouth out with soap?</span> <span id="s809">I’m – you know, it was just soap [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s810">They were so – they disparaged my father – because my brother was always protecting me, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: – then they wanted to dose me with some kind of medication, my brother would say, well, my father’s a doctor and he never gave that to Erika.</span> <span id="s813">So they’d say, well, I don’t know what kind of doctor your father was.</span> <span id="s814">You know, that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s815">One night they served breaded veal cutlet and my brother and I both suddenly cheered, wiener schnitzel.</span> <span id="s816">You know how kids are, something familiar.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: And they s – oh, you think everything good is Vienna, you know, and they ranted about that.</span> <span id="s819">Which is ridiculous, they wa – it was not a political statement –</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: It was something familiar.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: – it was something familiar.</span> <span id="s822">Sweet potatoes, which I happen to like now, was – the taste was totally unfamiliar, and I refused to eat them.</span> <span id="s823">And she was going to make me sit at the table until I ate them.</span> <span id="s824">This is so different from the way my family handled things, you know, we – maybe we were a little spoiled and a little laissez-faire.</span> <span id="s825">So she was going to make me sit there until I ate them.</span> <span id="s826">And when she wasn’t looking, my brother tried to eat them for me, and he got caught –</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: Oh, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: – and he was hit.</span> <span id="s829">We were invited to dinner, friends of theirs, the children, Henry and I were invited, and it was do not speak un-unless you’re spoken to.</span> <span id="s830">But we were brought up not to, you know, draw attention to us, but to speak to adults, and not to sit like quiet lumps.</span> <span id="s831">So we were quiet for a long, long time, but then ice cream was served.</span> <span id="s832">And my brother was being sociable, in nine year old terms, and he said oh, this is as cold as the North Pole, you know, on a hot night.</span> <span id="s833">And when we left, he was hit.</span> <span id="s834">And I couldn’t – and I saw this, and I couldn’t help him.</span> <span id="s835">At some point, they said something to my brother about putting us in an orphanage.</span> <span id="s836">Now, I don’t know if they meant it or not, or if they were – if that was a way of getting him in line, if you don’t do this, we’ll do that.</span> <span id="s837">But my brother took it very seriously.</span> <span id="s838">His aim in Texas was to keep both of us out of an orphanage.</span> <span id="s839">And he went to school where he had a teacher that liked him very much, and that particular day, he was obviously upset.</span> <span id="s840">Now, this is not my memory, this is my brother’s memory, and also told to my parents.</span> <span id="s841">She recognized that he was obviously upset, and sh-she said Henry, what’s the matter?</span> <span id="s842">And he said, I think my foster parents are going to send me and my sister to an orphanage, you know, I-I – I don’t think we can stay there.</span> <span id="s843">And the teacher, who had never seen me at all, said, Henry, don’t worry about it, I’ll take you.</span> <span id="s844">And Henry said, I have a sister.</span> <span id="s845">And she said, don’t worry about it, I’ll take you both.</span> <span id="s846">The next time Henry was threatened with something, he said, well, my teacher will take us both.</span> <span id="s847">At which point they blew sky high because their whole thing was how charitable and idealistic and kindly they were, and the idea of this teacher even thinking of ta – you know, so again, you know, there’s punishment.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: This sounds horrendous.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: I – I can’t – you know, I may be telling you the worst parts.</span> <span id="s850">They fed us, they gave us, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: – a place to sleep.</span> <span id="s853">I don’t think they were awful all the time.</span> <span id="s854">But being a child, I remember the awful parts.</span> <span id="s855">But on the plus side, my brother had the teacher, I had a neighbor down the street.</span> <span id="s856">You – if you need – if you’re a kid, you need adult nurturing, and I found my adults.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: I called everyone uncle and aunt, so he was Uncle Irving, and his wife was Aunt Reba.</span> <span id="s859">He was an artist who was home all the time, and he liked me and he lived just down the street, so I could go by myself.</span> <span id="s860">And he decided he wanted to do a portrait of me.</span> <span id="s861">And – but it wasn’t about painting me, it was about making little jokes with me, and telling me little stories.</span> <span id="s862">And in their house, I felt very, very much at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: So whenever I could, I was there.</span> <span id="s865">You know, I found my adults, Henry found the teacher.</span> <span id="s866">So you find sort of what you need.</span> <span id="s867">There was also a dog next door, who was in the backyard most of the time, a big collie named Rex.</span> <span id="s868">I remember Rex.</span> <span id="s869">Loved that dog, and would spend as much time, you know, with my au – Henry took pictures, which I gave to Fred Wasson(ph), and I don’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: – have them here – pictures of me with my arms around this, you know, collie.</span> <span id="s872">And I do know that when I left Texas, the greatest wrenching part, you know, was leaving the dog.</span> <span id="s873">I – I really didn’t care about, you know, saying goodbye to anyone else.</span> <span id="s874">Ge – may I go on with my horrendous foster parents, or am I going on to –</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: Yes, please, please – no, no, no, no, please go ahead, go right ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: – the lovely lady fr – fr – with the birds from the ship apparently got our address in Texas.</span> <span id="s877">She was caring enough to write to me in Texas.</span> <span id="s878">When my parents came to the United States, this foster mother took it upon herself to write to this young woman and say our parents had just arrived in New York, and they’re going to be very needy, and ki – what can she do to help them?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: So of course we never heard from her again.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: Yeah, who does that?</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: I mean, my parents weren’t asking –</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s886">Is –</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: – for anything from anybody, and how did she take it upon herself, just because she had this lady’s address, because this woman wrote to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: So, you know.</span> <span id="s890">A – another little fact about my Uncle Irving, who I –</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: – adored, and you know, spent so much time in his house.</span> <span id="s893">When I was 16 he came to New York –</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: No kidding?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: – and he looked me up, and I was very excited about seeing Uncle Irving, and he came.</span> <span id="s896">I was this tall 16 year old.</span> <span id="s897">He came to maybe this high.</span> <span id="s898">A sweet, shy man.</span> <span id="s899">We had nothing to say to – I mean –</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: – disaster, nothing to say to each other.</span> <span id="s902">He was a sweet, shy man who was wonderful with children.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s904">And he – he was there for you when you needed him.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s906">Da – h-he was wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s908">Do you want to mention the names of those foster parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: Should I?</span> <span id="s910">I – I mean, I – it seems unnecessary, hi – they’ve since died, but you know, they –</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: If you don’t want to, it’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: I’d rather not, because there’s no reason –</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: Because they did take us.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: You know, they – we were kept together.</span> <span id="s917">They did clu – they didn’t clothe us, we had our own clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: But they did feed us, you know, and – everything wasn’t horrendous.</span> <span id="s920">They took us to see “The Wizard of Oz,” they took us to see the Alamo.</span> <span id="s921">I mean, you know, I’m telling you –</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: The parts.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: – the parts that were so foreign to me, just because it was so different from my own home.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: Yeah, well it’s – it’s – it’s – it-it’s a shock.</span> <span id="s925">For a child, it’s a shock.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: They then wound up li-living in Philadelphia again afterwards – and my parents felt that they had to be forever grateful.</span> <span id="s927">So I could never get rid of these people.</span> <span id="s928">My parents always welcomed them because they had to be grateful.</span> <span id="s929">They were fore – forever doing favors for these people, you know, because my mother felt, you know, she must be grateful.</span> <span id="s930">I didn’t feel grateful.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s932">Yeah.</span> <span id="s933">So, how long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: I’m not a hundred percent sure about when we went to Texas, but since the camp was not winterized, I would think we must have gone in August.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: My parents came over some time in November.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: Okay, so you were with them for, let’s say two or three months.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: It wasn’t that long, it – it seemed that long, but it really wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: And my brother, of course, was more panicked, like he was writing letters, oh, you have to get out now, the war is about to start, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Oh, the poor boy.</span> <span id="s942">You know, when you think of him, nine years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: And also the burden of me, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: – making sure that they didn’t infringe upon me, and forever defending me, and you can’t do that to my sister.</span> <span id="s946">And, you know, feeling that he had to keep us out of an orphanage.</span> <span id="s947">The burden on him was huge.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: And on me was minimal, because I ha – I mean, I didn’t like being with this people.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: Yeah, but – but he was the one who was taking the brunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: But he – you know, he was like my mother, father, family, hero.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: All of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: Well, when we came back to New York he reverted back to being a nine year old boy, it was very shocking to me.</span> <span id="s954">I mean, nothing bad, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: Yeah, but – but he was –</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: – nine year olds tease their sisters, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: Sure, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: I hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s960">So, do you remember hear – getting word that your parents have come over?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: Okay, what was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: I know part of it from my point of view and part of it from my mother’s point of view; as soon as they arrived, they called.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: And this charming voice that said, oh I’m sorry, I can’t wake the children, they’re asleep now.</span> <span id="s966">At which point my mother said, they’re my children, wake them.</span> <span id="s967">And we heard that our parents were o – here –</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: – and we went wild.</span> <span id="s970">And at that point Henry was going to be as bad, and disobey – I mean, you know, we weren’t terrible, but our parents were coming, we didn’t need these people any more.</span> <span id="s971">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: – I’m sure – they put us on the first train to New York.</span> <span id="s974">They got rid of us quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: And you had a train ride up to New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: And do you remember seeing your parents again then?</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: I had a very clear emotional image of my mother, like la – as I said to that lady, I’ll dream of my mother, I – like golden light, you know, all warmth.</span> <span id="s981">But I had lost the physical image.</span> <span id="s982">And we got off the train, and there’s this woman in a black coat, running to me with her coat flapping, and I was scared.</span> <span id="s983">And Henry kept pushing me forth saying, it’s Mutti(ph), it’s Mutti(ph), it – you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: It didn’t take long, and I realized that I was – the familiarity.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: But my first reaction was, I was afraid of her.</span> <span id="s988">You know, who was this person in a black coat that the va – the coat wa – seemed to be flapping in the breeze, she was running.</span> <span id="s989">Whether she was crying, who knows, but it was like, a little bit overwhelming.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: Well, that shows just how young you were, because an older child would have recognized.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: I didn’t recognize her physically.</span> <span id="s992">I had a mental, emotional image –</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: – which had a lot to do with, you know, a golden light, and all warmth, and all nice things, but the physical image was lo – not for Henry, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: And if – again, it was Henry that I trusted, so if Henry said, this is Mother, okay, you know, because Henry said so.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s998">Do you remember when it was that you had left Vienna?</span> <span id="s999">What month it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: Well, ma – I had my – I arrived in the United States just before my fifth birthday, which was June.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: So, I probably have records somewhere of when the Harding left, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: Probably May then, some time in May.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: Probably, depending on how long it takes to make the ocean voyage, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: I have it written down somewhere, but I ha – you know, I – I didn’t think of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: Okay Now, the reason I’m asking is I want – I want to get a sense of how many months apart you were.</span> <span id="s1008">So if you left in May, and that would have been in 1938?</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: Thirty-nine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: Thirty-nine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: I arrived just before my birthday, my birthday is June 10th –</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: – and I arrived some time in June, before my birthday.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: Okay, so it’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: It would have been May.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: – May ’39 to November ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: Half a year, seven months, something like that: May, June, July, August, September, October, November, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: Six or seven months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: That you had been apart from your parents, which is a lifetime for a kid, you know.</span> <span id="s1023">Time passes very, very slowly for children, and very, very fast for adults.</span> <span id="s1024">But probably not so fast for –</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: Well, I don’t think it went –</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: – your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: – that fast for my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: No, no, not – I was just gonna say, not for your – not when your children are separated from you.</span> <span id="s1029">So can you tell me what their ultimate experience was in being able to come over?</span> <span id="s1030">At first you say the American consul in Vienna had given them a great deal of trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: There was a great deal of trouble, my father had signed up early, finally his number came up.</span> <span id="s1032">The – I looked it up on the internet to find what ship they were passengers on, and they apparently sailed from Antwerp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: I always thought Lisbon.</span> <span id="s1035">It’s possible they went from Lisbon to Antwerp.</span> <span id="s1036">I – I had really always believed they sailed from Lisbon, but they sailed from Antwerp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: And I guess their number came [break]</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: So yes, you were going to tell me about how it was that your fa – parents finally had their number come up in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1040">And they went over in the boat, I think from Antwerp, you said.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: Fra – they sailed from Antwerp.</span> <span id="s1042">I don’t know the details.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: I mean, I assume that it was just luck that their number came up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1046">And so when you saw them now, from the train station, and you eventually recognized this is Mama –</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: Oh, it didn’t take long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: I think the n-non-recognition went very quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: I think by the time we arrived at the apartment that we were staying at, it wa – it was like family again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1053">So where was that?</span> <span id="s1054">Where was this apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: Woodside, Long Island.</span> <span id="s1056">Not Long Island, Queens.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: Queens, Queens.</span> <span id="s1058">And what were the circumstances in that apartment?</span> <span id="s1059">I mean, did you have your own apartment, was it with somebody?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: No, we had our own apartment.</span> <span id="s1061">My parents had their furniture shipped long before they came.</span> <span id="s1062">It was possible to ship furniture, you couldn’t take money out, but you could ship furniture.</span> <span id="s1063">And a – years after, you know, my mother would see things in antique stores, and think oh, this is, you know Jewish furniture that was shipped, where the owners never came.</span> <span id="s1064">Which I’m sure happened.</span> <span id="s1065">But yeah, they shipped furniture, and Woodside wasn’t too long, it was the first apartment, at I’m sure a low rent, because we had no money to speak of.</span> <span id="s1066">My father got busy taking the tests to be licensed as a physician again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: And that – did that work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: But there was a degree of camaraderie, because there was a whole bunch of doctors that had come from Vienna, in Brooklyn, in Queens, the family, friends.</span> <span id="s1071">And they all gave each other courage, and if somebody failed the test, all the men got together and said, you have to take it again.</span> <span id="s1072">Actually, the first group of men who took the licensing exam failed, because there were yes and no answers.</span> <span id="s1073">There was a question to which you should say, true, false, yes, no.</span> <span id="s1074">In European style, you write down, to show your knowledge, everything that you know, instead of a simple yes or no.</span> <span id="s1075">And of course, that was marked wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: But then the word got out, you know, the first wave made that mistake, the second wave knew that when they ask yes or no, you don’t do anything but –</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: Yes or no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: – yes or no, true, false.</span> <span id="s1080">A lot of women worked as maids, as whatever they could.</span> <span id="s1081">My father really didn’t want my mother to work because he felt it was really important that she take care of the children so that he could study.</span> <span id="s1082">He had to review, you know, his whole medical background, medical textbooks.</span> <span id="s1083">So she did a little bit work at home, it was piece goods.</span> <span id="s1084">She got fabrics, and she made little pincushions.</span> <span id="s1085">And I thought they were very cute, and I didn’t realize that it was like a horrendous job.</span> <span id="s1086">But you know, I thought it was cute.</span> <span id="s1087">We took our final apartment, you know, where we lived for a long time, in Washington Heights.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: Three-sixty Wasworth(ph) Avenue.</span> <span id="s1090">And the reason we took that apartment is they didn’t ask for extra rent, because we simply didn’t have it.</span> <span id="s1091">I think we could pay for one month, and we had nothing else.</span> <span id="s1092">And my father was a very confid – he had his license then –</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: – he was going to start practice.</span> <span id="s1095">He felt also it was in view of the subway, so his doctor sign would show –</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: – for people coming from the subway.</span> <span id="s1098">And he was confident enough that he thought that by the next month’s rent, he would be able to make it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: And did he?</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: And was he able then to reconstitute his practice?</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: He had a very good practice, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: In Washington Heights.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: Very good, very successful.</span> <span id="s1105">He was very respected, and very liked.</span> <span id="s1106">The super of our building was an ethnic German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: Oh dear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: No, not oh dear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: No?</span> <span id="s1110">Not oh d –</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: Nice lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: I think she felt really awful, and she knew our circumstance.</span> <span id="s1114">So she literally stood in front of the building and said, you know, we’re so lucky.</span> <span id="s1115">We have this prominent doctor from Vienna, like he’s a celebrity doctor, da, da, you know, none of which was true.</span> <span id="s1116">I mean, he was a good doctor, but – and was known as a good diagnostician, but he wasn’t – you know – but she built it up to help, which was an enormous help.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: Well, how sweet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: And then there was the neighbor on the third floor, Mr. Cherny(ph), who’d – his back had plagued him forever, and he came to see my father, and my father did something that solved whatever the problem was, so this guy stood in front of the building and said, oh, you know, this doctor’s good, yo-you know.</span> <span id="s1119">And it’s a neighborhood thing, it’s word of mouth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: It was a – many nationalities, but predominantly Irish Catholic.</span> <span id="s1122">Below the hill, there’s – in Washington Heights there’s a big hill.</span> <span id="s1123">The Broadway area is – was lots of Jewish refugees.</span> <span id="s1124">Up the hill, near Inwood, it was very Irish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: And my father had a – a working class Irish –</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: Clientele.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: – mixed nationalities –</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: – practice – which is what he had in Vienna, he had a working class practice in Vienna too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: How interesting.</span> <span id="s1132">I mean, how interesting that he was able to – well, he was a professional –</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: Well, he ha –</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: – he was able to reconstitute, and not only that, but in such a – such a demographic, I’ll say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: He was able to get his license –</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">A: – which is – which is why he didn’t want my mother to work, even before – you know, we had nothing.</span> <span id="s1138">I will also say that my mother never let me think that we were poor.</span> <span id="s1139">If I wanted something that other kids were getting, like oh, give me a nickel for a candy bar, there was always some reason which had nothing to do with lack of money.</span> <span id="s1140">Oh, it’s really bad for your teeth, or you know, oh, because of this or that.</span> <span id="s1141">There was always some reason, but I never felt that we were poor.</span> <span id="s1142">I didn’t know that we were down to nothing until much later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: There were Jewish aid agencies –</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: – that tended – were there to help in some way, to give loans, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1147">But there were conditions, and the conditions were ridiculous, and my father had refused help.</span> <span id="s1148">One condition was that we were to live in a furnished room –</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: – to save money.</span> <span id="s1151">But my father said, but we have furniture, what is the point of that?</span> <span id="s1152">The other condition would be that he would leave New York, and start his practice in Elmira, upstate, because there were too many –</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: That’s right, doctors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: – refugee doctors in New York.</span> <span id="s1155">And my father went up to Elmira – I think it was Elmira, I may be wrong.</span> <span id="s1156">It was an upstate town, but I – and I do think it was Elmira, I – I could be a little off on that.</span> <span id="s1157">And he went and looked the place over, and thought, I’ll never make it here, I’ll never fit in, I’ll never make it.</span> <span id="s1158">If I don’t drink with the locals at the country club, there won’t be a practice.</span> <span id="s1159">You know, it wasn’t – he recognized that it wasn’t his milieu.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: So he refused aid, and we kept our furniture, and [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: And your apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: – to practice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: Yeah, and your apar – so when did you find out about what had happened to the relatives who stayed behind in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: At different stages during the war years.</span> <span id="s1166">At one point there was – I don’t remember the name of the town – there was an article in the “New York Times,” about a massacre of Jews in my father’s town, which was close to Przemyśl, but it was another town.</span> <span id="s1167">And my mother saw it and cut it out of the paper, she didn’t want him to see it from reading the paper.</span> <span id="s1168">And she told me what it was, I was quite young then, and she told me what it was, and she said, if he asks, you cut out a picture of a dress, or you know, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: Something, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: I think they – there were news reports, they had a pretty good idea all along that there would not be a surviving family.</span> <span id="s1171">When my cousin survived, it was a great surprise, you know, great joy.</span> <span id="s1172">And she found it amazing that he could even remember the name Tamar in New York City.</span> <span id="s1173">But when he and his brother were separated from their parents, the last thing his mother said to him, remember, Dr. Tamar, New York City, you know.</span> <span id="s1174">His mother and my mother were two years apart, but almost looked like twins, they looked so much alike.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: No kidding?</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: And when he saw my mother for the first time, it was very shocking to him, because she looked so much like his own mother.</span> <span id="s1177">He lived with us when he came, and I became very, very close to him, He was 17, I was 13.</span> <span id="s1178">And at that stage, I knew more than I maybe should have about all details of the Holocaust, because he talked very freely to me, and I listened.</span> <span id="s1179">And – but before I was 13, I knew what was ha – I knew why we had left Vienna, I mean –</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: – I knew about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1182">And I also, as my parents knew, that it was very likely that no one would have survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: So when he did come, do you re-recall some of the things he told you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: When he did arrive in the United States –</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: My cousin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: Well, he told me about –</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: His own experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: – his years from age 12 to 17, when he went through I don’t know how many camps.</span> <span id="s1191">He wrote a book, which was quite –</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: Oh, you told me about that, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: – well received.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: I will say that when he wrote the book – I mean, he wrote it out because his children had asked, and he wrote with great pain and his wife told me that as he was writing, tears were streaming down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: And he’s a sort of a tough guy, you know, but he wrote with tears streaming down.</span> <span id="s1198">But he, I think as an adult was more mellow.</span> <span id="s1199">So the book – some things in the book are slightly more mellow than what he felt as a teenager.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: Did you ever go back to Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: Did your parents ever go back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: No.</span> <span id="s1206">I’ve gone to Europe, but I – there’s no way on earth that I would want to go back to Vienna.</span> <span id="s1207">Actually a close friend of mine, who was one of the original Viennese children from way back when, celebrated a birthday in Vienna, and a whole bunch of them went, and I thought, well that would be fun, and I made the reservation, and one of my sons was going to go with me.</span> <span id="s1208">And then at the last minute I thought, I can’t do this.</span> <span id="s1209">I cancelled.</span> <span id="s1210">I – I just don’t – I mean, I didn’t leave under benevolent circumstances.</span> <span id="s1211">I don’t have any relatives there, it’s not like there’s someone that I need to see, and I have no desire whatsoever to have anything to do with them.</span> <span id="s1212">I do my European travels in places I love: France, Italy, Spain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1214">Did – okay, so no one from your family has returned, you have not returned.</span> <span id="s1215">Did you ever keep in touch with the Krauses(ph)?</span> <span id="s1216">Did any – was there any connection over the years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: No, because I really didn’t remember them at all.</span> <span id="s1218">I didn’t know anything about what they had done, until that conference in 2002, when one of the children from my ship put together a – which I’m sure is in the museum, a wonderful bunch of pages telling the story of what had happened, and then of course, through Steve Pressman(ph).</span> <span id="s1219">But before that, I knew – I didn’t know anything about the Krauses(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: But your father and mother did keep in touch with your foster family for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: Yes, beca –well, because they kept appearing and my father and mother had to be forever grateful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1223">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: I don’t think they sought them out, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: They would appear in their lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: We were their good deed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: You know, so they – they really wanted to be in touch.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1230">Is there something else that you would like to add to what we’ve talked about today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: I ca – I think I’ve –</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: I think you’ve covered a lot of bases.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: – mostly told you my story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1235">Did you tell your kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: Yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: I’ve written about it, but not directly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1240">How have you written about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: I wrote a YA about the New York years, you know, being a refugee, and the different aspects of the refugee experience, living in New York.</span> <span id="s1242">And it wasn’t – it’s a fictionalized version of me, and you know, I do write fiction.</span> <span id="s1243">I tell more truth through fiction.</span> <span id="s1244">Then I wrote a book about the orphan trains, that in the 20s, they went from New York City to the Midwest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A: And I – I saw something about it on television, and I felt an identity with that.</span> <span id="s1247">So I wrote about the orphan trains, but I put in some of my experience, and some of my feelings, though of course it was a different nationality, different time, I wasn’t an orphan, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: Explain to people who – who – who will not know, what is a YA?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: Young adult.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">A: A teenage novel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: So you are a writer of –</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: I’m a writer of children’s books, and mostly teenage novels, some middle grade.</span> <span id="s1254">Two picture books, but words only.</span> <span id="s1255">Unfortunately, I can’t do art.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: Twenty-two books altogether.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: That’s quite an achievement.</span> <span id="s1259">Tell me the title of the one that’s about the refugee story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">A: The refugee in New York.</span> <span id="s1261">They changed the title, I like my original title.</span> <span id="s1262">My original title was “Goodbye Rita Hayworth.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: Which worked with what my story was about.</span> <span id="s1265">But Rita Hayworth at that time was on the verge of dying, and they said to put out a book with that title would be very bad taste.</span> <span id="s1266">Of course I didn’t mean it that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: They changed it to “Goodbye Glamor Girl.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: Which I never absolutely loved, but you know, it’s – it’s partly the refugee experience, partly me, partly my love of acting, and movie star – you know, it’s – it’s a mixed bag.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: All of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: The Irish orphan train story was “The Midnight Train Home”</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: And I’m very fond of that book.</span> <span id="s1275">You know, I – I do like writing historical, I do like doing the research.</span> <span id="s1276">And parts of – whole chapters are my story, but a whole lot of it is not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: But this is how you have expressed it.</span> <span id="s1280">This is how it has come out in your writing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: I thought – I did think of writing directly about the Kindertransport, and I really can’t.</span> <span id="s1282">For one thing, I would have to write it from a four or five year old’s point of view, in order to be authentic.</span> <span id="s1283">And for what audience, you know, who’s going to read a four year old’s story?</span> <span id="s1284">Also, I don’t think I really wanted to revisit it.</span> <span id="s1285">I – I expressed myself in other ways, through fiction.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1287">Well thank you.</span> <span id="s1288">Thank you very, very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s1290">Thank you so much for your interest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1292">It i – it’s a wonderful story that you have shared with us.</span> <span id="s1293">Sad in the beginning, but happy at the end.</span> <span id="s1294">And there are very few happy end stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: Happy endings are good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1297">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: So many of the kids lost their parents, the other kids that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: – we came here with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1302">So I – with that I will say, this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Miss Erika Tamar, on December 18th, 2015, here in Manhattan, New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: We did it.</span> <span id="s1305">Great.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span
