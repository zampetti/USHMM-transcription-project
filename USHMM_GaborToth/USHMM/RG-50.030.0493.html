id="s29">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: With the changeovers.</span> <span id="s31">And, let me ask you some questions about your family, a little bit.</span> <span id="s32">Your father was a doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Yes, he was a gastroenterologist.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: And, his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: Jacob, ____ Jacob Aaron Schwab.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: And, was that unusual to be Jewish and to be a doctor in Latvia at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: Well, he studied-</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: _____.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: He studied medicine before World War I.</span> <span id="s40">He began his studies in Estonia, Dorpat, which was a very, very famous German university in Estonia, Dorpat, taught to in the Estonian.</span> <span id="s41">It’s still in existence today, and for – then he studied also for a semester at Konigsberg University, and from – he specialized in Berlin for three years, Gastroenterology, and he returned then to Latvia in 1911 and opened his practice.</span> <span id="s42">And, during World War I, he was conscripted to the Czarist Army with a title of Colonel, rank of Colonel because of his profession, that being a gastroenterologist in the Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Now, I know you’re born in 1931, and you in fact, don’t know your father for a hugely long time.</span> <span id="s44">Do you remember him as a kid and what sort of relationship you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s46">Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Tell me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: He was a softy.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: But, my mother, she was a strict one.</span> <span id="s51">With him, I could get away with things, but not so easily with my mother.</span> <span id="s52">I have very fond memories of him.</span> <span id="s53">Sundays, we usually used to go out to a restaurant, my older brother, my mother, my father and I, and I always ordered the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: As your dad?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Yes, well, we all ordered what we called – it was Latvian version of a Chateau Brion, but completely different from what a Chateau Brion means over here or in France.</span> <span id="s56">It was a Latvian version of Chateau Brion.</span> <span id="s57">In summers, we spent some time at the beach together and we were at the Riga beaches, father came to visit.</span> <span id="s58">So, no, no, I have a fond and very warm memories of my father, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Tell me a little bit about your mother.</span> <span id="s60">Then, I’ll go back to-</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Well, my mother-</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Clara, Clara Jacobson Schwab.</span> <span id="s64">My mother was a wonderful, wonderful person, but in contrast to my father, she was very, very strict in the upbringing and well, let’s say, my father would say to my mother sometimes I would hear him say, “Well, just leave him alone.”</span> <span id="s65">He’d said.</span> <span id="s66">So, she would say, “No, no, no, he has to be taught his manners, this and that, so on and so forth.”</span> <span id="s67">But, I – also wonderful.</span> <span id="s68">Well, I wouldn’t say wonderful, but strict governesses particularly a German governess who taught me a lot which I didn’t like because I liked to rebel.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Do you get that from you father a little bit, the rebellion?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: No, I think it’s more my personality, but I don’t think neither my father nor my mother were rebellious types, no, no, and also not my brother, but I was – I was a talkaton.</span> <span id="s71">I could talk non-stop, and my mother used to tease me that I have her big ears because I listened to things I’m not supposed to listen to because everything interested me.</span> <span id="s72">So, on my days with my mother, which was usually Wednesday, I could determine what she would wear, and we would go and I would go to with her to my favorite cafes and I would pretend that I was drawing doing something, but I would overhear what my mother was talking with her girlfriends.</span> <span id="s73">So, the gossip in town, et cetera, but I didn’t understand much of it, but-</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: But, you took it in.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: But, I took everything in because everything was I found very interesting, very fascinating.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: So, old would you have been when she took you on her little trips to the café?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Oh, it started rather early because I would say about five, started five, six, seven, eight, nine, yes because I also refused to eat for a while at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Yes, and it was a problem, but by that time I must’ve been about six or seven, and I had an aunt who came from Riga, who had recently left Vienna, after Hitler.</span> <span id="s80">Yeah, actually, it must’ve been already ’38 after the Anschluss in ’38.</span> <span id="s81">I must’ve been about eight.</span> <span id="s82">She came especially from Riga after coming back from Vienna to Riga, she came especially to Libau.</span> <span id="s83">She said she is going to make from me Viennese sandwiches, and anything along those lines was of interest to me, and when she served me on the little piece of bread, piece of Wienerschnitzel or whatever, I said, “Well, I know what this is.</span> <span id="s84">It doesn’t interest me.”</span> <span id="s85">So, finally, my mother asked, “What would interest you?”</span> <span id="s86">And, I said, “I would love to go to Hotel Petersburg, and eat over there.”</span> <span id="s87">That was a hotel in Libau, and had also a beautiful restaurant, also was private rooms, et cetera, and she would take me there late in the afternoon about five, five-thirty or six, and I would always have my cocoa there, hot chocolate, and little sandwiches with hard boiled egg on top of it, a small piece of tomato, and anchovies, and whatever I – whenever I would get it I would sort of put it into the cocoa, into the hot chocolate and eat it.</span> <span id="s88">It was what I loved, but everything – with anchovies with everything.</span> <span id="s89">Some people complained actually, and the manager of the hotel came and said to my mother, “Mrs. Dr. Schwab”, that’s the way we used to address people, “There’s some people who object to seeing your son put everything into the hot chocolate and eat it then.”</span> <span id="s90">So, we were given a separate room, and for six months, I did this, and then I started eating again.</span> <span id="s91">I had some sort of disorder, whatever it was, I don’t know, but for about six months, we went almost every single day to the Hotel Petersburg in Libau, and that’s how I ate, and also I continued at home to put everything into hot chocolate.</span> <span id="s92">Hot chocolate, whatever I had was hot chocolate sandwiches.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: So, do you think you needed soft food?</span> <span id="s94">Is that why you think you-</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: No, it was just tasty.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: It was tasty.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: It was tasty, and whatever else I liked were desserts – cakes, and cakes naturally are fantastic.</span> <span id="s98">So, I remember always also during the day, et cetera, sneaking in sometimes alone or with an aunt of mine or with my governess going to a particular café in Libau for just cakes.</span> <span id="s99">I just loved sweets.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: It’s interesting because even though your mother was very strict.</span> <span id="s101">She realized that she needed to ask you what you wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Yes, because it was a problem, and my father also.</span> <span id="s103">I don’t know to what extent he knew what to do or didn’t know because in those days, actually, if a father was a physician, he was not permitted to treat his son.</span> <span id="s104">You had to go to someone else, and the pediatrician, my pediatrician, was a man by the name of Dr. Rabinovitz, who was the father of the head of – later on – the head of intelligence in Israel, _____, and whose nephew was the Israeli Ambassador here, Rabinovitz in Washington.</span> <span id="s105">They all come from Libau, and the father, Dr. Rabinovitz was my pediatrician.</span> <span id="s106">So, I don’t remember if I was taken to him for this or they just spoke over the telephone or what.</span> <span id="s107">This, of course, I don’t know, but-</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: But, you think it lasted for about six months?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: It lasted – yes, that’s what my mother told me after the war when we discussed it.</span> <span id="s110">It was, she said, many, many months probably up to about six months that we had to do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Now, do you remember when you stopped using cocoa?</span> <span id="s112">I don’t mean to drink, but to use it with your food.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Well, I would say by the time the war broke out, yes, when we didn’t, yeah.</span> <span id="s114">And, actually, it was yesterday, I think, yes at the Holocaust Museum that I had some hot chocolate for the first time in years.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Was it good?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Wonderful, I loved it.</span> <span id="s117">(laughs) I loved it.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Tell me about your brother.</span> <span id="s119">What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Bernhard Boris Schwab, and for short we called him Bubi.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Bubi.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Bubi, he was about eight, nine years older than I, and he – he adored me.</span> <span id="s123">He loved me very, very much, but I was sometimes not very nice to him.</span> <span id="s124">I would tease him this and that, so on and so forth, and sometimes he got angry at me I remember, running after me and sort of hitting me over my rear because I really teased him a lot.</span> <span id="s125">I remember once on a tennis court, after I annoyed him, but he was really wonderful, and until he was taken away, I mean, he took very, very good care of me when we were just the two of us and we were alone, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: And, was he an easy going...?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: He was easy going, yes.</span> <span id="s128">He loved to read.</span> <span id="s129">He devoured reading, and it’s very interesting.</span> <span id="s130">The last two years of the Gymnasium, he remained sitting.</span> <span id="s131">He failed because he was interested in his own agenda just to read.</span> <span id="s132">He was interested, and he just kept on reading and didn’t care about school, but this happened with me too when I went to school.</span> <span id="s133">One day, I remember coming home and declaring, “I know everything there is to know.</span> <span id="s134">I know how to count to a hundred.”</span> <span id="s135">I knew the alphabet.</span> <span id="s136">“And, I’m not going to school anymore or if I have to go to school, I will simply not pay attention because I love to play with my games and toys, et cetera, et cetera.”</span> <span id="s137">And, sure enough I failed every course save English because English was something -you were a wizard if you learned English and very, very few people because my parents were brought up with French, but I was brought up with English.</span> <span id="s138">I had British tutors and so did my older brother.</span> <span id="s139">So, I passed only one subject.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: English.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: English, and that was English.</span> <span id="s142">I remained sitting, and what was – what happened was war broke out and the first thing in 1941, I thought, “My god, war broke out now.</span> <span id="s143">I will not have to go back to school.”</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: And, that was relieving to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: That was very – that was a relief that I would not have to go back to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Were your parents upset that you were happy about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: No, no, actually, I’ve been thinking about it, and I don’t remember having discussed this with my father, but they did not seem to be perturbed or anything of the sort.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: And, no one said to you, “You don’t know everything, George, if you just can count to a hundred.”</span> <span id="s149">I mean nobody – they just accepted what you said.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: They accepted what I said, and they let me play, and I played a lot.</span> <span id="s151">I was fortunate to have a lot of toys, and I just – trains and trains, toys, all sorts of toys.</span> <span id="s152">I was imaging that I was a general – that was already in 1939, 1940 – on the _____ Line and a cousin of mine was the general of the Siegfried, yeah, he was Siegfried Lineland, and I was ______.</span> <span id="s153">We played war, and we had tanks and we had airplanes, and we had all sorts of toys.</span> <span id="s154">The cousin, this cousin actually is still alive.</span> <span id="s155">He’s older than I am.</span> <span id="s156">He lives in Salzburg now.</span> <span id="s157">So, we often, whenever we meet, we talk about our days when we used to play war.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Now, you were probably brought up in a fairly wealthy situation.</span> <span id="s159">Am I correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Yes, yes, and that was also a little bit embarrassing because about – thinking about it in anticipation of today, about fifteen years or so ago, there was a gathering of Latian Jews, and I, not thinking, I made the statement that I do not remember – there were no, I said, “Categorically, there were no poor people in Libau who were Jews in Libau.”</span> <span id="s161">So, they snickered at me saying, “You don’t know this.</span> <span id="s162">You and your family probably didn’t know that there were poor Jews in Libau, but there were plenty of poor Jews in Libau.”</span> <span id="s163">This came to me as a surprise.</span> <span id="s164">I should’ve thought it through, obviously, but I had never met – let’s put it this way – one who was not, well, well endowed from this perspective.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: And, did you live in a big house?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: We had a large apartment, very large, probably – well, not probably, it was considered the foremost apartment building in the city, yes.</span> <span id="s167">It had ten rooms.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: And, was your father’s office in that building?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: In the building, yeah, in the building, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Did that mean that he came upstairs for lunch and you would all eat lunch together?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Well, yes he would – what we called lunch was dinner, and in the evening was supper, and we had dinner very late about two, two-thirty because my father between ten and twelve he saw patients in the office, or was it nine-thirty.</span> <span id="s172">Then, he also made house calls.</span> <span id="s173">Then, he would come for lunch, go out again on house calls, and then he had office hours, if memory – memory serves me right, from four to six.</span> <span id="s174">But, he had so many patients that he sometimes did not come and have supper before eight, eight-thirty when I did not see him because I was already in bed or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: And, dinner when you would eat what we call lunch, but dinner in the middle of the day, were there a lot of conversation?</span> <span id="s176">Was this is a very perfunctory sort of eating?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: No, it was always interesting conversation, and when I was finally permitted to join them, when I was sufficiently trained, I enjoyed it very, very much.</span> <span id="s178">But, then, when I did sort of things that were unacceptable at the table, I was sent back.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: And, where would be “back” to-?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: To my room.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Would you eat there?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: I would eat there with my governess.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: But, when I was permitted to sit at the table – see, I try to make sure that I wouldn’t really spoil things because I didn’t want to be sent back.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: But, from time to time, I was sent back.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: And, was this your mother making the decision?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Mostly my mother, yes.</span> <span id="s189">My father thought everything was amusing.</span> <span id="s190">He did not contradict my mother, but I remember one little incident when my father came in – which very often happened.</span> <span id="s191">He was not there on time at two or two-thirty when we would have the lunch.</span> <span id="s192">He came in late, and he just paced in the dining room, and my mother didn’t talk to him and he didn’t talk to my mother which was unusual, and it still sticks in my mind.</span> <span id="s193">It happened once.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: And, tell me about your governesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Well, I had a nanny as a – when I was a very small child.</span> <span id="s196">She was Russian, Fanya, and I adored her.</span> <span id="s197">She was – I just could’ve sold my parents.</span> <span id="s198">She was – she was it so far as I am concerned, so far as I was concerned And then I was being prepared that I’m going to be a big boy, and the summer we were going to spend in Riga Beach, and when I will come back, I will have a governess and no longer my nanya, my nanny, and I didn’t really understand what they were saying, and we always went summers to Riga spend time at the Riga beaches, to the resorts in Riga.</span> <span id="s199">And, when I came back, she wasn’t there, and I just didn’t understand it.</span> <span id="s200">And, I remember crying, but then we had engaged a German governess, Fraulein ____ was her name.</span> <span id="s201">She was very strict, more in my mother’s tradition than in my father’s tradition which was leisurely.</span> <span id="s202">My mother was much more Prussian in this sense, and the governess was also in that tradition.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: So, this was not comfortable for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: No, but I had no choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s206">Did you actually complain to your mother and say, “Why are you...?”</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: No, I don’t remember complaining to her.</span> <span id="s208">I even think I had a crush on her.</span> <span id="s209">She was, as I remember, very attractive.</span> <span id="s210">She probably was, I don’t know, I guess must have been in her late 20s or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: And, I thought she was very attractive, and I actually tried to behave.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Oh, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: I tried.</span> <span id="s215">Whether I did or not, that’s something else, but she taught me so, proper table manners.</span> <span id="s216">She taught me also had to greet people.</span> <span id="s217">We were also taught how to walk properly.</span> <span id="s218">This was part of our-</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Now, was this the major thing the governess would do was teach you how to act?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: No, also with the homework, et cetera, and we would play games together.</span> <span id="s221">We would go out on walks and meet friends of mine, et cetera.</span> <span id="s222">We were there with the other governesses, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: So, did you really spend any more time with the governess than you did with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Well, when I was in school, let’s say I was in school – I would come home.</span> <span id="s225">There was my governess.</span> <span id="s226">In the morning, no she was not a live-in governess.</span> <span id="s227">I got-</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Oh, she wasn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: No, she was not a live-in governess.</span> <span id="s230">She would come in the morning, but breakfast, my mother did not serve me breakfast.</span> <span id="s231">It was our housekeeper, and she was always there when I came home or would pick me up from school, and then we would come home.</span> <span id="s232">We would go for walks.</span> <span id="s233">We would do this.</span> <span id="s234">We would do all sort of things, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: And, given the fact that your mother wasn’t working, what was she doing during the time when you and your brother – when he was young enough – was being taken care of by a governess?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: My mother used to be a professional cellist.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s239">She went to the famous Riga Conservatory which was a very, very famous school where as Isaac Stern once put it, you could go to any of these Russian violinists, it doesn’t matter who it is, they all came out from Riga, from the conservatory.</span> <span id="s240">She was playing a lot, but not professionally.</span> <span id="s241">Every two weeks or so, there were chamber music evenings at our house.</span> <span id="s242">She would drag her cello, go to the homes of other people where they’d play, and evenings when they would go out a lot, there was an opera, there was a theater in Libau.</span> <span id="s243">There were people who would come to our house for card games, kind of gin rummy that they used to play, and then there were big events in the house where the men would play a game called _____, and the women would play gin rummy which they called in Latvia, Kunken.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Kunken?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Kunken, K-u-n-k-e-n, it was a kind of gin rummy.</span> <span id="s246">I tried to mingle sometimes, and sometimes I actually succeeded and she did not say anything, but there was a very interesting incident that I remember.</span> <span id="s247">I loved dogs, but my mother did not permit us to keep dogs in the house.</span> <span id="s248">So, I would bring stray dogs to the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Into the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: Into the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: But, we had several entrances, bring it in through the rear entrance where we had a very large kitchen and a maid’s room, in between the kitchen and the maid’s room, there was another little corridor.</span> <span id="s253">And, my mother hardly ever went into the kitchen.</span> <span id="s254">So, she didn’t know what was going on, and I kept the dog over there in the rear and we also had a balcony.</span> <span id="s255">One day, there was a big card game at the house.</span> <span id="s256">The men were in one of the living rooms what we called ______, and my mother and her lady friends were playing canasta in the dining room, and the housekeeper came in and she was not called.</span> <span id="s257">Instead of addressing her as Frau Doctor Schwab or Mrs. Doctor Schwab, “It’s either the dog or me.”</span> <span id="s258">My mother said, “What do you mean?</span> <span id="s259">What do you mean?</span> <span id="s260">What dog?”</span> <span id="s261">“Would you please mind coming into the kitchen?”</span> <span id="s262">She got up, went into the kitchen and the dog went flying out.</span> <span id="s263">So, then, of course, I was called in.</span> <span id="s264">I said, “Look, I mean” I said, “It’s not my fault.</span> <span id="s265">The dog simply followed me.</span> <span id="s266">I didn’t bring it.</span> <span id="s267">I had nothing to do with it.”</span> <span id="s268">But, I loved this dog so, and this is just an instant that does come back to my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: So, the dog left or did they kick it out?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Yes, it left.</span> <span id="s271">No, the dog left, unfortunately, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Did you hear your mother play cello?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Yes, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Did you like it?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: I never liked the cello.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: No, but she also played the piano.</span> <span id="s278">We were forced to play the piano as children.</span> <span id="s279">I preferred to piano.</span> <span id="s280">I didn’t like the cello.</span> <span id="s281">I preferred, of all the instruments, I preferred the violin, but my favorite instrument is still the piano.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: And, do you still play?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: But, I was – before I hated it because I was forced to play it for something like five years.</span> <span id="s288">My older brother, too, and my mother would sit there and listen to us play, and correct us so on and so forth, but we had teachers who taught us.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Now, I know a bit about why she was a disciplinarian.</span> <span id="s290">Being a musician, they go together in some ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: You may have a point, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: They’re similar in some ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: All right, we’re going to have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">End of Tape 1</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: George, how much older was your father in relationship-</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: My father was about twenty years older than my mother, and it was interesting because my father was engaged several times before he met my mother, and he came back – and this was in Riga, he came back from an engagement with a cousin of his and going back to Libau because my grandfather was at that time sick apparently.</span> <span id="s299">And, on the railroad station, he saw my mother with a number of other young women seeing off somebody on a train that was going to Germany.</span> <span id="s300">And, my father said to his cousin, “This is the woman I’m going to marry.”</span> <span id="s301">So, his cousin, whom I knew, he died about twenty year ago in South Africa, said, “_____ You’re crazy.</span> <span id="s302">You’re nuts.</span> <span id="s303">You just came from an engagement.”</span> <span id="s304">He said, “I don’t care, and I’m going to go to the train and I’m going to sit in the same _____, in the same compartment with this man and find out who this woman is.”</span> <span id="s305">He got onto the train, didn’t go back to Libau, got into the same compartment, and said apparently to my mother’s brother, “Who is this woman?”</span> <span id="s306">“Oh, it’s my sister Clara Jacobson _____ et cetera et cetera” The next station, my father got off, went back to Riga and then to Libau, and started sending letters to my mother, didn’t know her age, and it was signed “Dr. Schwab.”</span> <span id="s307">The appearance of Schwab is a German name.</span> <span id="s308">After two weeks, he sent a ____.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: No kidding?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: A ____.</span> <span id="s311">Well, Dr. Schwab is probably Jewish, and then my parents said, and all of them, the sisters, my mother was the youngest – all the sisters and brothers said, “Well, let’s take a look at him.</span> <span id="s312">Let’s invite him and take a look at him.</span> <span id="s313">Let’s look at him.”</span> <span id="s314">So, two weeks later, they invited him and he came to Riga, and he came in and greeted everyone, and my grandparents’ apparently had lined up the six sisters.</span> <span id="s315">There were six sisters and three brothers in the family.</span> <span id="s316">And, to see if my father would recognize the one that he wanted.</span> <span id="s317">The nerve that he had, he came in, and walked over to my mother and gave her a kiss.</span> <span id="s318">And, then said, “Look, I have to get some medications here in Riga for my father.</span> <span id="s319">Would you like to accompany me?”</span> <span id="s320">because he had there a ____.</span> <span id="s321">It was a what you would call here a driver ____.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: Yeah, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: A ____ in Russian, and they went out for a few hours to get the medication.</span> <span id="s324">They came back, and my father announced that they had decided to get married.</span> <span id="s325">My mother didn’t even know anything about it, and that he will be back in two weeks, and everything can be ready.</span> <span id="s326">My mother said to me later on, she was so embarrassed to say no, et cetera, that she said to her parents, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s327">But, her parents kept on saying, “Look, you don’t have to go through with it if you don’t want to.”</span> <span id="s328">But, she made one condition to my father.</span> <span id="s329">He had a mustache.</span> <span id="s330">That he would have to-</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Take it off?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: Take it off because she didn’t like mustaches.</span> <span id="s333">So, what she did – they got married, and then he said, “Well, now we’ll go to Libau.”</span> <span id="s334">So, my mother was under the impression that he would stay in Riga and move in with the rest of the family because she was not interested in going to Libau.</span> <span id="s335">And, later on when she spoke of home when we lived in Libau, home to her was always Rega, which was very interesting.</span> <span id="s336">It was home.</span> <span id="s337">It was a very happy marriage I must say.</span> <span id="s338">They adored each other.</span> <span id="s339">And, I must say that I grew up in, despite the sternness of my mother, I grew up in a very warm home.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: So, she was affectionate as well as stern?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s342">She was affectionate, but stern.</span> <span id="s343">There was no nonsense.</span> <span id="s344">There’s a right way, and there’s a wrong way, period.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Now, this story that you just recounted, you heard from your mother I gather.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Not only from my mother, but I also from the cousin from South Africa.</span> <span id="s347">We were talking about, and he recounted it.</span> <span id="s348">And, also from an aunt of mine who – and some of my mother’s friends in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: Very lucky that they got along.</span> <span id="s352">It’s a very strange story.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Yes, but they did, and there’s still a woman actually in London who is a very close friend of one of the people who works with ______, very close family friend, but more my brother’s age than my age, who said it was an idyllic marriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: It’s an interesting story.</span> <span id="s355">So, how old was your mother when they married?</span> <span id="s356">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: She was around 17.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s359">So, she was really a kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Sixteen actually, no 17, and on her 18th birthday, my older brother was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Wow, now was that very young at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Apparently not so young I those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: But my mother was the first of the sisters to get married.</span> <span id="s365">Some never got married.</span> <span id="s366">Two of them never got married, but she was the youngest.</span> <span id="s367">She sort of paved the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: Now, I understand you had a trolley car model?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: Well, in Libau, we had trolley cars, and I loved going in trolley cars.</span> <span id="s370">My life’s ambition was to become a conductor.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Yeah, and when we would go on the trains to Riga, my life’s ambition was to become an engineer who drives a locomotive, or whatever you call them.</span> <span id="s373">This was my horizon.</span> <span id="s374">And, when the planes starting flying between Riga and Libau, passenger planes, I’ve never been on a passenger plane Riga-Libau, I wanted to be come a pilot.</span> <span id="s375">So, speed, in other words-</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Is very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: -is very important, and where did I get it because I saw a lot of the American movies in Libau where you saw in New York, bridges going up, cars, all these things.</span> <span id="s378">It made a tremendous impression on me.</span> <span id="s379">I loved American movies.</span> <span id="s380">I loved Shirley Temple and I went around saying she was a cousin of mine.</span> <span id="s381">(laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: (laughs) Did anybody believe you?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Well, these were kids.</span> <span id="s384">(laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: It’s interesting because I think that many of us, we know the movies went to Europe, but it’s so interesting to hear people who were living in Europe in ‘30s who actually - the impression was very big.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Yes, Bobby Breen, Tarzan movies, Bobby Breen, Shirley Temple, these were-</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: These were big things.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: These were big things for me as a child, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s390">Did you ever want to be a doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: My father said it’s not good to be a doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s394">The reason – and my mother reinforced it saying that his was called out very often at night, at three o’clock at night, and he made these phone calls – he made these house calls, sometimes at three o’clock in the morning on an emergency, when I would wake up and here the telephone ring, et cetera.</span> <span id="s395">I would wake-up.</span> <span id="s396">My mother usually accompanied him.</span> <span id="s397">There was a driver downstairs, and sometimes I went along, and I stayed with my mother in the car and my father went in.</span> <span id="s398">But, I remember one incident with a Latvian patient, my father decided to take in the car – the back seat in the car with my mother and him – between my mother and him, and I was in the front with the driver, and the patient was very, very sick and the patient’s wife was also there and blamed the car.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: For making him sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: For making him sick.</span> <span id="s401">Well, these were peasants, obviously, and this is something that still sticks in my mind today.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: I understand that you spoke German more than you spoke Latvian.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s404">Our – my mother tongue is German, yes.</span> <span id="s405">+</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Now, can you explain why that would be since you were born and lived in Latvia?</span> <span id="s407">Why your mother tongue would be something else?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: First of all, we lived in Courland, which was once upon a time German ____ where you had the German and also subsequently the Russian aristocracy congregating over there.</span> <span id="s409">We were products of German culture over there.</span> <span id="s410">So, we did not grow up with Yiddish.</span> <span id="s411">In Libau, by and large, at that time I did not know of anybody speaking Yiddish.</span> <span id="s412">Let’s put it this way.</span> <span id="s413">It’s only in the ghetto that I learned about that.</span> <span id="s414">And, I remember my father saying, “That Yiddish” and my mother also, “was not a language.</span> <span id="s415">It was a jargon.”</span> <span id="s416">A jargon.</span> <span id="s417">We used the French word in German, jargon.</span> <span id="s418">And, language is something that one has to be in command of.</span> <span id="s419">So, the first language was really German that we spoke.</span> <span id="s420">When I was small and my parents didn’t want me to understand something, they spoke Russian which, of course, bothered me.</span> <span id="s421">So, I picked it up because I heard Russian being spoken all over the place.</span> <span id="s422">I went to Latvian school, and Latvian school of course we spoke Latvian.</span> <span id="s423">Our main housekeeper, we spoke Latvian.</span> <span id="s424">When we had another one, Fenya, she was Russian, and then my father in the building had a nurse, Maria.</span> <span id="s425">With her, I spoke German.</span> <span id="s426">So, I grew up with all these languages, but my language number one was German.</span> <span id="s427">Two, I would say, was probably Latvian at that time.</span> <span id="s428">Three, Russian, and English four, because I really liked it, and I made a point of really getting it under my belt.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s430">How were you when you were in school with Latvian?</span> <span id="s431">Was it uncomfortable for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Well, I remember one anti-Semitic incident.</span> <span id="s433">We all had uniforms, and one day I was called on to recite a poem.</span> <span id="s434">We had to get up.</span> <span id="s435">I got up.</span> <span id="s436">I started to read it, and the teacher said, “You can sit down.</span> <span id="s437">He reads like a Jew.”</span> <span id="s438">I didn’t think I had an accent, but you didn’t have to.</span> <span id="s439">You could be perfect and still be called a Jew for something.</span> <span id="s440">I complained.</span> <span id="s441">I went home.</span> <span id="s442">I complained to my father and my mother, and my father immediately telephoned the director of the school.</span> <span id="s443">____ was his name.</span> <span id="s444">This was a Latvian school.</span> <span id="s445">He was a patient of my father’s.</span> <span id="s446">He came to the house and apologized to my parents that it would never happen.</span> <span id="s447">I was called in ____ office.</span> <span id="s448">He did not apologize to me.</span> <span id="s449">He turned the tables and said, “You have to be a good boy.”</span> <span id="s450">I told this to my parents.</span> <span id="s451">“Don’t worry.</span> <span id="s452">It’s not going to happen again”, et cetera, et cetera.</span> <span id="s453">In this class of about 25, there were three Jews, but when the teacher made this remark that I read like a Jew, everyone started to laugh.</span> <span id="s454">It was very embarrassing to me, obviously, and this irked me.</span> <span id="s455">But, otherwise, I personally did not sense any, what we would call today, anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s456">In those days, I wouldn’t have known the term, obviously.</span> <span id="s457">Next to our school was a Jewish School, and sometimes we had matches – soccer matches – not soccer matches actually snowball fights.</span> <span id="s458">So, we the Latvians would fight the Jews, the Latvians school and Jews, but did not have any overtones.</span> <span id="s459">It did not have any overtones.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: And, then you considered yourself a Latvian more than you knew you were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: Yeah, oh yes.</span> <span id="s462">I always knew I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s463">We grew up in an assimilated family.</span> <span id="s464">I knew about Passover.</span> <span id="s465">Once or twice I went to the synagogue with my parents in the High Holidays and I loved Passover because of the _____ matza.</span> <span id="s466">The matza was what they called-</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: With horseradish on it?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: No, it was cheese and egg on top, and don’t ask me about menus, the finished product was absolutely delicious.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: Matza fried?</span> <span id="s470">Fried matza with eggs?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: It was – no, you put egg on top of the cheese and then you baked it, et cetera, and then you put some cinnamon and sugar on top, and it was absolutely delicious.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: It sounds good.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s474">My mother was no good cook.</span> <span id="s475">She loved to bake, but had absolutely no talent when it came to cooking, and when she – I remember, this is an interesting incident, she once cut her finger in the kitchen doing something, and my father got upset and said, “If I see you again in the kitchen, the entire staff will be fired.”</span> <span id="s476">Your place is at the cello and not in the kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: And, you heard this?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: I heard this, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: You heard this.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: He was mad because it was a pretty bad cut.</span> <span id="s481">I don’t know what she had done, et cetera, and later on when we came to the states and my mother had to cook for me, she would go and buy steaks, the best steaks that she could get, and a steak – I don’t know a couple of dollars in those days.</span> <span id="s482">She didn’t know – she would make the steaks, and she said to me in the diminutive jocular, I don’t know what I do, but you can play football with it because it was all to her cooking.</span> <span id="s483">She just did not know how to cook.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: How to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: How to do it, but when it came to baking, she loved it, and she loved to bake.</span> <span id="s486">But, for cooking, et cetera, this – speaking, coming back to what you asked me before about these poor people.</span> <span id="s487">There was one schoolboy in my class, ________, and I became very friendly with him, and he invited me over to his house.</span> <span id="s488">Not far from where we lived, and he lived – it must have been a very large room with his parents, a table in the middle and a number of beds.</span> <span id="s489">We played.</span> <span id="s490">It must have been just underneath a roof between – I remember climbing a number of stories, a number of floors and then we got into a kind of an attic.</span> <span id="s491">I think they must have lived in an attic, and I thought it was the greatest thing because he was young and strong, and I was not.</span> <span id="s492">He was street-smart, and I was not.</span> <span id="s493">And, I thought of how wonderful it is to live like this, how wonderful it is to be like this because I was the exact opposite, and I just enjoyed playing with him, and I was invited.</span> <span id="s494">He died recently.</span> <span id="s495">He’s on one of the photos that I have over here.</span> <span id="s496">So, this is I do remember that I had this encounter.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: And, did you go there often?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Probably three, four times or so, maybe more, more times et cetera, but not very often, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: Did it influence you in some way, the way he was?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Well, it became a kind of a role model for me to be smart, to be strong, smart, this and that.</span> <span id="s501">This also reminds me about school.</span> <span id="s502">School – you could, if you gave some kids protection money, they would protect you and you could have your commandos, and for a centime or two or so, you could “buy your protection” and they would become your protectors, and I had my allowance, whatever, maybe a quarter a week which I would spend maybe ten centimes a week to pay off these guys.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: What would you have to be protected from?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: I don’t know because there were school fights.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Fights.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: There were fights among the kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: So, they would fight for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Then they would help me.</span> <span id="s509">Yes, they would come to my help if need by, but I never got into – I don’t remember having gotten into an actual fight, but just almost automatically.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: It’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Did you play sports?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: I used to swim and tennis, yes.</span> <span id="s514">These were the two things.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Not soccer?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: I wasn’t good at soccer.</span> <span id="s517">I wasn’t good at any of the other things, but I was good at tennis and I was good at swimming, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: The friends that you had, were they more parts of the family, or where there a lot of friends from school that you played with?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: Not from school.</span> <span id="s520">These were friends or friends of my parents and the kids with whom I associated with, with whom I played.</span> <span id="s521">My best friend was a chap by the name of Sasha ____.</span> <span id="s522">Sashenka we used to call him.</span> <span id="s523">He was also a role model, and the parents were the owners of most of the movie houses in Libau.</span> <span id="s524">So, we could sneak in back, et cetera, and watch then.</span> <span id="s525">He was very wild, and his language sometimes was off-color, and I would come home with the same language, and I was asked, “Where did you hear this word?”</span> <span id="s526">“Oh, yeah, Sashenka used it, et cetera.”</span> <span id="s527">So, for a while I was forbidden to see him, but the relations were soon repaired between the kids to give you just an incident.</span> <span id="s528">He was wild.</span> <span id="s529">I was wild, but I always managed to play innocent.</span> <span id="s530">Nothing was ever my fault.</span> <span id="s531">See, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: So, you’re very clever.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: Well, I guess I had to learn.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: When you say Sasha was wild and you were wild, what do you mean by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: In the middle of the city, they had a big garden where they lived, and he would throw stones across a wall to the neighbors aiming at people.</span> <span id="s536">He would instigate me to do the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: And, did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Yes, I did, too, et cetera and of course, there were complaints.</span> <span id="s539">“Ah”, I said, “Forget about these complaints.”</span> <span id="s540">Sometimes not using proper language.</span> <span id="s541">So, I came home and I thought, you know, that to be a wizard.</span> <span id="s542">Like, knowing English is to be wizard, it’s a term that we used in Libau was _____, wizard.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: _____</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: ____ very _____ actually, and yeah, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: So, you liked breaking out of-</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: -the discipline.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Oh, yes, oh, yes, I certainly did.</span> <span id="s549">I liked it very much, but I was always sort of put in my place at a certain point.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: But, you clearly kept both in some ways.</span> <span id="s551">You knew how to be very disciplined, but you-</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Yes, I could – I felt comfortable– let’s put it this way.</span> <span id="s553">I felt comfortable in home circumstances with my mother’s friends so on and so forth, but I also felt comfortable in the milieu of my Latvian friend and the impoverished, and the impoverished part.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: But, Sasha was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Sasha was-</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: Sasha was-</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: In a privileged situation, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: Oh, yes, very privileged situation, yes, very privileged situation.</span> <span id="s560">Where he picked it up, I can’t tell you.</span> <span id="s561">He had two older brothers, more my brother’s age.</span> <span id="s562">Where he got it from, I don’t know, and that’s where I learned, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Now, when you hit – I don’t know, it’s hard to know when you as a child would start hearing things.</span> <span id="s564">The Nazis take over in Germany in 1933.</span> <span id="s565">You’re two years old.</span> <span id="s566">I’m sure you’re not hearing anything then.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: But, suspicion is by the time 1938 hit.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s570">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s571">I was-</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: Did you begin to hear-</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Oh, a lot.</span> <span id="s574">There were a lot of discussions, and I will never forget when the aunt who came to Libau, she was going to make me these Viennese sandwiches so on and so forth, I remember still my aunt was saying to my father, the Anschluss was taking place in Vienna when Hitler marched in, that Jewish women were forced to take off their furs and to wipe and polish the cars.</span> <span id="s575">My father said, “You’re dreaming.</span> <span id="s576">I don’t believe it.</span> <span id="s577">German Culture, Deutsch Couture, they wouldn’t do this.”</span> <span id="s578">And, my father, to an extent, was a product of German culture, and during World War I, the German occupation, they behaved very, very properly toward the indigenous population of Latvia.</span> <span id="s579">So, my father dismissed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Even though she had seen it.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: Even though she had seen it, he had dismissed it outright, and I remember this very well, this incident.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: So, that must have been very meaningful to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Very meaningful, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Did you wonder?</span> <span id="s585">Could she just see-</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: No, look, I did not have an analytical mind in those days, I mean, in retrospect.</span> <span id="s587">Of course, I was short-sighted on my father’s side, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: It’s interesting what people will believe-</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: And, what they don’t believe-</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: When they’re told things.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: Exactly, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: Okay, we need to stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">End of Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Okay, George, besides hearing this about the Anschluss in Vienna and realizing that your father just doesn’t believe this, do you hear about other things going on about treatment of Jews, about concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Not that early on the concentration camps, no.</span> <span id="s599">The only incident that I remember about treatment of Jews was the one related to my father by my aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: That’s the only one?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: That’s the only one at that time, yes.</span> <span id="s602">I do remember very distinctly, the outbreak of war in September 1939 from the radio.</span> <span id="s603">We had radio which we could hear the entire world, and we heard the announcement from Warsaw when German bombers were arriving and bombing and everyone was glued to the radio, and of course, the discussions why people in the Baltics were safe because we were called ______, sort of buffer states, and if the Germans were to invade, the Russians would come in.</span> <span id="s604">They would immediately repel the Germans and vice versa, et cetera.</span> <span id="s605">So, that’s why the Baltics will remain immune to the war, and after all, as it was pointed out, and here my memories were very keen because this was something new excitement.</span> <span id="s606">I liked exceptional situations, and incidentally my first book is titled, “The Challenge of the Exception” because exception I find much more interesting than the rule, the norm.</span> <span id="s607">This was very exciting, war.</span> <span id="s608">I didn’t understand what it meant bombs falling, people running, et cetera.</span> <span id="s609">This was exciting.</span> <span id="s610">A nine year, ten year, nine year old kid, eight year old kid, et cetera, what did I know?</span> <span id="s611">I didn’t realize, I mean, today I would say I was a little jerk thinking about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: (laughs) Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: And, the discussions at the dinner table, supper, centered a lot about the war and what was happening, and the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact of August 23rd, 1939 where the two have come together, and after all, Hitler and Mein Kampfe was also saying that the reason – one of the reasons – why Germany lost World War I, and he will never make the same mistake, is fight on two fronts, and after Poland fell, I mean the war was still on with Britain and France, even though it was a kind of a phony war during the winter years until April, May 1940.</span> <span id="s614">So, everyone felt safe in the Baltics.</span> <span id="s615">We felt safe.</span> <span id="s616">Nothing is going to happen to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Given you were so excited in some ways that there was a war, but death was not meaningful for you at this point, of course, did you in some way hoping that it would come to Latvia?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: You wouldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: So, it was enough that it was someplace else.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: It was someplace else, yes.</span> <span id="s623">It was excitement, but someplace else.</span> <span id="s624">No, I didn’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: So, you’re okay in 1939.</span> <span id="s626">It doesn’t feel like anything is going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: No, no, life was beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: Life was fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: Life was very, very fine, very beautiful, very exciting.</span> <span id="s630">I loved to go to Riga.</span> <span id="s631">I could never understand why we lived in Libau in such a small city and not in Riga with 13 trolley car lines and Libau only two.</span> <span id="s632">More interesting cafes that in Libau, better gossip, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: How do you understand your father not going and having his practice in Riga do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Because the family is from Libau.</span> <span id="s635">My grandparents lived in Libau.</span> <span id="s636">We all were from Libau.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s638">So, he preferred to stay within that context.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Now, in June of 1940, the Russians occupy.</span> <span id="s641">Am I correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Do you remember the beginning of the occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Actually, I remember it very well.</span> <span id="s645">I was on the Riga beach with one of my aunts and cousins and uncle, and my mother immediately came to Riga to the beach to fetch me, and I was in my aunt’s apartment.</span> <span id="s646">This was already a day or two before it happened, in my aunt’s apartment which was not very far from the Soviet embassy in Riga, and from her terrace, I could hear over the loud speaker Vishinsky, the notorious Vishinsky addressing the crowd, welcoming Latvia to the Soviet Union because the Soviets came in at the invitation of the Latvians, according to him, and from the balcony, from the terrace, I could also see how the Latvians were marching with big banners, and I assumed that on those banners were “Welcome Russia.</span> <span id="s647">We’re finally liberated from the dictatorship of _____” Whatever.</span> <span id="s648">I only saw the placards, but not what was on the placards.</span> <span id="s649">So, these marches – yes, I, I was in Riga on that day and I heard his voice, Vishinsky’s voice.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: And, your impression of this?</span> <span id="s651">This was very impressive and interesting?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Everyone seemed worried.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: They were-</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: Everyone seemed worried, yes, but-</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Not you?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Not me, no, no.</span> <span id="s657">I felt safe.</span> <span id="s658">I, some way or another, felt safe.</span> <span id="s659">I didn’t – I never thought that I had to worry about anything, let’s put it this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: And, when you say everyone was worried – your father, your mother, your aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Well, this was-</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: The adults?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Yes, the adults in Riga, but my mother took me a day or two later, took me back to Libau, yes.</span> <span id="s664">So, in Libau, we went to the beach as usual, to the tennis courts still in the first few weeks, et cetera.</span> <span id="s665">Finally, we were permitted to talk to Russian soldiers because the Russians had established bases in Latvia already in September, October 1939 as a result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, but we were not permitted to talk to Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Yeah, but now we were permitted to talk to Russians, and I remember on the beaches, the Russians, also Russian soldiers, Russian trucks on all the beaches, and we could get these Russian insignias what we called _________, et cetera.</span> <span id="s668">So, we begged them, et cetera.</span> <span id="s669">But, soon after the occupation, we were all notified in our building where we lived that we had to evacuate, and evacuate it rather rapidly because it became eventually the headquarters of the Communist party for the Libau and the region around Libau, but we received an extension for a couple of months.</span> <span id="s670">First of all, they needed my father’s expertise, and we had to find a smaller apartment which turned out in my mother’s mind to be a disaster because we had to live in six rooms.</span> <span id="s671">How are we going to manage six rooms?</span> <span id="s672">My God...</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: And, how many did you have before?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: About ten.</span> <span id="s675">How are we going to do this?</span> <span id="s676">I had to double up with my brother.</span> <span id="s677">We had the same bedroom.</span> <span id="s678">My father was not permitted to put up – to have an office, but he was permitted to see private patients because, again, of his specialty.</span> <span id="s679">So, he had a kind of a sitting room where his library was, but all the X-ray machinery, ______ machinery, all this was stored in the maid’s room.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: And, could he use it?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: He couldn’t use it?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: No, because he became head of the policlinic over there at a salary and everyone laughed at it in the family of something like 30 Rubles a month.</span> <span id="s684">We were not dependent obviously on the 30 Rubles a month.</span> <span id="s685">And, he started getting patients for which I don’t think, I mean, he charged.</span> <span id="s686">I remember the admiral of the fleet _____or something along those lines, came and consulted my father and he even came to our house for dinner, the admiral, and I remember this because I admired his uniforms and the illustrious medals that he wore.</span> <span id="s687">That was in the new apartment that we had.</span> <span id="s688">In the old apartment, we had to take in a Russian soldier.</span> <span id="s689">Everyone had to take in Russian soldiers because Libau was a major base for the Russians, and Libau had three ports that never froze in the winters and that’s why you had also a very big naval port in Libau where part of the Russian fleet was stationed.</span> <span id="s690">So, it was very strategic significance.</span> <span id="s691">Libau as a city, and that is probably why Libau was much bombarded by the Nazis in ’41 when they invaded, and in ’44 and ’45 – and there was a lot of fighting in and around the city, and the city was about at least 85 percent destroyed in contrast to Riga which was not a strategic site, and there was relatively little fighting, and the city, by and large was preserved, is preserved.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: And, when this Russian soldier came into the original apartment, he lived in a room or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: He lived in a room, yes.</span> <span id="s694">He came, but sometimes drunk, had very curious habits, not washing himself, but spraying himself with a kind of an autocologne that smelled terribly, but this was common apparently among the Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s695">Different culture- different habits, et cetera, and people used to laugh.</span> <span id="s696">I remember my parents – the Russians loved music, and they would go to the opera, an in those days when you went to the opera very often you put on a tuxedo and long dress so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s697">So, the Russians wanted to show how well they can dress.</span> <span id="s698">So, some of the women – the wives of the officers came in long nightgowns.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: Yeah, and I remember snickers about this.</span> <span id="s701">I certainly do remember this, but then they distinguished you had still officers from the old Czarist days, and this I remember my parents saying what a difference it makes from these _____, I mean the ordinary, from the old days.</span> <span id="s702">The aristocrats versus ____.</span> <span id="s703">You can see, of course, immediately the difference.</span> <span id="s704">Or, if they try to be like the aristocrats, you just have to scratch a little bit and you saw where they came from.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: Now, do you remember this soldier?</span> <span id="s706">Was he – did he have any relationship with you or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: He was very friendly, very friendly.</span> <span id="s708">He would come.</span> <span id="s709">He would sleep.</span> <span id="s710">He would leave, but this was his room.</span> <span id="s711">He had the keys to the apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: So, he didn’t eat at your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: This I don’t recollect.</span> <span id="s714">I don’t recollect him eating in the house.</span> <span id="s715">Maybe in the kitchen or so.</span> <span id="s716">I don’t recollect this in the dining room.</span> <span id="s717">I don’t recollect this, but we also had to – we could no longer have sleep-ins.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: What does that - Do you mean with other people coming in?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: Well sleep-ins, I mean, because nobody was permitted to be a housekeeper.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: Ah, I see what you mean, right.</span> <span id="s721">So, you don’t have a housekeeper.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: No more staff, no, but a woman Fenya, this woman who didn’t sleep-in but always come in to work.</span> <span id="s723">She kept on coming to clean up the apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: And, that was okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: That was still okay, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: So, who started cooking, your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Good question.</span> <span id="s728">I remember one incident – no, I think it was Stepha, no, Fenya who did some of the cooking, but I remember one incident in the morning when we lived in the new apartment, and I had to go to school, my mother would prepare the breakfast for me and said, “Let’s do it very, very quickly, and we’ll eat in the kitchen.”</span> <span id="s729">And, I said to her, “I’m not a maid.”</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: Yeah, I said to her, and I remember that very distinctly, and my mother reminded me of this after the war.</span> <span id="s732">It seemed funny to eat in the kitchen, and this brings back a very funny story.</span> <span id="s733">My father had a cousin in Libau, _____ Rabinovitz, whose two sons lived here in the United States.</span> <span id="s734">One son used to accompany _____ a musician.</span> <span id="s735">He had Carnegie Hall in 1925 so on and so forth until ____ died, I think in 1929 if my memory serves me right.</span> <span id="s736">And, then he became a big _____ here in Hollywood playing behind mostly the piano.</span> <span id="s737">And, in 1936 or 1937, he came to Libau and begged his mother to come and live with him in Hollywood, leave Latvia, and he said, “Mother, I’m going to build you a house with a Hollywood kitchen where you can eat in the kitchen.”</span> <span id="s738">She said, “Eat in the kitchen?</span> <span id="s739">For this I should move to America?”</span> <span id="s740">To give you just an anecdote, but the mentality.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s743">“Eat in the kitchen?</span> <span id="s744">For this I should move to America?”</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: Yeah, and that reminded me of my little incident.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: Yes, and you were a kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: I was a kid, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s750">So is there a significant change when you had to move to the smaller apartment, or do things pretty much stay okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: Well, it was much, much smaller the apartment.</span> <span id="s752">My father was working.</span> <span id="s753">He saw private patients, but could not use his X-rays or his laboratory, et cetera.</span> <span id="s754">That was all gone.</span> <span id="s755">Did we starve?</span> <span id="s756">Food became more scarce.</span> <span id="s757">Let’s say a person could not buy more than, let’s say a pound of sugar per month.</span> <span id="s758">I’m thinking of an arbitrary-</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: -figure, but I do remember if we wanted to have meat, it also became scarce, and our new apartment was not far from the marketplace, and every person could buy so much and so much meat.</span> <span id="s761">So, I went online to buy a pound or a kilo or half a kilo, I don’t remember, and I paid.</span> <span id="s762">So, we had – and, my mother went online.</span> <span id="s763">So, that between the two of us, we were able to buy enough for a sumptuous meal.</span> <span id="s764">To give you just one idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: So, there wasn’t a restriction in terms of a family.</span> <span id="s766">It was a restriction per person.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: It was.</span> <span id="s768">I remember this very distinctly, yes, per person.</span> <span id="s769">So, therefore, my mother went probably an hour later or so, and I went at nine.</span> <span id="s770">I don’t know what time it was, at ten or she went at twelve, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: But, none of these restrictions were because you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: This is-</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: Everyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: Everybody’s in the same situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: Yes, everybody’s in the same situation, yes.</span> <span id="s777">Everybody was in the same situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Now, are you beginning – forget the Jewishness part for a moment – but, are you beginning to feel the harshness of what war means, and what occupation means, or is this you think because they’re communists and so-</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: They’re communists and we were vitriolicly anti-communist, and in my class, almost everyone joined the Communist Pioneers.</span> <span id="s780">I did not because we belonged to the “Bourgeois Class” and we were – the class was being lambasted all the time.</span> <span id="s781">And, we were scared, but nothing seemed to happen, nothing happened until one week before the outbreak of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: In 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: ’41, exactly one week before the outbreak of the war, on Sunday, suddenly Russian trucks appeared all over the city telling you you have to pack your things and leave.</span> <span id="s784">We’ll take you to Russia.</span> <span id="s785">We didn’t know whether we would be taken, too, but a lot of the well-to-do people, a lot of the Jews, also Latvians, but proportionally more Jews than Latvians, were taken and shipped off to Siberia and to that part of the world in cattle cars, and this was just one week, exactly the Sunday before the outbreak of the war between Russia and Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: Now, when you say that you were – and I’m assuming you mean the family – was vitriolicly anti-Communist, is that what you believed about the Communists or is that because the Communists saw you as Bourgeois and would not accept you?</span> <span id="s787">Or, was it both?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: I think it was both.</span> <span id="s789">I think it was both.</span> <span id="s790">Again, I can’t be a hundred percent certain, but I just know we were anti-Communist, and it was my decision not to join the youth movement.</span> <span id="s791">Again, my parents didn’t say anything that I had to or so.</span> <span id="s792">My father felt probably significantly secure again because of his specialty as a gastroenterologist, not to be too worried, but still, and also the fact that he had prominent Russians now from the Russian Army and the Russian Navy as patients.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: And, let me ask you something – is part of the reason also that you didn’t want to join not just ideological but the fact that they were also very disciplined and you were going to be indoctrinated on certain things, or you just didn’t agree with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: I just didn’t agree with them, and I didn’t – at that time, I tried to intuit myself into that situation.</span> <span id="s795">At that time, I simply thought that Communism was wrong.</span> <span id="s796">Why?</span> <span id="s797">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: See?</span> <span id="s800">Of course, we were chased out of our apartment, but in contrast to the other ones, we were permitted to stay there another month or two, but I do remember my mother complaining, “How are we ever going to live in a six room apartment?”</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s802">That included a kitchen, right?</span> <span id="s803">(laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: It was the library, living room, dining room, two bedrooms, I had to double up with my brother, and in order to get into the – not into the, we had different – the toilet was in a different part of the apartment from the bathroom, and my parents to take a bath, they had to go through our bedroom, my brother’s and my bedroom.</span> <span id="s805">So, there was not this privacy.</span> <span id="s806">So, wait a second, in Europe we don’t call the kitchen a room, or the maid’s room.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: No, so, actually to us, the library, living room, dining room, two bedrooms – five, and there was a kitchen – six, and the maid’s room, actually seven, seven rooms, but it was – and the rooms were much smaller than we had originally.</span> <span id="s809">A little footnote about this.</span> <span id="s810">I was persuaded by – I don’t know if the name means anything – Per Ahlmark, Per Ahlmark former Deputy Prime Minister of Sweden, played a very big role in Jewish life since the ‘70s, ‘80s – very pro-Israel, very pro-Jewish, convinced Elie to go back to ____ and accompanied Elie to ____ and wrote about it for the Swedish press.</span> <span id="s811">It was he who persuaded me to go back and accompanied me too, and wrote a series of articles in the Swedish press about my return to Libau.</span> <span id="s812">Before we went into any of my apartments where I lived in Riga and Libau in 1990.</span> <span id="s813">We had the President’s car and one his – another one his drivers, and also one of his deputies so we could get into any apartment.</span> <span id="s814">I said, “Per, before we go into any of these apartments, from the outside I will tell you exactly the layout so you will not think that I’m imaging or inventing certain things.”</span> <span id="s815">Later on he told me, “George, I’ve never seen anybody who has such a memory”, because I was precise on every single issue.</span> <span id="s816">For example, before I went into the apartment, I said to him, “We had central heating.”</span> <span id="s817">You see?</span> <span id="s818">And, I told him exactly where it is, and I showed it to him which was still preserved.</span> <span id="s819">In Riga too where I used to stay with my aunt in a very luxurious, large apartments.</span> <span id="s820">At that time in 1990, my aunts, she was the only person.</span> <span id="s821">She had an atrium apartment.</span> <span id="s822">There were about three or four families living, and I showed him in the room where I used to sleep, et cetera, dining room, living room, sitting room, library, et cetera.</span> <span id="s823">He said, “You know this memory’s absolutely” because, I found – everything I found to be fascinating, the big world.</span> <span id="s824">Now, I heard these talks about when my parents talked when they were in Paris and Berlin and went to the cabarets, this and that.</span> <span id="s825">That’s what I wanted to do, and my aunt with whom I stayed, she was married to the Chinese envoy to Germany who died in 1935.</span> <span id="s826">Whose father was already ambassador in the days of Bismarck, the Germany, and when she would talk – and so I always thought of foreign policy.</span> <span id="s827">I didn’t know what it was, but the lifestyle, I just loved it.</span> <span id="s828">I ate it all up, et cetera.</span> <span id="s829">The diplomatic life, what my mother would tell me about when they were in Berlin in the ‘20s, what was going on so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s830">For example, my mother loved to go in the subways.</span> <span id="s831">She said, “I came here in order to see Berlin.”</span> <span id="s832">My father had lived in Berlin because he had studied there.</span> <span id="s833">“I want to see Berlin.</span> <span id="s834">I go by bus.”</span> <span id="s835">My aunt said, “But you have my car with a driver.</span> <span id="s836">What’s the matter with you, Clara?”</span> <span id="s837">My mother said, “No, I am going to go in the subway.</span> <span id="s838">I am going to go in the elevator.</span> <span id="s839">I’m going to go in the buses.</span> <span id="s840">I want” She looked at her as if she was crazy, and it turned out later on, and my aunt told me that my mother knew Berlin better than she knew it.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: She did.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: Yes, because this aunt had survived and died in Riga about 20 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: But, your memory of some of the details of what an apartment looks like is – I don’t know.</span> <span id="s844">It doesn’t seem typical to me that you as such a young child would have such very vivid memory of these rooms and the layout.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: That’s really something.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: And, Per, as I said, who is very often speaks at Jewish events in the United States and in Israel, as I said, and very close to Ellie, and he comes with me all the time, every time I go back to Latvia, or almost every time.</span> <span id="s848">He has been with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: And 1990 was the first time?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: 1990 was the first time, yes, and I think we had sent you some – Sheila sent you some material on this.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: Of my first visit, how Per convinced me to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: That’s Per.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s856">O0kay, we’re going to have to change the tape again.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">End of Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Tape 4</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: George, just to go back for a moment, you’ve referred to someone named Elie quite often.</span> <span id="s860">So, I assume you’re meaning Elie Wiesel</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: Correct, Elie Wiesel.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Because otherwise some people may not know who it is.</span> <span id="s863">Did you go to school when the Russians were occupying?</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: Yes, and it was for one year, but I still went to school, and that’s when I really failed all the subjects.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: Oh, that’s when you failed?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: Yeah, and war was kind of a relief for me when it broke out.</span> <span id="s867">The first thing that came to my mind is, “I will no longer have to go to school.”</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: To school.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s870">Wait a second.</span> <span id="s871">Yeah, that was the year.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: That was the year.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: That was the year.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: Did your father have to acquire some military status during this period of time when the Russians came?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: Not in uniform, but when the war broke out, we could not run to Russia because it would have been considered desertion.</span> <span id="s876">It was considered that he had to be on the spot for his duties.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: So, does this mean that when people were told they could leave Latvia a couple of weeks or a week before-</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: No, the week before the outbreak of the war, these were the so-called “mass deportations”</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: You could’ve left then?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: With the mass deportations?</span> <span id="s883">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: No.</span> <span id="s886">These were forced deportations.</span> <span id="s887">The trucks arrived.</span> <span id="s888">“Family X – we’re looking for A, B, C, D – Family X you have to be packed what you can carry with you in two hours, and we’re taking you to Russia to work, work camp.</span> <span id="s889">You’re a Bourgeoisie.</span> <span id="s890">That is you belong to the Bourgeois class.”</span> <span id="s891">And, that was that.</span> <span id="s892">And, proportionally many more Jews were sent out than Latvians because he Jews were in certain of the professions, and also in many of the businesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: I see, and that was your father’s status as being a doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: That was our interpretation at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: That was our interpretation.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: And, what is the major religion in Latvia.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: Lutheran.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: Lutheran?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s902">Now, is your brother taken in to be part of the army?</span> <span id="s903">I mean, he’s now what 18 years, 19 years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: He just graduated gymnasium, and before the war the talk was after he would graduate gymnasium, of course, you couldn’t send him to Germany to study at the university.</span> <span id="s905">So, they were going to send him to England.</span> <span id="s906">Why to England especially Cambridge?</span> <span id="s907">Chemistry.</span> <span id="s908">He had some inclination in that direction.</span> <span id="s909">So, they figured that he would end up in England studying Chemistry.</span> <span id="s910">My mother later on told me that before Hitler came to power, it was assumed that we would – the kids – would study at one of the German universities.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: But, certainly, England, the talk of England came in only later on when Hitler was already in power that they would not be able to send him to study in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: Now, during the Russian occupation, though, your father isn’t earning a lot of money, really.</span> <span id="s914">The money that he has possessed, that the family had, was not confiscated as far as you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: Well, my mother told me that we had withdrawn a large sum of money before the Russian occupation occurred from the bank, a considerable amount, but not everything should be suspicious, so only a part.</span> <span id="s916">And, we were able to exchange some of it into Rubles, but there were price controls in the Russian period.</span> <span id="s917">So, if you made 30 Rubles, you had to pay the rent maybe with three Rubles or four Rubles, but money was not an issue and wasn’t – and I remember the snickers about the 30 Rubles that he was making, or 35 Rubles perhaps, but it was very low.</span> <span id="s918">It was in the 30s I remember, but it didn’t matter to us personally.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s920">So, are you – is there any apprehension that there’s going to be a war coming to Latvia, that the Germans will do something that this won’t stay-</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: No, no because according to the Ribbentrop Molotov Pact, Latvia and Estonia and a good part of Lithuania fell under the Russian sphere of influence and subsequently occupation, and that Germans would not dare attack Russia.</span> <span id="s922">This behemoth for as long as the war still is going on in the West.</span> <span id="s923">So, there were no fears of war.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: So, this deportation, this mass forced deportation, you think it had nothing to do with the Russians thinking there’s going to be a war.</span> <span id="s925">They just did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: That’s a very good question, and that’s still being speculated about.</span> <span id="s927">Stalin and Molotov were convinced, and I’m not talking now as a child.</span> <span id="s928">I’m talking about with my knowledge as an academic, where convinced that there would be no war with Russia – with Germany at this time.</span> <span id="s929">The lower downs believed that there will be because the Germans were sending spy planes all the time.</span> <span id="s930">In fact, the week before – two weeks before the outbreak or three weeks before the outbreak, we could see planes very, very high up.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: And, could you see them?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: You could?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: You could see them, yes which we assumed were not Russian planes.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: But, nevertheless, you weren’t – the people you were around were not suspicious.</span> <span id="s936">You wouldn’t be.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: You were too young.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: We were not suspicious.</span> <span id="s940">That was elsewhere, the war, not – it would not come to the Baltics.</span> <span id="s941">We did not like the Russians, but in comparison, of course, the Russians were the lesser evils.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: They still were the lesser evils even to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s944">Well, the point is, later on in comparison to the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: Ah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: Yeah, but we were, the family was together.</span> <span id="s947">We really did not starve.</span> <span id="s948">We were not sent out.</span> <span id="s949">Friends of ours were deported, yes, but my aunts and uncles in Riga were not deported.</span> <span id="s950">So, by and large, by and large, we were satisfied.</span> <span id="s951">Of course, the press was a controlled press.</span> <span id="s952">My parents now spoke much more often in Russian in front of me for fear that I should not go to school and say something anti-Communist, and then be arrested because a child had said something.</span> <span id="s953">I sensed it of course, and I resented the fact that my parents did not trust me, and that was probably one of the reasons I did not join the Russian Youth Movement, the Young Pioneers because everything was now hush-hush at home for fear that I may squeal because I was a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s955">So, you think you didn’t join partly because you felt?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: Yes, because I was vitriolicly anti-Communist like my parents, and I sensed it at home, what I overheard, what I understood from their Russian, et cetera, I kept my mouth shut, but nevertheless, they had to be cautious.</span> <span id="s957">I understand.</span> <span id="s958">I understand it now.</span> <span id="s959">I didn’t understand it at the time obviously.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Now, what language were you speaking in primarily now since before the Russians come you’re speaking primarily German.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: I continued to speak German with my parents, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: You did?</span> <span id="s963">With you parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: And in the street, with the kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: It was Latvian.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: Was it Latvian?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: And, could you speak a little Russian with the Russian soldiers that you-</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: Yes, oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: And, this is not a harsh occupation except for the forced?</span> <span id="s974">Or was it a harsh, maybe it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: I don’t think it was a harsh occupation before the deportations.</span> <span id="s976">Freedom of the press, of course, was curtailed.</span> <span id="s977">Harsh from the viewpoint of physical harm, no, until the deportation, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: I’ve read that people were arrested for anti-Communist, anti-Bolshevik statements, so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s980">Yes, we heard about this, but the immediate circle, our immediate circle, as I understood it at the time, was not affected.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: Something radically different happens in 1941, however.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: Do you remember the move into Latvia by the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: Very well, I remember the outbreak of the war very well.</span> <span id="s985">Actually, what happened, the war, the Germans invaded on a Sunday morning, early morning.</span> <span id="s986">Saturday night, my parents went to sleep only at three or four because they played cards at our house.</span> <span id="s987">There were about six or seven ladies played Gin Rummy, I mean Kunken, and suddenly early in the morning, there was lots of noise, bombs being dropped et cetera on that Sunday morning, June 22nd, of ’41, and now we had a terrace in the rear, a balcony not a terrace, actually only a balcony.</span> <span id="s988">And, we all went out to see what happened, and we saw German planes, ______ , flying very low where we could even say hello to the pilots and they sort of winked back at us because it was very low, bombing certain parts.</span> <span id="s989">We didn’t know what was happening.</span> <span id="s990">We turned on the radio, no news.</span> <span id="s991">The news about the outbreak of the war did not come for hours because the Russians were taken by surprise.</span> <span id="s992">They didn’t know.</span> <span id="s993">Subsequently, I read in the history books that Stalin thought that it was not Hitler behind this, the ____ went behind Hitler’s back because Stalin and Molotov were convinced that the Germans were not going to invade, and now suddenly, they did invade.</span> <span id="s994">So, the bombings – this was very exciting.</span> <span id="s995">Again, our building was not hit.</span> <span id="s996">It was someplace in the center of the city.</span> <span id="s997">I did not immediately see any ruins, but as the Germans were moving closer, they occupied Libau one week after the outbreak of the war.</span> <span id="s998">My father took us to the hospital which was a little bit outside of the city in a safer neighborhood, and we stayed there for a couple of days until the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s999">But, during the bombardment, we also stayed one night in a basement in the center of the city in a kind of a policlinic, a small hospital, and there I saw a lot of the destruction already, and that became to dangerous to stay there in the center of the city because this was being bombarded by the German Navy and subsequently by the Army.</span> <span id="s1000">So, we moved to the larger hospital outside the city – well, it still was in the city district, but in the residential area right near the beach, and I distinctly remember when the Germans arrived, the Latvian doctors asked my father to accompany them to “welcome the Germans” with roses, et cetera, and my father went and asked about the Jews and the Lieutenant in the car, and I remember him coming back saying the Jews have nothing to worry about.</span> <span id="s1001">We now have a common foe, and we must fight this common foe and the Jews are part of this war.</span> <span id="s1002">In the naivety, fighting if you fight together we’re civilized Germans, not racists, et cetera.</span> <span id="s1003">Like in World War I, if you fight Communism, fine and good, and he was sort of assured, and in a certain naivety, he believed and made us rather believe that we have nothing to worry about, or maybe he just wanted to keep us calm as could be the case.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: So, how did you feel that he asked the Germans this question?</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: He came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: And he told you what he asked them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: Yeah, he told us and my brother, my mother and me et cetera, yes, and we all listened, et cetera.</span> <span id="s1008">There was a kind of a command car that appeared and he was part of the welcoming committee that he was asked to participate, and in this context he asked about the Jewish question, and he was assured by this officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: That everything would be okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: That, Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: Is this as if your father either knew nothing or paid no attention to what was happening to Jews in Germany?</span> <span id="s1012">Did you have any idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: Originally, I’m convinced.</span> <span id="s1014">Again, this is my interpretation that he did not genuinely believe my aunt when she said-</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: What had happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: -what had happened with the Germans with the Jewish women polishing the cars with furs.</span> <span id="s1017">Later on, my interpretation again, is that he did not want to worry the family.</span> <span id="s1018">So, he always looked at the glass half full rather than half empty.</span> <span id="s1019">That’s my interpretation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: Is it possible that he never asked the Germans this?</span> <span id="s1021">He simply told you this so you’d feel okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: I would – it could very well be the case.</span> <span id="s1023">It could very well be the case, and then afterwards the same day, we took our baggage and we walked back to the apartment, and the house was still standing and we saw the German occupiers on the street and they left us alone.</span> <span id="s1024">We left them alone.</span> <span id="s1025">I remember staring at them, and then we went back to the apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: The same apartment, the smaller apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: Yes, but in the meantime we had also heard that a number of Jews were shot by Latvians because the Latvians were also vitriolicly anti-Communist, and in some of the German propaganda that leaked through, I guess, the Germans equated Bolshevism with Judaism so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s1028">So, apparently, some people were shot even before, just before the German occupation took place in Libau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: So, how long is it when things become rougher and it’s no longer the same life for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: Almost immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: Almost immediately?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: Almost immediately.</span> <span id="s1033">I remember my father having to go to a gathering place every morning to be assigned for work.</span> <span id="s1034">My father wore his red cross arm band.</span> <span id="s1035">My brother going to work.</span> <span id="s1036">A cousin of mine was shot dead by the Germans apparently, he had just married a Latvian girl before.</span> <span id="s1037">She was pregnant, but I was lead to understand that she also had a lover, and I was lead to understand that she denounced him as a Jew and he was shot and my father was called on to go to the cemetery to identify the body, and he came back to the house and I was there, pale saying, “Yes it was ____ who was shot dead.”</span> <span id="s1038">He identified the body, and that was about a week to ten days after the occupation, and it was not long thereafter when my father was arrested, tortured and killed, yes.</span> <span id="s1039">So, we immediately began to feel it, almost immediately, within days I would say, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: And, when you saw that your father coming back, it must have been very shocking to you to see him looking-</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: He must have looked awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: Yes, yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1044">Then, I no longer thought in terms of me and the I, et cetera.</span> <span id="s1045">I began thinking in terms of the larger picture that is our fate, no longer my school.</span> <span id="s1046">I mean, this became irrelevant.</span> <span id="s1047">It was not even a footnote in my life.</span> <span id="s1048">Now, the issue became life and death.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: And, you’re ten years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: About ten.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1053">Nine and a half at the time now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: So, the quick relief of “I don’t have to go to school.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: Oh, that-</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: Was all finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: That was finished.</span> <span id="s1058">That was finished, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: So, do you have trouble sleeping now when you’re-</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: Now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: No, I don’t mean now.</span> <span id="s1062">I’m sorry, now meaning at the point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: At the point, I don’t remember having trouble sleeping.</span> <span id="s1064">I slept.</span> <span id="s1065">I lead an active life in so far as I kept up with the news, the latest news, what’s happening all the gossip, the dangers, by the time the evening came around, I assume I was exhausted.</span> <span id="s1066">I was still a kid.</span> <span id="s1067">So, I seemed to sleep very well.</span> <span id="s1068">My mother was assigned to go to work, and sometimes she was able to take me with her.</span> <span id="s1069">This was she was kind of a seamstress, ironing.</span> <span id="s1070">I remember her doing working in, I guess it must have been a laundry.</span> <span id="s1071">If I think of it today, for the German Air Force in Libau.</span> <span id="s1072">She was, and then at a certain point, she became the housekeeper, maid for the mistress, for the Latvian mistress for the head of the _____ in Libau, and my mother knew her from before the war because they used to meet at the same hairdressers called Mary’s.</span> <span id="s1073">I still remember.</span> <span id="s1074">This mistress apparently had a liking, took a liking to my mother, and sent a long to the ghetto, but this was already in the ghetto period.</span> <span id="s1075">But, before the ghetto period already, extra food and when she knew that things were going to happen to Jews, she would tell my mother, “You better bring George with you to the apartment.”</span> <span id="s1076">So, I would stay for the day at the apartment safe when my mother was cleaning or whatever, yes.</span> <span id="s1077">But, things became in a sense chaotic, but there was within this chaos, there was still order.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: How – I don’t know whether at the time you would know, but perhaps only afterwards when you talked with your mother, how did she take to doing this?</span> <span id="s1079">She was never doing this sort of work in the house.</span> <span id="s1080">So, all of a sudden, she’s acting as someone’s maid and she’s ironing and she’s-</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: She said to me circumstances dictate what you have to do.</span> <span id="s1082">She took it very stoically.</span> <span id="s1083">She took it very – but, she – I’ve never seen my mother in tears before.</span> <span id="s1084">I’ve never seen my mother in a state of hysteria.</span> <span id="s1085">When my father was arrested, she ran all over the place to her Latvian colleagues who did not raise a finger for my late father.</span> <span id="s1086">Some of the Latvian doctors, I guess you know jealousy, professional jealousy whatever, but nothing unusual.</span> <span id="s1087">They didn’t raise a finger even though it was an issue of life and death.</span> <span id="s1088">She went to the _____ pleading for my father.</span> <span id="s1089">She left no stone unturned, and at a certain point was told by the man who really killed my father that he’ll be released but a wound has to heal, that guy apparently knocked out one of his eyes, and was told that they really needed him because of his specialty, but the wound never healed.</span> <span id="s1090">So, they didn’t want to release him in that condition.</span> <span id="s1091">So, they decided to shoot him instead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: And, that you heard later?</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: That I heard later, but a patient, a Latvian patient of my father’s came with the news that his eye was knocked out.</span> <span id="s1094">He heard it from I guess a Latvian guard in the prison or whatever, and I’ve also heard it from his fellow prison inmates, Jews who were later on liberated or I saw later, what happened to my father because they were eyewitnesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: Do you remember the day your father was arrested or weren’t you home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: He didn’t come home.</span> <span id="s1097">It was toward the end of July 1941, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: So, he was working in the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: He was not working in the hospital at that time, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: Or, he was doing forced labor, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: Yes, but as a doctor, as a doctor he was doing this.</span> <span id="s1102">This was the end of July, and then he was shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: So, how did you understand this as a young child?</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: Horrified, absolutely horrified, and you didn’t – I didn’t understand.</span> <span id="s1105">I didn’t understand why we had to suffer simply because being Jewish.</span> <span id="s1106">I hardly knew what it meant before the war.</span> <span id="s1107">As I said, I knew I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s1108">I knew about Matza, Passover, about certain High Holidays, or when my mother and father fasted, or turning on candles commemorating the dead, et cetera, but otherwise I really did not know much about the significance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: So, there’s no logic here for you.</span> <span id="s1110">I mean, nothing makes-</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: And, even if the-</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: What the logic was I’m suffering because I’m a Jew, but I didn’t understand why I had to suffer because I’m a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1115">Then, how do you understand death and murder?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: I didn’t analyze it.</span> <span id="s1117">I did not, but I remember later on thinking – initially, I did not want to die, but later on after Stalingrad, et cetera, I did not mind.</span> <span id="s1118">I thought myself because I know that the Germans are going to be defeated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: So, you didn’t mind the thought that you might die?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: Yeah, I did no longer mind it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: To see Germany destroyed, that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1125">Because I remember in the severe winter, well – I remember in maybe it’s later it’s been cut now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: No, you have another minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A: I remember it was a very severe winter, 1941-42, where I got frostbite in Libau, frostbite on my toes and my fingers, thinking perhaps if the Germans would win the war, there would no longer be a reason to punish Jews for whatever reason, and things would get better.</span> <span id="s1128">So, for a moment, I even thought, however perverse it may sound today, but as a child, perhaps the Germans should win and then we will be relieved of this misery, of this uncertainty.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: So, confusion reigns in some ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: Confusion reigns, but death was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1132">Okay, think we have to stop now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">End of Tape 4</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Tape 5</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: Okay, George, I understand that you know something about the circumstances under which your father was arrested at the marketplace.</span> <span id="s1136">Am I correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">A: Yes, he went to work to the gathering place in Libau where the Jews were gathered and then the Germans would transport them to their outfits, and he saw the ____ trucks approaching, and he began to make signs to the people on the square, in other words, to disperse, and this was noticed by the SS people, and they beat him up terribly and threw him onto one of the trucks, and he among others were taken to the prison.</span> <span id="s1138">That’s where he continued to be tortured.</span> <span id="s1139">That’s where apparently his eye was knocked out, and apparently he was going around looking for his eye, et cetera, and couldn’t find it, and begged – this is from eye witnesses that we have – begged to be shot, but they kept him alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: Tell me how you remember your mother was during this period.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: She – I’ve never seen her before crying or being hysterical.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: But she was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: She was absolutely hysterical when it happened.</span> <span id="s1144">She would say our ____ our dad, our daddy, how are we going on from here?</span> <span id="s1145">We must do everything possible to rescue him, and she started running around and we still had some hidden diamonds and gold coins so on and so forth, and she bribed some of the Latvian colleagues especially one who used to be a neighbor of ours, Dr. _____, a neighbor of ours when we lived in the – before the Russians came in, in the same.</span> <span id="s1146">There were two apartments to the same floor and he lived in one of them.</span> <span id="s1147">And, he said, “There’s nothing I can do.”</span> <span id="s1148">She went to some other Latvian colleagues.</span> <span id="s1149">They said, “Well, there’s really nothing we can do or help or say.”</span> <span id="s1150">She then went to the ____, but I don’t think she did give anything to the ____ people in terms of gold coins or diamonds, et cetera.</span> <span id="s1151">It would’ve been much too dangerous, and there was this one person who apparently knocked out my father’s eye, Handtke who was tried after World War II in Hamburg where apparently I have the transcripts where this whole issue was brought up.</span> <span id="s1152">He defended himself.</span> <span id="s1153">I don’t remember the details from the transcripts, and he finally said to my mother after several days, “Yes, we’re going to release your husband once the wound” some sort of wound “he has will be healed, but the wound never healed so they decided to shoot him instead.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: And, how long did it take before she found out that he was dead?</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: The first news as I remember, came from a former Latvian patient of my father’s who came to visit us with the news that he had heard, and then also some of the people who were arrested together with him, some of them were released who saw it, and others were also shot relatively speaking at the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: And, did your mother then become very practical about trying to figure out how to help the three of you survive together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: She relied heavily on my older brother who had leadership qualities which she did not really, nor of course I, as a child.</span> <span id="s1158">So, she relied very much on my brother, and together with whatever help I could give, we manipulated the situation to the best of our knowledge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: Your brother is about twenty years old in 1941.</span> <span id="s1160">Am I correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: He was about nineteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: Nineteen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: Nineteen, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: And, your mother, must have been-</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: In ’41, she was born in 1903.</span> <span id="s1166">Thirty, 23, 33, 43 – 38.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: Thirty-eight?</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: Thirty-eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: So, very young woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: Yeah, and she was obviously spoiled from her old home, and my father spoiled her very much.</span> <span id="s1171">So, she was not very street smart or anything of the sort, but it is sometimes the circumstances that forge an individual, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: So, does she now go to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: Yes, was forced to go-</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: Was forced, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: To go to work, and then after working for a while with the Air Force in Libau, - Libau, that’s where the _____ was, the war port, where I occasionally went along.</span> <span id="s1176">Then, she was taken by the former mistress – by the mistress, the then mistress of the head of the Gestapo, this Latvian woman, her name was Mrs. Krohnberg and I was led to understand that after the war, she managed to get to Canada and she died in Canada about ten, fifteen years ago or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: Kronberg</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: Krohnberg, in Latvian I guess it would, the husband would be the Krohnbergs in Latvian it would be Krohnberga, for the woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: Now, is this before the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: This was before the ghetto, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: In Libau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: In Libau.</span> <span id="s1183">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: So, your mother has a couple of jobs, and are you still living in that smaller apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: No, in the meantime, several times we had to move.</span> <span id="s1186">We moved in to one apartment near my school for a short time.</span> <span id="s1187">Let me get the sequence straight.</span> <span id="s1188">Oh, my – we moved into the servant quarters of the Kessel Villa, K-e-s-s-e-l, because my brother married the daughter, but this was already a war marriage, had no legal validity to the best of my knowledge.</span> <span id="s1189">So, the front part was occupied, the main part of the villa was occupied by Mrs. Stein who was Latvian.</span> <span id="s1190">Her husband was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1191">So, she lived there with a daughter, and Mr. Stein, the Kessel’s – the husband was already killed, Mrs. Kessel and her two daughters, and my brother and I and my mother, we lived behind the building what used to be known as the servant’s quarters.</span> <span id="s1192">We lived there for a while until we had to move from there and moved to another quarter which was near my school where we were in three rooms – one, two, three.</span> <span id="s1193">We were one – my brother and his newly acquired wife, myself – we lived, slept in one room.</span> <span id="s1194">My mother slept in another room, another woman – Mrs. Boop slept in a room that was in Mrs. Boop’s apartment.</span> <span id="s1195">Yes, she was killed during the war, and two young women slept in another room.</span> <span id="s1196">So we were about six or seven people in this small apartment of about four or five rooms, excluding the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1197">And, from there, well an announcement came that we will be moved to a ghetto – we’ll have to move to a ghetto which is in a part of Libau, a section of Libau that I did not know very well, and there in the ghetto this was in the summer of ’43, we were assigned to a flat in a basement that had a kind of an outhouse, the toilet was a few steps – we had to go about five or six steps, right off the entrance, rear entrance of the building, and there including the kitchen there were one, two, three rooms.</span> <span id="s1198">So, two rooms and where people could sleep.</span> <span id="s1199">In these two rooms, my brother and his wife, and my mother and I slept, in this basement apartment, and in the other room there were about four people who slept, and we shared the same toilet.</span> <span id="s1200">We shared the bathroom, the bathing facilities, and we made the best of this situation.</span> <span id="s1201">I was working for a while in the ghetto in the garden, vegetable garden, and then I was “asked, invited” to become the commandant’s runner in the Libau ghetto.</span> <span id="s1202">The commandant was not a bad person actually, Kerscher.</span> <span id="s1203">He closed his eyes to many things especially when people brought in some extra food to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1204">He did not make a big deal out of it, but of course, we also managed to give him things that is not only the Schwabs but other people with means before the war who had saved a gold coin here, a diamond there, a fur coat, whatever, gave it to him, and this reminds me even before we moved into the ghetto, there were collections of gold coins.</span> <span id="s1205">This in order to try to release Jews from the prison to bribe the Germans, et cetera.</span> <span id="s1206">So, this was – I remember people coming around for specific arrests that were made and collecting, because we were told if we gathered this and this and this and this, we would be able to get that person out of prison and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s1207">But, this brings me back to before the ghetto, way before the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1208">Immediately after the revolution in 1917, Lenin needed hard currency, and opened up the palaces.</span> <span id="s1209">You could buy everything and anything for very little money.</span> <span id="s1210">And, we had antique – an antique for example living room that came from one of the Czarist palaces.</span> <span id="s1211">We had a chandelier a cobalt with gold chandelier that came from one of the palaces that my grandparents bought and some of it gave to my father as a gift after World War I, immediately, and some that my father bought including some art works from famous Russian artists that he bought when he was serving in Russia, and right after the revolution that he bought and brought it back to Latvia.</span> <span id="s1212">So, in addition to the Persian carpets and the Grand piano, et cetera, this was very exclusive furniture that we had from Czarist palaces including a number of chandeliers.</span> <span id="s1213">I remember two in particular, and all this was taken by the Germans before we came even to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1214">And, not only the German _____, but also the German Navy.</span> <span id="s1215">There was a certain Inspector Ulmann of the German Navy.</span> <span id="s1216">Incidentally, the old – where we lived before World War II, the building that became the headquarters of the Communist Party during World War II became the headquarters of the German Navy for the region, and this Inspector Ulmann came very often to our apartment, and with a crew would take a lot of the things from the apartment, and then of course, we also had people from the ____ coming with their crews to take, and there was one guy from the ____ by the name of Strott, S-t-r-o-t-t, who was a collector of stamps, and my late brother had a huge stamp collection and he traded stamps with all over the world.</span> <span id="s1217">There was actually an exhibition here in Philadelphia in memoriam for my brother, a big stamp collection, where it is all described and I have a photograph with my late mother, still.</span> <span id="s1218">She was already sick and we went to Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s1219">This must have be in 1963, when there was this big exhibition in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s1220">And, he took, and I’m sure he took it for himself because he was an art collector, and then we had to two Leica cameras, one German and one Russian Leica, I remember, and we gave one of them to one of the Latvians who came to the house to look for things.</span> <span id="s1221">I think, and I would have to establish this, I’m not sure, but one of the Latvians was a notorious murderer by the name of Cukurs.</span> <span id="s1222">He had several fingers missing.</span> <span id="s1223">I don’t know how come, but I remember fingers were missing, and for some reason I associate him with the name Cukurs who was a deputy to Arias, the famous Arias, commander of Latvians who killed Jews with a vengeance.</span> <span id="s1224">And, this man with the fingers came and looked for things, and I remember very distinctly my mother giving him one of the Leicas because we had two still hidden in the apartment.</span> <span id="s1225">This is when we were still living in the apartment to which we moved during the Russian period.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: The smaller.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: Yes, the smaller apartment.</span> <span id="s1228">So, these are some of the things that suddenly come back about the furniture so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s1229">Now, how did we get up to this question?</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: You went back from the ghetto, but I would like to stay in this period for a moment, and ask you what was probably a peculiar question.</span> <span id="s1231">Was there anything like a funeral for your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: Nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: No, we never saw him again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: Because you never-</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: Nothing, never saw him, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Q: So, did your mother go into mourning in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: You couldn’t mourn in the sense in those days you would wear black for a whole year, et cetera.</span> <span id="s1239">This you couldn’t do.</span> <span id="s1240">There was no way of doing it.</span> <span id="s1241">You had to go in the morning to work whatever, and then they would come back and in the evening hoping to find me still there, alive, et cetera.</span> <span id="s1242">So-</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: So, there’s really no time for any-</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: Shiva or so on, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: There’s no way to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A: No, I don’t remember – we didn’t even know exactly the date, but this was irrelevant, but I don’t remember a Shiva.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: And, do you remember yourself responding in way like your mother because you lost your father, or did you not understand what it really meant to lose your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: I understood.</span> <span id="s1249">I missed him very much, but I didn’t understand what it meant that he was shot, but then I had some sort of an inkling because when he came home from the cemetery where he identified my cousin that the person was suddenly dead, and my father was arrested.</span> <span id="s1250">What I couldn’t understand is that I’ll never see him again.</span> <span id="s1251">This I do remember, that I may never see him again.</span> <span id="s1252">This I do remember very, very distinctly, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">Q: How did you – was there a notice to go into the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: Yes the bekantmachung</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">Q: And, what is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">A: The bekantmachung means a kind of an announcement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q: So, it was a public announcement?</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A: It was a public announcement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q: Like a poster?</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">A: Yes, yes, by that and that date we had to move in, and then we were assigned the living quarters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: So, do you even as a child begin to feel that your life is getting more and more constricted, or you have no-</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: Oh, yes, not only this, but I was at a certain point coming to this, even going back before the ghetto when we had to wear the yellow star and had to deliver our radios and other things right after the occupation, and we were not permitted to go on the sidewalks as Jews.</span> <span id="s1263">We could only go right off the sidewalk, and I remember it was in the winter, going and a fellow student, a girl, came in my direction.</span> <span id="s1264">We were in the same class, and we walked and I wanted to say hello to her, and it happened to be a girl I fancied as a child.</span> <span id="s1265">Veltina was her name.</span> <span id="s1266">She sort of looked away, and I felt embarrassed that I was a Jew, that I had to wear this and I could not go on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s1267">It was something strange.</span> <span id="s1268">Why should I feel embarrassed?</span> <span id="s1269">But, I remember feeling embarrassed that I am who I am.</span> <span id="s1270">It’s a very strange sensation that I had, just as strange as the same winter when I thought maybe a German victory would be helpful to us.</span> <span id="s1271">Let the Germans win.</span> <span id="s1272">Logical, perhaps for a child, but for an adult, obviously not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: Did you ever say anything to your mother or your brother that you were embarrassed, felt ashamed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: Not in this context, in a different context.</span> <span id="s1275">The children in the ghetto didn’t like to play with me because I didn’t speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1276">I spoke German, and they used to call me kind of a yeke.</span> <span id="s1277">I did not speak it, and I remember going to my mother crying saying, “The children don’t want to play with me because I don’t speak Yiddish”, and I remember my mother saying to me, “George, there’s really nothing I can do about it.</span> <span id="s1278">I don’t speak Yiddish either.</span> <span id="s1279">We have to make the best of the situation.”</span> <span id="s1280">And, it is in this context that I began to acquire Yiddish because this became the lingual _____ the accepted language in camp, et cetera.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A: So, just like I acquired Russian, I acquired a smattering of Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q: The Jews that you are meeting in the ghetto, were they not of your economic class because the Russians had sent out most of the Bourgeois?</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: They didn’t send out most of the Bourgeois.</span> <span id="s1285">They sent out a good number, but I assume, but in those days I didn’t think in terms of classes, et cetera.</span> <span id="s1286">I didn’t think in terms – I didn’t think in these terms, but in retrospect, I would say that they came from a milieu from which I did not come, period.</span> <span id="s1287">I mean, that’s how I would put it now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: And, did that make you feel uncomfortable because they were so dissimilar in terms of background?</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: No, I felt – I felt bad that they would not accept me and at the same time, I was envious because they were stronger than I was.</span> <span id="s1290">They were better athletes than I was.</span> <span id="s1291">In many ways, they were far superior to me.</span> <span id="s1292">So, I was envious actually, and they spoke Yiddish which I did not.</span> <span id="s1293">So, I was envious too.</span> <span id="s1294">But, as a child, you can acquire language very easily.</span> <span id="s1295">So-</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: So, how quickly did you acquire Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: I guess I still probably have a vocabulary of about 150 or 200 words.</span> <span id="s1298">So, I could get by.</span> <span id="s1299">In other words, with my limited vocabulary, I could get by, and but also interesting because the Yiddish we speak in the Baltic countries is different from the Polish Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1300">For example, I’m now the Vice President of the Sholom Aleichem Foundation even though my Yiddish is almost non-existent as is Belle Kaufman’s Yiddish almost non-existent, the granddaughter of Sholom Aleichem, who is still alive at 93 and is our Chairman.</span> <span id="s1301">When we have the annual meetings of the Sholom Aleichem meetings in New York commemorating his death because it’s according to his will, when some of the Yiddish actors read his writings in the Polish Yiddish especially in the _____.</span> <span id="s1302">Yiddish, I don’t understand 95 percent.</span> <span id="s1303">If somebody reads it with a Baltic accent, not an accent, but pronunciation, I understand fifty percent because the Yiddish is more akin to the German.</span> <span id="s1304">To give you just one example, when you say – in German you say ____, in the Baltic Yiddish it would be ___, and in the ____ Yiddish it would be ____.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">Q: So, it’s quite different?</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: Quite different.</span> <span id="s1307">So, I just I have difficulties with this, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: Did you mother learn Yiddish in the ghetto also?</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1310">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1311">This was not a problem for her.</span> <span id="s1312">It was a problem for-</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: For you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: For me, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: I think we need to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">End of Tape 5</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Tape 6</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: George, let me just go way back for a second just so we get a context for your family.</span> <span id="s1319">I assume that your father did not become very wealthy because he was a doctor in Lativa, that there was money in the family before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A: Yes, there was money in the family before, but he also did very well, and I remember my mother telling me that he would come home and take out from his pockets lots of money saying, “You have brought me a lot of luck, Clairehen, Claire.</span> <span id="s1321">Look how well I’m doing in my practice.”</span> <span id="s1322">So, independently of his parents, but my grandfather was a big merchant in the grains – import and export – and, we had at least one warehouse that I was aware of with elevators in front of it, railroad tracks, right at the pier, because he exported a lot to England and elsewhere, but one of my relatives told me that we had another warehouse on the other side of the pier exactly facing it.</span> <span id="s1323">This I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1324">Maybe they sold it very early on, but I only knew of the other one because it was not sold until the late ‘30s, the other one.</span> <span id="s1325">So, maybe the first one they didn’t bother talking about.</span> <span id="s1326">But, I did not know until I heard about it over here that there was a second one.</span> <span id="s1327">Also, to give you a little background, what I found out over here is that when the governor of St. Petersburg came to Libau, he would always come to Libau and play bridge with my grandfather, and they were very good friends, but I would think that the big money came from my grandfather.</span> <span id="s1328">But, my father did very well in his practice, in his practice, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: And, was your mother’s family a well-to-do family also?</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: Not as well-off as my father’s family, but in the six sisters, three brothers, they all went to universities, the three brothers.</span> <span id="s1331">The six sisters all went to gymnasium, and there you had to pay in those days and music conservatory.</span> <span id="s1332">My grandfather owned an upscale delicatessen store, and my mother tells me he brought home the most delicious things everyday from the delicatessen something like ____ in Paris, and my grandmother, the big money apparently came from my grandmother who came from the Russian city of ____ and her maiden name was ______.</span> <span id="s1333">She came from a very, very well-to-do family, and each daughter, and there was a large family, each daughter received a house or a villa as a dowry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: Yeah, so, and she had six sisters and three brothers and all were educated this and that so, you had to have some means in order to do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A: And, in my father’s family, the mother of my cousin over here studied at the University of Geneva in those days before World War I, and Grenoble in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: Interesting.</span> <span id="s1339">It seemed important to get a bit of that background which we didn’t get before.</span> <span id="s1340">Now, let’s go back to this not so great situation in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1341">How did you become a runner for the commandant?</span> <span id="s1342">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A: My German was good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: Clearly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: Yes, it was my native tongue, maybe I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1346">It’s an interpretation.</span> <span id="s1347">Maybe this was one reason why I was “invited” to become his runner.</span> <span id="s1348">A second reason perhaps, it’s my interpretation again is because I came from a certain background.</span> <span id="s1349">I don’t know if this played a role, but in addition to being a runner for him - when I would have to, when I would get a pass that nothing should happen to me while I brng a watch which was repaired in the ghetto to, let’s say to _____ or to SS ______ who was the head of the SS in Libau or to Inspector ____ of the _____.</span> <span id="s1350">So, and I could communicate with the staff over there whatever it is in German.</span> <span id="s1351">Perhaps this is a reason, but again, as I said before, it’s pure speculation and I do not know the facts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">Q: So, the job that you had to be a runner was primarily going from inside the ghetto outside delivering.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">A: And, also keeping count of the inmates.</span> <span id="s1354">When we moved into the ghetto, we had something like 823 people survived out of community of close to 8,000.</span> <span id="s1355">And, when – in the morning when they left, they were given a tag, a metal tag so I had to give them the metal tags as they went out to work in columns, and in the late afternoon, I had to collect these tags and hang them up.</span> <span id="s1356">So, I remember the numbers, and you could see immediately if somebody escaped or what.</span> <span id="s1357">The number, you associated that with a name, and that is how you kept tabs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">Q: And, did you have to write down the person to whom you gave the number?</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">A: No, everyone had his number or her number.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1361">So, that was their number.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: What was this like?</span> <span id="s1364">You were a kid doing this work for this German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: You didn’t think along those lines.</span> <span id="s1366">You thought about how to survive in this milieu.</span> <span id="s1367">At times, we had basketball games arranged.</span> <span id="s1368">There was a school for children which I attended on occasion.</span> <span id="s1369">It didn’t last very long because we were not very long in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1370">But, by and large, there wasn’t much time for self-reflection.</span> <span id="s1371">At least, I do not recollect.</span> <span id="s1372">I do recollect being concerned on how to survive, and under the circumstances, we were still lucky because I had my mother and I had my brother.</span> <span id="s1373">We lost our father, but there were others who had lost more than just a brother and a father, et cetera.</span> <span id="s1374">So, in the circumstances, I – I still felt “good that I had my brother and my mother”.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: And, they, I’m assuming, were also working.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: Working, yes, my mother was working for the ____.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: Oh, that was where she was working for the ____?</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: Yes, and my – well, she was already working for the _____ way back in ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A: But, for a short time between let’s say August and September and October when she was working for the Air Force because when the big action came, she was already working and December was a very big action, she was already working for the mistress because she had the letter from the ____ that we can not be touched.</span> <span id="s1381">____ is what we called...</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: That December of ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: Yeah, ’41, that was December yeah, were thousands were rounded up and killed in ____</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q: So, after that there was about a thousand Jews left, I think, or maybe 900 Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A: Well, when we moved into the ghetto in ’43 there were about 820, yes.</span> <span id="s1386">I remember because I was in charge of the big board with the tags.</span> <span id="s1387">So, I knew how many Jews came into the ghetto and how many-</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">Q: How many?</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">A: Yeah, and who stayed in the ghetto because those who stayed in the ghetto I did not give a tag in the morning.</span> <span id="s1390">So, you could see the people for illness or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1392">How long are you there in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: From the summer of ’43 until – wait a second – no, ’42, summer of ’42 to October ’43 because Yom Kippur was very late that year, and we were shipped to Riga the night of Yom Kippur and there was a song composed by one of the inmates “Yom Kippur Bai Nicht, Als Men Sogt Den Malchet, Gebracht Uns Aher In Kazet”</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">Q: Could you translate that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">A: Yom Kippur Bai Nicht – in the eve of Yom Kipper, when one says the Malchet, the prayer, Gebracht Uns Aher – we were brought to Kaiserwald.</span> <span id="s1396">It’s a very loose translation from Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: When you picture being in the ghetto in that period of time, do you remember whether people who – how were people with each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: I must say that with very few exceptions, they were very civil, very polite, but this was our general upbringing in Libau.</span> <span id="s1399">Later on, I met types I never met before, but in Libau, I had not met types, such types before.</span> <span id="s1400">So, among ourselves, we were very polite.</span> <span id="s1401">We were very well behaved to the best of our ability, and this goes also for the “less fortunate” people because I think that even the less fortunate people before the war, there was a common level of behavior that embraced the, I would say, what I knew of the Jewish community, but as I proven wrong about saying that there were no poor Jews in Latvia, maybe I just didn’t was not in touch with other elements.</span> <span id="s1402">But, after the war and during the war when I spent with many of them from many other levels, I would say that there was very civilized and – under the worse circumstances- civilized and cultured approach to things, to human beings, to fellow human beings, et cetera.</span> <span id="s1403">You rarely heard of a Libau Jew stealing something from another Libau Jew, rarely.</span> <span id="s1404">There were exceptions, and they were caught ant they were punished.</span> <span id="s1405">This even went on later when we were in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1406">Among ourselves we were very civil, and it didn’t matter whether – from which class you came.</span> <span id="s1407">At least, I had not encountered this, and I’m speaking now - strictly speaking from my perspective.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: And, the____ in the ghetto in Libau, did you know those people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A: Yes, Mr. Israelit and Mr. Kaganski who was an attorney.</span> <span id="s1410">I told you the woman in California who should be interviewed, his wife.</span> <span id="s1411">Yes, I knew them.</span> <span id="s1412">Mr. Israelit, he was a banker before World War II.</span> <span id="s1413">He spoke broken German, but was a very nice man.</span> <span id="s1414">I knew his daughter.</span> <span id="s1415">She was a classmate of my brother’s in the Jewish gymnasium.</span> <span id="s1416">I knew other members of the family, very dignified family.</span> <span id="s1417">He was the number one person, and the number two person was this Mr. Kaganski, highly educated, very cultured, spoke a very, very good German, very handsome man.</span> <span id="s1418">We had no problems with our leadership, and I hadn’t heard major complaints about them from any of the ghetto inmates.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: Was there Jewish police also?</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: There was a kind of a Jewish police, but of course they didn’t have weapons or anything of the sort, and it was, I believe, this Jewish police had caught two thieves stealing things from the store in the ghetto, some bread or so, and they were incarcerated, and I just don’t remember know what their fate was.</span> <span id="s1421">I believe they were shot for what they had done.</span> <span id="s1422">But, this was such a rare exception.</span> <span id="s1423">It was an exception that this should happen among us Libau Jews.</span> <span id="s1424">This was sort of almost unheard of.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: And, what rumors are you hearing about what’s going on?</span> <span id="s1426">Through 1942, there’s a huge number of Jews between ’41 and the end of ’42 that are killed that are massacred.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">A: Yes, we heard vague stories, but we did not know details, but what we did know, there were technicians among the former Libau Jews who were technicians already then, and they managed some way or other to construct a radio.</span> <span id="s1428">So, we knew what was going on in the world.</span> <span id="s1429">We heard about the German defeats at the front, which was wonderful news to us and gave us inspiration, and when we didn’t hear good news or anything, we used to talk about the _____ one says rumors.</span> <span id="s1430">Rumors about his, et cetera.</span> <span id="s1431">What are your source?</span> <span id="s1432">______ agency ____________ says it’s a rumor, but it was known as _________________.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q: So, were you under the impression, were people under the impression between these rumors that one says ant the radio reports that the Nazis were going to lose soon?</span> <span id="s1434">Was that-</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: Not soon, but that they were going to lose.</span> <span id="s1436">This was a foregone conclusion after especially Stalingrad, after January ’42, and then of course, we heard about the famous Battle of Kursk a tank battle which was later where the Germans were decisively defeated.</span> <span id="s1437">And, of course in Stalingrad where the German Field Marshal gave up, surrendered with something like 90,000 troops.</span> <span id="s1438">This was vitamins to us, really.</span> <span id="s1439">I mean we couldn’t have been happier.</span> <span id="s1440">And, then we also heard about some British general that was Montgomery chasing the Germans all over Africa until they were thrown out of Africa.</span> <span id="s1441">This, of course, was very good news, and that the Germans were having – were being beaten not only in the Stalingrad front, but in many parts of the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q: So, tell me how you remember who you were?</span> <span id="s1443">You’re ten, eleven years old, in 1943 you’re twelve, right?</span> <span id="s1444">Because you were born in 1931.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">A: Yeah, but I was born late.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: Late.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: Yes, so eleven and a half or so, something to that effect.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: So, are you more grown up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A: Well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">Q: Because, you’re still a kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">A: I’m still a kid.</span> <span id="s1452">The fact that I didn’t have to study was- (laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q: I know.</span> <span id="s1454">(laughs) You thought this was a great-</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">A: This was a great boom.</span> <span id="s1456">What did I feel?</span> <span id="s1457">The essential thing in ’42-’43 when we were in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1458">It was a, relatively speaking, stable period.</span> <span id="s1459">We came in 800 some odd people, and we were taken to the concentration camp, roughly the same number.</span> <span id="s1460">So, there were few killings between the period between the time we got into the ghetto and went to Riga Kaiserwald to the concentration camp, but it was still the fear everyday.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: You don’t know what to expect, and you always had to be on the lookout, and incidentally, something very interesting.</span> <span id="s1463">Across the street from one of the streets in the ghetto, you had buildings where there were lots and lots of Russian POWs, and they were begging for bread.</span> <span id="s1464">They had it much worse than we, and we were able to throw them some bread because in the ghetto we still did not really starve.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">Q: I was going to ask you that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">A: Yes, we really did not, at least, I don’t think we starved, no because from with our Latvian people, we could deal for this.</span> <span id="s1467">We could get that, and we still had a diamond here, a dollar there, so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s1468">We could still do business, so to speak.</span> <span id="s1469">We could still bring in.</span> <span id="s1470">So, I do not really remember starving.</span> <span id="s1471">That we had our pre-World War food obviously is not the case or even the food that we had during the Russian period, but we had enough bread.</span> <span id="s1472">We had some butter.</span> <span id="s1473">We had sometimes a piece of salami.</span> <span id="s1474">We had even sometimes I got hot chocolate.</span> <span id="s1475">So, I don’t remember starving in the ghetto, let’s put it this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: But, you remember these Russian POWs starving.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">A: Yes, and how we threw bread over the fence.</span> <span id="s1478">Yes, I do this.</span> <span id="s1479">I do remember this very distinctly, yes.</span> <span id="s1480">They were much, much worse off than we were at this particular moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Q: And, do you feel as if you lost your childhood, that you respond in some more adult way because you had no opportunity to really be a child except perhaps playing some games?</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: I didn’t think in these terms that I’ve lost my childhood.</span> <span id="s1483">At that age, I don’t think that you think along these lines, but what is interesting, I think, and I often think about it, how I survived because later on I had to witness hangings so on and so forth because I’ve never really seen anybody hang, but this goes to late ’44 early ’45 in Stolp _________.</span> <span id="s1484">To me, this was a kind of theater.</span> <span id="s1485">I was observing.</span> <span id="s1486">I was living.</span> <span id="s1487">If I were to put in today’s terms, I was – I was an actor in a theater.</span> <span id="s1488">I was living something which was not real, and yet it was very real.</span> <span id="s1489">I was an actor, and at the same time, I felt that I was a spectator, and whatever was going on was interesting to me for better or for worse.</span> <span id="s1490">It was something of an experience – warped in today’s terms, I would say yes, but again from a child who is ten, eleven, twelve, et cetera, it’s a different because – but, this was really my personality before the war.</span> <span id="s1491">Everything seemed to interest me except school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: I don’t know if I answered your question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: No, it’s an interesting answer because there’s some ways in which that may account for how good your memory is because you’re observing so much-</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Q: And so hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">Q: And, it’s a kind of schizophrenia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">A: Oh, I wouldn’t be myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q: I don’t mean in mental illness terms.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">Q: But, a kind of distance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">Q: Do you think your mother and brother was doing the same thing or wouldn’t you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">A: I really couldn’t answer because I just don’t know.</span> <span id="s1506">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">Q: Because, I’m just trying to get, you know, it’s – it’s interesting to try to figure out who you really – I mean, I can’t see who you were at the age of ten looking at you now, you know, as you speak.</span> <span id="s1508">So, trying to get a sense of what a little boy is doing in a circumstance like that is – Man: George, ______ your microphone is ______.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">Q: I, sorry...</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">Man: I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s1511">I couldn’t hear what you were saying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">Q: Ok.</span> <span id="s1513">You couldn’t hear what I was saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">Man: It was coming out, but it was-</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">Man: __________</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: I was saying...now I don’t remember what I was saying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">Man: Sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">A: What a ten year old child-</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">Q: With a ten year old child, it’s difficult to visualize a ten year old child, and to try to figure out who he is in those moments, and it must be difficult for you to even explain it, but I think-</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">A: It is difficult, but to me it was a big spectacle that in a strange, I would say today, in a warped way was interesting to observe, and at the same time, I was part of the action that is part of the theater, watching out, when will I be next to be shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q: And, you did think that, “When will I be next?”</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">A: Yeah, because everyone thought so, “what will the next day bring?”</span> <span id="s1524">“What will the next minute bring?”</span> <span id="s1525">yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">Q: So, in those circumstances you slept okay, too.</span> <span id="s1527">You didn’t have nightmares.</span> <span id="s1528">You didn’t have-</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">A: No, I did not begin to have nightmares until after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">A: I don’t remember-</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">Q: When it was safer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">Q: When it was safer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">A: When it was safer, yes.</span> <span id="s1536">I don’t remember having nightmares in the Libau ghetto, no</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">Q: And, when you were going – when the Libau ghetto was then liquidated and you were then sent to Kaiserwald, everybody went, the 800 some odd people went, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">A: Some people escaped from the ghetto, and were hidden by Latvians who we call now the Righteous Gentiles, and most of them survived the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1541">Most of the others were sent to the Riga concentration camp, Yom Kippur at night, 1943, and we were taken to the cargo terminal and in cattle cars we were shoved in and interestingly, we were told we were going to Riga.</span> <span id="s1542">And, Riga just rang a bell, something clicked.</span> <span id="s1543">I loved Riga before the war.</span> <span id="s1544">The ____ the commotion in Riga, it was a big city for me in contrast to Libau which was sort of a sleepy, smaller city of some 70,000 inhabitants.</span> <span id="s1545">Riga at that time had close to half a million people.</span> <span id="s1546">It was the city of my dreams as a child.</span> <span id="s1547">So, I imagined Riga when I was being transported, I was thinking of the Riga beaches, the summers we spent there.</span> <span id="s1548">I was thinking of my aunt’s apartment, the parties.</span> <span id="s1549">I was thinking of the cafes, of the Riga Zoo, wonderful, wonderful memories.</span> <span id="s1550">And, then we were told we were coming to Kaiserwald.</span> <span id="s1551">Kaiserwald was the most exclusive suburb in Riga at this time.</span> <span id="s1552">Kaiserwald means the Forest of the Kaiser.</span> <span id="s1553">And, one of my aunts and my granddad had a beautiful villa there, Kaiserwald, gorgeous.</span> <span id="s1554">So, I thought, “Kaiserwald, well, who knows?”</span> <span id="s1555">et cetera.</span> <span id="s1556">In a sense, I mean, obviously here we were in a cattle car, and at the same time I was daydreaming about the beautiful life that I lived in Riga.</span> <span id="s1557">(laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A: Which is very strange, but I remember this very, very distinctly, and looking forward to going to Riga.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">Q: We have to stop the tape.</span> <span id="s1561">Is it okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">End of Tape 6</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Tape 7</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">Q: George, can you tell us what it was that you brought with you?</span> <span id="s1565">Did you have luggage?</span> <span id="s1566">Did you have special clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">A: We were told that we could take with us what we could carry.</span> <span id="s1568">So, I still – we still had our pre-war clothes.</span> <span id="s1569">We were dressed warmly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">Q: Was it cold?</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">A: October, it was beginning to get cold, yes.</span> <span id="s1572">So, we were always prepared.</span> <span id="s1573">I remember mother saying it’s better warmer because we could always take off.</span> <span id="s1574">So, we were very warmly dressed.</span> <span id="s1575">We each had a suitcase and some other things so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s1576">So, we were transported, and I remember we arrived in Riga.</span> <span id="s1577">It was still dark, probably very early in the morning next day.</span> <span id="s1578">Suddenly, the doors were slid open.</span> <span id="s1579">SS men beginning to scream and also some of the non-Jewish prisoners in very strange garb, namely in concentration camp garb screaming, “Out, out with you dirty Jews, out!”</span> <span id="s1580">And, beating us, beating us like crazy, and then we had to run from – which wasn’t very far, maybe fifty or sixty yards – to the camp from the railroad track.</span> <span id="s1581">And, there we were told to throw all the luggage and to take off the coat, and throw it on a pile, and my mother didn’t want to do it, and I remember saying to my mother, “But, mother we’re told that we’re going to get it back.</span> <span id="s1582">So, let’s put it there.”</span> <span id="s1583">What do you expect of an eleven year old kid?</span> <span id="s1584">That’s what we were told, and I believed.</span> <span id="s1585">So, reluctantly, my mother and my brother also took off the coat, and inside of course, were diamonds and some gold coins whatever.</span> <span id="s1586">And, needless to say, we never saw the coats again.</span> <span id="s1587">Then we were chased into a barrack, and next day, we were “deloused” but we didn’t have any lice in Libau, and we went through a shower, and coming out of the shower, we no longer had our old clothes.</span> <span id="s1588">We were given new clothes that didn’t fit me.</span> <span id="s1589">I got a coat that came down to here.</span> <span id="s1590">I received some wooden shoes.</span> <span id="s1591">What do they call them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: Clogs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">A: Clogs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">Q: Wooden clogs, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: Clogs, some sort of a shirt, et cetera - not as yet concentration camp garb.</span> <span id="s1596">And, everything was quick, quick, and you had these especially some Polish and also very notorious German criminal _____, some of the Polish criminals, _____, beating us together with the Germans beating us to run here and there, and then we were directed to a certain barrack where we’re going to sleep now.</span> <span id="s1597">I’d never seen before bunk beds with straw mattresses and straw pillow, and at night I remember, the straw would come out and it was very – there were no sheets or anything of the sort, a kind of a blanket even in the winter.</span> <span id="s1598">It was very cold which as an ordeal especially for me who – for everyone who had not experienced anything of the sort because until then, let’s put it this way, in comparison to the Libau ghetto, Riga was – Riga Kaiserwald was hell, and the Libau ghetto was, in comparison, paradise.</span> <span id="s1599">The beatings, the screamings, Appel, for the first time I heard the word Appel, the count, in the morning, and to make sure that I look older, et cetera, at the count, I always scratched together the sand and stood on my toes to be taller than usual.</span> <span id="s1600">So, and I was a little bit taller than the rest of the kids in my age group.</span> <span id="s1601">That was probably one of the reasons why I was not immediately selected for being shot.</span> <span id="s1602">My brother after a few days was taken to a kaisernierung, to a camp outside the camp where he worked in their reichsbarn which had happened to be a very good kaisernierung.</span> <span id="s1603">The people were treated relatively well.</span> <span id="s1604">My mother was assigned to a job in the concentration camp, in the tanklager, and sometimes she managed to convince, I don’t know how that I go with her to the tanklager, not to remain in camp because if you remain in camp you never know what can happen.</span> <span id="s1605">There were safer days.</span> <span id="s1606">There were less safer days.</span> <span id="s1607">It was a very, very severe winter, the winter of ’43 again in ’44, and we were working on this tanklager again, in constructing railroad trucks, and there were a lot of the-</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">Q: Railroad tracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">A: Yes, railroad tracks, sorry, tracks because it was – you had a lot of gasoline storage et cetera, and trains came in where you loaded the gasoline, et cetera, for the Air Force, for the Navy et cetera, and so it was a storage, a dump, and also part of the tanklager was also a repair shop for German cars or whatever, but I was working a lot outside building and repairing of the tracks, railroad tracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: Is this when you were still in Kaiserwald or when you joined your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: No, that’s still in Kaiserwald.</span> <span id="s1612">I did not join my brother until probably it was, must have been November or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">Q: The following-</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">A: Well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">Q: Oh no-</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">A: A month or two months later, or maybe even three months later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">Q: Let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s1618">When you get into the camp, are you separated from your brother and your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">A: I was together with my brother for the first three days until he was taken to this kaisernierung and I was alone.</span> <span id="s1620">My mother was on the woman’s side, and there was a fence between the woman’s camp, but I could see my mother almost anytime – in the morning before work or when she would come back because you could see the women’s camp.</span> <span id="s1621">It was just – the distance was like from here to the camera.</span> <span id="s1622">So, it’s just a few feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">Q: Did you talk to each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">A: Oh, across the fence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q: And that was okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">A: That was okay.</span> <span id="s1627">In the mornings, I remember I was starved all ready, but I didn’t suffer all that much from hunger, but I remember I would say to my mother, “Momika, I’m so hungry.”</span> <span id="s1628">So, she would give me her portion.</span> <span id="s1629">I said, “But, did you eat?”</span> <span id="s1630">“Yes, yes, I am full.”</span> <span id="s1631">She would say, but she was not, but she threw me her portion because in the mornings we would receive moldy bread, some sugar, some kind of a marmalade, and this was very bad because – this was bad because we all got diarrhea from it, and a kind of a coffee that didn’t taste like coffee at least to me as a child.</span> <span id="s1632">It was terrible, but it wasn’t enough for me.</span> <span id="s1633">So, I asked my mother, and she very often was able to throw me her portion, and I ate, and I remember at that time, there was a Mr. Kaufman who was a friend from before the war.</span> <span id="s1634">And, I went to him and I said to him in German, “Mr. Kaufman, do you happen to have a slice of bread?</span> <span id="s1635">I’m very, very hungry.”</span> <span id="s1636">He said to me, “George, I wish I had I could give you, but I don’t.”</span> <span id="s1637">And, I’ll never forget this.</span> <span id="s1638">He died in New York.</span> <span id="s1639">He was the first chairman of the Jewish Survivors of Latvia, and he always remembered this, and I remember this particular incident as well.</span> <span id="s1640">But, it was done still.</span> <span id="s1641">It was still Herr Kaufman, Mr. Kaufman that I addressed him.</span> <span id="s1642">It was not Max or sort of the way we’re accustomed to here.</span> <span id="s1643">Yes, and then, interestingly enough in this Tanklager, which was a tough place, there was a German guard by the name of Hoffmann, the beast par excellence, beat the Jews like anything.</span> <span id="s1644">He came I think from Romania or some place from that area, but he liked my mother, and would always address her as Frau Dr. Schwab, and when he was patrolling, he would say, “You can go into this shack” where there was a stove and what we confiscated.</span> <span id="s1645">We used to call it organizier, we organized something.</span> <span id="s1646">We stole something – potatoes so we could slice and put it against the oven and roast potatoes.</span> <span id="s1647">That became a delicacy.</span> <span id="s1648">So, and he permitted me to go with my mother.</span> <span id="s1649">So, we could go in.</span> <span id="s1650">We could warm-up, et cetera.</span> <span id="s1651">We would have our potato so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s1652">One day, we were marching toward the Tanklager again in the winter, and my mother told me she had a terrible case of diarrhea and she doesn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s1653">_____ in German.</span> <span id="s1654">She went over to him and said, “I really have to step out.”</span> <span id="s1655">He said, “Go ahead.”</span> <span id="s1656">He slowed down the column, permitted my mother to attend to what she had, and then she rejoined the column.</span> <span id="s1657">Why did he do it?</span> <span id="s1658">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1659">My mother was gold blonde, very fair skinned, bluish-grey eyes, looked like a thousand Aryans.</span> <span id="s1660">Actually, she was told and that was still going back now in Libau, if she wanted to be saved to be taken to Germany, she could be saved.</span> <span id="s1661">She said, “I’ll be delighted if I can bring my sons with me.”</span> <span id="s1662">They said, “No, you can not.”</span> <span id="s1663">Then, she said, “Then I stay with my sons.”</span> <span id="s1664">And, that was still in Libau, because they distinguished sometimes the genotype from the phenotype, genetically Jewish versus the appearance, and if your appearance was “Aryan” especially Nordic, which my mother was, then you could manipulate, but she was actually asked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">Q: She was asked?</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">A: Yeah, and there are other incidents like this after the war, immediately where people in Berlin did not think that she was Jewish because the way she looked when she came to look for me, but maybe when we go into this, we can discuss it later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">Q: Now, is your brother living in this outer camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">A: Yes, he was living in this outer camp, and sometimes there was communication and you could ____ had little pieces of paper or whatever, and you could communicate.</span> <span id="s1669">And, he communicated with my mother that it is possible to bribe the commandant Kohler of the reichsbahn where my brother was at to bring her and me to the reichsbahn, and my mother said yes she is going to send for some gold coins and fur coats.</span> <span id="s1670">It was something in because certain of the things we managed to give to a Latvian patient of my father’s who was a head of a bank by the name of Abelit.</span> <span id="s1671">His name was Abelit, and he did come through, this Abelit, and sent the things to Kohler and Kohler instructed my brother to get a message to me that I should be in the camp on those three days and he will send a car for me.</span> <span id="s1672">And, indeed, but not for my mother, but for me.</span> <span id="s1673">And, my mother said, “Absolutely you go.</span> <span id="s1674">It’s ___ and don’t worry about me.</span> <span id="s1675">I’ll be all right.”</span> <span id="s1676">So, I went and joined my brother, but I was not the only one in the car.</span> <span id="s1677">There was apparently a few more who had similar deals because he could be bribed.</span> <span id="s1678">He was one who could be bribed.</span> <span id="s1679">And, then my mother, we learned later, also went to an out camp to work camp called the SS ________, the SS vegetable garden for the SS et cetera.</span> <span id="s1680">So, that’s where she was, and then I saw my mother very briefly.</span> <span id="s1681">We had word that she would passing the reichsbahn.</span> <span id="s1682">I don’t know how we got the word, through whom, but that at that time was a convoy that we should be at the gate or whatever, and we actually saw our mother for maybe two minutes.</span> <span id="s1683">We were just able to-</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">Q: And, did she see you as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">Q: She did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1688">When I came to the reichsbahn it was in comparison to Kaiserwald, paradise.</span> <span id="s1689">The food was slightly better, no beatings.</span> <span id="s1690">I had an attack, I suffered appendicitis.</span> <span id="s1691">I was there in the camp hospital for a couple of days until I got better.</span> <span id="s1692">Incidentally, I was also in the Kaiserwald, had an attack there.</span> <span id="s1693">And, a colleague of my father’s, Dr. Sik in Libau was the head of the hospital over there.</span> <span id="s1694">He said, “George, I’ll take you into the hospital.”</span> <span id="s1695">And, he kept me there.</span> <span id="s1696">On the third day, he said, “George, you better disappear because there’s going to be inspection today and we don’t know what can happen.</span> <span id="s1697">Do the best you can.</span> <span id="s1698">Nothing is going to happen to you.</span> <span id="s1699">Try not to work too hard or bend too hard.”</span> <span id="s1700">And, I left, and sure enough some of the sick ones were taken away and shot.</span> <span id="s1701">But, the reichsbahn in comparison was not all that bad, food-wise.</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">Q: Who ran it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">A: It was run by the German reichsbahn, railroad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q: So, they-</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">A: And, the commandant, you could – you could talk to him.</span> <span id="s1706">He could also scream.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">Q: You could scream?</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">A: He could scream.</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">Q: He could scream.</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">A: He could scream, yes, but by and large, I don’t remember major beatings or so, for example in the Kaiserwald, I remember having received once a smack in my face from the commandant Oberstrumbahnfuhrer Sauer.</span> <span id="s1711">I saw stars in front of me.</span> <span id="s1712">I was supposed to clear the snow from the walkway, and I perhaps didn’t do it as quickly.</span> <span id="s1713">So, he came out and said to me, “Hey, you Jew boy, why aren’t you working?”</span> <span id="s1714">I said, “I’m working,” And, he slapped me.</span> <span id="s1715">I fell maybe ten feet away from the slap, and I just stars in front of my eyes.</span> <span id="s1716">This did not – was not the case in the reichsbahn, and in the reichsbahn what was my task, I began to “help my brother” he was an auto electrician.</span> <span id="s1717">He knew about a car electrician as much as I know about the Chinese language, and I was his assistant, and what we did, what we all did for example when we had to screw in something, we would screw it in not all the way.</span> <span id="s1718">It was our way of, “sabotaging” the German war effort.</span> <span id="s1719">We would always try to do things not a hundred percent, eighty percent.</span> <span id="s1720">Hopefully, something will go wrong.</span> <span id="s1721">But, when an SS man would come, and inspect, go around the big halls and inspect somebody would scream out ______, ________ meant six.</span> <span id="s1722">For some reason, I don’t know why six which meant inspector be careful.</span> <span id="s1723">So, we all immediately-</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">Q: Got very serious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">A: -got very seriously this and that running around, ______ this was a code word.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">Q: Did anybody ever get caught for not doing things right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">A: I don’t remember this.</span> <span id="s1728">I don’t remember this, and then we had a wonderful Jewish couple, German Jewish couple who were working there too, and he and his wife were the elders of this kasernierung Steinhart, Edith Steinhart.</span> <span id="s1729">I forget his first name.</span> <span id="s1730">They were lovely, lovely people, and they were so to speak belonged to the German Jewish group in the camp, but were very good towards us.</span> <span id="s1731">There was a couple from Vienna, lovely people, Maier was their name.</span> <span id="s1732">Mr. and Mrs. Maier I remember, lovely, lovely people from Vienna.</span> <span id="s1733">There were two German Jewish couples who were a little bit on the rough side, who became much rougher in Stolp, more to say about it.</span> <span id="s1734">So, one was Kentcourik from Lubek the other was Grunwald, or Greenwald also from Germany, but I don’t remember from what part of Germany.</span> <span id="s1735">And suddenly, we knew that the Russians were advancing in the direction of Riga in the late spring of 1944.</span> <span id="s1736">Suddenly, we come to the camp, return from our work which was only may about 200 yards from where we were living, and that we all had to appear at an ______.</span> <span id="s1737">That was in July 1944, and there was this SS doctor from the camp, Krebsbach and his deputy, Wisner and Kohler standing and we’re in this large hall and we were told to get undressed, get in line, and then there was a selection – left, right, left, right, left, right.</span> <span id="s1738">My brother was sent to the left, and I was sent to the right.</span> <span id="s1739">But, my brother said, “Don’t worry, Kohler is there.</span> <span id="s1740">He knows what we have done.”</span> <span id="s1741">So on and so forth, “we can do more, don’t worry.”</span> <span id="s1742">My brother was sent to the left.</span> <span id="s1743">I was sent to the right, and I never saw my brother again.</span> <span id="s1744">My mother saw him still in Kaiserwald, and knew that he would be shot, and he said to my mother, “Don’t worry mother.</span> <span id="s1745">We’re going to take some of the Germans and Latvians, our shooters with us.”</span> <span id="s1746">My mother felt that she could have rescued him and begged him to come to the fence, but he wouldn’t come.</span> <span id="s1747">He didn’t want to upset my mother.</span> <span id="s1748">So, he didn’t come to the fence to see her again, and that was the last we heard of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">Q: So, he was sent back to Kaiserwald, and then they were going to shoot them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">A: Yes, and then from Kaiserwald, they were taken the Rumbala forest where they were killed, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">Q: Shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">A: Yes, but it must have been at the very end of July or the very beginning of August, 1944.</span> <span id="s1753">The ones who survived, I came back to the barracks, we came back to the barracks, and I kept on – my brother was sleeping in the bunk bed next to mine.</span> <span id="s1754">I said, “Bubbi, Bubbi, where are you?</span> <span id="s1755">Bubbi, Bubbi, where are you?”</span> <span id="s1756">And, I had a hunch that this was it.</span> <span id="s1757">That I wouldn’t see him again, and he was taken probably to be shot, and I was alone now.</span> <span id="s1758">It was at this stage that Julius Goldberg, who was in the same barrack, et cetera, he said, “George, I’ll take care of you.</span> <span id="s1759">For as long as I will live, you will live.”</span> <span id="s1760">And, Julius Goldberg was strong like an ox, very athletic, a yachtsman before the war, very handsome fellow, at that time probably in his late 20s I would think.</span> <span id="s1761">But, he slept over there, and I slept over here, and fine.</span> <span id="s1762">A week later, we were taken to a ship.</span> <span id="s1763">We were being evacuated because the Russians were coming close.</span> <span id="s1764">We were being evacuated, boarded the ship.</span> <span id="s1765">That’s when we were taken to Stutthof in August 1944.</span> <span id="s1766">And, it was a, I guess a troop carrier, what, I don’t remember what it was before the war.</span> <span id="s1767">Maybe it was a liner or so, but at that stage of the game there were bunks all over the place, troop carrier, I guess.</span> <span id="s1768">It was full of concentration camp inmates.</span> <span id="s1769">So, I was looking.</span> <span id="s1770">Maybe I would see Bubi.</span> <span id="s1771">Maybe I would see my mother.</span> <span id="s1772">And, we already had concentration camp garb by that-</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">Q: You mean striped uniforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">A: Striped uniforms, and I was looking up, and a woman was looking down without hair.</span> <span id="s1775">I didn’t know who it was without hair, and suddenly I heard a familiar voice saying, “Georgenka.”</span> <span id="s1776">My mother’s voice.</span> <span id="s1777">She was looking down.</span> <span id="s1778">She was without hair.</span> <span id="s1779">They had taken her and shaved her hair, and there was my mother.</span> <span id="s1780">So, for the next three days we could see each other on the ship, and the interesting thing is that while we were going through the bay of Riga, the Russians were shooting at the ship, but missing us by a hundred or two hundred yards, and we just sailed through it, and the artillery shells would fall, go over the ship, fall on the other side maybe a couple of hundred yards from it, and we finally arrived near Danzig.</span> <span id="s1781">We were put on the little railroad cars.</span> <span id="s1782">What do they call them?</span> <span id="s1783">The schmalspurbahn, the German.</span> <span id="s1784">It’s not the regular, it’s-</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">Q: Were they half cars?</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">A: Half cars, and not as wide.</span> <span id="s1787">The railroad tracks were not as wide – lorries, kind of lorries, it’s almost a sort of a choo-choo train, et cetera.</span> <span id="s1788">So, we were transported to Stutthof in August.</span> <span id="s1789">That was Kaiserwald, however bad it was, was paradise in comparison to Stutthof.</span> <span id="s1790">We were beaten.</span> <span id="s1791">We had to work also on the railroad tracks over there, not far from the gas chamber and crematorium we saw.</span> <span id="s1792">We already knew what it was.</span> <span id="s1793">The chimney burning all the time, burning the bodies.</span> <span id="s1794">So, we knew and the issue was how to survive there.</span> <span id="s1795">Food was almost non-existent.</span> <span id="s1796">We were all emaciated.</span> <span id="s1797">We were all starving, but and I no longer saw my mother.</span> <span id="s1798">I no longer saw my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">Q: I’m afraid we have to stop there and change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">End of Tape 7</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">Tape 8</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">Q: George, we ended with your saying that you no longer were able to see your mother and coming into Stutthof, the Kaiserwald was paradise in comparison with Stutthof.</span> <span id="s1803">So, could you explain what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">A: Well, the beatings were almost non-stop now.</span> <span id="s1805">The food was even worse than in Kaiserwald.</span> <span id="s1806">When we worked on the tracks, we were beaten all the time by the Germans and by the non-Jewish couples, even though I learned what a louse means in Kaiserwald, and began the practice of delousing myself – the hair and over here and so call in the garb that we had.</span> <span id="s1807">Now, we were full of lice in Stutthof.</span> <span id="s1808">The facilities were terrible.</span> <span id="s1809">Sanitary facilities in Kaiserwald were also bad.</span> <span id="s1810">For example, the toilet was a kind of an outhouse.</span> <span id="s1811">It was a square pit, and was – on top of this what was constructed were columns.</span> <span id="s1812">Columns was a wooden “bench” maybe six or eight inches and you would have to lift yourself up, that I never fell into the pit was a miracle, and incidentally, there were some kapos that were so bad that they were thrown into the pit by the Jews, non-Jewish couples.</span> <span id="s1813">But, in Stutthof it all over shadowed Kaiserwald from every point of view, especially the beatings.</span> <span id="s1814">Now, the interesting part was that the reichsbahn requested that the same people be spent to Stolp.</span> <span id="s1815">So, I was part of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">Q: So, you got out of -</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">A: I got of Stutthof.</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">Q: Let me ask you something, George, when you say – what were they beating you with?</span> <span id="s1819">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">A: First of all, they would slap you, but then they also had whips – whips.</span> <span id="s1821">They would beat you like you would beat a wild horse when you want them to run or something to that effect.</span> <span id="s1822">It didn’t matter if you were young or old, et cetera, and the infirm were immediately taken after the appel to be shot, cremated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">Q: And, how were you strong enough to withstand this kind of treatment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">A: I always made myself older, and I always made myself taller, and this was street smartness in a sense.</span> <span id="s1825">Now, why was my brother taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">Q: And, not you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">A: And, not me.</span> <span id="s1828">Again, I resorted to the same tactic, but my brother used eyeglasses, and anybody who needed eye et cetera was already concerned infirmed, which we did not know, or he would’ve hidden the eyeglasses.</span> <span id="s1829">So, he was taken.</span> <span id="s1830">I did not need eyeglasses.</span> <span id="s1831">Yes, I was emaciated, but everyone was emaciated, and however much I suffered from hunger pains, I suffered less than others because my father as a gastroenterologist, et cetera never permitted us to eat huge portions of anything, never permitted us too much, too many of the fatty things.</span> <span id="s1832">In between meals, we could have a fruit or something.</span> <span id="s1833">He was strict about that – a fruit or so, but no _______ as we would call it, maybe a piece of this or that, et cetera nothing.</span> <span id="s1834">A meal is a meal.</span> <span id="s1835">That’s when we can eat, but everything in moderate proportion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">Q: So, this was helpful to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">A: This was very helpful because I could never gorge myself with food, because many of the people and that’s what I first learned – poor people gorge themselves very often believing that they had to put on layers of fat that would protect them from the natural – from the winters or whatever, and this I only learned subsequently.</span> <span id="s1838">I was not conscious of it before the war, but only after the war people talked about the food habits in the camps, and those were my habits.</span> <span id="s1839">However hungry I was, as I said before, I was not that hungry.</span> <span id="s1840">The day of liberation, as I’ll tell you a little later, I mistook soap for bread and I started to eat soap, but this was already on the day of liberation which is still to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">Q: So, are you in Stutthof for like a month, two months?</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">Q: Not even that long?</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">A: Not even that long, probably not more than ten days or so the first time around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">Q: Now, you turn 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">A: I turned-</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">Q: In 19-</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">A: Later on, I guess in 19- wait a second.</span> <span id="s1849">I had a birthday I remember, and this was in 1944, was I 13 in 1944?</span> <span id="s1850">I guess so, but this was in November, much later.</span> <span id="s1851">I was still now 12 in Stutthof.</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">Q: So, when is there this sort of semi-Bar Mitzvah party?</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">A: That was in – that was later.</span> <span id="s1854">That was in November.</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">Q: In 19-</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">A: ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">Q: 1944.</span> <span id="s1858">So, we’re still in 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">A: Yes, we’re still in 1944, in August, 1944.</span> <span id="s1860">And, suddenly we were transported from Stutthof to Stolp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">A: In passenger cars, railroad cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">Q: Passenger cars?</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">A: Yes, and the feeling was that the Nazis didn’t want to show to their own people that you transport prisoners – this was our interpretation – prisoners in cattle cars.</span> <span id="s1865">That was our interpretation.</span> <span id="s1866">Whether this is true or not, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1867">And, that turned out to be a work camp, living right on the premises in the reichsbahn right near the railroad, the main railroad station there.</span> <span id="s1868">There I became a carpenter, and I know as much about carpentry as I know about Chinese hieroglyphics.</span> <span id="s1869">That I didn’t chop off a finger or something or other is still one of those miracles because I have no sense for these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">Q: So, what was your job?</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">A: Helping to repair cattle cars, transportation, et cetera.</span> <span id="s1872">Sometimes you needed a board, so you had to do this.</span> <span id="s1873">You do that.</span> <span id="s1874">Don’t ask me what somehow or another, and managed to do what was expected.</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">Q: You weren’t building furniture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">A: No, no, no I wasn’t building furniture.</span> <span id="s1877">I was not an artist, along those lines.</span> <span id="s1878">No.</span> <span id="s1879">I was a plain, plain worker.</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">A: The food was manageable over there, and people who worked right near the tracks were able to organize sometimes potatoes, carrots, because they would fall off from the railroad tracks and smuggled into the camps and you could begin to trade a little bit here and there.</span> <span id="s1882">So, you could augment the poor food that we got with some of the extras, but a few months later, some people did the same thing, organize some food, and they were caught by the Germans.</span> <span id="s1883">And, now, the Germans wanted to teach us a lesson that theft is punishable.</span> <span id="s1884">And, what they did was hang the people, and we were forced to march to see the hanging, and then march around the hangers to see them.</span> <span id="s1885">How did I survive this one?</span> <span id="s1886">When it was announced hanging people, I didn’t understand what it means, how a person can hang.</span> <span id="s1887">Again, it became interesting to me to look at the person hanging.</span> <span id="s1888">I didn’t understand that this is involved with death.</span> <span id="s1889">I did not put two and two together.</span> <span id="s1890">How can a person hang?</span> <span id="s1891">And, only while hanging did I realize that the person was hanged and it meant actual death.</span> <span id="s1892">I did not connect this before.</span> <span id="s1893">So, to me again, it was a kind of a spectacle.</span> <span id="s1894">Theater of the Absurd, if you want to call it, or something along those lines.</span> <span id="s1895">Sick!</span> <span id="s1896">But I remember the context very well because I think about it and how could I have reacted the way I reacted?</span> <span id="s1897">And, my answer is, folly of youth, did not understand, and number two, and perhaps even more important than this, curiosity because everything interested me especially that what I didn’t understand.</span> <span id="s1898">And, this happened three, four months before our liberation when the Russians were already on German soil, and also during this period in Stolp, the German Jewish couples began to behave atrociously to the Eastern European Jews.</span> <span id="s1899">When somebody was caught organizing something internally or so, he had to receive twenty lashes, and the German Jewish couples were only delighted to mete out the punishment.</span> <span id="s1900">One of them was Kentcourik who was particularly brutal.</span> <span id="s1901">For some reason or other, both of these couples Greenwald and Kentcourik liked me, maybe because I spoke their type of German, and left me pretty much alone this and that and were actually nice, but they were absolute – excuse me for using the term here – bastards.</span> <span id="s1902">And, I’m jumping now forward for a minute.</span> <span id="s1903">I was in the same hospital, after, right after the war as Kentcourik, and I came out of the hospital and was brought back by the British to the rehabilitation, to the rehabilitation barrack in the DP camp in Neustadt in Holstein with one of the British Red Cross cars, ambulance cars, and Kentcourik – I informed the other guys who were there, fellows, many of them that I was liberated with that Kentcourik was coming out.</span> <span id="s1904">“Oh, Kentcourik is coming out.</span> <span id="s1905">We’ll beat the hell out of him,” and Kentcourik came in thinking that’s he’s coming in as a great hero, and chairs flew into his face, this and that, so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s1906">He was taken back to the hospital seriously injured.</span> <span id="s1907">He survived this, and after the war he had two daughters, moved with his two daughters to Lubeck where he died subsequently, but I don’t remember what happened to his other one, Grunwald, but that was the fate of this German Jewish couple Kentcourik.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">Q: George, when you’re walking around, how long did they make you walk around these people who were hung?</span> <span id="s1909">Just once?</span> <span id="s1910">Twice?</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">A: No, no, no, we were standing at attention walking, I would say about for an hour or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">Q: So, it’s a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">A: Yeah, for us to be taught a lesson.</span> <span id="s1914">So, they were hanging there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">Q: Do you think you also took this kind of position – not just, that it wasn’t just curiosity and interest in something new – and ignorance because you were a kid, but also a way to protect yourself?</span> <span id="s1916">Or was that-</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">A: You can interpret it as such.</span> <span id="s1918">It was a protective mechanism perhaps.</span> <span id="s1919">You could – I didn’t think along these lines, but I can see this, yes, I can see this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">Q: Was there-</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">A: But, not conscious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">Q: Yes, I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">A: There was no conscious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">Q: That I understand, and was there an affect after looking at this for an hour that broke this sort of curiosity?</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">A: Well, I’ve been thinking about it ever since this particular episode.</span> <span id="s1926">Hanging, et cetera, and when I watch the History Channel, and I see some of the – some of the things when Mussolini was hung with Clara Petacci, and how they used to hang Russian prisoners, the German and so on and so forth, this always comes back to me, this scene of how I had to watch these people being hanged.</span> <span id="s1927">It’s something that stays with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">Q: Stays with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1930">Well, I guess you can interpret my reactions to many of the things in psychological terms as self-protection et cetera.</span> <span id="s1931">The whole approach being the theater of the absurd, but looking at it with today’s vocabulary and understanding et cetera, but at the time, of course, I did not-</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">Q: Right, you didn’t have that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1933">A: I don’t have this vocabulary and know this understanding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">Q: But, it must have been scary.</span> <span id="s1935">At some point it had to be horribly scary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">A: Absolutely because I could be next.</span> <span id="s1937">Yes, you never knew.</span> <span id="s1938">Yeah, and, in Stolp I was sleeping in a bunk right next to Julius Goldberg.</span> <span id="s1939">Again, everything straw, this and that, lice, delousing was an every evening activity.</span> <span id="s1940">Bathroom facility better than Stutthof and Riga, but still – there was water.</span> <span id="s1941">You could wash yourself in the barrack which was a converted – the barrack was actually not a true barrack.</span> <span id="s1942">It was for a steam engine that was converted into a kind of a barrack where we could sleep, bunk beds.</span> <span id="s1943">And, then, the Russians were coming very close and they were going to evacuate us, but before then, about the Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1944">It was Eugenia Goldberg who was a nurse, and persuaded the SS woman to let her do something for me.</span> <span id="s1945">And, she “baked” something from potatoes which was the most delicious thing I thought I’d ever eaten because I was so starved – a kind of a potato pie.</span> <span id="s1946">She explained it to Sheila Robbins, maybe she would be able to explain it to you what it was, and then the SS woman was present.</span> <span id="s1947">I was permitted to come in from the man’s quarter including Julius Goldberg, her husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">Q: Oh, it is the husband.</span> <span id="s1949">They are related.</span> <span id="s1950">That’s what I was going to ask you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">A: Yes, yes, that was a wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">A: Wonderful, wonderful woman, and songs were sung by inmates including one of the songs sung in English, Lambeth Walk, I remember and the SS woman actually enjoying it too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1956">It was “very festive” under the circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">Q: That’s quite extraordinary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">A: Extraordinary, yeah.</span> <span id="s1959">So-</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">Q: So this was your 13th.</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">A: Yes, I guess it was, yes.</span> <span id="s1962">It was my Bar Mitzvah I guess, end of ’44.</span> <span id="s1963">I’m confused with the dates sometimes a little because sometimes I was made older, sometimes I was made younger.</span> <span id="s1964">So, I have to think about.</span> <span id="s1965">It was nothing unusual in those circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">Q: But it was in Stolp</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">A: It was in Stolp, yes.</span> <span id="s1968">Now, it was not long thereafter, a couple of months actually, I think it was in March, beginning of March or end of February when we were sort of dumped into cattle cars again, and we were returning to Stutthof But, because the Russians were already nearby and my mother was already liberated nearby which I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1969">I found this out only after I met her, we spent about a week in these cattle cars with hardly any food, no facilities to speak of, in the corners we had where the stench was absolutely incredible.</span> <span id="s1970">Finally, we came to Danzig and we didn’t manage to get to Stutthof and we were brought to another small camp Burggraben, and we marched.</span> <span id="s1971">It was a long march from Danzig to Burggraben.</span> <span id="s1972">It was very cold, I remember.</span> <span id="s1973">It was about easily, easily ten, twelve miles in our circumstance to march.</span> <span id="s1974">We arrived in Burggrabben.</span> <span id="s1975">It was knee deep in mud.</span> <span id="s1976">There were no German guards.</span> <span id="s1977">It was no man’s land between the Russian front and the German front.</span> <span id="s1978">The Russians would shoot their artillery across our heads, and the Germans would shoot their artillery across our heads.</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">Q: And, you’re in the middle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">A: And we were in the middle.</span> <span id="s1981">For about a week to ten days I would say with hardly any food, hardly anything to drink.</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">Q: You were just sitting there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">A: Sitting there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">Q: Watching?</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">A: Watching what was happening.</span> <span id="s1986">Watching what was happening.</span> <span id="s1987">Suddenly, German trucks appeared.</span> <span id="s1988">This was in March ’45.</span> <span id="s1989">We’re hauled to those German trucks, and they took us to Stutthof back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">Q: Oh, you did get to Stutthof.</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">A: Yeah, the second time.</span> <span id="s1992">Now, Stutthof the first time was paradise in comparison to Stutthof the second time.</span> <span id="s1993">Rampant typhoid, hardly any food, Russian plans attacking us, didn’t know that it was probably a camp or so.</span> <span id="s1994">The ovens burning all the time, hardly anything to eat, people dying left and right, being shot left and right, Germans unleashing their dogs, police dogs.</span> <span id="s1995">And, the police dogs biting people including Julius Goldberg was bitten like mad.</span> <span id="s1996">His feet swelled up, and we were there for about two weeks, maybe a little longer give or take a week or so when suddenly the order came, “Evacuation.”</span> <span id="s1997">We’re going to be evacuated by boat.</span> <span id="s1998">And, again, we were hauled off in these mini-train, these mini-railroad tracks, not the regular ones to barges in Danzig, or near Danzig, barges.</span> <span id="s1999">And, then we were taken on these barges on the high seas – the Baltic, the North Sea.</span> <span id="s2000">For the trip, we received a loaf of bread and some water.</span> <span id="s2001">That was it because we subsisted on sea water during the trip, salt water.</span> <span id="s2002">SS Guards were guarding us, and if you had to step out, you had to do it over the railing and into the water on these barges, and you could see the SS Guards pushing people with their shoes into the Baltic or into the North Sea.</span> <span id="s2003">I remember very distinctly I suddenly saw a German coming, passing me.</span> <span id="s2004">I thought, well, this was my end, but it passed me and didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s2005">And, we were down, et cetera.</span> <span id="s2006">To climb up we had no strength left or anything of the sort, but Julius despite his illness, I mean he was as strong as a bull.</span> <span id="s2007">I’ve never seen anything like it in my life.</span> <span id="s2008">And, suddenly we were told that we had arrived in Hamburg, but I don’t think it was Hamburg, but this is what I remember, and that we had to get out very quickly for Hamburg because the Americans were in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s2009">It was actually the Brits, not the Americans, and then, we were taken back to the high seas, and at night the German guards abandoned us, and we were told that we were in minefields.</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">Q: On the high seas?</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">A: On the high seas, minefields, abandoned and we didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s2012">On our barges, were Norwegian POWs, and they collected the blankets we had still from the camp, and made sails out of them.</span> <span id="s2013">And, came close to, very close to the shore that we later learned was Neustadt in Holstein, about 25 miles or kilometers from Lubek, and the decision was made – this was about four o’clock in the morning, five o’clock in the morning, May the third – that we would wade to shore and walk in the direction of Hamburg where the Americans are, and we’ll be liberated.</span> <span id="s2014">Julius was immediately for wading and was taking me along.</span> <span id="s2015">I said, “Julius please, please let me die.</span> <span id="s2016">I have no strength.</span> <span id="s2017">Please leave me alone!”</span> <span id="s2018">I remember Julius was stone.</span> <span id="s2019">He said, “Nope, you’re coming with me”, and took me by the collar and dragged me.</span> <span id="s2020">We had to go down, and actually in this very cold May in the North Sea, early morning, and I knew a little bit how to swim from the Baltic.</span> <span id="s2021">I grew up on the shores of the Baltic.</span> <span id="s2022">I knew, et cetera, but I had no difficulties wading to shore, and we all lined up and people took a long time because there were several barges of people, and there were people still there who didn’t want to leave, and left very slowly, and suddenly, units of the German Navy arrive because it turned out that this was a U-boat school in Neustadt in Holstein, a huge U-boat school.</span> <span id="s2023">Units of the German Navy arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">Q: Okay, I’ve got to - Hold that thought because we have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">End of Tape 8</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">Tape 9</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">Q: George, I want to go back to your scene with Goldberg.</span> <span id="s2028">This is the first time that you’ve said, “I want to die.</span> <span id="s2029">Leave me alone.”</span> <span id="s2030">You’ve never indicated in any of the ways you told your story that you wanted to die.</span> <span id="s2031">Why now?</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">A: By now, I really felt totally, completely, totally exhausted – completely and totally starved because we were subsisting on sea water.</span> <span id="s2033">How long can you subsist on sea water?</span> <span id="s2034">I just wanted to sleep because we were crowded in like herring, but he wouldn’t let go of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">Q: That’s really something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">A: Yeah, and then when we finally waded there, when the German troops arrived from the ____ marina, from the naval units, they started shooting at random.</span> <span id="s2037">People were still on the barges, wading toward the shore.</span> <span id="s2038">People who were sitting, who were too weak to get up were shot immediately.</span> <span id="s2039">It was the day of liberation, incidentally.</span> <span id="s2040">And, now another march.</span> <span id="s2041">We were going to march someplace, and I said to Julius, again, “Julius, please leave me alone!</span> <span id="s2042">I want to die.”</span> <span id="s2043">And, he was all swollen from the dog where he was bitten.</span> <span id="s2044">He said, “No”, and again he pushed me.</span> <span id="s2045">And, the march was not a long one, a couple of miles, and we arrived at this huge complex, a German U-boat school.</span> <span id="s2046">There was a huge soccer field, and there were thousands and thousands of people there from other camps.</span> <span id="s2047">And, we were told that there is a ship by the name of Cap Arcorna that we’re going to be put on that ship, and we will sale for I don’t remember where.</span> <span id="s2048">I was semi-delirious and I was really starved, and in the shuffle in these thousands of people, I lost Julius.</span> <span id="s2049">I wandered around.</span> <span id="s2050">British planes were overhead and shooting, and the Cap Arcona was offshore, but there was another ship, the Athens, and we were supposed to line up and get onto the Athens to be taken to the Cap Arcorna.</span> <span id="s2051">And, I wandered around still, and suddenly, I see a pile of things, and I was in a delirious state by then, a German guard looking at it, guns – all sorts of things, and saw there what I would call today – it was soap, but I mistook it for bread.</span> <span id="s2052">I picked it up and I started to eat it, and I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s2053">I couldn’t bite it.</span> <span id="s2054">I couldn’t eat it.</span> <span id="s2055">It didn’t taste like bread.</span> <span id="s2056">So, I threw it away, and I walked over to the guard and said to him, “May I have a slice of bread?”</span> <span id="s2057">He said, “Why don’t you walk over to this tank?</span> <span id="s2058">This is a British tank.</span> <span id="s2059">You have been liberated, walk over and you’ll get something.”</span> <span id="s2060">So, I walked over to the tank.</span> <span id="s2061">The British, I decided to speak English, I said, “I’m very, very hungry.</span> <span id="s2062">Can I please have a slice of bread?”</span> <span id="s2063">So, they gave me these cookies, a number of cookies to eat because they didn’t have bread, but it was some sort of cookies.</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">Q: Cookies or cracker?</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">A: Crackers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">Q: Was it a cracker?</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">A: Those were crackers rather, not cookies, you’re right, crackers.</span> <span id="s2068">And, we were free, and I saw the Athens there.</span> <span id="s2069">In the meantime, just then, the Cap Arcorna was sunk by the British.</span> <span id="s2070">Most of the people drowned, most of the prisoners drowned.</span> <span id="s2071">A few survived included Sam Bressler and his father ____.</span> <span id="s2072">And, some way or other, I saw Julius again, and I saw people stealing goods from the German storage places, food.</span> <span id="s2073">They had huge gallons of marmalade, I guess for the soldiers, for the Naval people whatever, and people hauling, people eating all over.</span> <span id="s2074">Many died by overeating immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">A: Immediately, I was too weak to even carry that much, but Julius and I and some others went into a barrack and took over the rooms.</span> <span id="s2077">The bunk beds was clean, everything.</span> <span id="s2078">And, that’s where we decided we’re going to be for the night, and we were basically free, but it didn’t mean anything to me being free.</span> <span id="s2079">I did receive some crackers, something else, et cetera.</span> <span id="s2080">So, my basic hunger was to an extent satiated, and then I went out myself and I organized something also one of those cans I managed to bring back.</span> <span id="s2081">Suddenly, there’s a knock on the door and several Poles walked in, looked around, and said among themselves, and by then I knew some Polish because I lived with Poles at the camps, “This is our place and out you Jew!</span> <span id="s2082">Out!</span> <span id="s2083">You out!”</span> <span id="s2084">He didn’t say Jews, and the Jews said, “You better get out or else.”</span> <span id="s2085">And, Julius was in the forefront as sick as he was.</span> <span id="s2086">Those days are over.</span> <span id="s2087">They left quietly, and we stayed there.</span> <span id="s2088">Now, while we were still on the barges, we heard the best news of all that Hitler was killed fighting the Russians.</span> <span id="s2089">He was killed in Berlin.</span> <span id="s2090">It was very, very late April.</span> <span id="s2091">It must have been about the 29th or 30th of April, just a few days before we were liberated.</span> <span id="s2092">We were liberated on the third of May by the British.</span> <span id="s2093">And, the day Germany officially capitulated, I collapsed out of total weakness and I was taken to the hospital in Neustadt in Holstein.</span> <span id="s2094">The many, many other prisoners from Libau, from Riga, from German Jews that I met subsequently, Czech Jews, so on and so forth were all there, and I stayed for a good number of weeks.</span> <span id="s2095">I think four or six weeks I stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2096">Q: Did you also collapse because of the appendix?</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">A: No, it had nothing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">Q: Nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">A: The appendix was finally taken out in Hamburg, September or October 1945.</span> <span id="s2100">I had an attack, but by then I was already on the Warburg Estate in ___.</span> <span id="s2101">No, it was general weakness.</span> <span id="s2102">I luckily did not suffer from diphtheria, typhoid or any of these illnesses because as soon as the Germans occupied Libau, my father said I’m going to give you certain injections against certain illnesses.</span> <span id="s2103">These were not only injections over a number of days, I remember once he cut something.</span> <span id="s2104">It was a kind of a special type of a razor, and he had something – there was something on the razor, and that was enough.</span> <span id="s2105">I guess it was against typhoid or something or other, and then several other things, and my mother escaped all of this, and I escaped all of this.</span> <span id="s2106">I didn’t have typhoid.</span> <span id="s2107">I didn’t have diphtheria, and some of the other illnesses associated, but especially typhoid and diphtheria.</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">Q: It’s quite extraordinary.</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">Q: So, he must have had some suspicion.</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">A: He must have had some-</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">Q: That it was not going to be good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">A: So, he wanted to make sure at least to immunize us as best as he could.</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">Q: Did he immunize himself as far as you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">A: I would think so, but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2116">I would think so, yes.</span> <span id="s2117">He immunized the rest of the family.</span> <span id="s2118">So, why shouldn’t he immunize himself?</span> <span id="s2119">So, this was basically the liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">Q: It doesn’t feel like liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">A: Which doesn’t feel like liberation, and yet I was liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">A: Yeah, and thanks for Julius.</span> <span id="s2124">If not for Julius, I don’t think I would’ve made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">Q: It sounds like it.</span> <span id="s2126">It sounds like you would’ve just dropped.</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">Q: And, what do you think made – because he promised you he’d take care of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">A: He promised me that-</span></p> <p><span id="s2130">Q: He would take care of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2131">A: Yes, and this was nothing uncommon when a kid was left alone.</span> <span id="s2132">An older person would sort of volunteer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">A: To do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">Q: And how old was he do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">A: Julius at that time was probably mid or late twenties.</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2138">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">Q: And he had a wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">A: Yeah, that was Eugenia.</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">Q: Right, and did she survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">A: She survived.</span> <span id="s2143">She’s still living in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">Q: She is now?</span></p> <p><span id="s2145">A: Yes, she’s still living in Israel – wonderful, wonderful person.</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">Q: When do you go to Warburg Estate in Hamburg, and you don’t know yet.</span> <span id="s2147">The first few months you don’t know whether your mother’s alive, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">A: No, I had a feeling that she’s alive, but where, what, when, et cetera, no.</span> <span id="s2149">Before I go to the Warburg Estate, a group of Russian officers arrived with British officers trying to convince me to go back to Latvia, go back to Latvia, go back to the Soviet Union, et cetera.</span> <span id="s2150">The answer – my answer was a categorical no because we made a pact, a family, never go east, go back.</span> <span id="s2151">You go.</span> <span id="s2152">We have relatives in England, the United States, and we’re given a name so on and so forth to remember, but never go back, and I said, “Categorically, I’m not going back.”</span> <span id="s2153">The British officers still tried to convince me to go back, and a good number did go back.</span> <span id="s2154">Some of them are now in Israel.</span> <span id="s2155">After horror – after spending horrible times in the Soviet Union in Latvia until the ‘70s, and I refused to go back.</span> <span id="s2156">Then, the Brits became suspicious of me that I wasn’t Jewish, despite the fact that I’m circumcised, and put me, brought me, took me to a Latvian children’s home where only Latvian was spoken, where some of the leaders were former patients of my father, where they talked about Tievzeme in Latvian, the Fatherland, how eventually we’ll all go back to the Fatherland, et cetera, but this was a little bit strange to me because we had Latvian guards.</span> <span id="s2157">Some of the Latvians were innocuous.</span> <span id="s2158">Others were horrible.</span> <span id="s2159">I believe this guy Cukurs, especially Cukurs.</span> <span id="s2160">I didn’t feel comfortable there.</span> <span id="s2161">They also wanted to introduce me – they had with a woman.</span> <span id="s2162">This was in ____.</span> <span id="s2163">She wanted to introduce me to General Dankers who apparently knew my father.</span> <span id="s2164">General Dankers was one of the sympathizers, Nazi sympathizers who managed to get to Lubek.</span> <span id="s2165">He headed Latvian troops, so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s2166">But, which I did not know exactly, but General Dankers just didn’t sound right that I should meet him.</span> <span id="s2167">In Lubek, she wanted to take me because apparently he knew my father, but when we needed the Latvians, they didn’t come through those who were in the position to come through.</span> <span id="s2168">One day, when the head, this woman, went to Lubek for a day or so, I decided to run away, and I ran away and I ran all the way to the DP camp in Neustadt in Holstein.</span> <span id="s2169">_____ the DP Camp.”</span> <span id="s2170">But, this was a second time around, not the first time.</span> <span id="s2171">The first time I was brought back to the – I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s2172">This was the second time around because the first time after a few days I had a relapse, and I was taken back to the hospital for another twelve days.</span> <span id="s2173">The second time, it was when they took me to the Latvian children’s home, and after a few weeks, I ran away.</span> <span id="s2174">I came to the camp which was in this U-boat school, and I went to the bunk where I had originally brought back, the rehabilitation bunk, and I’ve got a bed so on and so forth, and what were the people doing?</span> <span id="s2175">Playing poker.</span> <span id="s2176">Playing poker.</span> <span id="s2177">Playing – what you call it?</span> <span id="s2178">They call it 21?</span> <span id="s2179">– Blackjack, blackjack, and making piles of money.</span> <span id="s2180">In those days, the exchange rate was one dollar to 600 Marks, and I don’t know how I got a few Marks to play also.</span> <span id="s2181">I figured, “Why not?”</span> <span id="s2182">And, I had a very good memory, and after a few days, I saw this and I knew every card that had gone out and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s2183">I began to play, and I piled in tens of thousands of Marks which translates into dollars, maybe it was twenty or twenty-five dollars, but in Marks, it sounded enormous amount, and then I decided that it’s time for me to see the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">Q: And, you’re what?</span> <span id="s2185">14?</span></p> <p><span id="s2186">A: No, thirteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">Q: Thirteen?</span> <span id="s2188">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">A: To see the world.</span> <span id="s2190">I had plenty of money because the official rate if you went to a railroad station was still actually two or three Marks or four Marks for a ticket let’s say to go to Hamburg.</span> <span id="s2191">Now, I’m an adult.</span> <span id="s2192">I’ve seen it all I felt.</span> <span id="s2193">I would love to live the life my aunts, my uncles, and my parents.</span> <span id="s2194">To see the world – Berlin, Paris, night clubs, dancing, et cetera, that part of the world, and Neustadt was just a DP camp.</span> <span id="s2195">So, I packed a few things that I had with my money, maybe by that time twenty, thirty thousand Marks which for Germans was an awful lot of money, got it all, and I decided to go to Hamburg.</span> <span id="s2196">The reason being that we were told that we also had family in Germany, part of the family came from Hamburg, and part of the family came from Dresden.</span> <span id="s2197">And, obviously, I didn’t find anybody in Hamburg, and I didn’t expect to find, but at least I got to Hamburg.</span> <span id="s2198">I didn’t think it through would I go to a hotel?</span> <span id="s2199">Do I need this?</span> <span id="s2200">Do I need that?</span> <span id="s2201">Et cetera, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">Q: And, how did you get there?</span> <span id="s2203">By train?</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">A: By train.</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">A: That was not a problem.</span> <span id="s2207">I bought my ticket.</span> <span id="s2208">I went to Hamburg, and I remembered going to a police station saying, “I looked for so and so.”</span> <span id="s2209">I spoke German, and I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s2210">So, I was taken to the Warburg Estate in _____, a suburb of Hamburg which the Warburg family had temporarily given over to – I guess there’s a joint distribution committee of the American Relief Unit to turn it into a children’s home, just a small children’s home.</span> <span id="s2211">I arrived there, and I was told, “Yes, I belong there.”</span> <span id="s2212">So, that’s how I arrived.</span> <span id="s2213">It must have been late summer or early fall.</span> <span id="s2214">I remember a few weeks later, getting an attack, appendix attack.</span> <span id="s2215">I was operated on.</span> <span id="s2216">I was all alone.</span> <span id="s2217">I was scared, in the Altona Hospital in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s2218">I spoke German.</span> <span id="s2219">I told them that my father was a gastroenterologist.</span> <span id="s2220">I spoke German to them.</span> <span id="s2221">They were very nice to me, but I was still very much afraid.</span> <span id="s2222">They were Germans.</span> <span id="s2223">You don’t know what they can do to me.</span> <span id="s2224">I thought at that time, and I always reacted very poorly to ether, and I remember throwing off the mask in those days, but before the war my tonsils were removed also under ether and I reacted very poorly in Riga, and I threw off the mask, which I did again, but next thing I knew I came out of the operation all right.</span> <span id="s2225">I stayed for a number of days in the hospital.</span> <span id="s2226">When I was brought back for further recovery to the estate.</span> <span id="s2227">Now came the issue – there were several issues.</span> <span id="s2228">First of all, to find mother, and then I wanted to go to Palestine because there were people from the Jewish Brigade in uniform and out of uniform, legally and illegally, Hamburg to train us.</span> <span id="s2229">Not only to teach us Hebrew, the history of Israel, the history of Palestine, Jewish History, also Hebrew, mathematics, so on and so forth, but prepare also for Alijah Bet which was illegal immigration.</span> <span id="s2230">And, the war to an extent, it’s only in retrospect that radicalized me.</span> <span id="s2231">Why did I suffer?</span> <span id="s2232">I suffered because I’m a Jew.</span> <span id="s2233">Is there anything really to be ashamed of being a Jew?</span> <span id="s2234">No, I was ashamed when I met the girl that I fancied on the street, and, you know, shame came over me that I could not really talk and I really felt inferior which I never did before.</span> <span id="s2235">But, this was a kind of a reaction I guess to my timidity at the time to having felt ashamed that I reacted the way I did, and was prepared to go to Palestine, prepared to take up a gun against the British because they were so horrible also to the Jews not permitting the Jews to come in, giving maybe 1,500 certificates a month, and there were hundreds and hundreds of thousands and Jews who wanted to move to Palestine, so on and so forth, but this comes a little later.</span> <span id="s2236">When it’s all started, and my mother and brother, especially my mother said, “You go west, never go east.”</span> <span id="s2237">You must remember your relatives in America, and in England.</span> <span id="s2238">In London, remember your Uncle Robert, Robert Schwab.</span> <span id="s2239">I said, “Yes, of course.</span> <span id="s2240">He visited us in Libau.</span> <span id="s2241">I remember him well.”</span> <span id="s2242">Remember to write simply Robert Schwab, Director Shell Oil, London, England it will arrive because he was one of the heads of Shell Oil, but I had forgotten that he was the director of Shell Oil.</span> <span id="s2243">So, I wrote, “Robert Schwab, London, England.”</span> <span id="s2244">It all went through military mail because you could not write.</span> <span id="s2245">It went through the Joint Distribution Committee.</span> <span id="s2246">It never arrived.</span> <span id="s2247">To my cousin in Salt Lake City, I wrote, “Mr. David Alder.”</span> <span id="s2248">He was married to my cousin Anna Alder, who’s in this photograph who went to America, and there I wrote to Mr. David Alder, Director Shell Oil, but he was not Director of Shell Oil, and it arrived to the local manager of Shell Oil in Salt Lake City, letter after letter.</span> <span id="s2249">He disregarded it, but one day he decided to look up in the phone book in Salt Lake City who this David Alder was.</span> <span id="s2250">It turned out that he was the owner of an insurance company in Salt Lake City, David Alder Insurance Company.</span> <span id="s2251">So, he called David Alder and asked him, “Does the name George Schwab mean anything to you?”</span> <span id="s2252">He said, “Yes, he is my wife’s cousin.”</span> <span id="s2253">So, this was a first contact.</span> <span id="s2254">I wrote to my other cousin in West Hartford, Broskin, it never arrived because it was just Dr. and Mrs. Broskin, Hartford, Connecticut.</span> <span id="s2255">It never arrived.</span> <span id="s2256">But, this man, this one man, immediately contacted my uncle in London and contacted his sister, his wife’s sister in Hartford, Connecticut.</span> <span id="s2257">So, they were already now in touch, but my mother knew to write the correct.</span> <span id="s2258">So, she independently got in touch, and this way we connected.</span> <span id="s2259">We were able to speak on the phone, on the military phone once a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s2260">Q: And, she was where?</span></p> <p><span id="s2261">A: She was liberated in Lauenburg, it is on the map over there, already in March, and she worked as a nurse in the Russian hospital.</span> <span id="s2262">Then, she heard later on in May or June that there are a lot of Jews in Lodz, and maybe I am one of those who she could find in Lodz or get some information.</span> <span id="s2263">Turns out that she arrives in Lodz, gets off a trolley car and somebody says, “Frau Dr. Schwab in German.</span> <span id="s2264">Frau Dr. Schwab.</span> <span id="s2265">Frau Dr. Schwab.”</span> <span id="s2266">“Yes, yes, who was it?”</span> <span id="s2267">It’s is Mrs. Dorbian the son comes now several times had come to Latvia.</span> <span id="s2268">He’s my age.</span> <span id="s2269">We were together in _____.</span> <span id="s2270">It was his mother.</span> <span id="s2271">“Do you know that George is alive in the British zone?”</span> <span id="s2272">She didn’t ask, “Where?</span> <span id="s2273">When?”</span> <span id="s2274">She was so overwhelmed, she ran back to Lauenburg, picked up her few things that she had, and went to Berlin almost penniless, comes to Berlin and Berlin was a second home to her because she had been very often to Berlin before the war especially in the ‘20s and early ‘30s.</span> <span id="s2275">And, decided she was going to go to the Joint Distribution Committee.</span> <span id="s2276">She went to the Joint Distribution Committee.</span> <span id="s2277">They wanted to test her, “Who is she?”</span> <span id="s2278">She didn’t speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s2279">She looked like a thousand percent Aryan.</span> <span id="s2280">So, they were suspicious because many wanted to do things, and she got away with no results, but she went back to the Joint several times, and then there was a woman who said to her, “You know Mrs. Schwab, I believe your story.</span> <span id="s2281">I’m going to help you.”</span> <span id="s2282">And, with the help of this person, she was able to write to the United States because again, everything had to go through military mail, and through them she found out where I am which the Joint was able to connect me then by telephone to my mother because the Warburgs, the Joint Distribution Committee and the American and the English Relief Unit were sort of the heads of the so-called children’s home in the Warburg estate, were able to connect once a week.</span> <span id="s2283">My mother went to the Joint in Berlin, and I was, of course at the Warburg Estate, and it was pre-arranged what time we would be talking.</span> <span id="s2284">So, we started to talk, and in those days, it was not easy to go from Hamburg from the British zone to Berlin because you had to go to the British Sector or the American sector because we had to go by way of the Soviet zone, and it took months before I was brought to Berlin.</span> <span id="s2285">But, in the meantime, when my relatives found out that I was alive, they started bombarding me with packages and money, and every single letter was five dollars, ten dollars, twenty dollars.</span> <span id="s2286">Sometimes I received a package a day.</span> <span id="s2287">I didn’t know what to do with cigarettes and coffee, but they wrote me they coffee and the cigarettes are not for you, but we’ve been led to understand that there’s a lot you can do with it in Germany.</span> <span id="s2288">So, that’s for that purpose.</span> <span id="s2289">Now, it may sound very funny, but it’s true.</span> <span id="s2290">I felt that I was now an independent young man.</span> <span id="s2291">I’ve gone through the camps.</span> <span id="s2292">I’m going to live the life of my parents, aunts and uncles.</span> <span id="s2293">I am rich.</span> <span id="s2294">I have now all this coffee, et cetera, and among other things, I managed to get myself a driver with his car.</span> <span id="s2295">He came to the Warburg Estate.</span> <span id="s2296">He always picked me up whenever I needed or wanted.</span> <span id="s2297">I had my wine table in the Alhambra in the ____, it was a kind of a red light district I went to in the evenings.</span> <span id="s2298">For two cigarettes, I could get it at my age because it was my card l’dentitie.</span></p> <p><span id="s2299">End of Tape 9</span></p> <p><span id="s2300">Tape 10</span></p> <p><span id="s2301">Q: Okay, George, so you’re now describing yourself as the reincarnation of that little kid who knows everything.</span> <span id="s2302">Now, you’re a big person and you’re all of what?</span> <span id="s2303">Fourteen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">A: Not yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">Q: Not yet fourteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2306">A: Not yet fourteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">Q: So, you have money?</span></p> <p><span id="s2308">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">Q: You have – what made you go get a car and a driver?</span> <span id="s2310">I mean, where does that come from?</span> <span id="s2311">Is that really-</span></p> <p><span id="s2312">A: Yes, I don’t know how come that I got that driver with that car.</span> <span id="s2313">I don’t remember, but they used to come around to Hamburg to ______, and they had a car, and I started out by saying, “I’ll give you a pack of cigarettes if you can drive me here or there.”</span> <span id="s2314">And, then they offered that anytime I wanted, I could have the car with a driver.</span> <span id="s2315">There were two brothers, and they owned a factory on the other side of Hamburg, in Harburg with 200 people working, and they offered me, incidentally, to buy the factory for ten pounds of coffee and 40,000 cigarettes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2316">Q: That you should buy it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2317">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2318">So, I figured, “What do I need a factory for?”</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">Q: Oh, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s2320">A: Yes, I did, ten pounds.</span> <span id="s2321">I mean, I didn’t have at that moment, neither 10,000 – 40,000 cigarettes.</span> <span id="s2322">Which meant, I don’t know, 400 or 4,000 packs of cigarettes and ten pounds of coffee.</span> <span id="s2323">First of all, I didn’t have it.</span> <span id="s2324">I had maybe a thousand cigarettes or maybe two pounds of coffee, which was a lot in Germany at that time, but then I figured, “Well, I could ask my aunt, but what am I going to do?</span> <span id="s2325">I want to have a good time.”</span> <span id="s2326">And, I had now access to the Alhambra.</span> <span id="s2327">With two cigarettes, you could get in any place.</span></p> <p><span id="s2328">Q: And, your age, it didn’t matter?</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">A: It didn’t matter with two cigarettes.</span> <span id="s2330">That’s what we called a Carte D’identite, and identification card.</span></p> <p><span id="s2331">Q: And, you had your own table?</span></p> <p><span id="s2332">A: I had my own wine table there, and it was very interesting, fascinating because you had a kind of a telegraph system there with tubes.</span> <span id="s2333">If you sat at table fifteen, and you wanted to dance with somebody at table eighteen, you wrote a little bit, “Let us meet in the center of the dance floor, fifteen.”</span> <span id="s2334">And, I just had to write “Eighteen” and it would arrive by tube, and then we would meet or something or other.</span> <span id="s2335">I knew about as much about dancing as I know about the ballet dancing (laughs), but I learned, et cetera, and because one of the things that I remembered very well became the rage in Latvia before the war in the late ‘30s was the Tango, and a particular type of Tango Naturno.</span> <span id="s2336">It was one dance, and the Lambeth walk.</span> <span id="s2337">People went crazy tangoing and Lambeth walking.</span> <span id="s2338">So, I was sort of going to live their lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s2339">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2340">A: There’s a German expression Kleiner Mann Was Nun?</span> <span id="s2341">It was a novel written by, I forget the author’s name, “small man, what now?”</span> <span id="s2342">In other words, looking at it in today’s terms, at that time, I didn’t know about the author nor about the novel Kleiner Mann Was Nun, and I in the evenings were not really supervised as much at the Warburg Estate.</span> <span id="s2343">As long as we were there in the morning for hitamulut is what they called it in Hebrew, the exercises, callisthenic exercises, appearing in class, doing some homework.</span> <span id="s2344">We didn’t take studies very seriously.</span> <span id="s2345">Much more interesting was when we learned a little about how to smuggle arms, and this and preparing for Alijah Bet, not to sit with this dry stuff mathematics or, so, who needed it.</span> <span id="s2346">Anyways, in the meantime, Julius Goldberg met up with his wife.</span> <span id="s2347">She was liberated in Cologne – in Kiel, sorry, in Kiel.</span> <span id="s2348">And, she was in one of the barges that didn’t come to Neustadt in Holstein but went to Kiel.</span> <span id="s2349">And, then he became Norbert Wollheim’s driver.</span> <span id="s2350">Norbert Wollheim became the head of the Jews of the British Zone.</span> <span id="s2351">And, Norbert was headquartered in Lubek, Germany, and Julius would drive him when he had to go to Kiel, to Hamburg, or to ____.</span> <span id="s2352">So, usually when Julius had to drive him to ____, he had to go by way of Hamburg.</span> <span id="s2353">So, Julius would come to ____ with Wollheim, pick me up, take me to _____ to the DP camp where I met Yosele for the first time, Yosele Rosensaft, Manachem’s father, for the first time.</span> <span id="s2354">That was in ’45 still.</span> <span id="s2355">And, then would drive me back either to or at times take me all the way to Lubek where I stayed at the Wollheim home with his first wife, beautiful woman incidentally, and that’s how I reconnected with Julius.</span> <span id="s2356">This is how I reconnected with Eugenia.</span> <span id="s2357">They were living in a DP camp in Kiel at the time, and I visited them also in Kiel if Juluis picked me up.</span> <span id="s2358">I saw Eugenia for the first time since the liberation.</span> <span id="s2359">And, in the meantime in Hamburg, I did this.</span> <span id="s2360">I did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2361">Q: Are you still playing cards?</span></p> <p><span id="s2362">A: No, I didn’t play cards.</span> <span id="s2363">I didn’t need to.</span> <span id="s2364">I made my money in Neustadt in Holstein playing cards.</span></p> <p><span id="s2365">Q: That was enough?</span></p> <p><span id="s2366">A: It was enough.</span> <span id="s2367">I had plenty of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s2368">Q: And, are you still getting money from relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s2369">A: Yes, getting money in every single envelope, I had at any time, I had at least a hundred dollars in cash.</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2371">A: At any time because in every single envelope there’s five dollars, ten dollars, sometimes twenty dollars coming from especially from my cousins in West Hartford and Salt Lake City, and sometimes I would get two or three letters a day – a week from each of them.</span> <span id="s2372">In every envelope, there was five dollars or ten dollars or twenty dollars.</span></p> <p><span id="s2373">Q: Do you have a lot of self-confidence now?</span></p> <p><span id="s2374">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2375">Q: You do?</span></p> <p><span id="s2376">A: Very much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">Q: You feel very sure of yourself as a kid there, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2378">A: As a kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s2379">Q: I’m not talking about right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2380">A: Oh, I thought right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2381">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2382">A: Ah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2383">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2384">A: I didn’t think of it in those terms, but the answer is yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2385">Q: Because you seem to have a way of getting around and figuring out things and...</span></p> <p><span id="s2386">A: Yes, because I was living the life of my parents and my relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s2387">Q: Do you take any – do any of the other kids do what you’re doing that you’re with?</span> <span id="s2388">Or are you alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">A: I was pretty much alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2390">Q: You were pretty much alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s2391">A: I was pretty much alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2392">Q: I have tell you, I can barely fantasize it at your age.</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">A: No, I was pretty much alone, yes.</span> <span id="s2394">I have a photograph with my drivers in Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s2395">Q: Yes, we’ll show that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2396">A: You have them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2397">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2398">A: So, what was your question?</span></p> <p><span id="s2399">Q: Well, it’s just that it’s a kind of self-confidence.</span> <span id="s2400">It’s not clear to me exactly where it comes from, but you obviously have a fantasy of what life ought to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s2401">A: Just fantasy as it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2402">Q: And, you wanted to live it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">A: I was living a fantasy, but I fanaticized before the war because I found it very, very exciting when they talked about when my mother and father were for the first time in Paris in 1928 at Maxime’s when the dinners my parents attended in the private home, the private residence of my aunt in Berlin, for the diplomatic core, where Hindenburg would say to my aunt, “You are my Garbo.</span> <span id="s2404">You have to sit next to me.”</span> <span id="s2405">et cetera.</span> <span id="s2406">She was very strikingly beautiful woman.</span> <span id="s2407">She basically looked like Garbo, and the whole lifestyle that we lived was a kind of a fairy tale which I never lived again because I didn’t have any means.</span> <span id="s2408">But, as a child I at least fanaticized right after the war and whatever I could, I did.</span> <span id="s2409">Then, came the day when I was brought to Berlin to meet my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2410">Q: Wait a second, on the telephone didn’t you ask her about nightclubs in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s2411">A: No, it was – that is coming.</span> <span id="s2412">I’m coming to this one.</span> <span id="s2413">In the car, I was taking by the Joint finally in May 1946 to Berlin.</span> <span id="s2414">I was thinking, “Do I really want to go and meet my mother?”</span></p> <p><span id="s2415">Q: Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2416">A: Am I going to live the old lifestyle again with governesses who are rigid – a certain rigid approach?</span> <span id="s2417">Because now I’m a man of the world.</span> <span id="s2418">I had my own car.</span> <span id="s2419">I had money.</span> <span id="s2420">I was able to do as I pleased.</span> <span id="s2421">I’m not so sure that I want to see my mother again especially if she would insist on the same type of rigidity, not the walls, but rigidity to which I was accustomed to.</span> <span id="s2422">So, when we arrived finally late in the evening, my mother lived privately, not in a DP camp, we lived privately in Berlin, I was brought up and the person – her name was Selma from the Joint Distribution Committee from the Bronx, lovely, lovely woman – and I saw my mother, and I gave her pro forma, a kiss, and she gave me pro forma, a kiss, and the first thing I asked her was, “Tell me, mother, what is the nightclub situation like in Berlin?”</span> <span id="s2423">I wanted to show her who am I.</span> <span id="s2424">She looked at me and said, “That’s a very interesting question that you’re posing.</span> <span id="s2425">Did you know that until now, I was here all alone in Berlin, but now that you are, we’ll be able to explore it together.”</span> <span id="s2426">She disarmed me on the spot, and I was satisfied with the answer and was looking forward to a life in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s2427">Q: So, did it turn out to meet the fantasy?</span></p> <p><span id="s2428">A: It turned out, yes, but rather than going to nightclubs, we went to some very interesting cafes.</span> <span id="s2429">We didn’t go to a cabaret.</span> <span id="s2430">I don’t remember, no, because I don’t think I could get in in those days, but I dragged my mother literally to two to three movies a day, two to three movies.</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">Q: A day?</span></p> <p><span id="s2432">A: A day, sometimes from on movie out into the second.</span> <span id="s2433">Later on in New York, my mother said, “Well, when you came and you had a problem.”</span> <span id="s2434">But, she was really wonderful.</span> <span id="s2435">For example, she decided to sleep with me in the same room.</span> <span id="s2436">I had nightmares, and she would jump up and calm me down from the nightmares, “Everything is fine, George, we’re together.”</span> <span id="s2437">And, I went back to sleep, but lasted for months and months and months.</span> <span id="s2438">And, then she said, “George, I’ll do everything possible in my life to make life as wonderful for you as possible for you to forget these horrible years.”</span> <span id="s2439">And, she did it.</span> <span id="s2440">But, then when she saw that she had a problem, she said, “George, let’s go, there’s a DP camp.</span> <span id="s2441">There’s some sort of a school, and you may meet interesting people there.”</span> <span id="s2442">And, I was always interested in meeting interesting people.</span> <span id="s2443">I didn’t cherish the idea of a school, but let’s go and look at this.</span> <span id="s2444">And, lo and behold, I went to this school where Renia was my classmate.</span> <span id="s2445">I was the youngest in my class.</span></p> <p><span id="s2446">Q: Schlachtensee.</span></p> <p><span id="s2447">A: Schlachtensee, exactly, I traveled everyday by elevated from where we lived privately in Berlin to Schlachtensee camp and then I went back because in Hamburg, we were all juvenile delinquents, and we didn’t take classes all that seriously – spitballs.</span> <span id="s2448">We used to shoot spitballs at the teachers.</span> <span id="s2449">So, I thought we’d do the same in Berlin which to an extent we did.</span> <span id="s2450">We were not _____, and didn’t have schooling for how many years?</span> <span id="s2451">Four or five years.</span> <span id="s2452">I was a semi-literate buffoon with high falooting ideas.</span></p> <p><span id="s2453">Q: You lived a very brutal life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2454">A: I lived a very brutal life, yes.</span> <span id="s2455">That is true, but there were some very attractive girls in the other class including Renia, and her two girlfriends, Tunia and Rachelka Feigenbaum.</span></p> <p><span id="s2456">Q: And, Renia, Chris’s-</span></p> <p><span id="s2457">A: Chris’s sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s2458">Q: Chris’s sister, Laks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2459">A: Laks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2460">Q: Renia Laks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2461">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2462">Q: You were close in age with here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2463">A: She’s older than I.</span></p> <p><span id="s2464">Q: A little by a couple-</span></p> <p><span id="s2465">A: Three, four years older than me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2466">Q: I thought it was less.</span></p> <p><span id="s2467">A: No, and I was the youngest, and they used to go the ____ to all these places, and I wanted to tag along because after all, I have from the basis of my experiences, and Renia would dismiss me as this little jerk schnesel, “He wants to go with us.”</span> <span id="s2468">And, the other young ladies, attractive young women laughed at me, and I felt very insulted, and I say to Renia even now, “I still haven’t forgiven you.”</span> <span id="s2469">(laughs) We have a good laugh over it, but at that time, I took it very, very seriously.</span> <span id="s2470">They just sort of dismissed me as, “This little jerk wants to join us ladies” going to the ____, going to the Fifth Avenue of Berlin, to the exclusive places where they went, et cetera, as if I was a zero, so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s2471">Q: Did you and your mother talk about what had happened to each of you when you separated?</span></p> <p><span id="s2472">A: Over the years, yes, we talked a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2473">Q: But, not in the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s2474">A: Not at the beginning.</span> <span id="s2475">She wanted me – she desperately wanted me to forget, to involve me in other things, to involve me in other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2476">Q: She was really smart with you, wasn’t she?</span></p> <p><span id="s2477">A: Yes, she disarmed me and she became more like a pal going with me to the movies.</span> <span id="s2478">Later on in New York, she would say, “I thought I was going out of my mind at times”, she would say to me.</span> <span id="s2479">So, but, these were also formative years.</span> <span id="s2480">These were also the years, where I became very much involved in betar.</span> <span id="s2481">I don’t know if you know anything about betar, the revisionist outfit.</span> <span id="s2482">I went in eventually to the Stern gang.</span> <span id="s2483">I was really radicalized, but this is a chapter in itself post World War II.</span></p> <p><span id="s2484">Q: And, I think we want to take a break now.</span> <span id="s2485">Did you like being in classes with the Jewish Brigade?</span></p> <p><span id="s2486">A: Yes because there are certain things I learned which I did not know before – the geography of Palestine, the history, the Alijah bet, the British policies towards the Jews, the ____ which I did not know anything about in Russia that led to the establishment of the first ___, the first ____among others, how the Jews turned this wasteland into a thriving community.</span> <span id="s2487">We saw pictures of Tel Aviv, wonderful, and I was very anxious to go to a warm climate because during the war in the winter years when it was freezing cold, I swore to myself that if I were ever to survive, I will go and live in a country that has a warm climate.</span> <span id="s2488">Never again do I want to experience winter, and here I am in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s2489">Q: You are, right?</span> <span id="s2490">(laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s2491">A: Yes, and then of course we began to study Hebrew, too, and I picked up a smattering of Hebrew, the alphabet, sentences here, sentences there, so on and so forth, which was good because later on I joined the Stern, and then I studied in Israel for a while in the early ‘50s.</span></p> <p><span id="s2492">Q: Did you want to go to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s2493">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2494">Q: Before leaving Europe and you wanted to go directly to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2495">A: I wanted to go directly to Palestine, if need be, fight.</span> <span id="s2496">I wanted to – we were being prepared in Hamburg for Alijah Bet, illegal immigration because of the-</span></p> <p><span id="s2497">Q: And, you were being trained to fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s2498">A: We were being, not as yet trained to fight, but we did smuggle some radios, this and that that we managed to pick up.</span> <span id="s2499">Nothing very dangerous so far as guns or so, not at this stage of the game, a little later, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2500">Q: And, does your mother know that you’re doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2501">A: My mother didn’t know a thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2502">Q: She-</span></p> <p><span id="s2503">A: No, she was in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s2504">Q: So, this is before.</span></p> <p><span id="s2505">A: This is before, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2506">Q: This is in __________</span></p> <p><span id="s2507">A: Yes, this is in _______________.</span></p> <p><span id="s2508">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2509">A: So, life on the estate was wonderful.</span> <span id="s2510">We had socials.</span> <span id="s2511">I was always looking forward to the socials, the dances, and with certainly what they call in Hebrew _______, the folk dances where the girl has to come and pick you up rather than you to the girl, which I liked very much, and I – no it was very nice, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s2512">Q: So, when you went to Berlin, and you’re going to the school Schlachtensee-</span></p> <p><span id="s2513">A: Schlachtensee</span></p> <p><span id="s2514">Q: Schlachtensee, do you still want to go to Palestine?</span> <span id="s2515">Or are you giving that up a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s2516">A: I am – my mother began to talk to me, and she always said even out of context to me a man without an education is no man.</span> <span id="s2517">It didn’t register very much.</span> <span id="s2518">I thought myself of being highly educated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2519">Q: Right of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2520">A: The illiterate that I was, and then she loved to read books, and she would say to me, “I don’t understand George, how anybody can go through life without reading a book.”</span> <span id="s2521">I said, “I’m not interested, period.</span> <span id="s2522">I wasn’t interested in studying.</span> <span id="s2523">I wasn’t interested in reading.</span> <span id="s2524">I was interested in enjoying life, what life has to offer.</span> <span id="s2525">Then, she said, “Look, until age 21, I’m in charge of you”, but she didn’t put it – she put it in very diplomatic, polite language, “and before you can make up in your mind if you want to go to Israel, but I want you to come with me to America where you can get an education.</span> <span id="s2526">Here in Europe, and you see what Europe is like, we will be lost.</span> <span id="s2527">There’s an opportunity.</span> <span id="s2528">At least you’ll get an education.”</span> <span id="s2529">And “Where are going to in America?”</span> <span id="s2530">She said, “New York.”</span> <span id="s2531">Well, New York was interesting.</span> <span id="s2532">I remembered the films, the speed, the size, the skyscrapers, some of the films.</span> <span id="s2533">The idea was intriguing provided, of course, that eventually I can go to Palestine, to fight if need be.</span> <span id="s2534">She said, “That’s fine, after 21.”</span> <span id="s2535">In the meantime, she would have me, obviously, for six, seven years, I guess to brainwash me.</span> <span id="s2536">So, we decided that we would go to America, and my cousins provided the visas, and actually they paid for us to go second class, business class on either the Queen Mary or the Queen Elizabeth, and the Joint promised that tickets would be issued for us for to go on the Queen Mary or Queen Elizabeth.</span> <span id="s2537">We would go by way of Paris to Marseilles – yeah, Marseilles I think it was – embarkation and – no, not Mar – I don’t remember the port, and the Joint “pocketed” the money.</span></p> <p><span id="s2538">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2539">A: Yeah, but my cousin said later on, “Let’s forget.</span> <span id="s2540">They used it for others.”</span> <span id="s2541">And, we went on the SS Marine Perch which was a troop carrier.</span> <span id="s2542">That was in March 1947.</span> <span id="s2543">We left Berlin together with the Lermans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2544">Q: This is Miles Lerman.</span></p> <p><span id="s2545">A: Chris Lerman.</span></p> <p><span id="s2546">Q: And Renia Laks, who is the sister of Chris.</span></p> <p><span id="s2547">A: Chris’s yeah, and my mother and I.</span> <span id="s2548">We all went together to Bremin.</span> <span id="s2549">We all sort of lived together.</span> <span id="s2550">Aboard ship, Miles and I, we were bunking together, and my mother was bunking with Renia and Chris.</span> <span id="s2551">So, the twelve days, we were also together aboard ship, and then we landed in New York.</span> <span id="s2552">And, I was very disappointed because I was told in Berlin, the night before, you can already see the lights of New York.</span> <span id="s2553">So, the night before, I stood on the deck looking for the lights of New York, and I didn’t see any.</span> <span id="s2554">It was a clear night, and I believed it, and then we docked on 42nd or was it 44th Street and Twelfth Avenue, and these were shacks.</span> <span id="s2555">I was so disappointed, and it was a misty morning.</span> <span id="s2556">I didn’t see any skyscrapers.</span> <span id="s2557">I just saw the West Side Highway.</span> <span id="s2558">This was my first shock of the new world.</span></p> <p><span id="s2559">Q: You thought it was all a fake.</span></p> <p><span id="s2560">A: No, I didn’t think it was a fake, “Where is it?”</span> <span id="s2561">et cetera, and we were awaited there by some relatives who took us to Brooklyn actually, Borough Park where we stayed for six weeks, and my mother didn’t like it.</span> <span id="s2562">So, we moved to Manhattan.</span> <span id="s2563">But, I loved it in Brooklyn in the meantime.</span> <span id="s2564">I was registered there in the New Utrecht High School in Bensonhurst, and there I fell into an interesting group of Jewish activists, so on and so forth, and one thing led to the other, but this is now coming to the United States, already in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s2565">Q: Brooklyn doesn’t have many skyscrapers in comparison with Manhattan.</span></p> <p><span id="s2566">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s2567">Brooklyn didn’t have any.</span> <span id="s2568">There was a Hotel St George, I think that was about twelve or fifteen stories, but nothing like the Empire State Building.</span></p> <p><span id="s2569">Q: How was your English then?</span> <span id="s2570">Was that okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s2571">A: Pretty good.</span> <span id="s2572">It wasn’t good, but I would say it was pretty good.</span> <span id="s2573">I understood, sometimes.</span> <span id="s2574">That’s an interesting story about going to school.</span> <span id="s2575">It was obligatory of us to get a high school degree, and I lived in the district in New Utrecht, and it was an uncle by marriage that took me to New Utrecht, to Brooklyn, and in Bensonhurst, and I was overwhelmed by the most gorgeous teachers in the world who looked to me like seventeen, eighteen, but where actually – they were actually seventeen, eighteen, but I figured they must be in their late 20s or 30s because they had manicured nails.</span> <span id="s2576">In Europe, this was forbidden for students.</span> <span id="s2577">No lipstick permitted, no powder, no mascara, or anything.</span> <span id="s2578">So, I thought that they were all teachers.</span> <span id="s2579">I said, “My god, this is going to be interesting.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2580">Q: And?</span></p> <p><span id="s2581">A: And I registered.</span> <span id="s2582">I was registered and I started only to find out that they were all students, wonderful, one more gorgeous than the other, especially the Italian girls.</span> <span id="s2583">They were young, they’re absolutely gorgeous, and I skipped a lot of grades.</span> <span id="s2584">Hebrew from - they tested me and put me immediately into Hebrew six, the last semester.</span> <span id="s2585">So, I got credits as a foreign language.</span> <span id="s2586">English, I started with English one.</span> <span id="s2587">They put me in the most fundamental course, but was transferred shortly thereafter to English three.</span> <span id="s2588">So, I managed to skip a number of grades.</span> <span id="s2589">History – World War II history, I didn’t read about it, but I knew more than the kids in class.</span> <span id="s2590">In short, I graduated high school, which I would have never been able to do in the gymnasium in less than two years, New Utrecht High School.</span> <span id="s2591">To my mother, this was heaven.</span> <span id="s2592">At least, I have a degree now.</span> <span id="s2593">Now, let’s see where we go from here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2594">Q: Let’s stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2595">End of Tape 10</span></p> <p><span id="s2596">Tape 11</span></p> <p><span id="s2597">Q: Okay, just a couple of things about what people’s impressions of Europeans were like when you came.</span> <span id="s2598">So, the people thought that you lived a very primitive life, I gather.</span></p> <p><span id="s2599">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2600">First of all, I heard the first time the term “coot”</span></p> <p><span id="s2601">Q: “Coot”</span></p> <p><span id="s2602">A: “Coot” and I came home to my uncle and aunt, and I said, “The girls say that I’m a coot.</span> <span id="s2603">What does it mean?”</span> <span id="s2604">Cute, but as I understand it, and never knew the word cute, that I was cute.</span> <span id="s2605">They thought I was cute, et cetera.</span></p> <p><span id="s2606">Q: Well, that’s nice.</span> <span id="s2607">That must have made you feel very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2608">A: Yes, I was delighted, and I sort of reciprocated.</span> <span id="s2609">I don’t know what term I used, but then it was very interesting.</span> <span id="s2610">I had a science teacher who in one day said, “Look how advanced we are and how backward Europe is.</span> <span id="s2611">In Europe, the people don’t even have eyeglasses.”</span> <span id="s2612">I raised my hand and said, “Not so, my brother wore eyeglasses.</span> <span id="s2613">There were eyeglasses.</span> <span id="s2614">I saw many people with eyeglasses.”</span> <span id="s2615">“Oh, you’re dreaming.</span> <span id="s2616">Certainly not in those days before the war, maybe now here and there, but there were no such things as eyeglasses.”</span> <span id="s2617">And, he had eyeglasses and some of the students had eyeglasses.</span> <span id="s2618">We have eyeglasses.</span> <span id="s2619">Then I remember some of the friends that I made over there, I visited their homes in Bensonhurst and in Borough Park, and they said to me, “Look electricity.”</span> <span id="s2620">I said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s2621">And, they were surprised that I was nonplussed by it because they said, “In Europe, you don’t have this.”</span> <span id="s2622">I said, “We had electricity.”</span> <span id="s2623">So, they were thinking that I was spinning, or running water or things like these, and when they asked me how I lived, and originally when I explained, they thought that I was fibbing.</span> <span id="s2624">So, I decided to shut up, and just listen and not say anything because what I encountered here were I guess middle class people who had no inkling what another type of lifestyle may be, and my mother did the same.</span> <span id="s2625">Only among her friends, she had plenty of friends here from pre-war Europe, we knew at our homes, the homes of my relatives, et cetera where the surroundings were sumptuous.</span> <span id="s2626">So, in this milieu, I kept my mouth shut because they just didn’t believe me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2627">Q: Did your mother speak English when she came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s2628">A: Her English was not as good as mine because she grew up with French, and English, she did not participate directly in the tutorials that my brother and I had in Libau, but she was a voracious reader, started immediately to read the newspapers, started immediately to read some of the easy novels, English novels, and picked it up, picked it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2629">Q: Did she play cello when she came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s2630">A: No, she actually thought of getting a job at Radio City Music Hall because the person at that time, his nickname was Pipke.</span> <span id="s2631">He was a friend of the family way back in Latvia.</span> <span id="s2632">What was his name, and he was the head of the music of the orchestra in Radio City Music Hall.</span> <span id="s2633">He converted ____ and my aunt, I remember, telling the story before the war, and I saw Pipke in a train going from Berlin to wherever she was going, and suddenly Pipke is there with a big cross, and I said, “Pipke, what are you doing with this cross?”</span> <span id="s2634">And, he said, “Well, this and that.</span> <span id="s2635">So on and so forth, et cetera, et cetera.”</span> <span id="s2636">But, my mother went to see him, and he knew that my mother played, but she said, “Look, I didn’t play for years.</span> <span id="s2637">It could take me” et cetera, and then he said, “I can offer you something for maybe thirty dollars a month in those days or so.</span> <span id="s2638">She figured because we were living on an allowance from the Joint at that time, and my mother didn’t want to keep on getting money from my relatives.</span> <span id="s2639">She wanted to be independent and we did not – later on we found some moneys back that we had in Europe, but it was a few years later.</span> <span id="s2640">So, it was tough, but she said for thirty dollars, I can’t make ends meet, et cetera.</span> <span id="s2641">So, she declined, and I guess he was just as happy that she declined.</span> <span id="s2642">I assume, but he was prepared to give here – but, she had a very rare cello, my mother, by name – by a man named Schweitzer who did many, many cellos, but only two cellos for women, and my mother had one cello of the two which were taken by the Germans, and she got it from my grandparents when she began the music conservatory, this cello.</span> <span id="s2643">I often claimed, and I don’t know if I’ll ever see anything by it, but the Germans confiscated this as well, this cello.</span></p> <p><span id="s2644">Q: So, did she end up working?</span></p> <p><span id="s2645">A: Yes, she actually for a while, she always loved to stitch maybe a pillow or something, and she was offered something if she wanted to do even at home, if she wants to do some stitching on men’s jackets, working piece work.</span> <span id="s2646">So, she took this and made sometimes a hundred dollars a week, which was a lot of money in those days in the late ‘40s, but once we started finding some of our funds back, not the major ones, et cetera.</span> <span id="s2647">So, things began to be easier.</span> <span id="s2648">The first couple of years were difficult years, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2649">Q: But, then it got easier?</span></p> <p><span id="s2650">A: Then it got easier.</span></p> <p><span id="s2651">Q: When did you join the betar?</span></p> <p><span id="s2652">A: Through the friends that I made in, at Utrecht, New Utrecht.</span> <span id="s2653">It was a very heavily Jewish group over there, quite radical, that accorded with my tastes, and I became very active in betar in the Borough Park Chapter, and then the issue became whether to join ____ or the Stern, and there was a tremendous discord over one issue – the bombing of the King David Hotel.</span> <span id="s2654">The issue was to forewarn the British or not forewarn the British.</span> <span id="s2655">_____ insisted that it was right to forewarn the British even if they would not take the warning seriously.</span> <span id="s2656">As it happened in the case of the King David Hotel, but so that the innocents will not suffer.</span> <span id="s2657">The Sternists argued that all Brits are our enemies, look what they’re doing to us, hardly permitting any Jews to migrate to Palestine, and we are not going to forewarn the Brits.</span> <span id="s2658">And, I was so radicalized over the issue of Jewishness, even though I knew relatively little what it meant, that I joined Stern, and there we seriously trained for all sorts of things including assassination.</span> <span id="s2659">Interesting, before I quit Stern, that was a chapter in itself because I was nearly shot for it – before I quit Stern, we were going to assassinate Sir Gladywn Jebb.</span> <span id="s2660">Sir Gladywn Jebb at that time with a British rep at Lake Success at ____.</span> <span id="s2661">Why were we going to assassinate him, like we assassinated Lloyd Moyne in Egypt in 1944?</span> <span id="s2662">Assassinated Bernadotte?</span> <span id="s2663">Because, not because he was not a nice person.</span> <span id="s2664">He was actually a very nice person, but he represented Britain, Britain’s policies toward the Jews in Palestine.</span> <span id="s2665">So, he was a target, but for various reasons, I quit the Stern group.</span> <span id="s2666">There was a court proceeding.</span></p> <p><span id="s2667">Q: You were court marshaled?</span></p> <p><span id="s2668">A: In a sense, yes, court marshaled for quitting, so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s2669">But – and we were trained here on a farm in Jersey.</span> <span id="s2670">Does the name Josephson mean anything to you?</span> <span id="s2671">Josephson wrote the book, “The Robber Baron’s”, his brother, I think it was Murray, brother’s name, prominent Wall Street lawyer, and his wife.</span> <span id="s2672">They let us – their estate gave us for basic training.</span> <span id="s2673">We were trained by Sternists hiding here in the United States.</span> <span id="s2674">The Brits put the price 5,000 pounds in those days, for their heads, and we were trained.</span> <span id="s2675">We smuggled arms, ammunitions.</span> <span id="s2676">We learned assassination tactics.</span> <span id="s2677">We learned all sorts of things on the estate.</span> <span id="s2678">The FBI and together with Scotland Yard began to discover what we were doing.</span> <span id="s2679">So, we had to empty out or ____ what we called storage place of guns, ammunitions, in the Lower Eastside.</span> <span id="s2680">We dumped it all in the East River.</span> <span id="s2681">Some of my colleagues were caught.</span> <span id="s2682">I was not caught dumping some of the stuff in East River.</span> <span id="s2683">But, an interesting incident happened that affected me very greatly.</span> <span id="s2684">Our headquarters was on Second Avenue, around Eleventh Street, 149 Second Avenue, and there was a ____ right nearby, a little sort of a synagogue which a ___ where students could study the __, and I went there in order to say kaddish for my father, and I come in and the Rabbi said, I said to the Rabbi, “Can you please help me?</span> <span id="s2685">I don’t know how to put on ____, how to put on all the rest.</span> <span id="s2686">I want to say kaddish for my father.”</span> <span id="s2687">“What happened to your father?”</span> <span id="s2688">“He was killed during the war.”</span> <span id="s2689">He said, “They were right to kill your father for not having taught you the Jewish ways.”</span> <span id="s2690">That turned me off.</span> <span id="s2691">I go now, Yom Kippur, once a year to say kaddish to a synagogue, but otherwise I don’t go.</span> <span id="s2692">It’s wrong maybe because of one stupid Rabbi having said this, but it affected me emotionally very, very much, this little incident.</span> <span id="s2693">It wasn’t so much a little incident.</span></p> <p><span id="s2694">Q: It’s a big incident.</span></p> <p><span id="s2695">A: It was a very big incident, and it was right near our headquarters here in New York on Second Avenue I remember, but the reason I decided to quit Stern because after the State of Israel was created, established, Stern decided not to disband, continue as an underground movement.</span> <span id="s2696">Arrogated to itself the right to kill fellow Jews, if they, especially the leaders, if they did not agree to the idea of the Shtei gadot l’jardein meaning two sides of the Jordan, but it’s the old tradition of Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2697">Q: Greater Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2698">A: Greater Palestine, and that was can assassinate those Jews, and after having suffered what I have suffered, et cetera, kill a fellow Jew?</span> <span id="s2699">As young as I was, I had enough brain, and as uneducated as I still was, I had enough brain to say, “That doesn’t sit right.”</span> <span id="s2700">– was reason number one.</span> <span id="s2701">Number two, after the state of Israel was declared to be a sovereign state, the ideological head, somebody by the name of ____ who entered parliament in Israel, too at the time, took us into a Marxist-Leninist mode that this is something that we should strive for, we must strive for.</span> <span id="s2702">It is the ideal world.</span> <span id="s2703">By having lived in a Marxist-Leninist Totalitarian System, even if I didn’t understand it very much, and the hush-hush talks et cetera so that I shouldn’t understand, this also did not sit right.</span> <span id="s2704">So, at a certain moment, I decided to quit because the movement had become my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2705">Q: It had?</span></p> <p><span id="s2706">A: It had where we used to clean our arms and ammunition in my apartment, in my room, and my mother happened to be home and suddenly knocked at the door, and said, “George, may I please see you?”</span> <span id="s2707">And, I came out, and she said, “What are you doing there?”</span> <span id="s2708">I said, “No, we’re just playing some games.”</span> <span id="s2709">“Are you doing something with arms, revolvers or so?”</span> <span id="s2710">I said, “Yes, mother.”</span> <span id="s2711">She said, “You know, my suggestion is at least close the window so the neighbors shouldn’t hear what you’re doing.”</span> <span id="s2712">So, she knew suddenly what it was all about, and I told my mother that when I’m going to be 21, I’ll go to Palestine to fight.</span> <span id="s2713">She said, “When you’ll be 21, we’ll talk about it, but in the meantime you must also get your education.”</span> <span id="s2714">So, I was combining the two.</span> <span id="s2715">Anyways, there was a court marshal of me in a basement on Fifty-First Street, Thirteenth Avenue in Borough Park basement, where I was threatened with my life if ever I were to give up the idea of the two sides of the Jordan, traditional Palestine, if ever I were to approach another member of the Stern group that I knew, if ever I were to disclose anything that transpired here in the United States, and our cell structure, so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s2716">I promised, of course, I wouldn’t do anything of the sort, and they said, “Fine, these are our warnings.”</span> <span id="s2717">And, this came to me as a terrible shock because the movement had become my life, and my closest friends I could no longer see, spend time with, or even talk, and I remember traveling to Brooklyn every morning going to New Utrecht from Manhattan because I loved Brooklyn, and from time to time I would see some on the subway, my buddies, they looked away as if I was a traitor.</span> <span id="s2718">The way the girl looked away when I had the star, and that affected me enormously because the movement was part of my life.</span> <span id="s2719">This withdrawal, for six months I had difficulty sleeping I remember, and then it went on.</span> <span id="s2720">In the meantime, I entered college which I wasn’t very much interested, but the Stern group said that we had to go to City College, why?</span> <span id="s2721">In those days, City College was excellent, because you had a special professor there, Hans Cohen, the father of the study of nationalism, et cetera, and he was teaching there, and some other courses, but especially nationalism, what it’s all about – implications, et cetera, et cetera.</span> <span id="s2722">So, I took the exam and I managed to get in.</span> <span id="s2723">It was an eight hour entrance exam in those days, very tough, but I managed to get in, and I worked at the same time to help out.</span> <span id="s2724">I didn’t want – I knew that my mother was struggling even though she never said a word, et cetera.</span> <span id="s2725">So, I wanted to make some money on the side.</span> <span id="s2726">So, I worked in the library.</span> <span id="s2727">I worked as a runner for a friend of mine, here in the jewelry district who opened a business.</span> <span id="s2728">So, I managed some way or other always to earn between ten and twenty dollars a week on top of studying et cetera.</span> <span id="s2729">So, but I did not have to depend on my mother’s meager income.</span> <span id="s2730">Then, I – at the beginning, it didn’t interest me very much, the studies, but suddenly, something clicked and I began to read voraciously because my mother kept on saying always, “You know, a man for me, is not a man without an education.”</span> <span id="s2731">And would say to me, “How can one really live a life without reading a good book.”</span> <span id="s2732">The literature Pushkin, Lermantov, Thomas Mann et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.</span> <span id="s2733">This is part of life.”</span> <span id="s2734">Because they used to discuss it at dinner tables as a child.</span> <span id="s2735">It didn’t interest me.</span> <span id="s2736">Characters, who cared?</span> <span id="s2737">The character’s in a book.</span> <span id="s2738">Ideas were ridiculous.</span> <span id="s2739">But, suddenly, something snapped, and I couldn’t stop reading, and I began to read a lot, day and night, and what interested me particularly was a history of World War II, and one thing led to the other, led also to literature, led to philosophy, led to even an interest in the sciences.</span> <span id="s2740">For a while, I thought of studying medicine.</span> <span id="s2741">I met a young woman who was going to study medicine.</span> <span id="s2742">Her father was a doctor.</span> <span id="s2743">She was interested in medicine.</span> <span id="s2744">So, I figured I would also take some courses, and I took courses along those lines, but I reacted very poorly to formaldehyde.</span> <span id="s2745">Pus developed under my eyes and we had to dissect pigs and rats, and from all the formaldehyde, I began to get rashes here on the side.</span> <span id="s2746">So, I really had trouble, not that medicine interested me, but I decided to have something in common with the woman that I thought I fancied.</span> <span id="s2747">But, so much the better that I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2748">Q: So, you got yourself a PhD in Political Theory, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2749">A: Well, first, yes, Political Theory because I majored originally in history, then Political Science, and then PhD, actually PhD in Political Science because I had majored in History and I always felt when I became already sort of semi-educated that you can’t be a good Political Scientist without a thorough knowledge of History especially the Western Tradition from Antiquity to the Present, and you could not be a good historian, without an understanding of political relations between and among states, and international relations, so on and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s2750">Q: So, this must have made your mother really happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2751">A: She unfortunately didn’t live to see that I got because my first PhD was rejected as a dissertation, which subsequently was published and is now cited all over the world, and opened up an entirely new field of study in the English speaking world.</span> <span id="s2752">So, I had to write a second dissertation, and that hurts me very, very much that my mother did not see the success subsequently.</span> <span id="s2753">The second PhD got me into foreign policy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2754">Q: I see, and then in the ‘70s, you founded the National Committee on American Foreign Policy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2755">A: American Foreign Policy with the late Hans Morgenthau.</span> <span id="s2756">So, and which I have been now President for the last twelve or thirteen years, but I was one of the founders, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2757">Q: And, you married in ’64.</span></p> <p><span id="s2758">A: Sixty-four yes, a Latvian Jewish girl who lived in Sweden during the war.</span> <span id="s2759">Her maiden name was ____, a prominent Jew in Sweden, head of the Well Jewish Congress in Sweden, who opened negations _____ with Himler, and as a result was able to rescue Jews from ____ Concentration Camp _____.</span> <span id="s2760">You know the story, and then made some deals with Himler over not blowing up camps in the west, especially ____________ which was successful negotiations.</span> <span id="s2761">So, he made a contribution to history, especially Jewish history, no question about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2762">Q: And, the two of you have three boys, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2763">A: Triplets, triplet sons.</span> <span id="s2764">We had a fourth one that unfortunately didn’t make it.</span> <span id="s2765">So, yes, and they’re all thank God, healthy and successful.</span> <span id="s2766">So, I really can’t complain.</span> <span id="s2767">I count my blessings.</span></p> <p><span id="s2768">Q: Well, I wish we could go on, but it would take us another five or six hours.</span> <span id="s2769">So, I think we have to do that at another time, and I really want to thank you so much for being willing and able to speak with us.</span> <span id="s2770">It’s really been a pleasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2771">A: My pleasure and my privilege to have done this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2772">Q: A privilege for me.</span> <span id="s2773">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2774">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s2775">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2776">End of Tape 11</span></p> <p><span

George.</span></p> <p><span id="s2826">A: This was in Riga in 1940.</span> <span id="s2827">It was nothing unusual.</span> <span id="s2828">It was a get together with some friends and mainly members of the family.</span> <span id="s2829">My brother is right there.</span> <span id="s2830">My uncles and aunts and some people who I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s2831">My aunt is also there –

liberation, where I’m still as I look at it pretty emaciated and that of course is during World War II, during the tough days of World War II, but also with a certain sadness in my eyes, I see, really not knowing the direction I want to go, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s2842">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2843">A: This was me in Hamburg, _____ on or near the Warburg Estate, and what I’m

house of the Warburg Estate, and that’s where I used to reside, in the white house for a while.</span> <span id="s2855">I never resided in the red house, but for a while I also resided in the guest house.</span></p> <p><span id="s2856">Q: That’s quite a coat.</span></p> <p><span id="s2857">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2858">Q: Okay, George.</span></p> <p><span id="s2859">A: Yes, this

id="s2862">Here, yes, this is one of the pictures, and the man with the hat was another of the teachers accompanying us.</span> <span id="s2863">The others were all students from my class including Renia then known as Laks, now known as Renia Gelb who lives in New York City.</span></p> <p><span id="s2864">Q:</span></p> <p><span id="s2865">A: And, then there are the two women with Renia.</span> <span id="s2866">This one – yes, no, this one – yes, and then Tunia Rybak, and Rachelka Feigenbaum, next to Renia, to the right of Renia.</span> <span id="s2867">These were the three ladies who used to go nightclubbing in Berlin, et cetera, who sort of dismissed me outright when I wanted to tag along thinking that I was too young, perhaps not all that sophisticated at the time or whatever, but that was the “normal life” at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2868">Q:</span></p> <p><span id="s2869">A: This was in Berlin 1947, Summer ’46.</span></p> <p><span id="s2870">Q: When was this
