I will.</span> <span id="s8">My father is a..</span> <span id="s9">.</span> <span id="s10">was a reserve officer in the Norwegian Navy.</span> <span id="s11">He was an engineer.</span> <span id="s12">He spent many years in South America, in Chile.</span> <span id="s13">When I was a very young child, I lived in Chile.</span> <span id="s14">When I came back to Norway, I was about 8 years of age and I went to school in Norway with other children.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">I: When would that be?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">R: That must have been in 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">I: Um...hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">R: Or something like that.</span> <span id="s19">Before the War.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">I: And then, in 1939, of course, the war between Germany and England began, and my father was then immediately brought out into active duty.</span> <span id="s21">And, um...I have a brother who was two years younger than myself and my mother and I lived alone in Oslo while he was away in the service.</span> <span id="s22">And, then, on the 9th of April, 1940, Germany attacked Norway.</span> <span id="s23">On the night before that attack, we had a phone call.</span> <span id="s24">We had a telephone in the hall, I remember.</span> <span id="s25">And I happened to go by the phone, as it rang, and I picked it up, and it was my Daddy’s voice, saying, “Anita, we are at active war...” and then he was cut off.</span> <span id="s26">So, I said to my mother, “That was Daddy, and he says we are at active war.”</span> <span id="s27">My mother says, “Can it...can it be true?</span> <span id="s28">How can it be true?</span> <span id="s29">Why would he say that?”</span> <span id="s30">“Well, the line was cut...” Well, she was a little anxious about it and she called a few people and so on...and so forth... In the night of that night, we woke up at about two o’clock when we were being bombed.</span> <span id="s31">Oslo was being bombed, and we had a tremendous avalanche of people coming out of the city...I lived outside of the city...in a city [ ] we lived on a mountain, out of the city.</span> <span id="s32">And, people were walking, in April, in underwear and nightgowns and robes, undressed, just disrupted from their lives.</span> <span id="s33">I can remember my mother feeding a bunch of people that day.</span> <span id="s34">They just happened to go by and tried to get out.</span> <span id="s35">And, radios were calling for all children to be out of the city, and I, and myself, and a cousin, and a bunch of children, I think eight other children...we...I had never driven a car.</span> <span id="s36">My father had a Packard.</span> <span id="s37">It sat in the garage.</span> <span id="s38">My brother was two years younger than me and he knew all about the clutch, but he wasn’t tall enough...and I had a pillow behind me and I drove the car for the first time in my life.</span> <span id="s39">It was a stick shift type, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">I: You were about twelve years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">R: No, I was thirteen, almost fourteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">I: Fourteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">R: I was going on fourteen.</span> <span id="s44">And, um...we drove out of town.</span> <span id="s45">We drove to a farm, in a farm area, where we stayed for a few weeks till we were allowed to come back during this time.</span> <span id="s46">I remember my mother gave me 100 Norwegian kronen.</span> <span id="s47">It was like a big bill.</span> <span id="s48">And, I went and stopped for gas, and I forgot to take the change, and I went off without a cent.</span> <span id="s49">But, I got the change back when we came back to the city.</span> <span id="s50">And, it wasn’t very long after that, after the Germans had occupied Norway, they withdrew all radios and all kinds of things that had to do with communication plus we had no TV in those days.</span> <span id="s51">It was just radio.</span> <span id="s52">My brother and I had a little radio.</span> <span id="s53">We had made a cave in the bottom of our garden.</span> <span id="s54">We had a very large piece of land, wooded land.</span> <span id="s55">And we had dug a cave - as children.</span> <span id="s56">That we had to crawl into on our bellies.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">I: Um...hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">R: And, we had a little radio there.</span> <span id="s59">We had put a long outside extension line from an out garage-house.</span> <span id="s60">In there, we had covered it with earth, so nobody could see...and we had electric down there.</span> <span id="s61">And, of course, when they withdrew all the radios and everything we had in the house, nobody knew about this one.</span> <span id="s62">So, it was there all through the war, and during the war, an adult came every evening, at 11 o’clock, crawled through the hole, and took...”This is London with the news,” and they took stenography, and someone made a stencil thing, and they made the underground newspaper.</span> <span id="s63">From that little radio.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">I: From your little radio.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">R: One of the last newspapers we had.</span> <span id="s66">My brother was a deliverer of that newspaper.</span> <span id="s67">It was a very risky business.</span> <span id="s68">It was the death penalty for that job.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">I: Yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">R: And, um...I was approached by one of my teachers.</span> <span id="s71">I was in what you call Junior High School here, I guess Middle School.</span> <span id="s72">And they all knew their students pretty well.</span> <span id="s73">____ was not a very large area.</span> <span id="s74">Even though it was in the city, it was in the suburb.</span> <span id="s75">And, we had only one teacher that everybody knew was Nazi and we were very cautious about.</span> <span id="s76">When this teacher approached me...</span></p> <p><span id="s77">I: That was not the Nazi, but another teacher...</span></p> <p><span id="s78">R: No, no.</span> <span id="s79">And, told me that, would I be willing to work in the underground.</span> <span id="s80">They knew my father was...um...by that time my father had been picked up.</span> <span id="s81">He was in jail...the longest living prisoner of war, when the war was over...that lived...</span></p> <p><span id="s82">I: Um, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">R: And, so, he was gone five years - my father - he was in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s84">It was only in the last six months of the war that he was removed from the concentration camp to a prisoner of war camp, which is much more classy, of course.</span> <span id="s85">Both air and sun and food, which he didn’t get in all the others.</span> <span id="s86">These teachers knew my background and asked if I was interested.</span> <span id="s87">And, I said, “Of course.”</span> <span id="s88">And, I was pretty good on skis.</span> <span id="s89">So, the first year, my duties were to pick up C-rations, bandages, medicines, ampules, things that you give people that are not wounded, and even foods, all kinds of different foods.</span> <span id="s90">We had them in rucksacks and we would go through the German barricades, and we would be like little Red Riding Hood, almost.</span> <span id="s91">We were going to my Grandma.</span> <span id="s92">And, I went through the barricade that first winter.</span> <span id="s93">Of course, it was nerve-racking because it was dangerous if they ever checked your rucksack - you...you’ve had it... And my mother was a very nervous lady.</span> <span id="s94">She was not very strong in that department.</span> <span id="s95">So, when we were put to bed at night, like all children were, at normal time... As soon as lights were out and everything, I could jump out of a window in the second story, onto a shed roof, in which we had our skis.</span> <span id="s96">And, I would get my skis and I would run on skis to my station where I got what I had to pick up and then I ran on skis through the night but I was alone...I was afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">I: Always alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">R: Always alone.</span> <span id="s99">And, a few times...I had two pretty close calls in which the owls were my only friends.</span> <span id="s100">That’s why I was so interested in owls.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">I: Explain a little bit about the owls as your friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">R: Well, I had to run up high in the mountains where they were you would call guerrillas today...you know those people... And, they had no...later on, in the war, they had drops from London where they got everything from planes.</span> <span id="s103">That first winter, there really wasn’t anything...</span></p> <p><span id="s104">I: This was the winter of 1941...</span></p> <p><span id="s105">R: 1941.</span> <span id="s106">And, see, we were in the war before America.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">I: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">R: And, uh... So, when you came up there, we always had these runs in the moon - when the moon was full because you could see with the moon.</span> <span id="s109">Also, you were also a much easier target.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">I: That’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">R: So, when we came up beyond the tree line, you were a very open target.</span> <span id="s112">You threw a long shadow and it was very still and very quiet and very cold up there.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">I: Um, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">R: And, occasionally, because owls are up at night.</span> <span id="s115">They fly at night and see well.</span> <span id="s116">And, they would act like there was other people but me.</span> <span id="s117">You know what I mean...you have a feeling that there is some activity here.</span> <span id="s118">And, I would rush back into the bushes to a certain spot and I could hear bullets go off.</span> <span id="s119">You could hear them go “Cheee...eeee” you know, in the cold air.</span> <span id="s120">And it was pretty frightening.</span> <span id="s121">You know.</span> <span id="s122">I was afraid.</span> <span id="s123">Then, I would get back before daybreak and I would get back i my bed, so I could get up when the alarm went off.</span> <span id="s124">Then, I would go to school.</span> <span id="s125">But, my teachers, they all...everybody in school knew...</span></p> <p><span id="s126">I: But your mother didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">R: Except this teacher that was Nazi, and I was allowed to sleep through every class.</span> <span id="s128">I slept on my desk.</span> <span id="s129">Everybody knew.</span> <span id="s130">Many children in my class did the same.</span> <span id="s131">I wasn’t the only one.</span> <span id="s132">We all had different duties, depending on our talents.</span> <span id="s133">And, I took courage [ ] those things.</span> <span id="s134">And, so that’s how come I got involved with the owls, and then, when the first Christmas came, after that my brother carved me my first owl.</span> <span id="s135">And he had these two black marbles that he loved.</span> <span id="s136">When he played “immies,” you know, and it was a big honor to get those two black “immies” as eyes for my first owl.</span> <span id="s137">So, I cherished that, and from then on, I got this owl collection.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">I: Because they saved your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">R: I felt that they were sort of special.</span> <span id="s140">They were special - they took care of me and watched over me, and it was in the second year, in 1942, that I got involved in the Jewish movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">I: How did that happen?</span> <span id="s142">Had you had any contact with Jews beforehand?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">R: No.</span> <span id="s144">But I had contact with people in the underground.</span> <span id="s145">And, you see, when the job I did that first winter ceased, there was really no need for it any more, thank goodness, because it was getting very risky, also.</span> <span id="s146">I was lucky not to get caught.</span> <span id="s147">And, the people that I took my orders from - and they were all a whole network of people, they knew what type of a little girl I was, and I was asked if [ ] and they knew I could handle skis.</span> <span id="s148">So, what I did, in my part, was, I had a dog that was what they call a pull dog.</span> <span id="s149">It was trained to pull sleds when people are wounded in the ski...Sundays and stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">They were special dogs and I had a dog - that was my dog that was trained, and I had a sled.</span> <span id="s151">So, a person that we were trying to get over, for example, to the Swedish border, that couldn’t ski or couldn’t even walk in the snow, much less - you know, they were just not able.</span> <span id="s152">They could be pulled on those sleds.</span> <span id="s153">We pulled many people on those sleds.</span> <span id="s154">And, we guided the dogs along, of course.</span> <span id="s155">Through the woods - towards the Swedish border.</span> <span id="s156">You had to get across the Swedish border in the areas where there were very few German guards.</span> <span id="s157">At the border, they were thick in some areas where there was a lot of population.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">I: Um, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">R: You had to get away from where the population was to get people across and be able to get them safely across.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">I: And, you were met on the other side...</span></p> <p><span id="s161">R: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s162">By all kinds of men.</span> <span id="s163">My job was simply to get them to the border and through.</span> <span id="s164">And, I didn’t have to worry them after that.</span> <span id="s165">But, of course, I wasn’t doings this entirely alone.</span> <span id="s166">I mean, this was not one-on-one - this was groups of people that did this.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">I: So, there were a group of you who would meet with your dogs and sleds.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">R: Yes, oh, yes.</span> <span id="s169">And there were adults.</span> <span id="s170">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s171">Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">I: You were what, fifteen at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">[ ] ...that time, was still in Norway - I mean, he was a prisoner, and he was in the old prison, where the convicts used to be before the war, but, he was the head of the movement, getting the Jews out of the jail.</span> <span id="s174">Some of the people we got across, and I didn’t know it until many years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">I: How did they ever work that?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">R: I really don’t k now how.</span> <span id="s177">My father did an awful lot of those things once he became what you call a trusted prisoner.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">I: Um, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">R: He had been there so long and he was an officer.</span> <span id="s180">So, he got a lot of people moved around and checked on and like that.</span> <span id="s181">so, that’s how I got into that.</span> <span id="s182">Strangely enough, one of my dearest friends from childhood was a young boy by the name of Maurice Personsky.</span> <span id="s183">I don’t know why it never occurred to me.</span> <span id="s184">He was dark-skinned and dark-haired and brown-eyed and a darling, darling person.</span> <span id="s185">And, one day, I am sitting in class, in school, and the door knocks and in come these two Germans, with the clicking of the heels and “Heil,” and all this stuff.</span> <span id="s186">And call up Personsky, and the minute they said it, I thought, here I am pushing everybody out of the way, and here I sit next to the boy I was raised...literally raised with...he was raised two streets away from me.</span> <span id="s187">And, of course, I never saw him again.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">I: Hm...</span></p> <p><span id="s189">R: But, so that was how I got into it.</span> <span id="s190">And it was, uh...well, I loved it.</span> <span id="s191">I thought I did something wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">I: It was.</span> <span id="s193">How long were you involved in this?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">R: Well, I was involved in the Jewish movement for over a year.</span> <span id="s195">Over a year.</span> <span id="s196">There were all kinds of things that I could do and help.</span> <span id="s197">I can remember...we had...I had an aunt.</span> <span id="s198">We lost our house.</span> <span id="s199">The Germans took our house and I had an aunt who lived in an old, old fashioned apartment in the downtown area and she had a back step, you know, back stairs in which they used to have maid’s quarters, you know.</span> <span id="s200">And, in the maid quarters we had a lady who was the wife of the director of the Continental Hotel.</span> <span id="s201">A lovely lady by the name of Mrs. Bauman who lived in that room alone for months, before we could get her across to the Swedish border.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">I: Can you describe the operation a little?</span> <span id="s203">Where did you meet these people?</span> <span id="s204">Was there a central point?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">R: Yes, there were several central points.</span> <span id="s206">I had one central point was at the lady who was the guard at the ladies’ room at a restaurant downtown, who was the lady who gave you a towel, and you put a quarter in the dish.</span> <span id="s207">She gave me a lot of instructions.</span> <span id="s208">I had...I could go in from the street and like...as if I was in the restaurant and use the toilet and the lady would wait and give me my messages that I would have to do.</span> <span id="s209">That was one person that I constantly went back to and got new orders from about where to do and what to do.</span> <span id="s210">And, we didn’t use our names.</span> <span id="s211">We didn’t use real names.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">I: What was your name?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">R: One time I was Bette, like Bette Davis, and one time, I had another sort of very exotic name, Sarina, or something like that, that isn’t a bit Norwegian.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">I: Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">R: Not at all.</span> <span id="s216">Something like that.</span> <span id="s217">I didn’t have it very long.</span> <span id="s218">Bette was what I went by the most, and I even, years later, when I came home to Norway one year, when I was traveling the world, I walked down the street and someone called, “Bette, Bette!”</span> <span id="s219">and I looked around and it was someone that I knew from the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">I: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s221">R: A young man that only knew me under that name.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">I: Only knew you as Bette.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">R: After the war, when we told my mother.</span> <span id="s224">My brother did this underground movement with the newspaper and all kinds of other things that he was into, but primarily the newspaper.</span> <span id="s225">That was his...he was in charge of that.</span> <span id="s226">But he was two years younger than I was, so he had a big job for a little boy.</span> <span id="s227">And, when we told our mother after the war, she did not believe us.</span> <span id="s228">She said, “This cannot have happened right underneath my nose.”</span> <span id="s229">And it did.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">I: But it did.</span> <span id="s231">And it was a wonderful thing that she didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">R: Yes, if she was the nervous kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Well, she wouldn’t have.</span> <span id="s234">She would not have been able to stand the strain, you know.</span> <span id="s235">It is not that she would have meant...she wouldn’t have squealed on us...</span></p> <p><span id="s236">I: Oh, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">R: ...but she would not have been able to handle it.</span> <span id="s238">And, who knew in those days, anybody that was picked up by the Germans were often tortured to speak, and nobody was allowed to talk about those things.</span> <span id="s239">It is so long ago, you know, that I remember so many little vignettes that I heard stories by other people that had things happen to them.</span> <span id="s240">We had some close calls.</span> <span id="s241">I was once very flippant.</span> <span id="s242">You know, youngsters do things that are so foolish when I think back.</span> <span id="s243">We used to wear little red woolen caps.</span> <span id="s244">They were the sign of the anti-Nazi.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">So, all of Norwegian children wear a red ski cap with a little tassel on it and they became sort of a symbol.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">I: Uh, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">R: And we used to... The Germans used to pull them off our heads.</span> <span id="s248">So, we used to put them on with hairpins.</span> <span id="s249">They literally scalped us to pull these things off.</span> <span id="s250">Plus, we annoyed them and, one time, I was...I was a fool.</span> <span id="s251">I was on a bicycle and I was stopped by a German officer who was standing near us.</span> <span id="s252">And he says to me, “Tell me the road to so and so.”</span> <span id="s253">Of course, most of them knew we spoke German because we had German in school - as well as we had English in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">I: Uh, huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">R: He wanted to know the directions to such and such and such and such.</span> <span id="s256">I knew very well where that was and I turned to him and I said to him, in German, “May I answer in English?”</span></p> <p><span id="s257">I: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s258">R: And he said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s259">And I said, “I don’t know.”</span> <span id="s260">And he grabbed a hold of my red cap and almost drew all my hair out of my head.</span> <span id="s261">And things like that.</span> <span id="s262">It was not very wise, but this is the sort of pranks that youngsters do.</span> <span id="s263">Well, we were very smart.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">I: It also relieved some tension, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">R: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s266">In fact, there was a lot of laughter.</span> <span id="s267">When I think about those heavy days, we didn’t have much fun.</span> <span id="s268">We didn’t have fun in the same manner as young people.</span> <span id="s269">Teen-agers have fun normally, but we had a lot of laughs and enjoyment, making fun and jokes of all this sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">I: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">R: They were not...I suppose they were not so bad considering they were an occupation force.</span> <span id="s272">But, we used to do funny, funny things.</span> <span id="s273">We had bunkers.</span> <span id="s274">You know, places where people would go in case of bomb attacks.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">I: Uh, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">R: And, often the German soldiers would be in one of those, sort of smooching with a girl, and we would open the door and call, “Raus!”</span> <span id="s277">And everybody would jump, you know, because they were very, very worried about their superiors.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">I: How...you said you were involved in the movement of Jews for about a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">R: Yes, about a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">I: About how many people did you help, or did you lose track?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">R: Oh, I..</span> <span id="s282">.</span> <span id="s283">I don’t know exactly, but I would say, several hundred.</span> <span id="s284">And, you know, we didn’t have many Jews in Norway compared to other countries.</span> <span id="s285">The ones we had were very, very Norwegian.</span> <span id="s286">They had been in Norway for years.</span> <span id="s287">I can remember when the Danish King, you know, said... and when they issued the proclamation that every Jew has to wear an armband...</span></p> <p><span id="s288">I: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">R: ...with a star of David on it, and, we followed suit there.</span> <span id="s290">And I can remember when I got mine.</span> <span id="s291">I said, “What does it mean, that blue star?”</span> <span id="s292">That’s how little I knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">I: Um, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">R: But, it’s funny that since then, I was in Israel.</span> <span id="s295">I was in Palestine the night it became Israel.</span> <span id="s296">I flew into...I became an airline stewardess and I flew into the Middle East.</span> <span id="s297">In and out.</span> <span id="s298">In fact, I flew all those horrible people into the Nuremberg process.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">I: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">R: I met some of the most...worst people on earth that were sent...</span></p> <p><span id="s301">I: ... The ones who were coming in were there to be tried.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">R: Yes, I remember a lady by the name of Eve Montbeliesse.</span> <span id="s303">She was really a terror and she had gloves on.</span> <span id="s304">They were made from human skin and had a man’s nipple on top of the glove.</span> <span id="s305">Just enough to...it’s just not explainable how you feel about people like that.</span> <span id="s306">You can’t imagine it.</span> <span id="s307">It’s gets me upset to this day and it’s forty years ago, or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">I: Easily.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">R: So, um...</span></p> <p><span id="s310">I: Have you ever had any contact with any of the people you helped cross?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">R: Never, never.</span> <span id="s312">I met a lady many years later, flying out of...from Amsterdam out to Batavia, out to the Far East.</span> <span id="s313">Her name was Berenstein.</span> <span id="s314">And, she swore that she knew me.</span> <span id="s315">And, I did not remember her.</span> <span id="s316">But she says, “I know I met you.”</span> <span id="s317">I do not know whether she had a dream, but as far as I could figure out from her talk, she had not been...she had been to Sweden.</span> <span id="s318">She had not come over from Norway.</span> <span id="s319">So, I don’t know where she knew me, but that’s the only person that ever even mentioned it to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">I: And you have no idea what happened to these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">R: No.</span> <span id="s322">I met a lot of people during that time, directly after.</span> <span id="s323">All the European Jews will all try, ...once Israel became a country...they will all wanted to go to Israel, and then they went back and forth because they had so many problems there.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">I: Yes, it was very primitive.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">R: In and out...so many times I met the same people twice.</span> <span id="s326">took them in and took them out.</span> <span id="s327">Once or twice I took them back again the third time, but, uh, no, I never did.</span> <span id="s328">But, I had the horrible experience of coming to see several concentration camps, and it was enough to make me feel that, well, I think I became an atheist there.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">I: Um.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">R: I felt how can this possibly be?</span> <span id="s331">How can there be a God in this sadness?</span> <span id="s332">How can these be God’s chosen people?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">I: There have been several people who had had similar experiences visiting the camps - before they were prettied up.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">R: It’s funny I should marry an American Jew, who spent years in Europe, in the war, and he was one of the first men to open the doors at Buchenwald, and he...when he did, he had his pockets full of stuff and he gave a man a can of sardines.</span> <span id="s335">After he...he was so thin that he said it is not possible to describe what this man looked like, and he said, “Oh, I gave him this can of sardines.</span> <span id="s336">He opens it up.</span> <span id="s337">They are like wild.</span> <span id="s338">Everybody is trying to pounce on him and he eats the sardines and he died right there.”</span> <span id="s339">And then the loudspeakers went off and they said, “Don’t feed these people.</span> <span id="s340">Don’t give them anything.</span> <span id="s341">They can’t tolerate.”</span></p> <p><span id="s342">I: They can’t tolerate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">R: And, I know that, because when the war was over, and we got this...we got the Marshall help from America, every youngster in Norway got a quart of peanut butter.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">I: That’s a lot of peanut butter.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">R: And, I took mine with a tablespoon and sat down and started to eat it.</span> <span id="s346">I didn’t get too far, but I got far enough that I almost collapsed...I almost died.</span> <span id="s347">They had to get me pumped.</span> <span id="s348">I was rushed to the hospital and after that, I was sent to a farm, a sort of camp place, outside Oslo, where they sent children that have been in concentration camps, and we were fed.</span> <span id="s349">I was there for six weeks.</span> <span id="s350">Every day, some new thing was added to your diet, so that I learned to assimilate fat, and I can imagine how...that is very important.</span> <span id="s351">You simply cannot eat anything fat when you haven’t had anything to eat for so long...</span></p> <p><span id="s352">I: There were many problems that arose when the people coming out of the camps were fed.</span> <span id="s353">They had to learn how to feed them.</span> <span id="s354">Were the conditions so difficult in Norway, toward the end of the war, that...</span></p> <p><span id="s355">R: Well, we didn’t have an awful lot to eat.</span> <span id="s356">You see, what happened was we had ration cards, but there was nothing to be had any more.</span> <span id="s357">I remember, my brother and I used to take turns, when we could, of lining up for fish, which is, of course, Norway is oozing with fish normally.</span> <span id="s358">We would line up.</span> <span id="s359">Let’s say, I would start in the evening, at 7 o’clock, to line up, and he would relieve me in the morning, like 1 o’clock or 2 o’clock, and he would be there until the store opened up.</span> <span id="s360">And when the store opened up...they had nothing.</span> <span id="s361">And we ate a lot of things like turnips, that was kohlrabi, that’s fried in cod liver oil...</span></p> <p><span id="s362">I: Um, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">R: And pretty awful stuff.</span> <span id="s364">And we ate a lot of potatoes.</span> <span id="s365">And this very heavy weird bread that has a lot of wood in it.</span> <span id="s366">You know, they used the wood...</span></p> <p><span id="s367">I: Um, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">R: It’s cellulose.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">U: Yes, it’s cellulose.</span> <span id="s370">How long were you actually involved in the movement of Jews across the border?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">R: I would think about a year, approximately.</span> <span id="s372">Maybe a few more months than that.</span> <span id="s373">I guess it was getting more towards the end of the war.</span> <span id="s374">There weren’t ... Probably, the people that weren’t already picked up...there were no more...</span></p> <p><span id="s375">I: There were no more use for it.</span> <span id="s376">There were no more people needing it at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">R: And, I was getting to the point where I had to get my papers and graduation and I did more school work, but any time there was anything I could do.</span> <span id="s378">There was less need because they were becoming very proficient from England.</span> <span id="s379">They had professionals doing these things.</span> <span id="s380">So that they had the youngsters that had worked so hard...we sort of got the bonus.</span> <span id="s381">“You’ve done your turn and now you can do some school work.”</span> <span id="s382">You know we let our own work, really everything fall into shambles.</span> <span id="s383">So, the two first years of the war were the heaviest for me.</span> <span id="s384">It was really difficult because I never had a home during the war.</span> <span id="s385">We had moved out...we had a summer house on the fjord that was not meant for living in the winter.</span> <span id="s386">It had no water.</span> <span id="s387">So we had to... The water pipes were far off because they were on top of the ground and, of course, everything freezes.</span> <span id="s388">So, we almost froze to death.</span> <span id="s389">We ended up moving to this aunt who had this big apartment, and I remember sleeping in the hall, in a place next to the window, on sort of a love-seat.</span> <span id="s390">We were sore of middle-class.</span> <span id="s391">We were...we had a pretty nice lift before the war.</span> <span id="s392">So, I wasn’t accustomed to roughing it to that extent.</span> <span id="s393">But, we had...it really worked out very well and sometimes I wonder if it doesn’t make a strong person.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">I: Well, that’s sort of the hard way.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">R: Yes, it is.</span> <span id="s396">I wouldn’t want it [ ].</span></p> <p><span id="s397">I: Having been to Israel, are you familiar with Yad Vashem?</span> <span id="s398">This is the memorial to the six million Jews that were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">R: That was after my time.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">I: Yes.</span> <span id="s401">There is also a road that is lined on either side with beautiful trees.</span> <span id="s402">And, each tree has been planted in honor or in memory of a non-Jew who helped Jews escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">R: I have heard this story.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">I: Do you know if you are listed there?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">R: I am sure I am not.</span> <span id="s406">I have never...I have never told anybody these things.</span> <span id="s407">I mean, uh...like the lady who told you about me.</span> <span id="s408">It must have come about because she asked me about my house, possibly, and maybe my husband.</span> <span id="s409">My husband died a year ago, and, he, of course, being a Jew, he heard a lot of stories about me, especially when we went home to Norway, and we would meet friends, and they would say, “You know your wife did this and that and the other thing.”</span> <span id="s410">They were not really things I told him so much...and I would have forgotten...and my Dad was...has...had his story, which I thought was much more interesting than mine.</span> <span id="s411">And so, no, I haven’t, and I heard about that.</span> <span id="s412">You know, I was in Israel in 1948 when it became Israel, and years before, from 1945 to ‘48, I flew in and out of Israel every month, but then it was Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">I: Um, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">R: And then, I ws there until about ‘51, ‘52.</span> <span id="s415">But I have not been back since.</span> <span id="s416">That’s many years ago.</span> <span id="s417">Things have changed tremendously.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">I: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">R: I have a sister-in-law, who was just there last year.</span> <span id="s420">She showed me pictures of places that...</span></p> <p><span id="s421">I: ...weren’t there.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">R: ...that weren’t there.</span> <span id="s423">Yah.</span> <span id="s424">It is just a whole new place.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">I: There is this very beautiful avenue called The Avenue of the Righteous Gentiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">R: What a nice thing that is.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">I: It was very important because there were many lives that were saved this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">R: Yah.</span> <span id="s429">I can remember hearing about the Swede...um...Wallenburg.</span> <span id="s430">I even heard about him during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">I: Oh, really, we didn’t hear about him until much, much later.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">R: I heard about him...maybe I heard about him through someone who had connections with the Swedish people there.</span> <span id="s433">You know, he came from Sweden and I guess we were told stories.</span> <span id="s434">We heard so many stories.</span> <span id="s435">I can remember those nights when we would listen to the news from London, and Mr. Churchill was on.</span> <span id="s436">I was totally taken with him and his voice.</span> <span id="s437">And, when he would say, “We will fight them on the beaches...” Ach...he gave such inspiration.</span> <span id="s438">You know, we would have done anything.</span> <span id="s439">In those years, we lived in a fjord, where it was so cold we had to take a fjord bus.</span> <span id="s440">There was no way to get to this island without this fjord bus.</span> <span id="s441">It was like a little boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">I: Uh, huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">R: And, my husband went with me.</span> <span id="s444">I showed him where we lived and he said, “I cannot believe this.”</span> <span id="s445">In order to get the bus, I could get to school.</span> <span id="s446">See, the schools were doubled up.</span> <span id="s447">So that, I had to go to school from like 2 in the afternoon until 6 in the after...evening, or something like that...or 7 in the evening.</span> <span id="s448">And, in order to do that, I couldn’t get on the morning bus, so I had to get up, like 4 in the morning to get on the bus, that would leave at 6 or something from where I had get to the water...to the pier.</span> <span id="s449">And, then I had to wait at the pier till my time to go to school.</span> <span id="s450">And, then I missed the evening bus...the afternoon...so I had to wait for a night...that would leave at 9, and wouldn’t get home until almost 10.</span> <span id="s451">So, it was a very long day.</span> <span id="s452">Yes.</span> <span id="s453">And, um, I took my husband down to see a bunker, that I knew was used during the war.</span> <span id="s454">We once hid people in it, that was made in the first World War.</span> <span id="s455">It wasn’t made by our Germans.</span> <span id="s456">It was just something that had been there since before the war and I knew about it, and I took him down to see it.</span> <span id="s457">And, he stood there, I remember, and looked at this tough granite barrier, and he looked at the fjord and he said, “No wonder you are tough.”</span> <span id="s458">Of course, I was so little that I didn’t look very tough.</span> <span id="s459">And, I don’t think I am tough but, but, I suppose, with that kind of life, maybe it makes you tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">I: It does.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">R: Um, hum.</span> <span id="s462">It does something.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">I: You learn a good idea of self reliance and how to live on your own.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">R: I’ll tell you you are very grateful that you are alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">I: Yes, I don’t think people realize what you go through.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">R: No.</span> <span id="s467">I can remember, in 194-, in 1940, when the war broke out, the German ship, by the name of Misher, was bombed.</span> <span id="s468">it was torpedoed, in the fjord, in the narrow neck of the fjord, and it was oozing with dead people, and they were German soldiers, and it was springtime...it was fall...and we were requested from the school, all children, able-bodied, had to go down and help clear up the fjord.</span> <span id="s469">And drag all these corpses out of the water.</span> <span id="s470">And, it was a horrendous experience.</span> <span id="s471">I was not yet 14, and, you see...you saw limbs, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s472">I: Uh, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">R: I hadn’t so much of a problem with the bodies...the whole body...as with parts of the body...hands floating by themselves...and legs with boots on...and stuff.</span> <span id="s474">It just was enough to make it kind of tough for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">I: It can destroy you, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">R: Yah.</span> <span id="s477">So, we had some of those things.</span> <span id="s478">And I am so glad I came out of it alive, and I came out of it with my eyes.</span> <span id="s479">I was always so worried when we would have any kind of bombing, that I would keep my eyes.</span> <span id="s480">I would make prayers...just don’t take away my eyes...</span></p> <p><span id="s481">I: ...let me see.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">R: ...let me see.</span> <span id="s483">But, so, of course, when the peace broke loose, it was a wonderful day.</span> <span id="s484">It was five long years.</span> <span id="s485">It seemed long.</span> <span id="s486">I was almost twenty years of age when it was over.</span> <span id="s487">My whole youth was just about...it was gone.</span> <span id="s488">I was an adult by then.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">I: And it was the same for your brother, and all...everyone who worked with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">R: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">I: Everyone of them worked with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">R: Yes.</span> <span id="s493">They all did.</span> <span id="s494">And, uh...and most of the young people were very supportive and very good.</span> <span id="s495">Of course, there were some that fraternized with the Germans.</span> <span id="s496">I remember we shaved heads.</span> <span id="s497">In 1944, I remember a girl I went to grade school with.</span> <span id="s498">We had her pegged all through the years.</span> <span id="s499">During the war, “We’re going to get Jerry...” you know, and I can remember, wanting to, and yet, when it was done, I was so upset.</span> <span id="s500">It was...They walk around with babushkas...they are all...</span></p> <p><span id="s501">I: And then, you knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">R: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s503">It was just like a stamp.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">I: But, it must be a good feeling to know that there were people who made it out because of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">R: Oh, wonderful!</span> <span id="s506">Wonderful feeling.</span> <span id="s507">And I want to tell you that I learned to love those people.</span> <span id="s508">they had such inner courage themselves.</span> <span id="s509">You know, it was terrible to be ripped out of their roots and I had such a tremendous respect for the Jews, that has never ceased.</span> <span id="s510">So, I feel I am a Jew.</span> <span id="s511">I remember, when I met my husband, and my father came to visit here from Europe, and I said, “I want to introduce you to a very important man in my life, and I want to tell you that he is Jewish.”</span> <span id="s512">And, he said, “Oh, that’s nice.”</span> <span id="s513">I sad, “You feel that’s nice.”</span> <span id="s514">And he said, “I, of all people should object to a Jew?”</span></p> <p><span id="s515">I: Um.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">R: And, uh.</span> <span id="s517">He told my husband a long story of how he got many Jews out of jail, which was more tricky than what I did.</span> <span id="s518">But, I never knew that part of the orders that I had came from him.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">I: Did he know...did your father know that you were involved in this?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">R: Not till after.</span> <span id="s521">Not till after.</span> <span id="s522">Neither one of us did.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">I: Uh, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">R: I saw my father one time, when he was picked up, and I had a tremendous guilt thing about my father, because I had...when the war started, he was in northern Norway, and he was liaison officer between the English and the Norwegian forces.</span> <span id="s525">And the English and the German forces, supposedly.</span> <span id="s526">It all ended with a big gang, because, of course, Sweden was neutral, and they had to permit the Germans to refuel in Sweden, just like they would have to permit the English to do so.</span> <span id="s527">As we were...they were brought in from the back.</span> <span id="s528">So, we had a problem, and it was all over.</span> <span id="s529">And, it didn’t take more than a couple of days and Norway was capitulated.</span> <span id="s530">I remember that my father went North and he had a very small company of men.</span> <span id="s531">I think he had about 11 men with him.</span> <span id="s532">And he held the fort...in northern Norway, near the Russian border.</span> <span id="s533">Far up in the border area.</span> <span id="s534">And, he had written a letter, “I would love for you to come up in your school holidays.”</span> <span id="s535">It didn’t go through, because they had been bombed, so the trains and the mails were very, very iffy.</span> <span id="s536">The whole thing.</span> <span id="s537">So, I ended up getting up there.</span> <span id="s538">And, we were still...he was still flying the regular war flag.</span> <span id="s539">I mean, there wasn’t a German flag there.</span> <span id="s540">There was no Germans in town.</span> <span id="s541">He was the big boss there.</span> <span id="s542">An old, old fort.</span> <span id="s543">Very interesting place.</span> <span id="s544">And, he was there until the 11th of November, 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">I: That was a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">R: That was a long time.</span> <span id="s547">And, when it was over, when the Germans came in, I can remember the German officer that took it over came in and my father asked him to come in, and he came in and he sat down, and my father offered him a cigarette.</span> <span id="s548">And, he had a table lighter, a steel table lighter, and he picked up the table lighter to light the cigarette, and when he did it, the German pulled his gun.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">I: Um.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">R: He thought he had a gun.</span> <span id="s551">And it was a little embarrassing there.</span> <span id="s552">But my father was then allowed to leave with me, and to report from there all the way to Oslo, which is a long country.</span> <span id="s553">You see, we had about three days’ travel, and, during that time, we were in coastal cities where he was approached constantly by people that had been his classmates in the naval academy to come with the UTB, the boats that came from England, you know.</span> <span id="s554">And go.</span> <span id="s555">And he said, “I can’t.</span> <span id="s556">How can I leave this 13 year old child here by herself?”</span> <span id="s557">I said, “Dad, I got up here by myself.</span> <span id="s558">I’ll get home by myself.</span> <span id="s559">go, you don’t have to take me.”</span> <span id="s560">He said, “I can’t take her to England and I cannot go.</span> <span id="s561">I can’t leave.”</span> <span id="s562">I wanted him to leave.</span> <span id="s563">I begged and pleaded that he would leave, but he didn’t.</span> <span id="s564">So, of course, when he came to Oslo and he reported to Victoria Terrace, which was the main place where the German headquarters were, he never came out.</span> <span id="s565">He just vanished.</span> <span id="s566">And, I had to sit and wait for permission to see him.</span> <span id="s567">And, I had to speak German.</span> <span id="s568">So, I was elected in the family to sit and wait, for days, for hours and wait, to get what they called a “schein,” which was a permit to see him.</span> <span id="s569">So, when the first permit came, it was months later, and we still didn’t know exactly where he was.</span> <span id="s570">As it turned out, it was God’s will, because my mother could not have handled that.</span> <span id="s571">I got the schein, so I got to see him first, and my mother was furious.</span> <span id="s572">And, I can understand it.</span> <span id="s573">But, I couldn’t say, “Don’t give it to me, give it to my mother.”</span> <span id="s574">“What, what...you don’t get a schein at all.”</span> <span id="s575">So, I said, “I’ll take what I can get.”</span> <span id="s576">And, when I came in, he had been in a dark cell.</span> <span id="s577">He had been in a cell where they had just little blue lights, his eyes were like wolves’ eyes.</span> <span id="s578">He had hair... my father was very dapper...very neat man.</span> <span id="s579">He had long hair.</span> <span id="s580">He had a full beard.</span> <span id="s581">I had never seen him with a full beard that was a little reddish, and he had...so skinny...he had no belt and no suspenders...so he had to hold up his pants.</span> <span id="s582">And, he had long nails, because he hadn’t had a chance to cut them.</span> <span id="s583">And, I was allowed to walk up to him, just to touch.</span> <span id="s584">If it hadn’t been for that, I wouldn’t have known it was my Dad.</span> <span id="s585">I knew it was him because I could smell him as I gave him a hug.</span> <span id="s586">I knew it was my Dad.</span> <span id="s587">And, uh, he looked so terrible that it was all I could do to keep from showing how horrible he looked.</span> <span id="s588">And, in that quick embrace, he was quick enough to say he needed nail scissors.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">I: Um.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">R: And the German, who was the watcher, said, “What are you saying?”</span> <span id="s591">My father said, “I just told her that I loved her.”</span> <span id="s592">And I came back, and I said, “How am I going to get a pair of nail scissors to my father?”</span> <span id="s593">And, I could not think but I had made up my mind that I was going to get margarine or butter and I was going to broil them and put them in the butter.</span> <span id="s594">How I was going to get the butter in.</span> <span id="s595">You see, this was the beginning of the war, and you could get margarine yet, still.</span> <span id="s596">And, I made...started to... In those days, they still had some of the old Norwegian cops.</span> <span id="s597">They were still at the police station before the Germans took over completely.</span> <span id="s598">I started talking to a policeman and made goo-goo eyes at him, really.</span> <span id="s599">I was much too young.</span> <span id="s600">He was 24, I remember.</span> <span id="s601">I thought he was a very old man, and I was, what...14.</span> <span id="s602">And, he did it.</span> <span id="s603">He got the butter into my father.</span> <span id="s604">And, he said to me, when he went in, “Did he get it?</span> <span id="s605">Did he get it?”</span> <span id="s606">He said, “He got it.</span> <span id="s607">He is one tough nut.”</span> <span id="s608">I said, “He didn’t acknowledge it?”</span> <span id="s609">And, I said, “The message you gave me, he didn’t acknowledge that he heard it?”</span> <span id="s610">Because he couldn’t know that the man wasn’t a plant, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">I: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">R: I said, “Well, I’m glad he is not going to take any chances.”</span> <span id="s613">Then, I didn’t see my father for years.</span> <span id="s614">For years, he was in Germany.</span> <span id="s615">And, I have a picture of him in all the different places he stayed.</span> <span id="s616">For almost five years, he was interned.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">I: That’s a long time to be moved and to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">R: Yah, yah.</span> <span id="s619">But, he really met some interesting people.</span> <span id="s620">But he learned a few things, and we learned how tough he had been.</span> <span id="s621">It wasn’t easy.</span> <span id="s622">But, he is still very well.</span> <span id="s623">He is fantastic.</span> <span id="s624">You would never know.</span> <span id="s625">The man is in his eighties.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">I: Living in Oslo.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">R: No, he lives in Miami.</span> <span id="s628">He came to visit me.</span> <span id="s629">My mother is dead.</span> <span id="s630">My stepmother is dead.</span> <span id="s631">And he came to visit me when he was downhearted, and, one of my dearest friends, a Jewish lady, a widow, who lives in Miami, who has been my friend since I came to America, came to visit me, and I introduced them, and, they fell in love, and they are married.</span> <span id="s632">He moved from Europe and came to live in Miami.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">I: And, where is your brother now?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">R: He lives in Oslo.</span> <span id="s635">And the rest of my...all my family...live in Oslo.</span> <span id="s636">But I am delighted to have my Dad close enough that I can go down on occasional week ends, and I speak to him often on the long distance phone.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">I: That makes it very nice.</span> <span id="s638">Well, I want to thank you.</span> <span id="s639">This has been most interesting and most fascinating, and, with your permission, I am going to make some inquiries about...from one of the bigger centers, to see whether or not there is some way that you, too, can be recognized as one of the righteous Gentiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">R: No.</span> <span id="s641">Oh, don’t do that.</span> <span id="s642">I don’t deserve that much.</span> <span id="s643">It was just a little thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">I: It was not a little thing, and there are people who are alive today because, as a gutsy 15 year old, you got on your skis and helped them through.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">R: I had a lot of help from other people.</span> <span id="s646">I could never do that my myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">I: But, even so...</span></p> <p><span id="s648">R: I tell you, it was a joy to do.</span> <span id="s649">I felt very good doing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">I: Well, I want to thank you, and we will be in touch with you, because it is possible that we may want to have you share some of these experiences with the students in person.</span> <span id="s651">It makes quite an impression on them.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">R: Yes, I did that in Lake Placid, Florida.</span> <span id="s653">For a few years, I gave some...at the end of the school year I did that.</span> <span id="s654">They brought them all together in the big auditorium, and I talked to them...little vignettes that...</span></p> <p><span id="s655">I: Uh, huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">R: I may not even remember now.</span> <span id="s657">But, you know, they come to you as you chat and it was very interesting how the young people accepted it.</span> <span id="s658">I liked it and they felt closer - that it wasn’t so far away.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">I: Because you were their age when you did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">R: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">I: And they can relate to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">R: Yes, and they felt that it wasn’t...if I was there, it is not that long ago.</span> <span id="s663">I may be an old lady to them.</span> <span id="s664">Still, it doesn’t seem that long ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">I: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">R: Well, if I can do anything that would be of any help to anyone I would be happy to.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">I: We would be very happy to ask you.</span> <span id="s668">And, that you again so very much.</span></p></body></html>
