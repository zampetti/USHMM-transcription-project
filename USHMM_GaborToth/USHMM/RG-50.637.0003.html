how well-off you were or poor or what was your life like?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: I was born in a Jewish – a Jewish family, full of love.</span> <span id="s29">I was the only child.</span> <span id="s30">My mother, my real mother died.</span> <span id="s31">I was about three or four years old, and my father remarried.</span> <span id="s32">My mother was Sima, Sima Cale also, and my father remarried and her name was Balcie, and today when I think of my mother, I think of Balcie.</span> <span id="s33">She was a person extraordinary and gave her life for me during the ghetto and afterwards.</span> <span id="s34">I don’t speak afterwards about it.</span> <span id="s35">My father worked at the wholesale meat delivery Goscinny Dwor in Lodz.</span> <span id="s36">My mother took part in home work.</span> <span id="s37">She did work, and we were a family, a happy family.</span> <span id="s38">We were not rich, but we were not poor.</span> <span id="s39">The party in Poland, Polish Jews were very, very poor people, and we were considered rich people.</span> <span id="s40">We were not rich, but we were considered rich, and it was a family, a happy family.</span> <span id="s41">I went to school, public school.</span> <span id="s42">I wasn’t the best student.</span> <span id="s43">I wasn’t the worst.</span> <span id="s44">I wasn’t the best, and so that’s life got till 1939, and then came the war, and everything changed by that time.</span> <span id="s45">The Germans – the Germans invaded Poland the third of September, and three days later, the Polish army left the city of Lodz.</span> <span id="s46">They came up, swastikas because in Lodz there were very many Germans, and they considered themselves as Germans, as Nazis, and three days later, exactly a week the war started.</span> <span id="s47">It was a Friday, and the next Friday the light went on and we saw that we had lost.</span> <span id="s48">They made some to know what’s going on.</span> <span id="s49">In the streets they put on a – what do you call it – announcements what’s going to happen.</span> <span id="s50">So, I went to see.</span> <span id="s51">I was 12 years old.</span> <span id="s52">I went to see what happened, and it was written like this, “Tomorrow” at that time “the German Army is going to enter the city of Lodz, and who make any sabotage or something like it will be killed.”</span> <span id="s53">Just that, “Will be killed,” and I was a child of 12 years complete.</span> <span id="s54">I had 12 years when it all started.</span> <span id="s55">And, it was the orneriest thing.</span> <span id="s56">The first thing I met the Nazis, say “Going to be killed.”</span> <span id="s57">It was such a shock to me that I came home crying and told my father, “They’re going to kill us.”</span> <span id="s58">My father said, “No, people don’t kill people.</span> <span id="s59">They’re doing it because we were in the war and they’re afraid that it’s going to happen, something to them.</span> <span id="s60">So, they say going to kill, but no one kills nobody.”</span> <span id="s61">My father didn’t believe what is going to happen here.</span> <span id="s62">Nobody believed it.</span> <span id="s63">And, tomorrow, I went to see the German army to get in our city.</span> <span id="s64">I was very surprised.</span> <span id="s65">It was all motorized and it was very good looking, but the same day they took people, Jews in the street and hanged them.</span> <span id="s66">You could get there in the street and see five, six people hanging.</span> <span id="s67">They took Jews.</span> <span id="s68">Jews by that time used the beard.</span> <span id="s69">My grandfather also, he was very religious.</span> <span id="s70">My grandfather was.</span> <span id="s71">He wasn’t, but my father – my grandfather was very religious.</span> <span id="s72">And, they catched him and pulled out his face, never recovered, they pulled out his beard and he never recovered.</span> <span id="s73">He was taken out after awhile before the ghetto, and he just disappeared.</span> <span id="s74">That was the entry of the German army, the Wehrmacht, the SS in our city.</span> <span id="s75">Schools closed, and it was all – we didn’t know what to do, but we were – we had to use stars, yellow stars of David.</span> <span id="s76">We couldn’t get into some cities.</span> <span id="s77">They changed the name for Hitler and so on.</span> <span id="s78">We couldn’t walk on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s79">You had to walk in the middle of the streets.</span> <span id="s80">The Jews couldn’t go in movie or streetcars.</span> <span id="s81">We had to go to be separated.</span> <span id="s82">We had to eat.</span> <span id="s83">In Poland, it gets very cold about – very, very cold.</span> <span id="s84">We had to eat.</span> <span id="s85">So, my father was afraid.</span> <span id="s86">They took people, Jews, took them and they said it’s going to work, but there’s no work.</span> <span id="s87">They make these big ditches, and people had to undress, put it in, and dance over it and sing, and the words were – very few came home after.</span> <span id="s88">So, my father was afraid to just disappear.</span> <span id="s89">My father was afraid to go out.</span> <span id="s90">So, I had to go in the line to buy bread.</span> <span id="s91">I went out about five o’clock and four o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s92">It was very cold, very cold, and eight o’clock they came – German policemen because this district is called Warteland, and we were attached to the German Reich.</span> <span id="s93">So, we were ruled by German boss who came in German policeman, and usually, almost everyday, said, “Juden rausse” Jews, out of the line.</span> <span id="s94">I didn’t need, by that time, a Star of David.</span> <span id="s95">So, it wasn’t for me.</span> <span id="s96">It was just waiting, but most of the time, there was someone who recognized me and said that I’m a Jew.</span> <span id="s97">I was thrown out, kicked out of the line, and came home crying and we didn’t eat that time.</span> <span id="s98">I know – I feel it very much.</span> <span id="s99">I don’t hate.</span> <span id="s100">I don’t hate nor have hate in me, but I feel very, very much what they did to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: In May 1940, the ghetto was sealed.</span> <span id="s102">Did you and your family, your parents and your grandparents, did you have to move from your apartment or where did you live?</span> <span id="s103">And, how did you feel about being in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: When they started to speak about the ghetto, I didn’t know what it is.</span> <span id="s105">I asked my father what was the ghetto?</span> <span id="s106">And, he told me that in the dark ages there were ghettos, but afterwards couldn’t get anymore, but he said, “You’ll see.</span> <span id="s107">We’ll be all with Jews and at least we have the Germans.</span> <span id="s108">We have the Germans.</span> <span id="s109">We know that they’re our enemies, but at least we won’t have the Poles to what they were doing with us and beat us up and so on.”</span> <span id="s110">And– we didn’t know what’s going to happen.</span> <span id="s111">So, I went in – we went in to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s112">I lived at Gesia, Gesia 7 apartment 8, and it was a good apartment.</span> <span id="s113">The house belonged to my grandfather.</span> <span id="s114">He was a very wealthy man.</span> <span id="s115">We were not, but he was.</span> <span id="s116">And, so we didn’t have to move, but my father – my father worked I said in wholesale, retail/wholesale, and they called themselves grinszpan.</span> <span id="s117">So, I went – he send me because he was afraid to go.</span> <span id="s118">I went there and we brought one of the brothers, and he came to our house and lived with us for a while.</span> <span id="s119">Afterwards, I don’t know how it was because I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s120">He left the house.</span> <span id="s121">We had a big house, but they were – people who took part a way to place newcomers, we had to give up two rooms for people to live there.</span> <span id="s122">It was very – the ghetto had room about 25,000 people to be there.</span> <span id="s123">We squeezed in 165,000 people in the place.</span> <span id="s124">There’s room for 25.</span> <span id="s125">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s126">People didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s127">It was cold, also.</span> <span id="s128">The worst of all was the hunger.</span> <span id="s129">We didn’t have no food.</span> <span id="s130">People started to die because we didn’t have no food, and to say what is food it’s so hard to say because nobody understands what food.</span> <span id="s131">You can eat something.</span> <span id="s132">It’s okay, but if you don’t have nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s133">You don’t see your neighbor.</span> <span id="s134">You don’t see your parents.</span> <span id="s135">One thinking, you think all one thing – eat, eat, eat and you have nothing to put in your mouth.</span> <span id="s136">People started to die, and all over the ghetto there were people with open eyes, and you looked at them and you thought, “Give me some food and I will get up.”</span> <span id="s137">But they were dead.</span> <span id="s138">The Germans said, “If you make shops and work, we’ll give you what to do and we’ll give you food.”</span> <span id="s139">It was made in a short time, and they started to send me.</span> <span id="s140">To live, you need 2,400 calories daily.</span> <span id="s141">We received 200 calories.</span> <span id="s142">It’s a fact that people were just who eat no more than 200 calories can live most eight months.</span> <span id="s143">I lived five years with 200 calories.</span> <span id="s144">I don’t know how I ever survived.</span> <span id="s145">I don’t know how.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Tell me what did you eat?</span> <span id="s147">Who was in charge of getting the food?</span> <span id="s148">What were the ways that your parents went about getting some food for the family?</span> <span id="s149">And, what other activities did you have?</span> <span id="s150">Did you go to school?</span> <span id="s151">And, what happened there when the ghetto was closed?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: We received a kilo – kilo is a two pounds, two pounds of bread.</span> <span id="s153">It was dark black and full of water inside.</span> <span id="s154">Two pounds for five days, and soup.</span> <span id="s155">They gave us some vegetables and they were old.</span> <span id="s156">It was nothing to eat, almost nothing.</span> <span id="s157">People died.</span> <span id="s158">That’s why we died.</span> <span id="s159">And, that was – but, they permitted to make schools in ghetto.</span> <span id="s160">So, we had – they called them Juden Alteste.</span> <span id="s161">Mordechai Chaim Rumkowski, and he thought that he was the emperor of the ghetto, and this emperor opened schools.</span> <span id="s162">So, I went to school.</span> <span id="s163">It was, of course, to learn also, but the main thing was a soup.</span> <span id="s164">You received a soup day.</span> <span id="s165">It was not the – it’s more water than vegetables, but it was a soup, and it’s – I think it’s one of the reasons that I survived too.</span> <span id="s166">My survival is also, I think, because the love I received at home, and I never was beaten up to die.</span> <span id="s167">I never received a beaten up.</span> <span id="s168">They didn’t beat me up.</span> <span id="s169">That’s why I’m here.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Tell me a little bit about school.</span> <span id="s171">What did you learn there?</span> <span id="s172">Who were the teachers?</span> <span id="s173">And, who were your schoolmates?</span> <span id="s174">Who were your friends in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: The teachers were the best teachers in the world.</span> <span id="s176">They did everything to teach us, and we did everything to learn.</span> <span id="s177">They were – so bad as we were, no food, empty stomachs and thats – they didn’t understand what we say, but we did, and they didn’t say what for.</span> <span id="s178">They all want to die, what for to teach them, but they did everything to teach us.</span> <span id="s179">Today, if I can speak, if I’m a person, if I’m a Jew, if I’m Brazilian, I belong to humanity, it’s thanks to that teachers.</span> <span id="s180">In school, we had – I had some friends.</span> <span id="s181">I remember some names, other I don’t.</span> <span id="s182">It’s 65 years, okay?</span> <span id="s183">I’m 77 years old now, but I still remember each time, but names I’m very bad.</span> <span id="s184">There was a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s185">His name was Cukier, and I liked him very much.</span> <span id="s186">He was a friend, real good friend, and it’s something – something I want to say.</span> <span id="s187">We had in the ghetto, they made – they made a – how do I say – we wrote to Rumkowski.</span> <span id="s188">He was the emperor, and we called the father.</span> <span id="s189">The father, it was not the father, but we had to do it.</span> <span id="s190">And, we made a writing for him to the end of the year, we made a writing for him, to him, and who should make it is exactly this Cukier, but he was so dirty.</span> <span id="s191">His hands were always dirty and I don’t know.</span> <span id="s192">We didn’t have no soap of course, but he was more dirty than other kids.</span> <span id="s193">So, he started to make it, and the principal said, “No, you don’t make it.</span> <span id="s194">Who’s going to make it is Laks, Cale I mean, and I made it, and I remember I made this writing to the Prezes.</span> <span id="s195">We call him Prezes.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: What was the occasion?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: I think it was a New Year it was Rosh Hashanah or something like that.</span> <span id="s198">I don’t remember exactly, but I know it was good because I was in the principal’s room.</span> <span id="s199">I didn’t have to attend school.</span> <span id="s200">It was very good for me.</span> <span id="s201">I liked it and I recognize it now.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: You told me before that before each class every morning you started with a song.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s204">We started with a song.</span> <span id="s205">It’s something like this “We children beg you oh God, give us life and to be pure and good.”</span> <span id="s206">In Yiddish, I will sing it in Yiddish, I remember it still [sings Yiddish song].</span> <span id="s207">Was the song we sang and, afterward, when school’s ended, there were no schools anymore.</span> <span id="s208">I was in the part – part of we studied in ghetto without food, without nothing, but we studied.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Tell me what happened in October 1940 when you became 13 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Oh, as I said, my father was not a religious man, but he was a Jew.</span> <span id="s211">He was proud to be a Jew.</span> <span id="s212">So, am I now, and it was time to make Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s213">So, I don’t know where it was.</span> <span id="s214">I didn’t know about it, but in the front of our house there was a private room, private house and they had the Torah there, and I was taken in there, and I made the brachos, and I made Bar Mitzvah, and I don’t know how my father managed to bring some pieces of bread – pieces, not bread, pieces of bread, and all the people there who attend and pray got a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s215">That was my Bar Mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: After Rosh Hashanah in 1941, the schools were closed, and western Jews were brought into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s217">Could you say a little bit about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Before I wanted to say, I went to school before the war it was a church.</span> <span id="s219">It was on Franciszkanska Street, 21 or 20, 19 – I don’t remember the number, and at that school, we were lined up and it was time to have the soup.</span> <span id="s220">We wait with our pots, and came up a German and took pictures of us.</span> <span id="s221">In 1940, he took pictures, color pictures.</span> <span id="s222">I found it now.</span> <span id="s223">I have a picture with my friends in there, and I knew about it, last year, in 1940 - 203, when I came back from Chelmno with all my family – my family, my parents and friends perished, and the driver took out a xerox and showed me.</span> <span id="s224">It was me.</span> <span id="s225">This picture, the original, is now in Frankfurt, the Jewish Museum in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s226">I knew it in 2000, it’s me.</span> <span id="s227">I mean 2004, we’re in 05 now, 2004 after 60 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Tell me now a little bit about people that moved into your apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: At first there were, as I said, my father’s boss and they got out.</span> <span id="s230">I don’t know how it was.</span> <span id="s231">I was too young.</span> <span id="s232">There are some things that I know, but I can’t imagine now.</span> <span id="s233">I imagine, but sometimes I think like a child.</span> <span id="s234">I was a child.</span> <span id="s235">I was a child.</span> <span id="s236">Some people – when I speak – some people ask me, “What did you feel as a child?”</span> <span id="s237">I say, “I felt like a child, but in one day to the other I was grown up.”</span> <span id="s238">They took away my childhood, my youth, and I didn’t have it, but I still, I was a child.</span> <span id="s239">And, what was your last question?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: I asked about the Western Jews who came into the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: In ghetto, they came in trains with especially from Germany, not only, but especially from Germany.</span> <span id="s242">They came from other parts.</span> <span id="s243">I had a teacher from Athens, from Greece, but he taught me history, and they came trains from other parts of Europe especially from Germany.</span> <span id="s244">They were told they were going to be changed for German prisoners of war from England.</span> <span id="s245">And, when they came in, they came with crosses and medals from the first war, and they thought they were going to England.</span> <span id="s246">They came in, they asked, “Where are the ships?</span> <span id="s247">Where are the ships here?”</span> <span id="s248">There are no ships.</span> <span id="s249">And, a couple of elder people went into our apartment where we lived.</span> <span id="s250">There were two couples and I remember one of them had ten Marks, and she kept it ‘til afterwards.</span> <span id="s251">I don’t know how.</span> <span id="s252">I think they received – they had to go out of the ghetto and they were taken, of course, they were taken to Chelmno where all people died of the Wartegau, and these people also.</span> <span id="s253">But, I had – I had afterwards, I was designed, assigned to work at metal as a metaeines as a – English – Slusarz to– work in the shop.</span> <span id="s254">It’s called Metaleines, and-</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: When these people who lived in your apartment, when they disappeared, they left, what did you think?</span> <span id="s256">What did your father and mother tell you?</span> <span id="s257">Where did they go?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: We don’t spoke about it, a little, we spoke very little of it because before that, Germany invaded Russia, and they said that we’re going to – who wants to go with them can go to work in Russia.</span> <span id="s259">It’s not hard work.</span> <span id="s260">They can go, children, the families, or just individuals, who wants to go to work is going to work in agricultural, it’s not bad.</span> <span id="s261">See here you’re dying, but there you can have a potato, grow potatoes and that, but you’ll work, and it’s very good job.</span> <span id="s262">Many people went out as volunteers.</span> <span id="s263">And two uncles of mine, my mother’s two brothers went as volunteers.</span> <span id="s264">We know now that all those people went to Chelmno, but we didn’t – I don’t know.</span> <span id="s265">People just believed it.</span> <span id="s266">But, anyhow, we didn’t have – we were not in touch anymore with them, and people started to wonder, “Why don’t they write?</span> <span id="s267">What happens?”</span> <span id="s268">So, the volunteers quit because nobody wanted.</span> <span id="s269">So, the made a sperre, gehsperre, also those people who went away, went into gehsperre.</span> <span id="s270">Nobody spoke about it because nobody knew where we were going, and that’s why we didn’t bother those people who went away also.</span> <span id="s271">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s272">We don’t spoke about it, but nobody wanted to get out.</span> <span id="s273">So, my father made a hiding.</span> <span id="s274">In Poland, if you come in, in the front of the house, you’ve got doors, and each door means a room.</span> <span id="s275">If you hide one, you don’t have any room.</span> <span id="s276">So, my father pushed a cupboard – my father pushed a cupboard in front of the door.</span> <span id="s277">So, when they came in there was nothing – there was no room – no door, no room.</span> <span id="s278">We went in the bottom of this cupboard and the other room we went in.</span> <span id="s279">If something happened in this room, we went in about 13 or 14 people in there.</span> <span id="s280">Who made it was my father.</span> <span id="s281">In the beginning, the Germans didn’t know it, but afterwards they pushed the cupboards to see.</span> <span id="s282">They were not dumb also.</span> <span id="s283">So, looked – and they told us, “Who’s going to be in the hiding will be shot on the spot.”</span> <span id="s284">They did.</span> <span id="s285">So, we went in there, and there came in a child – a child of three or four months in the same building.</span> <span id="s286">It was forbidden, but there was an exception.</span> <span id="s287">There was a child.</span> <span id="s288">And when they came in, they said that they will shoot, and we hear a shot.</span> <span id="s289">We have to go down there, and they’ll segregate who can stay together and who can not.</span> <span id="s290">Before that, they took out all the children, all the children of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s291">They took out and they said they’re going to resettle, but all died in Chelmno.</span> <span id="s292">Then, by that time, they had children.</span> <span id="s293">They were going to take children 10 to 12 or 10, 12, and elder people, but they took others also.</span> <span id="s294">They had to have 5,000 a day, and if they would not have 5,000, they took other who could work.</span> <span id="s295">They didn’t like it.</span> <span id="s296">They didn’t have to.</span> <span id="s297">They never did what they said.</span> <span id="s298">And, they went in – this child went in with their father and mother, and all the time they came in and the child started to cry.</span> <span id="s299">So, this sperre, people started to cover the child with blankets and all was in his hand, and the child didn’t cry anymore.</span> <span id="s300">We were in there – we didn’t breathe.</span> <span id="s301">It was – it’s something you can’t – I don’t know how to say it what I felt there.</span> <span id="s302">I wasn’t standing, didn’t sit.</span> <span id="s303">Somebody sitting didn’t stand up.</span> <span id="s304">We were afraid to breathe, they hear us breathe.</span> <span id="s305">I don’t know how long it took.</span> <span id="s306">It took – every second was ten years, every minute was ten years.</span> <span id="s307">And, afterward, we heard outside crying and shoots, and then people were crying.</span> <span id="s308">Afterward, they went away, the child – the child was dead.</span> <span id="s309">My father make a mouth to mouth, but the child was dead.</span> <span id="s310">That time we weren’t discovered, but at night those couple, the couple with the child went and gave themselves up to the Germans.</span> <span id="s311">It’s something that marked me to the last day, I think – I won’t say I lived, but ‘til the last day, I – we be able to think.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: You mentioned to me before that at certain points you thought that sperre was over, and you went to get some soup – tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: They started in the morning.</span> <span id="s314">Nobody could get out of their room.</span> <span id="s315">You had to stay in there, and they stopped about five o’clock in the evening.</span> <span id="s316">We knew about five hours it’s going.</span> <span id="s317">It’s no more, no more sperre.</span> <span id="s318">So, I heard that there was a kitchen and they were giving soup.</span> <span id="s319">I don’t know how, but I know from where, but I took a pot and run over there to get a soup.</span> <span id="s320">I didn’t ask my parents.</span> <span id="s321">I just run away.</span> <span id="s322">I was only a child.</span> <span id="s323">I was still a child, and I came there.</span> <span id="s324">All of a sudden, we were encircled by Germans, by SS, and Jewish police, too, and they caught me.</span> <span id="s325">I don’t know how.</span> <span id="s326">I run away, went into a house, an empty house already, and there was another, my friend from school.</span> <span id="s327">Not but that time, but from school.</span> <span id="s328">We met there.</span> <span id="s329">His name was Woda, and we run up to the last floor, and went in there.</span> <span id="s330">So, I was so naïve.</span> <span id="s331">I said, “I’m going to put a towel in my face and say I’m sick.”</span> <span id="s332">But, he said, “No, don’t do that.</span> <span id="s333">Don’t do that.</span> <span id="s334">Let’s go in.”</span> <span id="s335">There was a box from coal to burn, and we went both.</span> <span id="s336">We went in this box, and we stood there, and we heard outside to come out police after us, and so they look all over, and when he went away, we came home.</span> <span id="s337">Of course my parents said, “Never do that.</span> <span id="s338">Never do this.”</span> <span id="s339">But, what would happen?</span> <span id="s340">And, I was with Woda.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Tell me a little about your work at the metal workshop number one.</span> <span id="s342">How did you get this job?</span> <span id="s343">Who told you to work there?</span> <span id="s344">What did you do?</span> <span id="s345">How many hours a day?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: It was a good shop.</span> <span id="s347">It was a good shop.</span> <span id="s348">I learned.</span> <span id="s349">I was a – I learned to be a – my job – I don’t know how to say it, but I had two foremen, Brogowski and another one.</span> <span id="s350">The other one was a Jew from Vienna, very nice people.</span> <span id="s351">They didn’t beat us, and they teach us how to work, and I’m thankful for it.</span> <span id="s352">They don’t live anymore, but they were very good people.</span> <span id="s353">And, we work 12 hours a day.</span> <span id="s354">We had also a soup in this.</span> <span id="s355">In this shop, we had a soup, and the soup was always so thin, it more water than – so, we had a song it says to get this spoon up to the bottom to take out a little maybe some vegetables or something like what was in there.</span> <span id="s356">And, we had a song it said, it sounds like this [sings Yiddish song] to put the spoon down there, and we sung it [sings Yiddish song] let us at that shop, but those both people, I’m thankful for what they did.</span> <span id="s357">The name of the principal of the school, of that shop was Chaimowicz.</span> <span id="s358">Chaimowicz was a bad guy.</span> <span id="s359">He molested girls.</span> <span id="s360">He was bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">[New Tape]</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Tell me a little bit about the school that you attended before the war, on Rybna Street, if I remember correctly, and the school in the ghetto, but first talk about the school before the war.</span> <span id="s363">Did you like going there?</span> <span id="s364">Do you remember any names of teachers?</span> <span id="s365">What subjects did you learn?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: Yeah, I don’t remember – that school before the ghetto was a public school.</span> <span id="s367">We had subjects, Polish was our language, my language by that time.</span> <span id="s368">It’s not anymore, and mathematics, history which I liked very, very much, geography.</span> <span id="s369">I think that’s all about.</span> <span id="s370">I don’t think I had anymore.</span> <span id="s371">We were young.</span> <span id="s372">In school, I had good friends, not only Jews, but good friends, but some people were discriminated.</span> <span id="s373">Not too much, but sometimes they said, “Oh, you’re a Jew.</span> <span id="s374">You’re a Jew.</span> <span id="s375">You’re a Jew.”</span> <span id="s376">But, I didn’t feel it so much.</span> <span id="s377">The schools were very good, very good.</span> <span id="s378">The teachers – I don’t remember any name of any teacher.</span> <span id="s379">I’m very bad in names and dates, but I remember facts what happened.</span> <span id="s380">So, in school, most of all, afterward we went into the ghetto and they started the school in the beginning for a few months only, and we had almost the same subjects, but we had also Yiddish.</span> <span id="s381">We had Polish, German.</span> <span id="s382">I had a very good professor from a German university, and it was just beginning.</span> <span id="s383">Afterwards, they brought in Jews from all over Germany, but in the beginning, just the beginning they brought also Jews from Germany, also, just in the beginning, and I had one of those professors.</span> <span id="s384">He was a professor.</span> <span id="s385">He was a teacher.</span> <span id="s386">So, we had German, Yiddish, Polish sometimes, not anymore, but who want it – and history, geography, and some Hebrew also, some Hebrew who want it.</span> <span id="s387">I had very good teachers.</span> <span id="s388">They – I spoke about it.</span> <span id="s389">I had the best.</span> <span id="s390">No, this was afterwards, but I had very good teacher.</span> <span id="s391">All were very good teachers.</span> <span id="s392">So, and we were children.</span> <span id="s393">We were children and we wanted to eat and it was not so much about learning to eat the soup.</span> <span id="s394">It was good.</span> <span id="s395">It was to eat another soup, and my parents, of course, were happy that I ate another soup, and this was the school.</span> <span id="s396">We came home also in school, we had – we were not so cold.</span> <span id="s397">At home, it was very cold.</span> <span id="s398">So, I wanted to go to school not so much to learn, but to eat the soup and not to be frozen.</span> <span id="s399">That why.</span> <span id="s400">That’s was the school, our school.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Did you have gymnastics, sports in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: No, we marched.</span> <span id="s403">We marched.</span> <span id="s404">I was assigned to be the head of this class.</span> <span id="s405">I mean after the war.</span> <span id="s406">Before the war, no.</span> <span id="s407">But, I mean, during the war.</span> <span id="s408">During the war, I was head of the class.</span> <span id="s409">They called it Gospodarz, land lord, but there was no land lord, of course, and we marched.</span> <span id="s410">We marched and we said, ‘Achad, Shtaim…[Yiddish counting],” We marched, and this was in the school.</span> <span id="s411">We marched, yeah.</span> <span id="s412">In that school of Franciszkanska where I have the picture where the German took a picture in color.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: Did you play football?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: No.</span> <span id="s415">We didn’t play no football.</span> <span id="s416">Before the war, of course, we – but, during the war there was no time.</span> <span id="s417">During the war, no.</span> <span id="s418">Before the war, we played football, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: When you started to work after the schools were closed, did you have time for any play with your friends or reading books or belonging to an organization of any kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: During the war effort, yeah.</span> <span id="s421">We had some – some organizations.</span> <span id="s422">I was in the Socialist organization, Bund, and it was something I can’t say – I can’t say it was something good or bad, but we had no time.</span> <span id="s423">I had no time, and not always with people came together I didn’t go because I was too tired.</span> <span id="s424">I had to work 12 hours a day, and one week during the daytime, and the other week during the night.</span> <span id="s425">So, I think I didn’t go because of that.</span> <span id="s426">I was too – I wasn’t lazy.</span> <span id="s427">I was tired.</span> <span id="s428">No food, I was freezing, and that’s why I didn’t go out.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: When you were at home with your parents, what did you talk about?</span> <span id="s430">Did you ever think that it’s going to end, or did you think the Germans might win the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: We were – I don’t know why, we believed – we believed that we are going to survive.</span> <span id="s432">We thought that it’s impossible to survive, but we had a – I don’t know why, but we believed it.</span> <span id="s433">We believed it really that we are going to get out of the ghetto and life will come again as it was before the war or better.</span> <span id="s434">I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s435">The Germans were going up, and we were happy when Germany invaded Russia because we thought that now it’s going to – that the Germans are going to lose the war because Napoleon did and so on, and so on but it was upside down.</span> <span id="s436">The Germans went to Moscow, near Moscow, near Stalingrad, Leningrad and so on.</span> <span id="s437">We saw it was not going to happen, but we believed it.</span> <span id="s438">We believed that we were – also the Germans stimulated us to believe.</span> <span id="s439">The Germans stimulated.</span> <span id="s440">They said these people who went out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s441">They lived good, but we didn’t know it.</span> <span id="s442">They believed every time, it was Biebow.</span> <span id="s443">His name was Biebow.</span> <span id="s444">He always said, “We need you, and you go to live because we need your work, and don’t worry about it.</span> <span id="s445">People go out, we take, we send to another place.</span> <span id="s446">They are replaced, and we need you because you are good and you are working and we need you in production.</span> <span id="s447">And, also this Rumkowski, I think he knew that it’s not true, but he always said and made speeches that we’re going to live.</span> <span id="s448">He said, “I brought you in the ghetto” That’s not true, “And, I’ll get you out of the ghetto.”</span> <span id="s449">Of course, it was not true, but always the same.</span> <span id="s450">They stimulated, the Germans, and the Jewish ghetto Aeltesten.</span> <span id="s451">They stimulated us to believe that we were to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Were you afraid of the Germans?</span> <span id="s453">Who were you afraid of in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: I was afraid of everything.</span> <span id="s455">All the people were afraid.</span> <span id="s456">I was afraid of police, Jewish police.</span> <span id="s457">I was afraid of Germans.</span> <span id="s458">I was afraid in the shop where I worked.</span> <span id="s459">I was afraid of everything.</span> <span id="s460">I was afraid I won’t have to eat tomorrow.</span> <span id="s461">Today, I ate something.</span> <span id="s462">I didn’t know whether tomorrow I will have another soup, and I was afraid of everything.</span> <span id="s463">We always lived in stress.</span> <span id="s464">We were very stressed.</span> <span id="s465">All people were stressed, and we spoke at home, but sometimes we didn’t speak at home because my father had to work at another place, my mother another place, I in another place, and sometimes we didn’t meet at home.</span> <span id="s466">When we came together, who made all the preparations to eat was always my mother, and she left each piece for one, my father, me, my parents, and we sometimes didn’t speak at all.</span> <span id="s467">And, the evening ghetto, we had a theater.</span> <span id="s468">It was for people, not us.</span> <span id="s469">People who had some jobs in the Ghetto-Verwaltung and so on.</span> <span id="s470">And, this was, I spoke about it I was going to see the theater and so on, but people like me, like us, couldn’t have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Where from did you get news?</span> <span id="s472">How did you know about Germany invading Soviet Union?</span> <span id="s473">Or things not going so well for the Germans?</span> <span id="s474">How did you find out about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: We had a – from German newspapers.</span> <span id="s476">We didn’t read the paper as it was written.</span> <span id="s477">I’ll give you an example.</span> <span id="s478">It said, “We’re going to fight the communists in Krakow.</span> <span id="s479">In Krakow, we’re going to make a great counter attack in Krakow.”</span> <span id="s480">So, we knew it was near Moscow.</span> <span id="s481">How come it’s near Krakow?</span> <span id="s482">They were beaten back, and that we knew.</span> <span id="s483">We didn’t know that they were going to win Krakow, but they were up there and now they were down there.</span> <span id="s484">They were pushed down, and that’s how we knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: At work, in the metaleines workshop, did people talk about politics or military issues of how is the war going for the Germans or the Russians moving, fighting back, or the Allies, the Americans and the British?</span> <span id="s486">Did you know about D-day?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: We didn’t know about British.</span> <span id="s488">We knew only from the Russians, Red Army and we looked at them as liberators and even after the war, I thought that’s true that they were liberators and so on.</span> <span id="s489">The only hope for us was this side, the Russian to come.</span> <span id="s490">They never came, and we didn’t know about invasion.</span> <span id="s491">We didn’t know about Americans, the west.</span> <span id="s492">We knew only this side, the east, the Russian, the Russian army.</span> <span id="s493">We spoke about it, yeah, sometimes we spoke that the Russian would come and liberate us, and we’ll be good.</span> <span id="s494">That’s it, but we didn’t know the other side what was going on in the west.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Did you ever think about running away from the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: It was impossible.</span> <span id="s497">It was impossible to run away from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s498">I think it’s the only ghetto in all Poland, all over the world, all over Germany and Europe, that was impossible to get out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s499">First of all, we were – there were fences, fences, and we couldn’t go to the fences.</span> <span id="s500">There were some streets where the fences were people couldn’t walk there.</span> <span id="s501">I lived near the fence, but didn’t go out on the left side.</span> <span id="s502">I had to go always on the right side inside the ghetto to another property and not in the streets.</span> <span id="s503">So, we couldn’t go in.</span> <span id="s504">Afterwards, the Germans took away all Poles, all others on the other side of the fence, and they relocated Germans from Germany and also Germans from Russia.</span> <span id="s505">So, I don’t know the distance.</span> <span id="s506">There were always a German policeman watching and inside were Jewish policeman watching.</span> <span id="s507">So, we were isolated completely, but completely from all the world.</span> <span id="s508">We didn’t know what happens on the other side of the street.</span> <span id="s509">We knew about, about the Germans going to win or lose by the papers as I said.</span> <span id="s510">But, what’s going on in the city and near Chelmno, we didn’t know absolutely nothing, and also in the ghetto, this Rumkowski he had spies.</span> <span id="s511">If you said something, if he didn’t like or invented even something, you were taken out and sent, it was called the Czarnieckiego.</span> <span id="s512">It was a prison, and from that prison people went out of there.</span> <span id="s513">So, we didn’t know absolutely nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: When you still went to school, how many children were in your class?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: We were about thirty.</span> <span id="s516">I think so twenty or thirty people.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: At that time at school, did the children talk to each other about what was happening?</span> <span id="s518">How come you are in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s519">How come you’re isolated from the rest of the city?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: No, we were happy in school, very happy in school.</span> <span id="s521">We were together.</span> <span id="s522">We were between friends, and we had good teachers too.</span> <span id="s523">The teachers simulated to be friends.</span> <span id="s524">They were your friends, too, I was happy in school, we had soup.</span> <span id="s525">They had the soup there.</span> <span id="s526">We knew if we come home we maybe have a piece of bread, too, and between us we marched.</span> <span id="s527">It was good in school.</span> <span id="s528">But we didn’t speak about what’s happening.</span> <span id="s529">We didn’t want to know.</span> <span id="s530">We were happy in school.</span> <span id="s531">We lived from one moment to the other.</span> <span id="s532">Never in the ghetto, we never make plans after the war, yeah, we’re going to be friends – but, ‘til the end of the war, we didn’t want to speak about it.</span> <span id="s533">I was a child, but also the adults also was the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Tell me what happened in August 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: In August 1944, the ghetto was being finished.</span> <span id="s536">They came up to us, and said that we’re going to Germany because the Russian army is near, and we’ll be shooted by them as collaborators to the Germans because we’re in ghetto, and they’re going to help us not to be.</span> <span id="s537">So, they’re going to take the ghetto as it is with machines and shops and all of us.</span> <span id="s538">You’re going to Germany to be better in Germany.</span> <span id="s539">Each one will receive to go there, two pounds of bread, and there you’ll have German money and that would going to be good for us to go.</span> <span id="s540">We didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s541">So, for two or three days, we were hidden too, my family were hidden.</span> <span id="s542">And my father said we’re going to die here.</span> <span id="s543">Let’s go.</span> <span id="s544">We’re going to die.</span> <span id="s545">So, we gave ourselves up.</span> <span id="s546">We were taken to [unintelligible], not far away I lived before the war and in ghetto, and from there, we were taken to a place.</span> <span id="s547">I finished up in a place.</span> <span id="s548">We didn’t know where we were.</span> <span id="s549">People in the meantime, I would like to say something also.</span> <span id="s550">That, today, people say that they didn’t know what was going on.</span> <span id="s551">Well, when we left Poland, I mean ghetto Lodz, and went through to go there, there were people working in the fields, and there was a woman there.</span> <span id="s552">She made a cross and prayed for us.</span> <span id="s553">So, I said to my father, “You see people are praying for us.”</span> <span id="s554">But, after the war, I remembered that.</span> <span id="s555">This woman, she knew where we going.</span> <span id="s556">She made a cross to death, that we were going to death.</span> <span id="s557">So, if she knew all the people who were over there knew too.</span> <span id="s558">If, they knew, the village also knew.</span> <span id="s559">If the village knew, also the city knew, and if the city knew, all of them knew.</span> <span id="s560">They knew and did nothing.</span> <span id="s561">But on the train, went on, and we came in, in a place.</span> <span id="s562">They said we had to go out.</span> <span id="s563">I want to tell a story also on that train.</span> <span id="s564">It was August, it was not so cold, and we became two pounds of bread, each one finished it in two minutes, and we wanted to have, to drink something.</span> <span id="s565">They didn’t put in nothing.</span> <span id="s566">In the train I was, a young girl or man, we all were young, and started to cry, “Water, water.</span> <span id="s567">I’m dying.</span> <span id="s568">I want water, water, water, I’m dying.”</span> <span id="s569">There was no water.</span> <span id="s570">When the Germans came in, we had to give up all we had of value – gold, silver, furs, all of it, but in that train where I was, a man came up with a watch, a golden watch, and said to the – we had in all the trains we had a – there’s a window and he said to he, “Take this watch and bring water.</span> <span id="s571">A person’s dying.”</span> <span id="s572">He took the watch but didn’t bring no water.</span> <span id="s573">The cries were weaker and weaker.</span> <span id="s574">I’m sure that person died of thirst.</span> <span id="s575">The two things that marked me all my life – the child and that person.</span> <span id="s576">We came in – we came in.</span> <span id="s577">They opened up the – they were waiting there, and my father grabbed for my hand not to lose each other.</span> <span id="s578">He held me by my pulse and we jumped out the train.</span> <span id="s579">They said, “Women one side.</span> <span id="s580">Men down.”</span> <span id="s581">I was with my father.</span> <span id="s582">My father asked they called Kanada, Sonederkommando Kanada, and my father said, “Where are we?”</span> <span id="s583">He said, “Shut up.</span> <span id="s584">You’re in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s585">The only way out is the chimney.”</span> <span id="s586">And, I thought, before we went out, I thought I’m in the – where they make iron and steel and so, I saw chimney, I said, “It’s a factory.”</span> <span id="s587">But, when we came out, my father asked him and he said, “Shut up.</span> <span id="s588">Shut your mouth.</span> <span id="s589">You’re in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s590">The only way out is through the chimney.”</span> <span id="s591">And, women went to one side.</span> <span id="s592">It was the last time I saw my mother, and my mother was very thin, and I want to tell about my mother.</span> <span id="s593">In ghetto, between one organization and the other we could go to a doctor, and the doctor gave or not the medicine.</span> <span id="s594">The medicine was a few ounces of bread, and my mother became ill, and the doctor gave her.</span> <span id="s595">She didn’t eat it.</span> <span id="s596">She brought it to me.</span> <span id="s597">I ate this bread.</span> <span id="s598">Was my stepmother.</span> <span id="s599">She was a mother.</span> <span id="s600">My mother was very thin, and she died.</span> <span id="s601">I looked for her after the war all over the world, all over the world – wrote Red Cross and all things because my mother died in the gas chamber in Auschwitz, in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s602">Right ‘til now, I don’t know how I survived, but I know what for.</span> <span id="s603">I survived to be a witness and to say all the world that can not happen again, never, never again.</span> <span id="s604">I do it in Brazil.</span> <span id="s605">I will apologize also for my English because I speak Portuguese, and Portuguese would be much better, but I hope people will understand, and never again.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: Tell me a little bit about what happened then with you and your father after arriving in Birkenau, and what happened later.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: I was in Birkenau, we were, they took off our clothes.</span> <span id="s608">We were naked, just as we were born, shaved – cut-off our hair was cut-off.</span> <span id="s609">And, we were taken, my father asked, yeah inside they took a part to the left and the other part to the right, beating us.</span> <span id="s610">We separated, one on one side – one part on one side, other part.</span> <span id="s611">The one part we were not, they asked them to get their sleeves up and tattooed, made a tattoo with a number.</span> <span id="s612">So, we – my father thought they going to take us because we were not tattooed, and my father said they’re going to take us to the gas chamber, but we didn’t.</span> <span id="s613">They took us to a block and they – we were sold, sold as slaves to build a – what do you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: Trenches?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: Trenches also, but to make-</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Gas tanks?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: Tanks, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Anti-tank reinforcements.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: We were sold to make the jobs, and I want to tell you – to tell you also about what happened to me in Flossenbürg, I mean in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s620">I was standing to get the soup, and they came up a Kapo and said to me that I’m for the second time taking soup.</span> <span id="s621">I wanted to say something, he said, “Shut up.</span> <span id="s622">You’re in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s623">The only way out is through the chimney.”</span> <span id="s624">Come, [German].</span> <span id="s625">It means to get beaten up with 25 lashes, and I don’t – I know only one person who survived 25 lashes.</span> <span id="s626">My father saw it.</span> <span id="s627">He wanted to say something.</span> <span id="s628">I said, “Don’t talk.</span> <span id="s629">Don’t talk.”</span> <span id="s630">I was afraid they were going to take my father, too, and he went to kill me.</span> <span id="s631">I don’t know why he didn’t kill me on the spot, but why he took me.</span> <span id="s632">So, I started to march.</span> <span id="s633">He kicked me sometimes.</span> <span id="s634">I don’t know where I was.</span> <span id="s635">In came another one, a friend of his, and said to him, “Come I want to show you something.”</span> <span id="s636">So, he said, “What I going to do with this?</span> <span id="s637">I’m going to finish him.”</span> <span id="s638">He said, “Take out, take another, you have so much what do you need him for.”</span> <span id="s639">So, he went with him.</span> <span id="s640">He kicked me right here march zuruk.</span> <span id="s641">My father didn’t believe that I came back.</span> <span id="s642">I think I was – I don’t know why I survived.</span> <span id="s643">I was dying.</span> <span id="s644">He took me there to kill me, and I came back.</span> <span id="s645">So, afterwards, we were sold as I said to another camp, and this camp of course belonged to Gross Rosen.</span> <span id="s646">The camp – the name of the camp was Kaltwasser, Kaltwasser.</span> <span id="s647">This camp was a little better because they didn’t beat us.</span> <span id="s648">They did beat us, but not so much.</span> <span id="s649">At that camp, in the better camp, work was hard, and food was the same, but they didn’t beat so much.</span> <span id="s650">The only thing they beat because it was cold and we were working with cement, and we took some paper to put in – it was so cold – to put enough in the feet, so cold.</span> <span id="s651">And each person who was catched with this at night, they’d beat us up.</span> <span id="s652">We had numbers.</span> <span id="s653">We gave us numbers, also, but not tattooed, but we had on our clothes, and our uniforms, we had numbers.</span> <span id="s654">At that camp, they came once and took youngsters, I was in it, took youngsters to stay aside.</span> <span id="s655">They came out one of them.</span> <span id="s656">I think he was a dentist.</span> <span id="s657">He took me in, took me out of this bunch of where we were.</span> <span id="s658">Took me in their quarters, and pulled me out a tooth.</span> <span id="s659">He said, “I’m going to pull you out a tooth, and you may cry if you feel something to cry over, just go ahead.</span> <span id="s660">Nobody will hear you.”</span> <span id="s661">Anyway, and without anesthetic, without nothing, he pulled out a tooth.</span> <span id="s662">I wanted to stay up.</span> <span id="s663">He said, “Sit down.</span> <span id="s664">And, now if you yell, don’t breathe in because I’m going to take out another tooth, and if you cry or something, I kill you right now.”</span> <span id="s665">And, pulled me out another tooth, two teeth.</span> <span id="s666">I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s667">From this one, it became five because I used a hook, and spoiled.</span> <span id="s668">I make implants to this side, and here I have a bridge.</span> <span id="s669">He took me out five from this side and three on this side, in that better camp, we made ditches, and it was raining so much that night.</span> <span id="s670">It was horrible, and the guards there were well guarded rubber.</span> <span id="s671">There was no plastics by that time.</span> <span id="s672">With rubber, they were dry, and he said, “Hey, Jew, bread.”</span> <span id="s673">He said a little bread.</span> <span id="s674">I pulled out of the trench, and put this in my mouth.</span> <span id="s675">Other people saw something, I don’t know how.</span> <span id="s676">I heard shooting, but people fell on me, and I was offered but the bread I had in my mouth.</span> <span id="s677">When they took out my beating, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s678">I got out this same soldier, the same SS was near me, looking at me.</span> <span id="s679">I knew if I would run or something, he would kill me.</span> <span id="s680">So, I stood up, put my head down, couldn’t look at the Germans.</span> <span id="s681">It was forbidden.</span> <span id="s682">So, I stood.</span> <span id="s683">He with his gun, he hit me here.</span> <span id="s684">It’s still here.</span> <span id="s685">Until today, I don’t breathe with this side.</span> <span id="s686">I breathe this side.</span> <span id="s687">This is Nazi.</span> <span id="s688">The name of the camp was Lärche.</span> <span id="s689">These youngsters, I received a little time ago, I received from Poland a book who said exactly what I’m – not about me, but about the youngsters that all these people who went – who were taken out of this camp, were sent back to Auschwitz and they all gone, all was exterminated in Auschwitz, and it was something.</span> <span id="s690">It was a blessing that he took me out and pulled my teeth out.</span> <span id="s691">If not, I would not be here.</span> <span id="s692">There’s so many coincidences, but I think that God wanted me to be here.</span> <span id="s693">I think it’s God.</span> <span id="s694">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s695">Afterwards, we were taken out from Lärche.</span> <span id="s696">It was Kaltwasser and Lärche.</span> <span id="s697">When I was in Kaltwasser, we had to build Lärche.</span> <span id="s698">And, we build Lärche, and we belonged to a Gross Rosen.</span> <span id="s699">We were taken – they took us to death march, and at that time was almost end of the war.</span> <span id="s700">My father said to me, “I want you to promise me son.”</span> <span id="s701">I said, “Of course, what do you want father?”</span> <span id="s702">He said, “To see the war’s going to end.</span> <span id="s703">The Germans look like the Polish Army in ‘39.</span> <span id="s704">One runs forward, the other runs back, and if they won’t kill us, you will survive.</span> <span id="s705">And, I want you to do a thing.</span> <span id="s706">If you survive, never let people forget what happened to us.</span> <span id="s707">Always tell what happened.</span> <span id="s708">Maybe some people won’t get out in their head that something so terrible could happen, but you always say and tell what happened, no matter – young, old, many, few – always say it.”</span> <span id="s709">I promised my father I would.</span> <span id="s710">He said to me, “Now, my child.</span> <span id="s711">I’m going to sit down because my feet don’t – can’t go on anymore.”</span> <span id="s712">And, to get out of the – to be to not go or sit down, they killed.</span> <span id="s713">We went out from there, we went out 600 prisoners, and at the time, my father fell, we were about 50 or 60.</span> <span id="s714">They killed all of us.</span> <span id="s715">My father said, “I’m going to sit because my feet – my feet don’t – over there.”</span> <span id="s716">I said, “Father, if you will sit down, I will sit down too.</span> <span id="s717">I don’t want to live without you.”</span> <span id="s718">He said, “No, you have to walk.</span> <span id="s719">You have to go.</span> <span id="s720">You have to survive because I don’t want” Anytime he mentioned to stop or something, I stopped with him, and near us, we were always in five.</span> <span id="s721">So, a person – I don’t know who it is, he didn’t survive.</span> <span id="s722">I’m sure.</span> <span id="s723">He said, “You want your son to live.”</span> <span id="s724">He said, “Of course.</span> <span id="s725">The only thing, I’m going to die.</span> <span id="s726">I’m dying.”</span> <span id="s727">“So, put your arm on me, and one arm on your son, and we’ll fall down all the three of us.”</span> <span id="s728">He was in very bad shape too, but we fall down.</span> <span id="s729">My father said, “They’ll shoot us.</span> <span id="s730">They don’t allow it.”</span> <span id="s731">He said, “Put your arm – put your arm on us.</span> <span id="s732">Let’s go.”</span> <span id="s733">And, my father after he put one hand on his and one on my shoulder and we went, and it was a miracle.</span> <span id="s734">All of a sudden, we had a train from nowhere.</span> <span id="s735">There was a train, and our commandant went over to the man who was in it.</span> <span id="s736">There was nobody in it, just a train, just only the driver, and we went into this train, and we came to Flossenbürg.</span> <span id="s737">In Flossenbürg, we were in Block 25, in quarantine.</span> <span id="s738">It was one of the – the worst in Flossenbürg, and the Kapo killed my father there because he went in and it was cold and my father couldn’t go anymore.</span> <span id="s739">So, he went in and he call latrina, and in there he killed my father.</span> <span id="s740">I asked some people, we shouldn’t push if someone died, we had to stay in same place where he died.</span> <span id="s741">They could say, “Get them in.</span> <span id="s742">Get them out.”</span> <span id="s743">But, they asked people to push my father and they attended me, and pushed him in Block 25, and my father was dead.</span> <span id="s744">I saw all the lice getting off his head from him.</span> <span id="s745">I knew that my father’s dead.</span> <span id="s746">He shared the same fate with six million Jews.</span> <span id="s747">My father had 45 years, 45 years.</span> <span id="s748">He was a good man.</span> <span id="s749">He was not religious, but good, respected, respectful, a good person, but he died because he was a Jew with 45 years.</span> <span id="s750">I had about 17.</span> <span id="s751">My father, the crematorium in Flossenbürg didn’t work anymore.</span> <span id="s752">He was burned outside the camp, outside near 25th block, quarantine in Flossenbürg.</span> <span id="s753">He was burned out there and I saw it.</span> <span id="s754">A few days later, I was taken to be drown in south Germany in Bodensee, to be drowned because came a cable from Himmler to Flossenbürg.</span> <span id="s755">My boat, I rowed a boat and I have the facsimile in Portuguese of course, and they said that no prisoner should fall in the hands of the Allies, and I was there to be killed.</span> <span id="s756">In the meantime, it was there.</span> <span id="s757">I didn’t know where I was.</span> <span id="s758">We were bumped.</span> <span id="s759">I don’t know by the English or Americans, and at night we had to get out of the train, and at night we were taken to another train to go on, and in the meantime we stopped in Offenburg.</span> <span id="s760">This town was bombed, and we had to clean it, but a few time, a little time, they take me in the train where we were bombed, as I said.</span> <span id="s761">And we went in this town of Tutlingen.</span> <span id="s762">We went into Tutlingen at night.</span> <span id="s763">I don’t know how – why, I mean I don’t know why, the train started to move, and we stopped in another train – another station called Emmendingen, and at Emmendingen, I was dying.</span> <span id="s764">I was sittin’ there.</span> <span id="s765">I knew I was dying, and I was in peace with myself.</span> <span id="s766">“I’m going to die.”</span> <span id="s767">I knew it.</span> <span id="s768">I didn’t feel no fear.</span> <span id="s769">I didn’t fear anymore.</span> <span id="s770">I didn’t hurt.</span> <span id="s771">Pain, just a little in my feet, because they were swollen, but I was sitting there in the train, they came up, and I heard outside some shooting and then lights, but it wasn’t at me.</span> <span id="s772">I stood there.</span> <span id="s773">I was there with my, they call a blanket, and I was tired.</span> <span id="s774">Came over to me a person, and spoke in some language I don’t know, it was Greek, I don’t know what they said, and came back with a – with some milk and gave it to me, but I couldn’t lift my hand anymore.</span> <span id="s775">So, he pushed my head back, and put this milk in me.</span> <span id="s776">And, I have a son.</span> <span id="s777">He is a doctor.</span> <span id="s778">He is a doctor now.</span> <span id="s779">He said, “Father, you had to die by that time.”</span> <span id="s780">I weighed – my weight was 56 pounds with 17 years.</span> <span id="s781">I was dead.</span> <span id="s782">I was dying there, really dying.</span> <span id="s783">He said, “You had to die like that.”</span> <span id="s784">I didn’t eat.</span> <span id="s785">I don’t know how long I didn’t eat, and all this stuff.</span> <span id="s786">‘The milk should kill you.”</span> <span id="s787">But, I felt better.</span> <span id="s788">I got up.</span> <span id="s789">Got up, and they came Russians too said the Germans run away.</span> <span id="s790">We are free.</span> <span id="s791">We are free now.”</span> <span id="s792">But, for me, it was – I don’t know.</span> <span id="s793">I didn’t feel nothing.</span> <span id="s794">But, I went into a train where the Germans were before.</span> <span id="s795">I could sleep there.</span> <span id="s796">So, I lay down there, and the French.</span> <span id="s797">I was awake by French.</span> <span id="s798">They left us as we were when we – garbage, they ask nothing – what happened.</span> <span id="s799">Who we are, they knew, but they didn’t ask, didn’t bring food, didn’t bring a doctor, didn’t bring a nurse, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.</span> <span id="s800">We waited few days afterwards, they came back said they going to retreat.</span> <span id="s801">Who wants to go with them can go, but they don’t have any trucks to take us.</span> <span id="s802">I couldn’t go a yard.</span> <span id="s803">I couldn’t go ten miles, twenty miles.</span> <span id="s804">So, I didn’t get up.</span> <span id="s805">I was dead.</span> <span id="s806">The next day, the Germans came back, and I was taken with others who also couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s807">We were taken to be shot.</span> <span id="s808">When we came in near where they wanted to shoot us, there came a priest, a firer and two civilians, and said to – it was an officer – they told him, “If you kill these people and the French come back, we will be responsible for it.”</span> <span id="s809">They did nothing.</span> <span id="s810">So, leave them because of us.</span> <span id="s811">And, they didn’t say it’s not allowed to kill.</span> <span id="s812">They gave him a reason why because they will be responsible.</span> <span id="s813">They took us in the school, and afterwards they were shooting and when we got out there were white flags and there was bread the second time.</span> <span id="s814">Sixty years ago, last year, was January 2004, I went to Germany, Poland and Germany, to see all this I’m telling you.</span> <span id="s815">All this, I saw it again, and I went to Emmendingen and spoke to the mayor of the city Emmendingen, and he has it all written down with dates.</span> <span id="s816">I don’t know dates, but he did.</span> <span id="s817">I’ve got it home in Brazil.</span> <span id="s818">I have it written down all this.</span> <span id="s819">I read a book and I showed him what – this is this but without dates, and it’s exactly the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: I want to go back a little bit to the very beginning of the ghetto when you realized that you were going to be fenced up some little area.</span> <span id="s821">You were so called lucky that you didn’t have to move because you stayed in your own apartment with your parents, but what was the feeling of being fenced in, of being separated from the rest of the world?</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: In the ghetto we were fenced in.</span> <span id="s823">It was a feeling of loses.</span> <span id="s824">We lost everything.</span> <span id="s825">We were not human anymore.</span> <span id="s826">We were put in like cattle in a place where there was room for 25,000, we were squeezed in 165,000, and it was something like to take out at night some person and put them in the street.</span> <span id="s827">We have all, even us, we were in the ghetto we were lucky not to leave the home, but we all – all we had before the war, but we felt the same.</span> <span id="s828">We felt the same because we were afraid of invasion.</span> <span id="s829">They came in some people and took it.</span> <span id="s830">Just went in and we want to stay here, and we are afraid that more people are going to come.</span> <span id="s831">We were afraid.</span> <span id="s832">You couldn’t say no.</span> <span id="s833">Of course, you couldn’t say no.</span> <span id="s834">Go in, get in, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s835">They did so.</span> <span id="s836">They didn’t ask, and we didn’t say no.</span> <span id="s837">I was a child, but my parents – my father said it’s okay.</span> <span id="s838">We don’t need so much room.</span> <span id="s839">And, just it was something.</span> <span id="s840">I really don’t have words to say what we felt.</span> <span id="s841">People were sleeping in the streets, in the street and it was raining.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: Tell me a little bit about the apartment.</span> <span id="s843">When you entered there was a separate kitchen, and was there a bathroom?</span> <span id="s844">Was there a toilet?</span> <span id="s845">Was there running water in the apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s847">We had – the apartment wasn’t a new one.</span> <span id="s848">We had the toilet, you had to go out.</span> <span id="s849">We had to go down, and there was a toilet separate in the yard, and we had three rooms, sleeping rooms.</span> <span id="s850">One was mine separate.</span> <span id="s851">We came in the kitchen, from the kitchen there was a dining room, and we had three rooms – one was my parents’, one was to hold some things that my father had, that my parents had, and my room separate.</span> <span id="s852">And, all those rooms were taken by – about the toilet, the toilet was down there just for the whole building.</span> <span id="s853">There was no running water in the house.</span> <span id="s854">We had to go pick it up in a pump, and to take it in.</span> <span id="s855">And, the toilet in ghetto, there was a – there was a barrel.</span> <span id="s856">They put it lying down, made a hole in the middle, and took out all this thing from people left there, put it in this barrel.</span> <span id="s857">This barrel was taken to Marysin, and there it was emptied and came back to take others.</span> <span id="s858">Those people usually were families who put it, and they received a little more bread.</span> <span id="s859">These people basic called scheisszkommando.</span> <span id="s860">The schiesszkommando were happy because they got a little more bread, and this was our house.</span> <span id="s861">It was very good.</span> <span id="s862">It was very cozy, but it wasn’t very modern.</span> <span id="s863">It was very good.</span> <span id="s864">We lived good.</span> <span id="s865">As I said, my father, they looked at us as rich people.</span> <span id="s866">We were not.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: Tell me about the geography.</span> <span id="s868">You said that your street, Gesia Street, was near the fence.</span> <span id="s869">How far away was it from the bridge?</span> <span id="s870">And, how often did you have to go through the bridge to the other side of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: The bridge – to cross the bridge – I want to say, the ghetto was three parts, and from one part to the other they made a bridge, and that bridge took from one part to the other.</span> <span id="s872">In the beginning, I worked in the Nazi shop.</span> <span id="s873">I worked in metaleines, but it was not in the same place where it was later on.</span> <span id="s874">We moved.</span> <span id="s875">They made it bigger and better and to go where I lived, I had to go it was quite a while to go.</span> <span id="s876">It was not so near, but it wasn’t so far, and I had to cross the bridge and to go on the other side to ghetto, Nowomiejska, I mean Zgierska, and so I had to cross it each day two times.</span> <span id="s877">That’s also where doors to open – we had door and the bridge.</span> <span id="s878">Some people went through the bridge, and some people went through the door, but the door was opened not always.</span> <span id="s879">It was opened sometimes because the street cars between one part to the other, there were street cars with Germans and Poles who went from one place to the other.</span> <span id="s880">In the beginning, I had two times, two times a day, to work and back.</span> <span id="s881">And, afterwards, I lived near the plant, near metaleines.</span> <span id="s882">So, I didn’t have to go far, it was near.</span> <span id="s883">I was now in Poland, in Poland.</span> <span id="s884">It’s something else.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: I have two questions – one was it scary to go through the bridge?</span> <span id="s886">And, if so, why?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: No, to go to the bridge was not scary.</span> <span id="s888">I’m not scared to the bridge because I just through, it, and there was nobody had to be scared about it.</span> <span id="s889">We were always scared.</span> <span id="s890">We were scared.</span> <span id="s891">We lived scared.</span> <span id="s892">We were scared, but to cross the bridge didn’t scare, just cross the bridge.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: Tell me did you ever see Biebow?</span> <span id="s894">Did you meet him?</span> <span id="s895">Did you see him in the street, or did you never maybe you never saw him, but just knew about him?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: Biebow I saw once.</span> <span id="s897">He came to make an inspection in metaleines.</span> <span id="s898">He want always to look where people were working and so, but he came to metaleines.</span> <span id="s899">He came in where I worked and asked – didn’t really ask me, but he asked the other people if they have enough to eat and it they feel good and how feel, and that’s all.</span> <span id="s900">But, we were, but Chaimowicz said if he, always, if he asked somethin’ say always, you’re good.</span> <span id="s901">You feel good.</span> <span id="s902">You have food.</span> <span id="s903">That’s all.</span> <span id="s904">And, the person he asked answered exactly what was told to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: Was Biebow a person that you were scared of more than, let’s say Jewish policemen?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: We were scared of all of it.</span> <span id="s907">We were scared of Jewish policemen.</span> <span id="s908">We were scared of Biebow.</span> <span id="s909">We were scared of Rumkowski.</span> <span id="s910">We were scared of Sonderkommando.</span> <span id="s911">We were scared – always we were scared.</span> <span id="s912">It was no more or less, but we were – we had more, we were more afraid more for policemen than from Biebow.</span> <span id="s913">Biebow didn’t come.</span> <span id="s914">He came one time, but the police you had it the time.</span> <span id="s915">So, we were afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: What were you afraid of that what would the police do to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: To take us – to take us for nothing.</span> <span id="s918">To take us to Czarnieckiego.</span> <span id="s919">We were afraid the policemen just to take us, so on, take us out of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: Tell me again why if you believed that they’re taking people for work, why not to go?</span> <span id="s921">Why avoid it?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: We didn’t want to go out of the ghetto even we believed they going to work.</span> <span id="s923">We didn’t go out because some had family.</span> <span id="s924">For instance, both of my uncles they went out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s925">They wanted to eat.</span> <span id="s926">They told them they were going to Russia to work.</span> <span id="s927">So, went out.</span> <span id="s928">But, for instance, if I would be a grown-up person, I wouldn’t go out because I wanted to be with my mother and my father.</span> <span id="s929">My father wanted to be with his wife and me, and my mother wanted to be with her husband.</span> <span id="s930">That’s why.</span> <span id="s931">People wanted to go.</span> <span id="s932">Some went.</span> <span id="s933">“No, I’m going out because I want to live.</span> <span id="s934">I want to eat better.”</span> <span id="s935">But, most of us didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s936">“Here I know it’s bad.</span> <span id="s937">Maybe I’ll die, but I’ll die here.</span> <span id="s938">Why should I go look for better or worse?</span> <span id="s939">I’ll stay here.”</span> <span id="s940">That’s the reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Did you know what was Biebow’s function?</span> <span id="s942">What was his responsibility?</span> <span id="s943">What was he doing with the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: We knew we had of Biebow, we knew very little.</span> <span id="s945">We knew he was the gaulieter.</span> <span id="s946">He is the head, and he is above Krippo.</span> <span id="s947">We had a Krippo – criminal police.</span> <span id="s948">We had a Krippo.</span> <span id="s949">We had a Gestapo, and also Jewish police, also in the same style.</span> <span id="s950">The Jewish police was in the same style as the Germans.</span> <span id="s951">And, Biebow himself, he didn’t expose himself.</span> <span id="s952">We didn’t know very much about him.</span> <span id="s953">He was the head, of course, but we didn’t.</span> <span id="s954">After the war, we saw pictures.</span> <span id="s955">I saw pictures.</span> <span id="s956">I knew what really happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: Was it clear to you and your parents that it was these were the Germans who are making your life so difficult in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s958">Or did you blame the Jewish Administration – Rumkowski, the police?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: About who we blamed, we blamed both of them.</span> <span id="s960">The Germans, because they wanted to annihilate us.</span> <span id="s961">They wanted to kill us all.</span> <span id="s962">And, the Jewish police, the Jewish administration we blamed for some errors they did.</span> <span id="s963">For example, the Germans sended flour to make bread.</span> <span id="s964">So, he didn’t make bread, and it to the people to eat.</span> <span id="s965">He made bread put it away and said there it will be harder times than now, and the bread they had to throw it away and we didn’t eat it.</span> <span id="s966">He could do it.</span> <span id="s967">Potatoes – they send so little, but this little didn’t come to us.</span> <span id="s968">People died because of Rumkowski with his all errors.</span> <span id="s969">They sent potatoes.</span> <span id="s970">Instead to give it to the people, eat, two, three, five potatoes.</span> <span id="s971">No, he made holes, put it in Marysin, put holes, put straw and buried it, and it spoiled.</span> <span id="s972">They bored of them.</span> <span id="s973">What the Germans didn’t, the Jewish administration did.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: Many of survivors of the Lodz ghetto feel that more people survived from Lodz ghetto than from any other ghetto.</span> <span id="s975">What do you think about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: About survivors from Lodz ghetto.</span> <span id="s977">It’s not true.</span> <span id="s978">We were put in – we were squeezed in I said, 165,000 people.</span> <span id="s979">In the end of ’45, when we were taken to Auschwitz, we were in ghetto 70,000 people still, but those people who were in ghetto, there were 70,000 between them, there were only 1,500 people who went in with these 165,000.</span> <span id="s980">All died from hunger, from Chelmno, and from so on.</span> <span id="s981">It’s not true.</span> <span id="s982">From ghetto Lodz who came in out of the ghetto we had 1,500.</span> <span id="s983">Today, people all over around Lodz, you ask where you been, “Lodz”.</span> <span id="s984">They not Lodz.</span> <span id="s985">Lodz is a state, and the oldest state Lodz.</span> <span id="s986">Some people went through Lodz also, but in Lodz where I was born in Lodz, raised in Lodz, lived in ghetto Lodz.</span> <span id="s987">In ghetto there are others also, but they’re not from Lodz.</span> <span id="s988">From Lodz, and they don’t know.</span> <span id="s989">They came in the end, and they were 70,000 people with them.</span> <span id="s990">From the 165,000 who went in the ghetto, when the ghetto was liquidated, finished, only 1,500 people, and this people could be more.</span> <span id="s991">If it would be better administrated and so I don’t know.</span> <span id="s992">I don’t think that he was right because if you want someone to be bad, give them power, and that was him.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: I’d like to ask you now about October 1941 after the schools closed, and the western Jews came in.</span> <span id="s994">You told us before that two elderly couples lived with you in the apartment, but did you meet other children, German speaking children that came from Berlin or from Vienna or from Prague maybe?</span> <span id="s995">Did you meet them?</span> <span id="s996">Did you know them?</span> <span id="s997">Did you play with them, talk to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: Who came in the ghetto Lodz were no children, not youths.</span> <span id="s999">They were only elderly people, and most of them were decorated by the first World War, and they believed, as I said, they believed they were going to be changed for German POWs.</span> <span id="s1000">There were no children.</span> <span id="s1001">There were only elderly people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: That you met?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: Right, there were no children.</span> <span id="s1004">I met in concentration camp after the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1005">I met some from Austria, from – youth, children from Czechs and from Hungary, from, all this but in the camps, but not in ghetto.</span> <span id="s1006">In ghetto, there were no children, only elderly people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: Did you and your friends, your family somehow blame the German Jews or the Austrian Jews that came in and because of them the school was closed?</span> <span id="s1008">Did you make this connection that because they came, the school was closed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: When the Germans came into the ghetto, we just ignored them.</span> <span id="s1010">I don’t know why, but we just ignored them.</span> <span id="s1011">It wasn’t because they were better or worse or they want to take our place or something like that.</span> <span id="s1012">People don’t know.</span> <span id="s1013">Ignore them, people.</span> <span id="s1014">They came in, in our house.</span> <span id="s1015">They thought that the Germans and we are Poles.</span> <span id="s1016">We were Jews, and they were Jews, but it was no – between us, nobody hate, nobody.</span> <span id="s1017">You’re a German, okay, you’re a German Jew, but we didn’t blame them, of course not.</span> <span id="s1018">But, people ignored them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: Could you communicate with them?</span> <span id="s1020">Could you talk to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: Yeah, yeah, of course.</span> <span id="s1022">My father spoke very good German.</span> <span id="s1023">So do I. My mother too, in our home was spoke Polish, and we had a lot of books.</span> <span id="s1024">When the Germans came in, my father burned books.</span> <span id="s1025">German books in our house, and they came also Lichtenstein from another, Luxembourg, yeah, they came from Luxembourg and we were friends – younger people.</span> <span id="s1026">There came some younger people.</span> <span id="s1027">We were friends, but older one looked at us that we were Poles and they were Germans.</span> <span id="s1028">That’s why.</span> <span id="s1029">From the other parts, it was very good.</span> <span id="s1030">There was no difference between us.</span> <span id="s1031">They died just the same way we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: Sir, anytime you want to start.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: All those years, I was looking for that piece of paper – it’s not just a piece of paper, it’s something I wrote when I was 13 years old.</span> <span id="s1034">I’m 77 now, and I found it.</span> <span id="s1035">I’m so excited about it that I don’t know what to say.</span> <span id="s1036">Of course, it’s written in here, it’s all a lie.</span> <span id="s1037">We, it says, “We little children are grateful for you our father” is Rumkowski “because you took us out from the dirt and gave us cleanness that we now can breathe fresh air.”</span> <span id="s1038">And so on.</span> <span id="s1039">It’s a lie.</span> <span id="s1040">It’s a great lie, but I remember that at that time I had to do it because I had, and I was a little boy, and today I know it what happens here.</span> <span id="s1041">And I’m very, very excited to see after those years something I made when I was twelve years old, thirteen I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: [Background talking]</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: When the album was ready for Rosh Hashanah, we made it for our father – our father, and all the children had to sign it.</span> <span id="s1044">I made the album.</span> <span id="s1045">I wrote it, but all this students had to sign it.</span> <span id="s1046">It’s also my signature in here, and after those years, I found it out, and I would say it’s a pleasure.</span> <span id="s1047">Yeah, it’s a pleasure.</span> <span id="s1048">They wanted to kill us all.</span> <span id="s1049">All of them were killed, but they forgotten one, and I’m a witness of what happened, and I got my signature right here with all my friends, my friends.</span> <span id="s1050">All of them I liked.</span> <span id="s1051">Was Cukier.</span> <span id="s1052">He should have written it, but he couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1053">I did it.</span> <span id="s1054">After those years, I’m here.</span> <span id="s1055">Cukier, I’m here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: [Background talking]</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: On Rosh Hashanah-</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: Go ahead sir.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: On Rosh Hashanah, we made an album to give to our father Rumkowski, father, and I wrote it.</span> <span id="s1060">It should be Cukier who should made it, but I did it, and after those years, I found my signature in here.</span> <span id="s1061">All the boys, we were together, all my friends.</span> <span id="s1062">I’m sure nobody lives anymore, but I found my signature in here, and all those are my friends.</span> <span id="s1063">They all live in me, all live in me, and I am here.</span> <span id="s1064">The Nazis killed six million, six million.</span> <span id="s1065">1,500,000 children, but I am here.</span> <span id="s1066">I am here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: Mr. Laks, Anytime you’re ready.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: In 1940, right after closing the ghetto, the Germans permitted schools, a school, and I was one of the children who went to school.</span> <span id="s1069">This picture was taken at Franciszkanska.</span> <span id="s1070">I don’t know whether 21 or 19.</span> <span id="s1071">The building is still there, but we were a class, our class of children, and I was the head.</span> <span id="s1072">I was the best.</span> <span id="s1073">Of course, I wasn’t the best student, but for some reason they picked me out to be the head.</span> <span id="s1074">And, by that time, there was a German – I don’t remember his name – he took pictures in 1940 pictures, colored pictures, and I am in that picture.</span> <span id="s1075">That’s me over here.</span> <span id="s1076">That’s me.</span> <span id="s1077">That picture, that’s me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: [Background talking]</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: In 1940, the Germans allowed schools in ghetto, and there was open class school in the church of Franciszkanska, 21 or 19 I don’t remember the number, but I was in it.</span> <span id="s1080">The main reason to go there was not so much to learn as to have another soup.</span> <span id="s1081">We see here children with pots to get a little soup, we got the soup there.</span> <span id="s1082">In this picture, I am too.</span> <span id="s1083">That is me, here.</span> <span id="s1084">In 2004, I was back to see it, and the building’s just the same, and here I am, here.</span> <span id="s1085">Also, it made the – I don’t know for the some reason – this little boy here, my friend of course, I don’t know who it is.</span> <span id="s1086">He has a hat from a Jewish policeman.</span> <span id="s1087">It’s something.</span> <span id="s1088">I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s1089">Also, my friends have stars, yellow Stars of David, but I don’t have a star.</span> <span id="s1090">I don’t have a star because I was not 12 years old by that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: [Background talking]</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: After making the album, and we were sent to take it to Rumkowski, to our father, and I don’t remember well what was happened in there, but that is my picture here.</span> <span id="s1093">Exactly here, that’s me, over here.</span> <span id="s1094">I found it now.</span> <span id="s1095">I’m grateful to have it.</span> <span id="s1096">I don’t think it makes any difference, but for me it does.</span> <span id="s1097">Here I am, 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">End of Recording</span></p> <p><span
