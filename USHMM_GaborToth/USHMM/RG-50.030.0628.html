talking a little bit about your life before the war.</span> <span id="s24">Can you describe your father's occupation and the type of schooling and the family life you had before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s26">My father's parents were bakers in Shedlitz.</span> <span id="s27">And he was born in 1900, also March the 23rd.</span> <span id="s28">But he didn't like the family because they were too religious for him, so when he grew up, he didn't want to be a baker, so he became a shoemaker.</span> <span id="s29">In 1923, he was trying to avoid the Polish army, he went to Berlin, and he worked in Berlin for four or five years, approximately, as a shoemaker.</span> <span id="s30">He was making fancy shoes there.</span> <span id="s31">After —— in 1928, he came back to Poland, and he married my mother.</span> <span id="s32">And I was born in 1928.</span> <span id="s33">After 1928, I was one years old, my father didn't like living in Shedlitz, so we moved to Aleksandrow Kujawski.</span> <span id="s34">This was not far.</span> <span id="s35">It's in Poland and ____.</span> <span id="s36">The reason he moved there, because they found out over here he could make a nice living making shoes and selling them to people that was from Poland.</span> <span id="s37">So, when I came there, I was one years old.</span> <span id="s38">My father started a business ____ —— well, actually, a Polish lady, because he was in business with my mother, making the shoes and selling them.</span> <span id="s39">So, I was right behind most of the time, and I spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s40">We lived there 'til 1938.</span> <span id="s41">In 1938, after the Kristallnacht, most of the people were living —— there was only 150, 200 Jews, not too many Jews living there.</span> <span id="s42">Most of them were Polk Deutsche living there.</span> <span id="s43">1938 became very bad for us, so we had to leave Aleksandrow, and we went back to Shedlitz, came to Shedlitz.</span> <span id="s44">So, my father's went to work for a sports factory.</span> <span id="s45">They were making sport shoes for skiing, ice skating, and soccer, and soccer balls.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: And when your father was working, could you talk about the type of education, activities, hobbies that you and your brother had?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: I had the same education like I had in Aleksandrow, because I was not used to Jewish life, because most of the Jewish kids lived, like, in a ghetto.</span> <span id="s48">They had to go to Jewish schools.</span> <span id="s49">They didn't play with Polish kids.</span> <span id="s50">They were afraid.</span> <span id="s51">They were beaten up.</span> <span id="s52">They couldn't go to swim.</span> <span id="s53">They couldn't ride a bicycle.</span> <span id="s54">They couldn't play ball.</span> <span id="s55">But I was used to that Polish life, so I registered myself, and I went to a school, to a Polish school for a year.</span> <span id="s56">In that school, I became very popular because I'm a very good soccer player and a ping—pong player, and a volleyball player.</span> <span id="s57">So, they kept me there good.</span> <span id="s58">They treated me good.</span> <span id="s59">Now, the war broke out in 1939.</span> <span id="s60">In 1939, when the war broke out, was terrible.</span> <span id="s61">All the —— half of Shedlitz was bombed.</span> <span id="s62">So, all my mother's relatives, most of them, got killed.</span> <span id="s63">So, they all moved in with us.</span> <span id="s64">So, they all lived with us in the ghetto, like for —— like ten people living in one room.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Let's move back.</span> <span id="s66">Before the ghetto was established, after the bombing ——</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: —— do they move in with you before the ghetto or ——</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s70">They moved in before the ghetto, because they have no place left to live, so they slept in my house, over there.</span> <span id="s71">We slept on the floor.</span> <span id="s72">We slept on couches, because there was no mattresses in Europe.</span> <span id="s73">In Europe, a mattress was straw and a sack.</span> <span id="s74">That was your mattress.</span> <span id="s75">And in the ghetto, when it started, the ghetto, they took away all the men right away, they took away.</span> <span id="s76">So, they took my father away, too.</span> <span id="s77">So, where he went, I did not know where he went.</span> <span id="s78">Or how he went, I didn't know either.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: So, let's go back.</span> <span id="s80">Let me step back a little bit before.</span> <span id="s81">From the period of the bombing, that's September '39, and then the ghetto was the next summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: So, that in—between stage, was your father able to work?</span> <span id="s84">Were you able to do anything ——</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: —— or life pretty much stopped?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: No.</span> <span id="s88">My father didn't work nothing.</span> <span id="s89">He helped out a little bit in the bakery with my grandmA: My grandma had a big bakery.</span> <span id="s90">She used to bake the bread and the cakes, everything for about —— for the whole town, the whole ghetto used to go to my grandmother.</span> <span id="s91">So, my father used to help them out.</span> <span id="s92">Then they took him away.</span> <span id="s93">I was in the street, because I was not used to stay with the Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s94">I played outside.</span> <span id="s95">I had a special soccer ball my father gave me, so I played with the Polish kids in the street, and I was very popular with the Polish kids because I played a lot of soccer.</span> <span id="s96">We went to the school backyard playing because there was no school.</span> <span id="s97">At that time, there was noschools, nothing.</span> <span id="s98">So, everybody was free.</span> <span id="s99">You did whatever you could.</span> <span id="s100">Then they established a ghetto.</span> <span id="s101">When they established the ghetto, they took away my father.</span> <span id="s102">I don't know where they took him, but they took him away.</span> <span id="s103">I don't know where he got to.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Do you remember the day your father was taken away?</span> <span id="s105">Was it SS who took him?</span> <span id="s106">Did you witness it?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Or just, one day, your father was ——</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: No.</span> <span id="s110">I was in the street that time.</span> <span id="s111">I remember when they took out the men, the men.</span> <span id="s112">They took out the men, and they make three lines.</span> <span id="s113">And the women on one side, that they SS men was standing on top, on spokes.</span> <span id="s114">There was a pharmacy there.</span> <span id="s115">I remember now that the names from the street was ____ ?</span> <span id="s116">Schutzki?</span> <span id="s117">22, was a pharmacy, one pharmacy in all of Shedlitz.</span> <span id="s118">And the guy was saying, all the men go to the left, the women be kept in the middle and with the young girls, and down the —— the teenagers were kept to the right.</span> <span id="s119">And that's how we were sorted.</span> <span id="s120">And then I saw they took away my father.</span> <span id="s121">I heard from one of the SS soldiers where they take him to Sokolow, on a soccer —— on a soccer stadium.</span> <span id="s122">Where you think they kept the people?</span> <span id="s123">In the soccer stadium.</span> <span id="s124">And that's how they stood there for a week, two.</span> <span id="s125">And after this, I don't know where they shipped —— where they took him.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: So ——</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: At that time, I didn't know where he is.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: So, after your father left ——</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: —— you were left alone in the ghetto with your mother ——</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: And my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: And were the other relatives, were you uncles also taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: No.</span> <span id="s134">My uncle was sick because he was in the farming, he was injured.</span> <span id="s135">So, his wife died and the two girls died because, you know, they had no —— they had no medications from infection.</span> <span id="s136">They all died.</span> <span id="s137">And they —— all the kids in the ghetto, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s138">They had no medications for them, so they were dying like flies.</span> <span id="s139">And in the ghetto was bad, bad.</span> <span id="s140">And then they took me —— I was assigned from the Utenrod (ph) to go, as a teenager, they needed me for the German soldiers, for the cavalmitz (ph), as they called it, for the barracks, to clean and to bring down the mattresses, the blankets, and to take down.</span> <span id="s141">So, they used to keep us for a whole day, and then at night we used to go home, and in the morning we had to come again.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: And were you escorted by policemen to your place of work, or were you just able to ——</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: No, they took us.</span> <span id="s144">When we stood outside —— they told us how many kids to pull out, you know, the Utenrod (ph).</span> <span id="s145">So, they came with a truck, and they took us to the cavalmitz (ph), to the barracks, when we worked.</span> <span id="s146">From the barracks, coming back, we did not go by truck.</span> <span id="s147">They told us to walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: And when you were walking, were you able to contact the Poles in the community?</span> <span id="s149">Or ——</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: No.</span> <span id="s151">We walked freely.</span> <span id="s152">They came.</span> <span id="s153">We walked into the —— sometimes they used to beat you up if they know that you're Jewish, you know, they used to beat you up in the streets.</span> <span id="s154">To a park, you couldn't go.</span> <span id="s155">You couldn't go to swim.</span> <span id="s156">You couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s157">The only thing you were —— like a prisoner.</span> <span id="s158">But I, most of the time, used to run out from the ____ because I used to play with the kids in the street.</span> <span id="s159">I was a street kid.</span> <span id="s160">So, I used to play.</span> <span id="s161">And they know me.</span> <span id="s162">In that time, you know, the teenagers were not anti—semitic.</span> <span id="s163">When it came after age 15, 16, you know, the old teenagers, they hated you.</span> <span id="s164">They killed you.</span> <span id="s165">They took you to the Germans to sell you for two pound of salt, two pounds of sugar.</span> <span id="s166">But the teenagers at 12, 13 years old, they didn't know so much about anti—semitics.</span> <span id="s167">They were educated in the churches, they used to teach.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: And did you have to wear any identifying badge?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: I used to wear, but I used to take it off when I went out on the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Was it an arm band or a star?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Arm band.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: And you just took it off?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: I took it off.</span> <span id="s174">I used to take it off and keep it in my pocket because I know that the kids not going to say anything because they needed my soccer ball to play ball with.</span> <span id="s175">And that's how we were in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s176">It was terrible living in the ghetto, because it was no food, nothing.</span> <span id="s177">People used to get sick.</span> <span id="s178">And the tanks used to run day and night.</span> <span id="s179">And the SS used to come in and check the apartment once in a while to see if there's any men hiding out.</span> <span id="s180">So, they used to look under the bed and this, but when they saw kids with women only, they still didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s181">They used to ask you, Where's your husband?</span> <span id="s182">Where's your father?</span> <span id="s183">So, we told them, they took them out already a couple months ago.</span> <span id="s184">But they still used to come and check.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Now, let's go back to you working in the SS kaserne.</span> <span id="s186">Can you describe sort of the typical day?</span> <span id="s187">And I understand that at some point you stopped working there, so can you describe that a bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s189">When I came to work there, I worked there for a while, because right, because we used to run up and down the steps because there was no elevators, so we had to carry the mattresses out, the blankets.</span> <span id="s190">And then we used to change the linens.</span> <span id="s191">And downstairs was the laundry.</span> <span id="s192">So, when they cleaned that out, we had to bring up the fresh stuff upstairs.</span> <span id="s193">And then when we're finished with this, they used to clean the streets, the toilets.</span> <span id="s194">We used to sweep, you know, the gutters.</span> <span id="s195">And that's how we worked there for a long time.</span> <span id="s196">I would say I worked there for close to a year.</span> <span id="s197">And one day, I was playing around with the kids, and I was laughing, so the SS men thought I'm laughing from him, so he run over to me with a rifle with a corbet (ph) they called it ____ the end side, and hit me in my head.</span> <span id="s198">He hit me in the head, and I fell down on the floor.</span> <span id="s199">I thought I was going to die.</span> <span id="s200">After this, I stood up.</span> <span id="s201">I went home.</span> <span id="s202">And I said to my mother I'm not going after this.</span> <span id="s203">They could kill me.</span> <span id="s204">After this, I didn't go back to work because I worked more than I —— it was already '42.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: And you mother and your brother, were they working also?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: No.</span> <span id="s207">My brother was helping in the ghetto, working there, you know.</span> <span id="s208">And my mother, what can she do?</span> <span id="s209">She couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s210">She couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s211">So, she wasn't —— a housewife.</span> <span id="s212">There was no food.</span> <span id="s213">The only food I got when I used to go —— sorry.</span> <span id="s214">I used to go to my grandma, to the bakery.</span> <span id="s215">I used to take some bread, you know.</span> <span id="s216">So, that's how I used to meet them, when I used to go pick up the food.</span> <span id="s217">I used to pick up ____ because he was delivering ____, you know, the wood, the eggs, you know, the milk, he used to bring it.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Was your mother's bakery inside ——</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Not my mother's.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: I mean, your grandmother's, inside the ghetto boundaries?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s222">Yes.</span> <span id="s223">She was the only baker.</span> <span id="s224">She worked to the last minute, she had that bakery.</span> <span id="s225">And the last minute they took her, Yom Kippur day, and the trucks, and they finished them off then.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Describe —— so, the Pole who came and brought supplies to your grandmother ——</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: —— he could come freely into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s229">Were there other Poles who were coming into

to give him flour.</span> <span id="s236">They used to pay him.</span> <span id="s237">She used to clean the bakeries down.</span> <span id="s238">And then, that's how I used to meet him and talk to him.Down to the last minute, when —— before I made a decision to go, I spoke to him, and I told him this and this time, you know, in the ghetto, I couldn't take it no more.</span> <span id="s239">So, I told my mother, when I came in from the street, and I heard Yom Kippur day, going to be the liquidation of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s240">So, I came in and I told my mother.</span> <span id="s241">So, my uncle says, Don't listen to him.</span> <span id="s242">You have a bed for to sleep.</span> <span id="s243">They're going to kill you.</span> <span id="s244">How do you want to sleep

kid.</span> <span id="s250">This is the time to leave, because they want to kill us, because —— don't you see what's going on?</span> <span id="s251">All the young SS and the storm troopers went to the battlefield.</span> <span id="s252">They took them out.</span> <span id="s253">So, at that time, wasn't so bad in the street, because you had just the occupation force.</span> <span id="s254">And the occupation force was old guys, like 40 years, 45, that were not so bad, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s255">They sympathize.</span> <span id="s256">Some of the sympathize, you

<span id="s290">My mother didn't want to go either, because my uncle, you know, he talks her out of it.</span> <span id="s291">So, my mother says, I have to go with him, otherwise he's going by

No.</span> <span id="s303">Nobody saw us, because we —— my mother —— and you'll see the picture —— my brother, we all —— we didn't look like the typical Jews, because typical Jews, they could recognize you.</span> <span id="s304">But we looked different because we were raised in a Polish town at that time, Aleksandrow Kujawski.</span> <span id="s305">We lived in, as all Polacks did.</span> <span id="s306">So, that's why we didn't look like the typical Jews.</span> <span id="s307">So, we decided, told him we were going to meet him at this and this place, and he was waiting for us there.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: How did you leave the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: The ghetto, went out through the back, yes, through the back.</span> <span id="s310">We got really —— we went out through the back, and we sneaked out.</span> <span id="s311">You know, it was a rainy day, a ____ rainy day.</span> <span id="s312">So, it was just good for us.</span> <span id="s313">It was, I would say, around 5, 6 o'clock at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: And tell me a little bit more about the person who was waiting for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: He was waiting for you.</span> <span id="s316">So, my mother says, how do you know —— my uncle says to her, How do you know he's not going to kill you?</span> <span id="s317">I said, What are you talking about?</span> <span id="s318">He works for my grandma, and he likes me.</span> <span id="s319">He told me to come.</span> <span id="s320">I went with him plenty of times ____+ took me to his house, and I stood with him there.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: And ——</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: So, he says, I'll take you.</span> <span id="s323">But I have to make sure that, you know —— that's why he took you at night, because it was dark.</span> <span id="s324">So, he'll come, it will be dark.</span> <span id="s325">I will take you in there.</span> <span id="s326">But, remember, he says, you cannot stay in the house for the time because I'm afraid, because nobody should find out.</span> <span id="s327">But it was a good location, so it was —— it was across the street from a church.</span> <span id="s328">His house was the last house at the end of the small town, you know, of the village, the end of the road.</span> <span id="s329">And one side to the other side was the church.</span> <span id="s330">So, not too many Nazis, not too many soldiers used to come to check them.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: How far away from Shedlitz was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: I couldn't tell you.</span> <span id="s333">We went about two and a half hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: And what was the name of the man and his wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: His name was Wladek, and his wife's name was StasA:</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: And about how old were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Oh, they were old.</span> <span id="s338">Oh, how do you know, in Poland, how old they are because a person 65 was how many died.</span> <span id="s339">There was no medication, nothing.</span> <span id="s340">He was very old.</span> <span id="s341">She's special —— they were very old but very nice.</span> <span id="s342">Very nice.</span> <span id="s343">Because, you know —— but they were so scared.</span> <span id="s344">God forbid, if somebody finds out that I hide Jews, they going to say you are a Jew lover, they're going to burn my house.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: And describe your sleeping quarters.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: The sleeping quarters was not bad.</span> <span id="s347">But it was terrible because he had to hide us certain places in case, you know, you see somebody walking or something, we had to sneak out for the —— you know, the —— on a small town, how the rooms are?</span> <span id="s348">We slept over on a floor, on the floor, but we had —— you know, like, put down like straw, in plenty time, if he found out that somebody was going to come to check the small town, the soldiers were going to come, the Germans, or pass by, so he kept us in the barn, you know.</span> <span id="s349">He has chickens and had a few goats, you know, from milk he used to got.</span> <span id="s350">And there were chickens.</span> <span id="s351">He had about 50 chickens maybe.</span> <span id="s352">And then he had one cow.</span> <span id="s353">And he had two horses.</span> <span id="s354">So, we kept us there.</span> <span id="s355">Plenty of times we had to go in there to stay, but in the summertime, I didn't mind staying there.</span> <span id="s356">You know why?</span> <span id="s357">Because it was better than in the house, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: I understand there were woods outside.</span> <span id="s359">How much time were you ——</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: In the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: —— out doors?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: It was a very good location, the woods, because his whole backyard was woods and swamps, so, in the summertime, we used to go to the woods and stay there.</span> <span id="s363">We used to enjoy ourselves because it was fresh air.</span> <span id="s364">You didn't have to sit in one place, you know, because she used to look out through the window to see if anybody's coming, God forbid, so we used to sneak out and stay in the wood.</span> <span id="s365">And then, if it was rainy or bad weather, we used to come back.</span> <span id="s366">So, he used to tell us when it's safe to come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: What was the signal to know whether it was safe or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Used to put on a few bricks there, you know, stone.</span> <span id="s369">If you put down, let's say, like three, four bricks, one on top of the other, that means it was safe.</span> <span id="s370">And —— but most of the time it was safe.</span> <span id="s371">I'll tell you why, because it was the last house, and not too many soldiers, Germans, came that time, because they were busy with the Russian front.</span> <span id="s372">So, they, maybe, since I was there, hiding, for the two years, maybe once or twice, I'd say, I heard them talking that they came to check the town, but they never came there.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: And did the neighbors ever stop by unexpectedly?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: No, because people —— I told you, in our location —— first of all, they didn't bother with anybody.</span> <span id="s375">They were old people.</span> <span id="s376">They didn't have no children, which was the favor for us, because otherwise they were afraid for their children or their grandchildren, and they got rid of the dog.</span> <span id="s377">Why?</span> <span id="s378">Because the dogs used to bark, you know.</span> <span id="s379">So, he got rid of the dog, and he kept us there.</span> <span id="s380">He always begged us, even in they capture —— they'll capture you or they'll find out about you, don't tell them that I saved you.</span> <span id="s381">Don't tell them that I kept you here.</span> <span id="s382">Just tell them, by mistake, you went in here from the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: And did you ever see any other Jews hiding in either the woods or ——</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: No.</span> <span id="s385">No.</span> <span id="s386">No.</span> <span id="s387">Nobody was in that village except us.</span> <span id="s388">Because this was a village, you know, with a lot of farmers.</span> <span id="s389">I mean, it was in our favor because they were not a village which was one house on top of the other.</span> <span id="s390">It was scattered around.</span> <span id="s391">Let's say —— I'll give you an example, there's 50 homes or something.</span> <span id="s392">It was far away, one house from the other.</span> <span id="s393">And his location was in the woods, the last one by the woods, by the swamps.</span> <span id="s394">And he was across the street from the church, and nobody ever came to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: And during the time you were in hiding, did he bring you any news?</span> <span id="s396">Did you have any idea what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, always news.</span> <span id="s398">Because he was more interested about the news than I did, because he wanted to get rid of us as soon as possible.</span> <span id="s399">He told us that, you know, when —— how he did, the Russians were coming close to this, that only says, Do me a favor, when the Russian comes, don't run out, in case the Russians come into that village.</span> <span id="s400">Wait 'til I'll tell you.</span> <span id="s401">Because he used to go to town and sell something, you know, little woods.</span> <span id="s402">He used to make little bundles of wood and sell it in town.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Did he ever tell you what happened to the Jews in Shedlitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s405">He told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: What did he tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: He told us that when it was the liquidation in the ghetto, he told us exactly.</span> <span id="s408">And he told us what they did with them.</span> <span id="s409">He said he was sure —— what you have the pictures there —— they dig ditches and they throw them in and then burn them, the one which they couldn't take, the last minute, to Majdanek and TreblinkA: They burned them.</span> <span id="s410">He said he know that some of them escaped.</span> <span id="s411">Where they are, he doesn't know.</span> <span id="s412">He knows that some of them stayed with the Polish girls, they say.</span> <span id="s413">And then, when he came to the last time to tell us that the Russian are all ready in Shedlitz.</span> <span id="s414">He told us that he saw a few guys there.</span> <span id="s415">But he says, Don't say to any of these people where you stood.</span> <span id="s416">Because he was afraid, he was so scared because the Polacks were terrible.</span> <span id="s417">So, when he came —— when he told us that the Russians came, we went out there at night, also, that nobody should see that, you know, stood there.</span> <span id="s418">And we went to Shedlitz.</span> <span id="s419">He told us where the committee is with the survivors.</span> <span id="s420">So, we went straight there.</span> <span id="s421">And we were not —— and the door, they were afraid to open up.</span> <span id="s422">They thought, who was there?</span> <span id="s423">They thought maybe the Polacks come to kill them.</span> <span id="s424">So, in Shedlitz, we didn't stay too long.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Let me just step back on to liberation day.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Did you see any soldiers when you were in your hiding place, or you just heard from him that he said he heard they were liberated and ——</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s429">Yeah.</span> <span id="s430">He said, they didn't come to this small town, the Russians.</span> <span id="s431">They didn't want to get killed, because they were afraid, in case the —— because the Polish army, they had underground.</span> <span id="s432">They were against the Russians, you know.</span> <span id="s433">They didn't want to surrender even voluntary.</span> <span id="s434">I remember the ____ and ____.</span> <span id="s435">They were fighting for a year there.</span> <span id="s436">So, they were afraid.</span> <span id="s437">So, the Russians we didn't see come to town.</span> <span id="s438">He just told us that the Russians were in Shedlitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: And how did you get back to Shedlitz?</span> <span id="s440">Did you walk?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: We walked.</span> <span id="s442">We walked.</span> <span id="s443">It took us about two and a half, three hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: And ——</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: We have nothing with us, so it was easy to walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Did you see anybody on the road back?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: We saw somebody, but they didn't really —— we didn't really pay attention to them.</span> <span id="s448">They didn't really knew the situation because they know all the Jews were killed, so how did they expect?</span> <span id="s449">They didn't expect.</span> <span id="s450">But that was when they came —— when we came to Shedlitz, the people in Shedlitz, the guys, they all had weapons, gun, grenades, so they gave us already.</span> <span id="s451">They gave us ——</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: The Jews were back in Shedlitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s454">Yeah.</span> <span id="s455">There were some Jews already in Shedlitz.</span> <span id="s456">I would say about fifty or that.</span> <span id="s457">They all had weapons.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Were these people you knew from before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: Not really, but they know me.</span> <span id="s460">They knew who I am, because they know my father.</span> <span id="s461">They know my grandmA: But he told me, my grandmother —— Polack told me my grandmother, up to the last minute with her son, they were baking, with her two daughters.</span> <span id="s462">They were, the last minute, sitting in Shedlitz and making money.</span> <span id="s463">And what they did with the money, nobody knows.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: And so how long did you stay in Shedlitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Not too long, about —— I would say, six weeks, eight weeks, approximately, not sure, not much.</span> <span id="s466">More, more, more.</span> <span id="s467">Wait.</span> <span id="s468">We took —— I tell you, the Russians came in in '44, end of '44.</span> <span id="s469">We stood 'til 45, 'til the war as finished in Shedlitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: And where did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: I told you, in the —— we lived in, like was a _____, a cloak, you know, before, so they made the —— living quarters for us.</span> <span id="s472">And under the bruhat (ph) came in, they came in.</span> <span id="s473">They brought us money and food, you know.</span> <span id="s474">Was good, was not bad.</span> <span id="s475">But we were afraid for the Polacks.</span> <span id="s476">So, we stood there 'til May, when we heard, in May the 5th, was the end of war.</span> <span id="s477">And May the 19th was the capitulation, the Germans signed for —— from Keitel, the ____, and Zhukov ____ .</span> <span id="s478">And the Russians were good to us.</span> <span id="s479">The Russians gave us food.</span> <span id="s480">They gave us a gun, whatever you need, and they gave us blankets.</span> <span id="s481">They were very good.</span> <span id="s482">The Russians were very good to survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: I want to ask you two other questions when you were still in Shedlitz.</span> <span id="s484">One is that I understand you went back and visited your old home.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Not right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Talk about when did you come back and describe what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: I went back to the home, let's say, beginning of '45.</span> <span id="s488">The guys didn't tell me to go right away.</span> <span id="s489">And they told me not to go by myself.</span> <span id="s490">I took two —— there was a lot of Jewish Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s491">I went to a Russian captain, but otherwise they'll think that you come to take revenge on them.</span> <span id="s492">So, he went with us, and even we went —— I knew my grandma had a lot of money hidden someplace, so I went to her house also with a soldier.</span> <span id="s493">Nothing was there.</span> <span id="s494">But I didn't stay.</span> <span id="s495">I was afraid to stay there.</span> <span id="s496">In my house, when I walked in with them, they say to me, We did not take any of your furniture.</span> <span id="s497">We don't know anything about it.</span> <span id="s498">All from the small town, and they came, they, like vultures, they grabbed anything that they could, with, you know, with wagons and horses, you know.</span> <span id="s499">When the ghetto was taken out, the destruction of the ghetto, what do you think happened the next few days?</span> <span id="s500">They came like vultures from all over the Polacks.</span> <span id="s501">They told me that, was which I —— he says to me, You wouldn't believe, that Wladek says to me, what they did.</span> <span id="s502">They came, like, grabbing everything which was not nailed down.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: So, when you went in your old house, were the people there using your old furniture?</span> <span id="s504">Was ——</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: No, it was nothing there.</span> <span id="s506">There was nothing there.</span> <span id="s507">I didn't see any furniture.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: And ——</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Because they were smart.</span> <span id="s510">They used to give the furniture away someplace else, and they brought in.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: And so did you find anything that was left behind?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: No.</span> <span id="s513">That's all.</span> <span id="s514">I find some —— a few old things, you know, like my father's tools, was —— how did I find?</span> <span id="s515">Because in the hallway was a closet, with a hole, like —— like a —— what do you call it, where they used to —— we used to keep in the wintertime certain foods shouldn't get spoiled, potatoes, cabbage, ____.</span> <span id="s516">It's like a basement but a reach down.</span> <span id="s517">So, I knew we had something there.</span> <span id="s518">What, I didn't know.</span> <span id="s519">So, I went down there.</span> <span id="s520">I found my father's tools.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: And did the Poles say anything when you said, I'm taking these with me?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: No, they didn't say.</span> <span id="s523">They were happy to get rid of me.</span> <span id="s524">The minute they saw me on the outer side, I saw they were screaming: I didn't take anything.</span> <span id="s525">We didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s526">Somebody came here and they took everything from here.</span> <span id="s527">Because that guy was telling me that.</span> <span id="s528">Everything was taken.</span> <span id="s529">The minute of the liquidation of the ghetto, they came like vultures, running.</span> <span id="s530">You know, they were digging for gold, for everything.</span> <span id="s531">They thought the Jews were hiding things in the backyards and in the walls, you know, under the streets, and so they were digging everything to look at, they could find something.Even they find the truth, they wouldn't touch them.</span> <span id="s532">What would they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Tell me a little bit about who else was living in ____ with you.</span> <span id="s534">The other Jews who survived, did they also survive in hiding?</span> <span id="s535">Had any of them come back from concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: No.</span> <span id="s537">Most of them was from hiding, which they were hiding out by Polish women, in ——, you know.</span> <span id="s538">In the woods, a few of them survived.</span> <span id="s539">Two young kids survived in the woods.</span> <span id="s540">They came out with —— they were —— you know, you wouldn't believe it how they looked, with guns, with grenades all around.</span> <span id="s541">So, they told them, What are you doing here?</span> <span id="s542">They're going to kill you.</span> <span id="s543">He says, Us, they're not going to kill.</span> <span id="s544">We'll kill them first.</span> <span id="s545">They were wild kids, too.</span> <span id="s546">And they didn't stay too long in Shedlitz, those two guys.</span> <span id="s547">They left the next day.</span> <span id="s548">I don't know where they went.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: I understand they were registering people, survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Talk about how the registration worked and who was organizing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: There was a committee already in Shedlitz.</span> <span id="s553">After a while, they came from all over to Shedlitz, because a lot of people that came from hiding places.</span> <span id="s554">They came from the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s555">So, there was a committee.</span> <span id="s556">And how they got the money, I don't know.</span> <span id="s557">They gave every person, they gave us 1500 Zloty at that time to survive.</span> <span id="s558">You know, we should have survive, in case we don't want to stay in Shedlitz.</span> <span id="s559">They advised us not to stay, you know.</span> <span id="s560">Most of the people, they were advised not to stay in Shedlitz.</span> <span id="s561">We should go with a Russian army, where they took, you know, was

happened to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: No.</span> <span id="s568">No.</span> <span id="s569">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: You assumed he had died?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A:

years in Nordhausen?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: I don't know this.</span> <span id="s601">I don't know.</span> <span id="s602">I know he was liberated.</span> <span id="s603">A lot of Hungarian Jews —— in 1943, '44, that was the end of the war, they brought in a lot of Hungarian Jews to that camp.</span> <span id="s604">So, that's how he survived, because most of the Hungarian Jews, they didn't take him in the beginning, because they were all home in Hungary 'til 1943.</span> <span id="s605">Then, in '44, when they shipped them —— some of them shipped to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s606">Most of them went to Auschwitz, other camps, to the labor camps, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: And was it very hard reajusting to a life with your whole family, after having been used to being ——</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: —— on your own?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: After the —— after the way we lived, like animals, all the time in Europe, because, in Europe, was a very bad life for the Jews.</span> <span id="s611">The Jews didn't have anything.</span> <span id="s612">They didn't have no education.</span> <span id="s613">They didn't have nothing.</span> <span id="s614">Most of the Jews in Europe were shoemaker or, what do you call it, a tailor, this, and, you know, and the kids never went to school because they didn't have the money to send, and they were afraid to go to Polish schools.</span> <span id="s615">They only went to the Jewish school, malamitikof (ph), and they were teaching them, you know.</span> <span id="s616">And they were never going into the streets.</span> <span id="s617">That's why most of these people, I couldn't figure out how they could survive.</span> <span id="s618">They couldn't survive because they were not used to a strict life.</span> <span id="s619">They were used to living in ghetto all the time.</span> <span id="s620">Actually, before Hitler came into the ghettos, you know, that they were ____.</span> <span id="s621">They never lived with Polacks.</span> <span id="s622">They lived with themselves.</span> <span id="s623">And that life was terrible The kid didn't even know how to sign his name.</span> <span id="s624">He wanted to hide them, and that's it.</span> <span id="s625">And in the street, he didn't have a bicycle.</span> <span id="s626">He couldn't swim, because he was not allowed to go to swim.</span> <span id="s627">He was not allow to go to a park because they killed you.</span> <span id="s628">And then they used to tell the kids, don't hit.</span> <span id="s629">If a Polish kid hits you or does something to you, don't hit him back, because if you hit him back, they'll come at night and they're dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: So, when your father came back, you're all together in Stolczyn.</span> <span id="s631">And ——</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s633">And then we went —— I told you, we went right away —— in a few months, we went right away to Ziegenhain.</span> <span id="s634">When they made it —— they made the transport to Germans to leave to Germany, because the Poles gave them an ultimatum, a date, that you have to leave the houses and everything.</span> <span id="s635">That's all you're allowed to take is two satchels.</span> <span id="s636">And they prepared the trains.</span> <span id="s637">You know what kind of trains?</span> <span id="s638">Like you had in the Holocaust, trains like that.</span> <span id="s639">And then they came to us, and they said to us, you go with them.</span> <span id="s640">You know, the Bruhat (ph) came and they said: This is your chance.</span> <span id="s641">We want you all to go, all the Jews.</span> <span id="s642">They took from Szczecin, Stolczyn, and they said, When the train comes, go on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: How many people were in your group, your Bruhat (ph) group?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: A lot of, a lot of people, because in Szczecin, Stolczyn, was not only from Shedlitz.</span> <span id="s645">They came from all over, so that —— I would say a whole wagon.</span> <span id="s646">I would say about 150 people, maybe more, and they told us to sit still, mix in the Germans.</span> <span id="s647">And don't say anything, because when you pass by the Russian territory, because —— you know, Germany was divided in four sections.</span> <span id="s648">So, the first section we had to pass by, the Russian territory, then the French, then the English, and then was American.</span> <span id="s649">We didn't go to the American, because we were only allowed to go to the English sector.</span> <span id="s650">But when —— the first sector was the Russian, when you pass by Russian, the Russian soldiers saw the ____, the train, to look whose there, don't say anything.</span> <span id="s651">If they talk to you, don't answer.</span> <span id="s652">Don't make them look that you understand them.</span> <span id="s653">Then, when we arrived in the English sector, the Bruhat (ph) was waiting for us, and they took us off, and they all gave us clothing and food, and they put us up in German houses.</span> <span id="s654">And they kept us there for a while.</span> <span id="s655">And then they took us —— they came and said, this is the time to leave here, because we were already free in the English sector.</span> <span id="s656">And they took us on the cattle trucks, and in the trucks they took us to Ziegenhain.</span> <span id="s657">And at Ziegenhain was where we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Describe Ziegenhain.</span> <span id="s659">What did it look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: Ziegenhain was a regular concentration —— looks like a concentration camp, because it was with barbed wire with a tower where they watch you.</span> <span id="s661">What do you call them?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: Watch towers?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Watch towers.</span> <span id="s664">And it was barracks, you know, very poor barracks, was on cinder blocks built.</span> <span id="s665">Ready—made barracks.</span> <span id="s666">They put them on cinder blocks.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: What was your reaction?</span> <span id="s668">You walked in ——</span></p> <p><span id="s669">[Pause.]</span> <span id="s670">{coughing} So, you had just survived the war and walked into someplace and it's surrounded by barbed wired, with a watch tower.</span> <span id="s671">What was the first thing that you thought of when you saw that?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: As soon as we saw all Jewish people, all our uncles, we were happy, because they told us it was called at time the UNNRA: You heard that organization?</span> <span id="s673">UNNRA: President Roosevelt's wife was in charge, was a commissioner.</span> <span id="s674">She ____ + to get it, person and thoroughly.</span> <span id="s675">They're the one which, you know, didn't allow us to come into the United States.</span> <span id="s676">After the liberation, I can't figure out why they didn't let us go straight to America, why did they have to put us into the DP camp.</span> <span id="s677">DP camp was actually —— what I was talking about, once again?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: That's okay.</span> <span id="s679">Finish your thought, then we will go back and ——</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: All right.</span> <span id="s681">I can't figure out why they didn't let us go straight to America, why they have to throw us into DP camp.</span> <span id="s682">DP camps was actually the first person which has no country, so they put us there.</span> <span id="s683">All right.</span> <span id="s684">They did the right thing.</span> <span id="s685">But they put in the Nazis —— you know, I'll tell you the whole story.</span> <span id="s686">A lot of Nazis which arrived in America, they don't know how they arrived.</span> <span id="s687">The ones which working for the Germans in the camps, the Russians, the vice Russians, they worked in the camps, they were killing Jews.</span> <span id="s688">And after the liberation, they were afraid to go back to their country, so that's how they arrived in Germany and to the American sector.</span> <span id="s689">They arrived and they opened up DP camps for them, too.</span> <span id="s690">They put them in DP camps.</span> <span id="s691">Actually, they were not DP camps for them, because they're not a displaced person.</span> <span id="s692">A displaced person is a person without a country.</span> <span id="s693">They had a country.</span> <span id="s694">They were traitors.</span> <span id="s695">They were afraid to go back because Stalin would kill them all.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: And talk about your life in that Ziegenhain ——</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s698">When we came to Ziegenhain, it was good.</span> <span id="s699">The many —— I saw a lot of Jewish people, our kind, was good.</span> <span id="s700">They opened up schools.</span> <span id="s701">We opened up a club, the kid would

id="s710">I was a kid.</span> <span id="s711">What was I going to do with my mother and father when we need to, you know, young kids.</span> <span id="s712">So, we went to kibbutz ____.</span> <span id="s713">They make Saturday night dances.</span> <span id="s714">We had a good life.</span> <span id="s715">And from America came a lot of clothing, you know, the clothing which they throw into the boxes, and, you know, for the poor people.</span> <span id="s716">This is the clothing they used to bring us.</span> <span id="s717">A whole truck of clothing.</span> <span id="s718">Food they gave us, as much as you wanted to eat you had.</span> <span id="s719">And they might teach you to cook the food.</span> <span id="s720">They gave milk.</span> <span id="s721">And they gave the children

from Shedlitz, but they lived in different camps.</span> <span id="s747">They ____ other camps, but one cousin came to Ziegenhain.</span> <span id="s748">She lived with a little boy.</span> <span id="s749">So, they lived with us.</span> <span id="s750">But we went, later on, and I would found out about my mother's —— my mother knew that she has relatives in America, two brothers.</span> <span id="s751">The sister she didn't know because the sister lived in Belgium.</span> <span id="s752">The sister survived in Belgium, and she went, in 1940, the last ship to AmericA: That's how she arrived in AmericA: But we didn't know.</span> <span id="s753">So, we were writing to Shedlitz —— I mean, to</span></p> <p><span id="s754">AmericA: My mother didn't know the address, so we were writing to Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s755">She knew she has one brother in Brooklyn and one brother in St. Louis, but she didn't know which is which, so she didn't know the address.</span> <span id="s756">So, she put down Brooklyn St. Louis.</span> <span id="s757">So, the letter came back and says there's no such a thing in America, Brooklyn St. Louis.</span> <span id="s758">So, now we wrote another letter.</span> <span id="s759">And they found a Yacovich (ph), a cousin lived in the Bronx, and that cousin from the Bronx knew about her two brothers and sister, and he went and told them.</span> <span id="s760">So, we received a letter from him right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: And about what year was it that she was able to establish connection were her brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: In 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: And did they offer to sponsor you?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: They didn't know nothing about sponsors that time, because that time we were registered in Frankfurt to go to AmericA: Because we told the American government we had relatives there.</span> <span id="s765">So, that point came out, the quota was closed for the American —— for the Polish people.</span> <span id="s766">Only the German quota was open.</span> <span id="s767">They were tricky, because how many German had left on the ____.</span> <span id="s768">So, the Polish quota was closed.</span> <span id="s769">So, we were the first ones on the list.</span> <span id="s770">We went to Frankfurt, and they told us, in 1946, you can't go to AmericA: You have to wait for quotA: So, we wrote them a letter that we need sponsors.</span> <span id="s771">So, they send us letters that they were sponsors for us.</span> <span id="s772">That's how we went.</span> <span id="s773">So, we waited 'til 1948, 'til Truman passed the quota for the Jews, vice president, that you could go to America or England or wherever you have sponsors.</span> <span id="s774">So, that's how we went, in 1949, beginning of the first months of the quotA: So, we went to Bremerhaven.</span> <span id="s775">And in Bremerhaven, we had to sit for two months, because the weather was
