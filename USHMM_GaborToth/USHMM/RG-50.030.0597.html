<span id="s15">Please tell me when -- when you were born?</span> <span id="s16">Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Answer: I was born in Berlin, Germany, in July 1923.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s19">And you were born Doris -- as Doris --</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Dora Costinski (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Dora Costinski.</span> <span id="s22">Who are your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: My parents came from Poland, but my father was a prisoner in the first World War taken by the Germans and that's how he got to Germany.</span> <span id="s24">And that's how my sister and I were born there.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: What were your parents names?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: My father name was Max Mosik in Polish or Hebrew, Moshe.</span> <span id="s27">Whichever name you want to pick.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: My mother was Hilda Moyim (ph) and in German Maria.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s31">And you see -- you had two sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: I had one sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: One sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: And one brother.</span> <span id="s35">I'm the youngest one.</span> <span id="s36">I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: What were their names and when were they born?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: My brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: My brother's name was Alan Baer Costinski.</span> <span id="s41">He want that last name.</span> <span id="s42">And he was born in Larch, Poland.</span> <span id="s43">And he came with my mother just shortly before the -- the first World War to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: With your mother only?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s46">Because my father was a prisoner in a German prison camp.</span> <span id="s47">And she knew about it.</span> <span id="s48">She walked all the way from -- but the Germans came and they took everything away and there was nothing left.</span> <span id="s49">She had two more children younger than the one that I knew, and that's a boy and girl, but they both died, I really don't know how.</span> <span id="s50">But the Germans came in and they -- that's the first World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: And they destroyed everything and there was nothing left for her.</span> <span id="s53">So when she only had that one little boy left, she took him and she walked all night.</span> <span id="s54">And during the day, she stopped over somewhere on a farm, and only nights she walked until she -- by the time she reached the border from Poland to Germany, the war was practically over and she just walked across.</span> <span id="s55">And she went to the prison camp where my father was and they got together.</span> <span id="s56">And there was nothing to go back to to Poland.</span> <span id="s57">So they stayed in Germany.</span> <span id="s58">But then later on after they got a little established, my sister was born in 1921 and I was born in 1923.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: What's your sister's name?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: IdA:</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s62">So what do you remember from Berlin?</span> <span id="s63">Tell me about your childhood.</span> <span id="s64">What did your parents do?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Well, after the war it wasn't bad.</span> <span id="s66">We were free.</span> <span id="s67">But unfortunate -- which had nothing to do with Hitler -- when I was only three years old, my mother fell down a flight of stairs and she never recovered.</span> <span id="s68">It wasn't anybody's fault.</span> <span id="s69">It was her own fault.</span> <span id="s70">She should have gone into the hospital and be in a cast.</span> <span id="s71">But she said, I have small children and I can't afford to go into a cast and she neglected herself, which had nothing to do with Hitler or anything.</span> <span id="s72">He wasn't even there yet.</span> <span id="s73">And, of course, after a while instead of getting better, she got worse.</span> <span id="s74">And she's been in and out of hospitals since I remember.</span> <span id="s75">So I was only three so I barely remember my mother.</span> <span id="s76">And by the time I started school there was talk about Hitler being the new chancellor of Germany.</span> <span id="s77">So my father said, well, I think we're going to put the girls right away in a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s78">Because my brother went to a German school.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: When he first came to Germany he couldn't speak the language, but it was different.</span> <span id="s81">But when he heard about Hitler being so much against Jews, he says, I'm not going to put the girls in the Jew -- in the German school.</span> <span id="s82">So we went right away into a Jewish school.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: From the time we started kindergarten.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: But you could speak German?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Well, we learned German and we learned Hebrew --</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: -- in the school.</span> <span id="s89">We had every morning one hour of Hebrew from Monday to Friday five days a week and then it was from eight to nine.</span> <span id="s90">And nine o'clock we had regular subjects, German, arithmetic, geography, history, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: -- regular subjects.</span> <span id="s93">But it was only for Jewish children.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: So most of your friends were Jewish or did you have German friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Well, not really because mostly after school you go to somebody's house.</span> <span id="s96">But as I did not really have a home to go -- I mean, I had a home but there was nobody there --</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: -- because my mother was in and out of the hospital.</span> <span id="s99">My father was busy and I had to make a living so we had to go to day care.</span> <span id="s100">So straight from school we went into day care and we were there until six o'clock at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: By that time my father was home -- and so I --</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: So the day care was for German children too, right?</span> <span id="s104">It wasn't --</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: No, it was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Oh, it was Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: It was a Jewish day care, yes.</span> <span id="s108">We had sort of a hot meal during the day so at night wasn't much of a meal just, like, a sandwich or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s110">And what did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Well, as I said he was in the Army when he -- before he came to Germany.</span> <span id="s112">So he didn't really have a profession.</span> <span id="s113">So the -- at first, he did whatever he could just to make a living for us.</span> <span id="s114">But then he opened up a little tobacco store.</span> <span id="s115">And those days everybody smoked and it was a good business.</span> <span id="s116">He was doing -- I mean, we were not rich, but he made a living.</span> <span id="s117">We had enough to pay rent.</span> <span id="s118">There was always food on the table and he was doing all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: So you remember Hitler coming to power?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s121">By the time I started school it was practically -- as a matter of fact, they used to put on the radio in the schools and we had to listen to his speech.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Oh, in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: In the Jewish school.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: -- Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s126">So his voice...</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism when you were a child or before?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: You mean in the street?</span> <span id="s129">Well, at the beginning in the early '30s it wasn't bad.</span> <span id="s130">Everybody was very nice to us.</span> <span id="s131">And as a matter of fact, we lived in an apartment building.</span> <span id="s132">It was a walker.</span> <span id="s133">And as you come up the stairs there were two apartments on each floor.</span> <span id="s134">Here was our apartment and this was a -- German people.</span> <span id="s135">And there was only one wall between our living room and their living room and you could hear practically -- when they walked or every word they said, you know, like the next room.</span> <span id="s136">And we had no problem.</span> <span id="s137">I don't even know if there were other Jewish people in this apartment building.</span> <span id="s138">There were four floors, something like that.</span> <span id="s139">But because I wasn't home all day.</span> <span id="s140">I just left 7:30 in the morning to go to school.</span> <span id="s141">I came home late at night.</span> <span id="s142">I never saw anybody.</span> <span id="s143">But the lady that lived right next door to us on the same floor, my father used to go early in the morning, like, six o'clock and that -- those days we didn't have refrigeration -- and used to go down and buy some groceries.</span> <span id="s144">I don't know if every day.</span> <span id="s145">Depends on the weather how long you can keep it.</span> <span id="s146">And every time used to come out early in the morning and the lady came out.</span> <span id="s147">She used to say, good morning to you.</span> <span id="s148">How are you how?</span> <span id="s149">How is your wife doing?</span> <span id="s150">Because she knew she was sick.</span> <span id="s151">Once -- so sorry.</span> <span id="s152">You got small children and with a sick mother.</span> <span id="s153">And they were friendly people.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s155">Do you know their name or --</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Oh, I can't remember the name.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: I know there was only a lady and a young boy was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s161">He was like a teenager later on.</span> <span id="s162">And as we (?</span> <span id="s163">certain?)</span> <span id="s164">were so many years.</span> <span id="s165">But then in 1936 my mother passed away.</span> <span id="s166">And, you know, I wouldn't even know it but -- you know what a Minyan is?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: You have a ShivA:</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s171">Or when somebody passes away for one week we have mourning.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Which they call a ShivA: People come in the morning for service and they used to come in the evening.</span> <span id="s174">Twice we have the Minyan.</span> <span id="s175">Minyan means you have to have at least 10 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s177">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: 10 men to make the service.</span> <span id="s179">So in '36 it wasn't bad.</span> <span id="s180">My father belonged to the synagogue, people used to come.</span> <span id="s181">We're not allowed to go out for one week and people bring you food to the house.</span> <span id="s182">So we were in that whole week.</span> <span id="s183">We didn't go anywhere.</span> <span id="s184">But the next -- the following Sunday -- my mother died on a Friday in July of '36.</span> <span id="s185">So on Sunday was the funeral.</span> <span id="s186">So the following Sunday when we finished the Shiva, my father was going downstairs to buy groceries for following week or days.</span> <span id="s187">So the minute he got into the store the lady jumped on him.</span> <span id="s188">She says, I know your wife died more than a week ago and you did not turn in her ration cards.</span> <span id="s189">That's how I remember we must have been on ration. '</span> <span id="s190">36.</span> <span id="s191">That was three years before the war.</span> <span id="s192">And if you ask me, I wouldn't even know we were on ration.</span> <span id="s193">Just because he came up and he told us the story.</span> <span id="s194">So he says, I beg your pardon.</span> <span id="s195">I was in mourning.</span> <span id="s196">We don't go out for one week.</span> <span id="s197">And I came down this morning to turn her in ration card and buy my groceries.</span> <span id="s198">So she calmed down.</span> <span id="s199">Because in '36 it wasn't too bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: When did it get bad?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: You could still talk to a Jewish person.</span> <span id="s202">But when we went to the park all the benches had written on, not for Jews.</span> <span id="s203">You couldn't sit on.</span> <span id="s204">But there were only three benches in that whole big park, huge park, only for Jews.</span> <span id="s205">But nobody ever sat on those three benches.</span> <span id="s206">I remember that because some time on a Saturday --</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: How did you feel about that, that you couldn't --</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: We were just kids, you know.</span> <span id="s209">But like on the Saturday or Sunday when we didn't go to school or day care we use to say, oh, Papa, can we go to the park?</span> <span id="s210">You know, but he worked hard all week.</span> <span id="s211">He had to get up early.</span> <span id="s212">And he said, oh, I'm so tired.</span> <span id="s213">So in the winter, of course, he used to go sleep in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s214">But in the summer, you know, he tried to be nice.</span> <span id="s215">I mean, I didn't realize, you know, we had no mother most of the time, and he was mother and father.</span> <span id="s216">But when you're a child, you don't realize that it's a double job for him.</span> <span id="s217">So he tried to be nice and he took us to the park as much as he could.</span> <span id="s218">And I remember one day we were in the park, we were playing something like hopscotch on the floor, my sister and I. And he sat down on the bench and it said, not for Jews.</span> <span id="s219">But he had covered the writing.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: And he figures, well -- but he did not look Jewish because he had light eyes.</span> <span id="s222">He had gray hair since I remember.</span> <span id="s223">So he must have been on the light side.</span> <span id="s224">And then a man, a German man, came and sat down next to him on the bench.</span> <span id="s225">And he was watching us playing and he tried to make a conversation with my father.</span> <span id="s226">He didn't know who he was.</span> <span id="s227">So he says, you know, I feel sorry for those children.</span> <span id="s228">Isn't it terrible what they're doing to them?</span> <span id="s229">At that time -- so my father just sat and he nodded.</span> <span id="s230">He didn't say anything.</span> <span id="s231">So we just came over and we said, oh, Papa, something -- when he heard us calling him papa, which means father, he realized that he was our father.</span> <span id="s232">And he got up and he flew away like they were chasing him.</span> <span id="s233">In case they catch him talking to him, they'll arrest him.</span> <span id="s234">That's how bad it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: So that was later and not -- because you said in '36 it wasn't that bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: No.</span> <span id="s237">Yeah, '36 it wasn't too bad.</span> <span id="s238">But Hitler was in power since '33.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: And '36 it was already -- you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: So do you remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: It was hard to walk in the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Was it gradually that...</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s245">Little by little it got worse and worse.</span> <span id="s246">But then later on the lady came up.</span> <span id="s247">Did I say this already?</span> <span id="s248">And she said, how is your wife and all this?</span> <span id="s249">And then she says, well, you have to excuse me, I wouldn't able to say good morning to you anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Because my son is now in the Hitler Youths.</span> <span id="s252">16-year-old boy.</span> <span id="s253">And if he sees me talking to you, he'll report me.</span> <span id="s254">I'm talking to a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: 16 years old.</span> <span id="s257">She was afraid of him.</span> <span id="s258">Right next door.</span> <span id="s259">We were living next door to each other for years.</span> <span id="s260">She says, I have nothing against you personal.</span> <span id="s261">We've been living together for a long time.</span> <span id="s262">We've been -- you've been a good neighbor.</span> <span id="s263">It's nothing.</span> <span id="s264">So my father just said, I understand.</span> <span id="s265">He knew.</span> <span id="s266">It wasn't her fault.</span> <span id="s267">She's a very nice lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">I don't know if there was a man there because he only was talking about her and the son.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: So I have no idea if there was a father there or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: But you do remember her and her son?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: I don't too well.</span> <span id="s273">But my father used to see her very often.</span> <span id="s274">She probably went out the same time when he used to go out in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Maybe she had to go to work or something, you know.</span> <span id="s277">But there was nothing personal.</span> <span id="s278">She was very nice.</span> <span id="s279">We lived together for years, you know.</span> <span id="s280">People lived next door, they have problems, too much noise, fighting.</span> <span id="s281">You know, we never had a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: But then, of course, in 1938 all of a sudden -- as soon as my mother died he start getting sick.</span> <span id="s284">But he just was losing his voice.</span> <span id="s285">So he went to the doctor a few times.</span> <span id="s286">Was treating him for a cough -- cough medicine.</span> <span id="s287">And we had no ideA: Finally, we found out that it was more than a cough, he had throat cancer.</span> <span id="s288">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: He was working at the tobacco --</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: -- he suffered for two years.</span> <span id="s291">And to the day same July two years later he passed away.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: And now were how old?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: 14?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s296">I was 12 when my mother died.</span> <span id="s297">I was only three when she got sick.</span> <span id="s298">She was bedridden for nine years.</span> <span id="s299">See -- which had nothing to do with Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: It a different story.</span> <span id="s302">It's just my story.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s304">That's --</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s306">But then in '38 it was already very bad.</span> <span id="s307">But while my father was still alive he was trying so hard to get us out.</span> <span id="s308">He kept writing letters and letters to family he had in New York.</span> <span id="s309">And he says, it's getting very bad here.</span> <span id="s310">I don't care for myself, I'm an old man.</span> <span id="s311">He was in his 50s.</span> <span id="s312">He thought he was old.</span> <span id="s313">But the children, please, try to do something for the children.</span> <span id="s314">So you know what they wrote him back, if you need a few dollars, I'll send it to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Where are the relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Yeah, relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: And where --</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: In New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: How close were they -- what was the relationship?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Well, unfortunately, my father lost his mother giving -- she was giving birth to him.</span> <span id="s321">She died in childbirth.</span> <span id="s322">And those brothers and sister were from second wife.</span> <span id="s323">So they were half brothers and sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: But he wrote to the sister and he said --</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: Oh, no, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s329">Sure.</span> <span id="s330">I'm -- sure.</span> <span id="s331">Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: I don't want to in case somebody's alive, I don't want to say it.</span> <span id="s333">But -- {laughter} but she says -- he says, I don't want any money.</span> <span id="s334">I need a visA: Please take the children out.</span> <span id="s335">Things are very, very bad here.</span> <span id="s336">Never answered.</span> <span id="s337">And it was -- but in '36 and '38, the two years -- he was sick for two years.</span> <span id="s338">For -- as soon as she died he start getting sick.</span> <span id="s339">'38 he died.</span> <span id="s340">They both died in July and both on a Friday.</span> <span id="s341">Isn't that something?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: That's a --</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: Friday is such a day for me.</span> <span id="s344">Well, anyhow so --</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: So you were left orphans in '38?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Yes, we were left orphans.</span> <span id="s347">That was in July of '38.</span> <span id="s348">But as I said, my brother was a lot older than me because he was born in Poland.</span> <span id="s349">There were two more children after him.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: There must have been, like, two or three years old, or four something.</span> <span id="s352">A little boy and a little girl but he was the oldest one.</span> <span id="s353">So that's why he's so much older than we --</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: So how -- how old was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Well, he was 10 years older than my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: And 12 years older than me.</span> <span id="s358">Because, as I said, when they were in Poland, like, he was six years old and the little one probably was two and four.</span> <span id="s359">So by the time he came to Germany must have been seven, almost eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: So he was around 27 around that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s362">But then they took a few years before my sister and I were born because you just can't have children.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: You got to get established, you got to get a place to live, you know.</span> <span id="s365">It was just -- it was in the war.</span> <span id="s366">He was a prisoner, you know.</span> <span id="s367">So, you know, he had to wait until he makes a little money to get an apartment.</span> <span id="s368">And then my sister and I were born in the early '20s.</span> <span id="s369">So my brother was really quite a bit older, 10 years older.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: So he had already -- did he already have a job when you're father died?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: My brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Yeah, he was working.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: What did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Well, he was working by machine, like, tailoring because he didn't have -- he couldn't go to higher education, you know.</span> <span id="s376">And so he had to do whatever to make a living.</span> <span id="s377">And my father had the tobacco store.</span> <span id="s378">And around Christmastime they used to have -- I don't if they're called -- what you call it here it -- like a Christmas market.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Yeah, I guess a Christmas market.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Yeah, they had -- they opened up tables and --</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: -- sell things a few weeks -- like, a month before Christmas.</span> <span id="s383">So after school he used to take merchandise from our father's store, opened a table, put up cigarettes and cigars and tobacco.</span> <span id="s384">And they would sell.</span> <span id="s385">You're -- because it was so cold, Christmastime, and they saw a young kid, 12, 14 years old and they used to buy from him and he make more money than my father made in the store.</span> <span id="s386">He was jealous on him.</span> <span id="s387">He was a good brother and a good son.</span> <span id="s388">And, of course, after my father died it was very hard.</span> <span id="s389">We couldn't even get a Minyan to go to for the funeral.</span> <span id="s390">We went to the cemetery when we buried our father.</span> <span id="s391">And my father was collecting people and paying them so we could have 10 people for the funeral for the service.</span> <span id="s392">Isn't that terrible?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: So why was --</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Because there was not many Jews left and -- from the congregation I'm talking, you know.</span> <span id="s395">And there were very few and it was very hard.</span> <span id="s396">It was bad already.</span> <span id="s397">We wouldn't walk in the street.</span> <span id="s398">They used to throw rocks at us.</span> <span id="s399">And even going to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Did you have to wear the star?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Not at that time.</span> <span id="s402">It started after -- after I already came to England.</span> <span id="s403">So it was -- but they used to throw -- especially in the winter.</span> <span id="s404">They used to take a rock and put the snow on it, like, a snowball.</span> <span id="s405">And they used to throw that.</span> <span id="s406">It was so painful.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Was it children who would do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Kids.</span> <span id="s409">Yeah.</span> <span id="s410">Teenage.</span> <span id="s411">They used to throw the rocks.</span> <span id="s412">It was so painful.</span> <span id="s413">I was afraid to go -- we walked to school.</span> <span id="s414">We had no transportation.</span> <span id="s415">So I was really afraid to go to school.</span> <span id="s416">And after my father died, you know, my brother even tried very hard.</span> <span id="s417">And, you know, he felt like a young father to us.</span> <span id="s418">He was so much older.</span> <span id="s419">He was responsible.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: He was.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: He was trying to make a living for us.</span> <span id="s422">Well, thank God my father put away a few dollars.</span> <span id="s423">We didn't have it in the bank.</span> <span id="s424">So just a couple months later -- well, he died in July, this was August, September, October.</span> <span id="s425">Three months later.</span> <span id="s426">October 28, to be the exact date.</span> <span id="s427">Early in the morning, about 7:30 in the morning on a Friday, Friday morning, the doorbell rang.</span> <span id="s428">A policeman was outside.</span> <span id="s429">I was afraid to open the door.</span> <span id="s430">And my brother was just getting ready to go to the synagogue for the Minyan, you know, to say Kaddish for my father.</span> <span id="s431">He said a whole year Kaddish first for my mother.</span> <span id="s432">Now, he stopped a little.</span> <span id="s433">Now, he had to say it for my father.</span> <span id="s434">So he was just getting ready to go to say Kaddish for my father.</span> <span id="s435">And when the doorbell rang, he came out.</span> <span id="s436">He was still in pajamas.</span> <span id="s437">I looked through the peephole.</span> <span id="s438">He says, who's at the door?</span> <span id="s439">I said, it's a policeman.</span> <span id="s440">He says, open the door.</span> <span id="s441">We didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s442">Why are you afraid?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">I was afraid to open the door.</span> <span id="s444">He went over, opened the door, and the policeman says, Herr Costinski?</span> <span id="s445">You know, his name.</span> <span id="s446">And he says, yes, it's me.</span> <span id="s447">So he says, better come and see -- please come with me.</span> <span id="s448">So he says, wait a minute.</span> <span id="s449">What did I do?</span> <span id="s450">He said, oh, I know you didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s451">But we just want to take you to the police headquarters ask you some questions.Then he looked at us two, my sister and me, kids.</span> <span id="s452">He says, oh, he'll be back soon.</span> <span id="s453">So he said, would you mind if I get dressed first?</span> <span id="s454">He was in pajamas.</span> <span id="s455">To him he didn't care what he wore.</span> <span id="s456">They wore pajamas anyhow in the camp.</span> <span id="s457">So he says, all right.</span> <span id="s458">But make it snappy.</span> <span id="s459">Leave the door open.</span> <span id="s460">Watched him getting dressed.</span> <span id="s461">So, you know, if you're in a hurry, you don't look what you're going to wear.</span> <span id="s462">Whatever was there you put on.</span> <span id="s463">A pair of pants and a top.</span> <span id="s464">By the first October 28th, 1938, the day of the deportation and it was cold.</span> <span id="s465">But you figure he'll be back in a couple of hours.</span> <span id="s466">So he didn't put a sweater or a jacket or anything.</span> <span id="s467">Just a shirt and pants.</span> <span id="s468">And he took him.</span> <span id="s469">I went through the front room and I saw a truck down there and I saw him sitting right in the corner.</span> <span id="s470">He said he'll be back soon, right?</span> <span id="s471">That's the last time I ever saw him.</span> <span id="s472">I never saw him after that day.</span> <span id="s473">I never forget this day.</span> <span id="s474">We waited and waiting the whole weekend.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: You were staying -- and you stayed at home and you waited?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: But it was Friday morning.</span> <span id="s477">We waited Saturday and Sunday.</span> <span id="s478">He never came back.</span> <span id="s479">I never went back to school either, not since that day.</span> <span id="s480">I never saw any of my schoolmates or teachers.</span> <span id="s481">Anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Monday morning was the first of November and the doorbell rang.</span> <span id="s483">When I saw the agent from the landlord outside, I wasn't afraid to open the door because I've known him since I was a little girl.</span> <span id="s484">So I open the door and I said, oh, good morning.</span> <span id="s485">You came for the rent.</span> <span id="s486">I'll go and get it.</span> <span id="s487">First of the month.</span> <span id="s488">Every first of the month -- we didn't pay checks that time.</span> <span id="s489">We used to pay cash.</span> <span id="s490">My father always taught me, every week you put a quarter of the rent away.</span> <span id="s491">So when the month comes, rent is the most important thing.</span> <span id="s492">Even if you have nothing else, no money, you got to have a roof over your head.</span> <span id="s493">So when I turn -- oh, you came for the rent.</span> <span id="s494">I'll go and get it.</span> <span id="s495">He said.</span> <span id="s496">No, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s497">I didn't come for the rent.</span> <span id="s498">I came to ask you two girls to leave this apartment at once.</span> <span id="s499">I said, why?</span> <span id="s500">We're paid up.</span> <span id="s501">We don't owe anything.</span> <span id="s502">So he said, oh, I know you don't know anything but you're both minors and you cannot occupy this place.</span> <span id="s503">So I said, but my brother is not a minor.</span> <span id="s504">He was older than us.</span> <span id="s505">And since our father died it was put on his name.</span> <span id="s506">So he said, but you brother isn't here.</span> <span id="s507">I said, he's only been gone two days.</span> <span id="s508">He'll be back.</span> <span id="s509">Oh, no.</span> <span id="s510">Your brother was deported and he will never come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: That's what he told you?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: And he knew us for years since we are little girl.</span> <span id="s513">While I was talking to him my sister went to get the money and she came out with cash from the other room, and when he saw all that money in her hand he took the whole month's rent.</span> <span id="s514">And then -- I mean, he knew us for so many years since we were little.</span> <span id="s515">All of a sudden, you know, he was really following orders.</span> <span id="s516">But he didn't want to do it, but he had no choice.</span> <span id="s517">So he said, okay.</span> <span id="s518">Okay.</span> <span id="s519">I'll let you say a little longer.</span> <span id="s520">And he took the whole month's rent.</span> <span id="s521">But that week was Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Oh, it with was the same week?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: November.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: So did you -- when he told you that your brother was deported, did you believe that?</span> <span id="s525">Did you understand what that meant or...</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: We heard on the radio that they deported all of the Jewish men from 16 to 60 from Berlin.</span> <span id="s527">And from -- as it's smallest towns, women and children also.</span> <span id="s528">But from Berlin itself it was men and boys from 16 to 60.</span> <span id="s529">So he was over 16.</span> <span id="s530">And, you know, they came for my father too a little later because he was under 60.</span> <span id="s531">He was in his 50s so they came for him too.</span> <span id="s532">And he was already dead.</span> <span id="s533">It didn't go in yet --</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: -- you know.</span> <span id="s536">So I said, you can't have him anymore, he's gone.</span> <span id="s537">Okay.</span> <span id="s538">They didn't care.</span> <span id="s539">But they would have deported him too.</span> <span id="s540">See, and we were alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: And you were left alone and you became the -- no, your sister was older than you, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s543">She was 16.</span> <span id="s544">Still young.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: So what did you do after the landlord left?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: We looked around the apartment and, you know, there were five of us living here now there's only two left.</span> <span id="s547">What do you take and where do you go?</span> <span id="s548">We had no place to go.</span> <span id="s549">We didn't know what to take.</span> <span id="s550">Shall we take clothes?</span> <span id="s551">Shall we take dishes?</span> <span id="s552">Linens?</span> <span id="s553">What do you take?</span> <span id="s554">You know, we had no place to go.</span> <span id="s555">So my sister just look a few pictures that she can still put in her pocket, you know, little pictures, old pictures from my parents and the little one.</span> <span id="s556">One of the babies that died, we had a picture.</span> <span id="s557">He has them of us on it so I don't know if he came before or after.</span> <span id="s558">And she took my mother's wedding ring and I think a necklace with, like, a watch on it.</span> <span id="s559">She took a few things.</span> <span id="s560">That's not much.</span> <span id="s561">A small suitcase we took.</span> <span id="s562">Change of clothing.</span> <span id="s563">And that's all.</span> <span id="s564">What could we take?</span> <span id="s565">We had furniture.</span> <span id="s566">We had dishes.</span> <span id="s567">Linens.</span> <span id="s568">We had my mother's trousseau.</span> <span id="s569">Every single -- there was her name engraved.</span> <span id="s570">We had to leave everything behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: And where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: We had no place to go.</span> <span id="s573">We were out in the street.</span> <span id="s574">But then we met somebody that knew my father but I didn't even know the man that well.</span> <span id="s575">It was a German Jew but he was married to a Gentile German lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Do you remember his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s578">Albert Brusch and her name was Herta or BerthA: I don't know.</span> <span id="s579">But anyhow -- but he lived way across town.</span> <span id="s580">We were northeast in Berlin and he was, like, on the east side.</span> <span id="s581">You had to take one or two trains to go there.</span> <span id="s582">So he met us and he said, what you two girls doing in this cold weather out in the street with the suitcase?</span> <span id="s583">So I said, they threw us out from the apartment.</span> <span id="s584">He said, I know your mother was sick and she passed away.</span> <span id="s585">What happened to your dad?</span> <span id="s586">I said, he died just a few months ago.</span> <span id="s587">Well, didn't you have an older brother?</span> <span id="s588">I said, yeah, but they took him away.</span> <span id="s589">He said, oh, my God.</span> <span id="s590">He says, no wonder my hair is gray.</span> <span id="s591">He was 64 years old.</span> <span id="s592">So he says, what is this country coming to?</span> <span id="s593">He was a German Jew but he did not practice Judaism.</span> <span id="s594">He was just a German citizen.</span> <span id="s595">He fought in the first World War in the German Army.</span> <span id="s596">And he was, like, a real German citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: But he still considered a Jew by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s599">No matter how many generations.</span> <span id="s600">So he said, well, I have only a one-bedroom apartment, but if you want to sleep in the bathroom you're welcome.</span> <span id="s601">I said, thank you.</span> <span id="s602">Thank you.</span> <span id="s603">So he took us to his house and my sister slept in the bathtub and he put up a folding bed next to the bathtub and I slept on this.</span> <span id="s604">And his wife was so wonderful.</span> <span id="s605">She welcomed us with open arms.</span> <span id="s606">She said, I'm so sorry what this is coming to.</span> <span id="s607">She didn't approve, but she had no choice.</span> <span id="s608">And she cooked for us.</span> <span id="s609">First time we had a hot meal and actually a bed to sleep in, if you call it a bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: But was a roof over your head, like my father said.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: So had you spent several days outside on the streets or was it the first day that you left?</span> <span id="s613">Did you have to spend some days on the street, like, sleep on the street nights?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: It was cold.</span> <span id="s615">It was very dangerous until that man took us.</span> <span id="s616">Well, anyhow, we were there for a while and she was very nice to us.</span> <span id="s617">She says, oh, my God, you girls have no clothes to wear.</span> <span id="s618">Would you believe she took me to a store and bought me clothes and my sister?</span> <span id="s619">She said, I'm so sorry.</span> <span id="s620">And he said, I would love to adopt you two.</span> <span id="s621">We have no children.</span> <span id="s622">I would love to have adopt you both, but there's no future for you here.</span> <span id="s623">She was so wonderful to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Where they well-off or...</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s626">I mean, they had a car.</span> <span id="s627">In those days very few people had a car.</span> <span id="s628">He had a little business.</span> <span id="s629">And, yeah, I mean, I'm not saying how rich they were but they had an apartment, one bedroom, a living room, dining room, you know.</span> <span id="s630">They were not poor, but I wouldn't say they were rich, but they were comfortable.</span> <span id="s631">And -- but before we turned around it was December and it was Christmas and the doorbell rang.</span> <span id="s632">When she opened the door her brother was there in an SS uniform, younger brother.</span> <span id="s633">So he wanted to spend Christmas Eve with them.</span> <span id="s634">He was probably stationed nearby and he needed a place to spend the evening.</span> <span id="s635">So they went into the dining room and he was -- she says, quickly, quick go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s636">Lock the door.</span> <span id="s637">Don't make a light.</span> <span id="s638">Don't even breathe.</span> <span id="s639">She was so afraid of him.</span> <span id="s640">So he went in and he was drinking and drinking and singing all the German songs.</span> <span id="s641">Oh salute, you know.</span> <span id="s642">And he must have been so drunk.</span> <span id="s643">He was singing.</span> <span id="s644">I could hear it.</span> <span id="s645">I was so scared in that bathroom with my sister.</span> <span id="s646">It was so dark.</span> <span id="s647">We couldn't see each other even.</span> <span id="s648">And I said, isn't he ever going to leave?</span> <span id="s649">Finally, he said, okay.</span> <span id="s650">Okay -- in German, of course, he's going.</span> <span id="s651">I said, thank God.</span> <span id="s652">All of a sudden he said, okay.</span> <span id="s653">Okay.</span> <span id="s654">One more for the road.</span> <span id="s655">And back to the another drink, another drink.</span> <span id="s656">She wanted to get rid of him already.</span> <span id="s657">Finally, he left.</span> <span id="s658">She knocked on the door of the bathroom.</span> <span id="s659">She said, okay.</span> <span id="s660">Girls, you can come out now.</span> <span id="s661">We opened the door, we couldn't see a thing because we had been so many hours in the dark.</span> <span id="s662">No window, no light.</span> <span id="s663">I felt like blinded until I could open my eyes.</span> <span id="s664">So she says, I'm so sorry.</span> <span id="s665">I don't know if I can keep you any longer.</span> <span id="s666">My brother could come anytime unexpected.</span> <span id="s667">I mean, I understood this, but what could I do?</span> <span id="s668">Again, we were on the go.</span> <span id="s669">But he said, don't worry.</span> <span id="s670">I made an application for both of you for the Kindertransport.</span> <span id="s671">He says that I heard that England opened up visas.</span> <span id="s672">He told us this at the beginning when we first came.</span> <span id="s673">I forgot about this.</span> <span id="s674">So he says, England opened up visas for 10,000 children up to 16.</span> <span id="s675">And I was 14 and my sister was 16.</span> <span id="s676">16 she could still go.</span> <span id="s677">So he says, and I'm sure you will both qualify, you're orphans, you're homeless, they should take you first, right?</span> <span id="s678">But anyhow from the time he made the application and he says -- well, when we had to leave there he didn't throw us out, but we had to go.</span> <span id="s679">What about if her brother comes back and sees us there?</span> <span id="s680">So, again, we had to go.</span> <span id="s681">Whoever took us in.</span> <span id="s682">So then he says, well, I'm sure it will soon come through.</span> <span id="s683">You'll be going to England very soon.</span> <span id="s684">Wouldn't take long.</span> <span id="s685">But do you know how long it took?</span> <span id="s686">Nine months.</span> <span id="s687">Next year we first had the apply -- the letter in July.</span> <span id="s688">I can go to England but my sister's birthday was in May.</span> <span id="s689">She was two months too old.</span> <span id="s690">If you would have gotten it in May she could go.</span> <span id="s691">But she was two months too old.</span> <span id="s692">They came in July and they gave you a whole list what I could take.</span> <span id="s693">Only two pairs of shoes, two pairs of this.</span> <span id="s694">You know, all this.</span> <span id="s695">No jewelry.</span> <span id="s696">No nothing.</span> <span id="s697">So I was getting ready for July to go.</span> <span id="s698">Everything happened on a Friday.</span> <span id="s699">My mother died on a Friday, my father died on a Friday, my brother was deported on a Friday.</span> <span id="s700">I came to England on a Friday.</span> <span id="s701">I don't know what's with Friday.</span> <span id="s702">The Kindertransport was on a Friday too.</span> <span id="s703">Well, anyhow, so on the day when I --</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: So -- I'm sorry to interrupt.</span> <span id="s705">But you said it was after you left, after he told you -- they told you to leave, where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: Well, somebody took us in one night here and one night there.</span> <span id="s707">It was difficult.</span> <span id="s708">You know, because it wasn't my life I was afraid.</span> <span id="s709">I was afraid of their life.</span> <span id="s710">They're going to get into trouble.</span> <span id="s711">I'm in trouble already.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: But who were the people who were taking you in?</span> <span id="s713">Were they --</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: Well, one of them actually was a Jewish woman with two teenage girls.</span> <span id="s715">Her husband was also deported at the same time so he must have been Polish.</span> <span id="s716">So she took the two girls into her bedroom and she gave us -- she rented us the girls' bedroom for a while.</span> <span id="s717">So we paid her rent.</span> <span id="s718">As I said, my father put away a little money and this we took, of course.</span> <span id="s719">So we paid her.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: Do you remember her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: No.</span> <span id="s722">I don't think I ever even knew her name.</span> <span id="s723">All I know is the girls were teenagers.</span> <span id="s724">Like 17 and 18 or 19.</span> <span id="s725">And that's why they were so much older than we were.</span> <span id="s726">They called me a baby.</span> <span id="s727">I said, I'm a teenager too.</span> <span id="s728">But you know, 14 and 18 and 17 is not the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: Well, anyhow, so at least we had a roof over our head.</span> <span id="s731">But I hated that place.</span> <span id="s732">Well, anyhow, so when the day came for me to leave, my sister took me to the station.</span> <span id="s733">And this man, Albert Brusch, you know, the one where we stayed, the two of them took me to the station.</span> <span id="s734">When I came to the station and I looked down the platform -- oh, my God, there were so many people, children and mostly woman.</span> <span id="s735">There was an ocean of people crying and everything.</span> <span id="s736">Those mothers took their children to the train sending them to England on the Kindertransport knowing that they maybe never see them again.</span> <span id="s737">They didn't know if they're going to survive or what.</span> <span id="s738">So I'm telling you, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s739">But when my sister couldn't go they told her that she could make an application for domestic service.</span> <span id="s740">So she had no choice.</span> <span id="s741">So she did make and we were hoping that she would be able -- somebody would take her in as a maid, you know, because she had to have a visa, that was the most important thing.</span> <span id="s742">So anyhow.</span> <span id="s743">So -- but she took me to the station and I was hoping, hoping, she'll come soon.</span> <span id="s744">You know, because it was easy because the English people were looking for cheap help, you know.</span> <span id="s745">Because they didn't pay much.</span> <span id="s746">It was just, like, room and board and so on.</span> <span id="s747">But she was over 16, you know.</span> <span id="s748">So anyhow.</span> <span id="s749">So then I came to the station.</span> <span id="s750">I'm on the platform waiting for the train to come in.</span> <span id="s751">I haven't been back to school or seen any of my roommates since last year.</span> <span id="s752">Since '38 I haven't been back to school since my father died.</span> <span id="s753">And this was already July '39.</span> <span id="s754">All of a sudden somebody comes in back of me and hugs and kisses me.</span> <span id="s755">And she says, oh, I'm so happy you're going to be on the same transport.</span> <span id="s756">This is my Fritzi.</span> <span id="s757">That's a girl that was in my class, but not just in my class, she was eight years in my class from kindergarten on.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: What's her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Fritzi Hacker, H-a-c-a -- c-k-e-r.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: Fritzi is a German name.</span> <span id="s762">But since kindergarten her mother used to bring her to school every single day.</span> <span id="s763">And she used to pick her up.</span> <span id="s764">And every morning she always had a kind word for me because she says, your mother doesn't bring you to school?</span> <span id="s765">Because I told her my mother is bedridden and she can't get out of bed.</span> <span id="s766">So she was so sorry.</span> <span id="s767">So every day she always ask me, how is your mother doing?</span> <span id="s768">And so on, you know.</span> <span id="s769">She was very, very nice.</span> <span id="s770">But I didn't know if they had any other children because I've never seen anybody else, only that one girl.</span> <span id="s771">I don't even know if she had a father or not.</span> <span id="s772">{Undetermined interruption} It's okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: So -- so when I saw her at the -- until the end, she was already 12, 13, 14 -- almost 14 years old.</span> <span id="s775">She still brought her every morning to school and picked her up every day like a baby.</span> <span id="s776">So when I saw her at the station bringing her to send her to England, I thought to myself how can this woman bring the girl knowing that she may never see her again that she was so attached, you know.</span> <span id="s777">So then I said to myself, oh, my God, am I glad my parents are dead.</span> <span id="s778">I didn't have to say goodbye to them.</span> <span id="s779">I didn't leave anybody behind except my sister and I knew she made the application.</span> <span id="s780">She's going to come to England very soon.</span> <span id="s781">And then the train came and we got in.</span> <span id="s782">We said goodbye.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: To your sister and...</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Well, my sister, she made the application for domestic service.</span> <span id="s785">And she came, like, three weeks -- she came three days before the war broke out, the last minute.</span> <span id="s786">But she had a very tough time.</span> <span id="s787">She had to make all of the arrangements for herself.</span> <span id="s788">And, you know, like -- not like me.</span> <span id="s789">All we did -- we wore a name tag to know who you are, but everything was arranged like the train.</span> <span id="s790">I went through Holland.</span> <span id="s791">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: Do you remember crossing the border?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s794">Fritzi and I, we were sitting and we were looking out the window.</span> <span id="s795">And on the other side were two little kids, maybe seven, eight years old.</span> <span id="s796">I didn't know them.</span> <span id="s797">And we didn't even talk to them.</span> <span id="s798">We were just talking to each other.</span> <span id="s799">I didn't see her in a year, you know, or any of my schoolmates.</span> <span id="s800">So anyhow.</span> <span id="s801">So, you know, in the city in Berlin there's only, like, big buildings, cement floors.</span> <span id="s802">You don't see trees or grass or anything unless you go to the park.</span> <span id="s803">So as we were going, didn't take long, you're out of the city and you see the suburbs.</span> <span id="s804">And there was grass and trees, little houses.</span> <span id="s805">So Fritzi said to me, isn't it like you're going on a field trip from school and tonight we'll be back home in our house with parents -- with our parents?</span> <span id="s806">So I said to -- I thought to myself, well, she still had a home to go to and a mother but I didn't.</span> <span id="s807">But I didn't want to make her feel bad so I just nodded my head.</span> <span id="s808">I said, uh-huh, uh-huh, like this.</span> <span id="s809">And then as we were going, all of a sudden the train stopped.</span> <span id="s810">I said, what happened?</span> <span id="s811">Looked out the window and I saw the Gestapo outside.</span> <span id="s812">I said uh-oh.</span> <span id="s813">Now they're going to come and take us off the train.</span> <span id="s814">And I was scared like anything.</span> <span id="s815">But I didn't realize -- I forgot we were going through Holland.</span> <span id="s816">So then I realized this must be the border because they came on.</span> <span id="s817">It was a border crossing.</span> <span id="s818">So they had to come on and look at your passport.</span> <span id="s819">So he says, passports, passports.</span> <span id="s820">You know, young guys in Nazi uniform.</span> <span id="s821">So I got up and I took my little suitcase down.</span> <span id="s822">So you know what he said?</span> <span id="s823">Forget about it.</span> <span id="s824">He didn't want to look.</span> <span id="s825">I could have taken anything with me.</span> <span id="s826">I was like -- but my sister was, like, she took everything.</span> <span id="s827">Boy, what they did to her.</span> <span id="s828">Well, anyhow.</span> <span id="s829">We crossed the border.</span> <span id="s830">It took 15, 20 minutes we cross the border.</span> <span id="s831">I said, thank God I'm out of Germany.</span> <span id="s832">Now I don't have to worry anymore once you're out of the country.</span> <span id="s833">But we were going for a while and all of a sudden the train stopped again.</span> <span id="s834">I said, what?</span> <span id="s835">Another border from Holland?</span> <span id="s836">We're going straight through the channel.</span> <span id="s837">But when I looked up there was no Gestapo outside.</span> <span id="s838">They were Dutch women with baskets of food.</span> <span id="s839">I still cry when I hear about this.</span> <span id="s840">I got a tissue, you know.</span> <span id="s841">So they knew the children were coming so they brought us refreshments.</span> <span id="s842">Wasn't that wonder -- perfect strangers they came on the train.</span> <span id="s843">Wasn't that something?</span> <span id="s844">I never forget this.</span> <span id="s845">And then we traveled to Holland until the rest of the day.</span> <span id="s846">About 10 o'clock we got off the train that day.</span> <span id="s847">And we were by the -- by the British channel.</span> <span id="s848">And then they lined us up, make sure everybody was -- I think there were 300 children on that train from the connection spot.</span> <span id="s849">And they said, well, I want everybody to go straight to the cabin where they're assigned to.</span> <span id="s850">And it is 10 o'clock now -- 10 o'clock we got there.</span> <span id="s851">The boat is not going to start going until 12.</span> <span id="s852">But don't wait for 12 o'clock because six o'clock in the morning if you're going to be in Harwich and you have to be packed and upstairs ready to go.</span> <span id="s853">So go right to bed.</span> <span id="s854">Don't wait for 12 o'clock until the boat leaves.</span> <span id="s855">And when we got on the boat, Fritzi and I, we shared a cabin.</span> <span id="s856">So they had a bunk and a top one.</span> <span id="s857">We had to toss a coin, which one gets the top and which one gets the bottom.</span> <span id="s858">That was so cute, you know.</span> <span id="s859">We were just kids.</span> <span id="s860">And anyhow she slept on the top.</span> <span id="s861">And as we went to bed she kept talking.</span> <span id="s862">She says, are you sleeping?</span> <span id="s863">I said, how can I sleep when you're talking to me?</span> <span id="s864">You know, we're just talking like kids.</span> <span id="s865">Teenagers, early teens, you know.</span> <span id="s866">So anyhow.</span> <span id="s867">So all of a sudden after a while the boat started rocking.</span> <span id="s868">Uh-oh, it must be 12 o'clock because the boat starting going.</span> <span id="s869">He said 12 o'clock it's going to start.</span> <span id="s870">So it must be two hours already.</span> <span id="s871">Better go to sleep.</span> <span id="s872">Six o'clock we have to be upstairs.</span> <span id="s873">So we must have fallen asleep or something.</span> <span id="s874">And then in the morning we got up and we were in Harwich.</span> <span id="s875">And from there we took a train to London.</span> <span id="s876">It took two hours.</span> <span id="s877">And then when we got to London there was, like, a big room, a little bigger than this maybe.</span> <span id="s878">A little wider.</span> <span id="s879">And there was, like, a bench here and a bench there and there.</span> <span id="s880">And we were sitting on those benches and some people came and they called out names.</span> <span id="s881">You go with this person.</span> <span id="s882">You go with -- nobody knew where they were going.</span> <span id="s883">I had no address and I still like to look for this girl.</span> <span id="s884">I wish I knew if she's alive, if she's in England or some place else.</span> <span id="s885">I never saw her since that day.</span> <span id="s886">Because I didn't know where I was going and she didn't know where she was going.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: And you never -- never saw her?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: Never could find her?</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: No.</span> <span id="s891">No.</span> <span id="s892">That's a shame.</span> <span id="s893">I didn't -- I have -- contact --</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: Like you don't want to talk about it --</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: Anyhow I came to England on a Friday.</span> <span id="s896">And -- and that week I came to a couple, an elderly couple, I mean, old enough to be my parents.</span> <span id="s897">They had married children and grandchildren.</span> <span id="s898">And I met the family over the weekend.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: Was it in London?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: In London, yeah.</span> <span id="s901">I met the family over -- they had a married son, two or three kids; and a married daughter with some children.</span> <span id="s902">And then the youngest daughter was, like, in her 20s.</span> <span id="s903">And she was -- I didn't even know at the time she was expecting her first baby.</span> <span id="s904">But it wasn't hardly to see.</span> <span id="s905">And at that time I didn't even know where the babies came from.</span> <span id="s906">Now, I do.</span> <span id="s907">Anyhow.</span> <span id="s908">So -- so on the weekend I met them and then on -- she says to me, well, what are you going to do with yourself?</span> <span id="s909">You know, it was July.</span> <span id="s910">The schools were closed.</span> <span id="s911">So she said, well, when the schools open in September, we going to register you for school.</span> <span id="s912">So in the meantime what are you going to do with yourself?</span> <span id="s913">And they had their own -- like, a little factory.</span> <span id="s914">They were making civilian trousers for men.</span> <span id="s915">So Monday morning the younger daughter that was working in that place for her father, you know, there were a few people there.</span> <span id="s916">They were, like, a few men and one woman.</span> <span id="s917">They were in their 50s or 60s, you know.</span> <span id="s918">Like, four or five men and one woman was right on the corner.</span> <span id="s919">She was, like, 64.</span> <span id="s920">They were very nice to me.</span> <span id="s921">But they spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s922">I couldn't speak any English.</span> <span id="s923">So they spoke Yiddish to me.</span> <span id="s924">I understood but I didn't speak it that good.</span> <span id="s925">But it's very similar to German.</span> <span id="s926">So I knew what they were saying.</span> <span id="s927">So she introduced me to everybody and she showed me what to do.</span> <span id="s928">How to use this machine and this machine.</span> <span id="s929">A few machines she taught me at my age, you know.</span> <span id="s930">I never worked.</span> <span id="s931">I had to sew the buttons with the machine.</span> <span id="s932">And if you don't put it exactly in and the needle went next to the hole, you break the needles.</span> <span id="s933">I must have broke a dozen needles.</span> <span id="s934">It was very hard to get it the right way.</span> <span id="s935">And she was so fast because she's been used to it, you know.</span> <span id="s936">And then there was another machine that made the hems and another machine for the buttonholes.</span> <span id="s937">I had to work all three machines, and make tea twice a day for everybody who was there.</span> <span id="s938">I still hate teA: It reminds me.</span> <span id="s939">So anyhow I was working with her and she used to take me there in the morning.</span> <span id="s940">I think we went by bus.</span> <span id="s941">And then I came home in the evening.</span> <span id="s942">And before I had dinner she used to say to me -- there was only her and her husband living there -- she said, while the dinner is -- while you're waiting you can wash this floor.</span> <span id="s943">She made me do the housework before -- after a whole day in the factory.</span> <span id="s944">Well, anyhow -- but then this was going on for quite a few months.</span> <span id="s945">September came around.</span> <span id="s946">I forgot about it school.</span> <span id="s947">You know, and nobody mentioned a word.</span> <span id="s948">And I was just working, working every day.</span> <span id="s949">But then she was getting ready to have her baby.</span> <span id="s950">And her name was Fannie.</span> <span id="s951">And so she says, well -- when she couldn't go to work anymore I was on my own.</span> <span id="s952">And then all the work what the two of us did I had to do myself.</span> <span id="s953">So instead of going at nine o'clock in the morning I had to go eight o'clock and seven o'clock.</span> <span id="s954">And instead of staying until five or six, I used to stay until seven, eight o'clock.</span> <span id="s955">Five days, six days, seven days a week, I couldn't keep up.</span> <span id="s956">And I don't know what happened.</span> <span id="s957">One day I remember I was going to the bus and the bus ride was tuppence.</span> <span id="s958">Know anything about English money?</span> <span id="s959">Tuppence is like 20 cents.</span> <span id="s960">So she used to give me the tuppence.</span> <span id="s961">But then she found out they have -- what is this -- you know, if you come until 7:30 -- before 7:30 in the morning you get a return ticket.</span> <span id="s962">So if you give them tuppence and a half, Ha'penny, you get a ticket to go back at night.</span> <span id="s963">So she says, make sure you get the bus before 7:30.</span> <span id="s964">And she gave me tuppence and a half, the Ha'penny.</span> <span id="s965">And that's all the money I had.</span> <span id="s966">I never had pocket money or wages or anything, only food and sleep, lodging.</span> <span id="s967">So I tried to get the bus -- every time I came to the bus, there was a line from here to God knows where.</span> <span id="s968">All these big guys waiting for the bus.</span> <span id="s969">They probably had families to support.</span> <span id="s970">They saw me, they said, that kid's probably working for pocket money and they used to push me on the side and get on the bus.</span> <span id="s971">And I tried to get on the bus but I couldn't push those guys away.</span> <span id="s972">I was trying to get very hard.</span> <span id="s973">If I was lucky I got on it and I had my ticket to go back home.</span> <span id="s974">But I remember one day I tried so hard and they pushed me on the side.</span> <span id="s975">And -- there be another bus in a minute.</span> <span id="s976">Half a minute later the bus came, no more return.</span> <span id="s977">What I'm going to do?</span> <span id="s978">I had to give them the tuppence and I had a Ha'penny left.</span> <span id="s979">I came to the place and I was crying.</span> <span id="s980">So the woman that was working, the one woman, she says to me, what's the matter, Puppala?</span> <span id="s981">Puppala means little doll.</span> <span id="s982">Why are you crying?</span> <span id="s983">So I said, I missed the return bus this morning.</span> <span id="s984">So she said, big deal.</span> <span id="s985">So you're five minutes late?</span> <span id="s986">I said, no, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s987">It's not I'm late, I have no money to go back home.</span> <span id="s988">She said, what it is tuppence?</span> <span id="s989">Big deal.</span> <span id="s990">Here's tuppence.</span> <span id="s991">And I made a Ha'penny that day.</span> <span id="s992">That's the first money I ever had of my own.</span> <span id="s993">Isn't that something?</span> <span id="s994">I cried because I didn't make the return bus.</span> <span id="s995">But I didn't tell her that.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: So you were living with her too?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: I was living -- no, not the woman that worked there.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: Or with the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: She was home.</span> <span id="s1000">She didn't work there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: There was people working for them.</span> <span id="s1003">Well, anyhow.</span> <span id="s1004">And then another day I was standing in line again waiting for the bus.</span> <span id="s1005">I mean, every morning I was standing in line waiting for the bus.</span> <span id="s1006">I tried to get on this as much as I could.</span> <span id="s1007">But I don't know what happened that morning.</span> <span id="s1008">All of a sudden I remember standing in line waiting for the bus, but I have no idea what happened.</span> <span id="s1009">All of a sudden I wake up, I'm in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1010">I have know idea how I got there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: And what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: And I'm laying on the bed or stretcher and the young doctor bending over me and talking to me.</span> <span id="s1013">I couldn't understand a word he was saying because I didn't go to school.</span> <span id="s1014">Nobody spoke English to me.</span> <span id="s1015">I was already, like, a half a year in England.</span> <span id="s1016">If I go to school I would have spoken -- or people speak to you I would know a little English, but nobody spoke English to me.</span> <span id="s1017">I didn't go to school so I didn't know any English.</span> <span id="s1018">And he was talking and talking.</span> <span id="s1019">I didn't know what he was saying.</span> <span id="s1020">So he didn't know what to do with me.</span> <span id="s1021">Couldn't even tell me how I feel, why I -- I don't know what happened.</span> <span id="s1022">I didn't even remember fainting or anything.</span> <span id="s1023">All I remember is -- was I was hot.</span> <span id="s1024">It was just before Christmas.</span> <span id="s1025">This I remember because Father Christmas came.</span> <span id="s1026">Ho.</span> <span id="s1027">Ho.</span> <span id="s1028">Ho.</span> <span id="s1029">Ho.</span> <span id="s1030">That's how I remember what time of the year it was.</span> <span id="s1031">So he didn't know what to do with me so they put me in a big room like a ward with about eight or 10 people, woman, there all the way in the corner on one bed and they called somebody from the Bloomsbury House.</span> <span id="s1032">That's the organization that was responsible for the children, Kindertransport children.</span> <span id="s1033">So after a while a Ms. Feldman came to me see me and she spoke to me in German.</span> <span id="s1034">And she says to me, how come you don't speak any English?</span> <span id="s1035">You're here already a long time.</span> <span id="s1036">I mean, half a year is a long time to learn English, right?</span> <span id="s1037">At least a few words.</span> <span id="s1038">So I said, nobody speaks English to me, how can I learn?</span> <span id="s1039">So she said, well, don't you go to school?</span> <span id="s1040">I said, oh, my God, school.</span> <span id="s1041">I forgot what school is such a long time.</span> <span id="s1042">Like, a year and a half I haven't been in school.</span> <span id="s1043">So she says, what are you doing with yourself all day long if you don't go to school?</span> <span id="s1044">So I said, well, I work in the factory.</span> <span id="s1045">She says, well, do you have a permit?</span> <span id="s1046">I said, what's that?</span> <span id="s1047">I don't know what a permit is.</span> <span id="s1048">So she said, well, whenever we came we check up on our children and whenever we came to your house the lady always said, she's in school.</span> <span id="s1049">And when they came on the weekend I was never there.</span> <span id="s1050">She's out with a friend.</span> <span id="s1051">They probably went to a movie or something.</span> <span id="s1052">Because I was never there whenever they came to check up on me.</span> <span id="s1053">So they wouldn't let me go back.</span> <span id="s1054">And they had no place where to send me.</span> <span id="s1055">So I had to stay in the hospital until they found a place for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: How long was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: I know it was after Christmas because I know he came -- you know, Santa Clause came.</span> <span id="s1058">They call him Father Christmas.</span> <span id="s1059">And they gave every woman a bed jacket.</span> <span id="s1060">All different colors.</span> <span id="s1061">And he came to me he says, oh, you're the youngest one here.</span> <span id="s1062">You're so pure so I'm giving you a white one so to put on the shoulder.</span> <span id="s1063">You know, to put on your arms because they don't have heat there.</span> <span id="s1064">Not at this time anyhow.</span> <span id="s1065">So it's like to put on the bed when you sit up in bed, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">So there was nothing wrong with me.</span> <span id="s1067">I must have just had a little cold or something.</span> <span id="s1068">I have -- maybe somebody put -- I have no idea what happened.</span> <span id="s1069">How I was -- how I end up in the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: Yeah, well, you probably were exhausted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: I don't even remember -- I don't remember falling or fainting or anything.</span> <span id="s1072">But they must have picked me up and take me.</span> <span id="s1073">I don't remember it.</span> <span id="s1074">All I remember I'm opening up my eyes and that doctor is standing over me and talking to me and I didn't know what he was talking about.</span> <span id="s1075">But I know I was hot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: So what happened then when --</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: Well, then she says to me, well, we don't have anybody that can take you unless you want to go to a hostile.</span> <span id="s1078">I said, I don't know what a hostile is.</span> <span id="s1079">And I don't -- I was just scared.</span> <span id="s1080">I was afraid to go anywhere because the way I felt already.</span> <span id="s1081">I was afraid of everybody.</span> <span id="s1082">So do you have anybody here?</span> <span id="s1083">I said, all I know is I have a sister here but I don't even know where she is.</span> <span id="s1084">She -- she's working for somebody.</span> <span id="s1085">She same here on domestic service.</span> <span id="s1086">And you know when they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: How did you hear that she arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: How did you hear -- how did you learn that she arrived in England?</span> <span id="s1090">Were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: Oh, yeah, I know when she arrived, she wrote to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: Oh, you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: So I saw her but she had to go to the people that vouch for her.</span> <span id="s1094">And one weekend I even went to visit her for one night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: Where -- where was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: It was far away.</span> <span id="s1097">It took a couple of hours to get there.</span> <span id="s1098">But that one weekend when I did go, I went on a Saturday afternoon and I came back Sunday in the evening.</span> <span id="s1099">That was probably before I worked day and night, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: And the daughter was still working there at the beginning because she came -- the very last day of August '39.</span> <span id="s1102">Just three days before the war broke out.</span> <span id="s1103">So the daughter was still working with me.</span> <span id="s1104">So I went on a Saturday afternoon.</span> <span id="s1105">So before I went on that bus, I had to go to the police station and get a special permit to spend one night at a different address because I was considered an enemy alien.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: So -- so that's all.</span> <span id="s1108">So I had the permit and I went there and I got there Saturday in the evening late.</span> <span id="s1109">And I slept over in her room and then Sunday afternoon.</span> <span id="s1110">But that's the only time I saw her.</span> <span id="s1111">And when she came, we picked her up from the station.</span> <span id="s1112">So I saw --</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: Oh, you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: Who went with you to pick her up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: I guess the lady must have.</span> <span id="s1117">I said, my sister is coming.</span> <span id="s1118">Well, anyhow -- so -- but she had --</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: So what was the lady's name?</span> <span id="s1120">Sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: But -- so my sister had to go right away there.</span> <span id="s1124">But the people vouch for her and they were waiting for her.</span> <span id="s1125">So that one night I spent one weekend there.</span> <span id="s1126">And then the war broke out soon after this, three days later.</span> <span id="s1127">But at the beginning you heard bombings and -- but it wasn't too bad.</span> <span id="s1128">But later on it got very bad.</span> <span id="s1129">Bombs were coming down one after the other.</span> <span id="s1130">You heard about the Blitz of London?</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1132">Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: It was real bad.</span> <span id="s1134">So all of the children were evacuated to the country.</span> <span id="s1135">Because in London it was bad because there were factories and they tried to bomb all these things.</span> <span id="s1136">And I lived in London.</span> <span id="s1137">But the people my sister was staying with -- I don't know if they had a place in the country or they rented, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1138">But they couldn't take the bombs going every night to the shelter.</span> <span id="s1139">Because I didn't even know what it was like to sleep in a bed anymore.</span> <span id="s1140">For three years, four years, you know, I haven't slept in the bed.</span> <span id="s1141">So they went to the country and they took her along.</span> <span id="s1142">So I -- then I couldn't see her at all anymore.</span> <span id="s1143">So I -- I don't know if I knew any of this but I told this Ms. Feldman and they must have made the arrangements.</span> <span id="s1144">So anyhow.</span> <span id="s1145">So my sister wrote a letter to me to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1146">And they wouldn't let me out of the hospital.</span> <span id="s1147">And Ms. Feldman said, the only way we can release her is if a person that's already of age.</span> <span id="s1148">Well, she was old already.</span> <span id="s1149">She was -- what is age?</span> <span id="s1150">17?</span> <span id="s1151">18?</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: 18.</span> <span id="s1154">So maybe she's must have been, yeah, she must have been 18.</span> <span id="s1155">So she says, well, how can I come to London and stay with you?</span> <span id="s1156">See, first of all, the bombs and all this is bad, but I have no choice you're there too.</span> <span id="s1157">I was sleeping with the bombs every night.</span> <span id="s1158">But what am I going to do?</span> <span id="s1159">I have no occupation.</span> <span id="s1160">The only thing I know is cleaning houses.</span> <span id="s1161">That's the only thing I know.</span> <span id="s1162">That's what she came there for.</span> <span id="s1163">Domestic service.</span> <span id="s1164">So I said, but I know how to work.</span> <span id="s1165">I work all three machines, four machines, and I know -- and I can do -- so she says, but how am I going to make a living?</span> <span id="s1166">I said, don't worry.</span> <span id="s1167">I know how to work.</span> <span id="s1168">I'll teach you.</span> <span id="s1169">So that's the only way they'll let me out.</span> <span id="s1170">So she had to come to London.</span> <span id="s1171">Take a risk being in London under the Blitz instead of being safe in the country.</span> <span id="s1172">And so we rented a room and Ms. Feldman helped us a lot.</span> <span id="s1173">She says, as long as you're in this country you're my child no matter how old you are.</span> <span id="s1174">So -- but my sister from working all this -- they didn't have mops.</span> <span id="s1175">She had to go on her knees and clean the floor.</span> <span id="s1176">Her knees were all swollen, full of pus.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: Oh, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: She was in terrible shape.</span> <span id="s1179">A young girl, you know.</span> <span id="s1180">But we rented a room.</span> <span id="s1181">I think it was, like, five shilling.</span> <span id="s1182">It was very cheap.</span> <span id="s1183">And she got us a job in a war factory to do something, something with machines.</span> <span id="s1184">And I had to show her how to work.</span> <span id="s1185">And we made a living.</span> <span id="s1186">And, you know, the room was very cheap.</span> <span id="s1187">It wasn't much of a room.</span> <span id="s1188">You come up the stairs.</span> <span id="s1189">There's was one little room.</span> <span id="s1190">There was a little bed in there, and on the landing was a sink about that size, and a little gas ring.</span> <span id="s1191">That was our kitchen.</span> <span id="s1192">And the bathroom was an outhouse in the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: Well, it still had a roof --</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: Yeah, I had a roof over my head.</span> <span id="s1195">So we worked and we supported ourselves.</span> <span id="s1196">So that's about it.</span> <span id="s1197">But at least I was with my sister.</span> <span id="s1198">And, eventually, we picked up, you know -- when you work, you work with English people.</span> <span id="s1199">I hear them talking.</span> <span id="s1200">I never even heard -- we had no television at that time.</span> <span id="s1201">Didn't have time to watch it anyhow, I was never home.</span> <span id="s1202">And so I picked up -- it was easier to listen than to speak.</span> <span id="s1203">I was afraid to open my mouth in case it doesn't come out right.</span> <span id="s1204">But I could understand already when they were talking to me.</span> <span id="s1205">There was an English lady sitting right next to me, she was about 45 years old.</span> <span id="s1206">Because it was an old lady to me, you know, I was still a teenager.</span> <span id="s1207">And she was very nice and she helped me a lot explaining me what to do and this is this and this is that.</span> <span id="s1208">She spoke to me English, you know.</span> <span id="s1209">She didn't know German.</span> <span id="s1210">And one day she came in and she said, oh, we had a lot of bombs last night.</span> <span id="s1211">And they got bombed out the whole house went down.</span> <span id="s1212">She was living with her elderly parents.</span> <span id="s1213">And I said, where are you going to live now?</span> <span id="s1214">So she says, well, they have the prefabricated houses.</span> <span id="s1215">They put them up in one day.</span> <span id="s1216">I said, really?</span> <span id="s1217">You know, she was very nice.</span> <span id="s1218">English lady.</span> <span id="s1219">And so she says, I'll take you to my house and introduce you to my parents.</span> <span id="s1220">And she took me over there and they had a beautiful living room, a kitchen, two bedrooms, and a bathroom.</span> <span id="s1221">It was gorgeous.</span> <span id="s1222">One day they put up prefabricated house.</span> <span id="s1223">I said, it's a lot nicer than mine.</span> <span id="s1224">But I wasn't jealous.</span> <span id="s1225">I was happy.</span> <span id="s1226">I had a roof over my head.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1229">It was tough.</span> <span id="s1230">But God was with me all the time.</span> <span id="s1231">When they came to the shelter they gave out little cards and I still have it in my pocketbook.</span> <span id="s1232">I keep it with me all the time.</span> <span id="s1233">It's a little card that said, God is your refuge.</span> <span id="s1234">Don't be afraid.</span> <span id="s1235">He'll be with you all through the raid.</span> <span id="s1236">When bombs are dropping and danger is near, He'll be with you until the all clear.</span> <span id="s1237">And I still have it in my pocketbook.</span> <span id="s1238">I take it with me wherever I go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: And did it help?</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: And He was with me.</span> <span id="s1241">Because one night I came home from the -- from work.</span> <span id="s1242">I was so tired.</span> <span id="s1243">We had to be there at 7:30 in the morning and we worked until 6:30 at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: So I was really -- I was dropping.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
