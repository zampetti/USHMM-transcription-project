WILE INTERVIEWER: FRED CRAWFORD CAMP: BUCHENWALD DATE: AUGUST 8, 1978</span></p> <p><span id="s2">Q: Mr. Wile was a member of the 1270th Combat Engineer Battalion as a photographer.</span> <span id="s3">Of course, our topic is the German practice of putting people into various kinds of prisons, and doing all sorts of things to them, and I think what we're really aware of is that these were all kinds of people; that they weren't just the Jews but they were French and Rumanians and anybody the Germans caught.</span> <span id="s4">And it was the experience of the American soldier in his regular line of duty, almost, as he swept across Europe to once in a while encounter one of these camps.</span> <span id="s5">So, if you don’t mind, just tell us what happened to you in your own military career about 1945, April, someplace in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: We had just been witness to the most fantastic episode to witness in terms of military might, when the Third Army and First Army were ordered in different directions.</span> <span id="s7">We were on our way to Berlin, as we saw it, and then we were ordered south.</span> <span id="s8">We had the planes overhead and we had the half-tracks and the tanks and the trucks...it was just one constant din for three days of all of this materiel and this tremendous war machine, these two armies, changing directions.</span> <span id="s9">And here I was along with my buddies witnessing that aspect of the war.</span> <span id="s10">It was shortly after that that every photographer within a range of a hundred miles of Buchenwald was ordered into that camp.</span> <span id="s11">The reason given was that Patton didn't ever want it to be forgotten, and so he was recording it pictorially for all those that came after....</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: And your assignment in those days was as a photographer?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: Since the Third Army was moving so rapidly, they had a shortage of bailey bridges.</span> <span id="s14">And as I understand it, the function of the 1270th Engineering Combat Battalion was to go beneath the bailey bridges that were up and construct fixed timber bridges and as soon as they were usable to tear down that bailey bridge and transport it ahead to use it again for another site in a crossing over a river or stream or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s15">In order for this to work in each instance and to give Patton the direction he wanted, what we were doing was taking bridge site pictures ahead of putting up the next bailey bridge, and we might take three or four site pictures and then come back and develop them in the field and then deliver them to Patton's war room.</span> <span id="s16">One of them was at...gosh, it's been a long time ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: It’s been a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: It was one site near Bad Neustadt.</span> <span id="s19">Neustadt was the SS Officer's training facility, a very substantial quarters, a stone building as I recall.</span> <span id="s20">In fact, I might have a picture here somewhere of that facility, and we were taking these pictures in to that location on several occasions.</span> <span id="s21">And then the next thing, a Captain said that he wanted us to go to the concentration camp Buchenwald and be part of taking pictures of that site.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: What do you remember of that experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: We parked outside of the gates into the camp....</span> <span id="s24">Q: Did you have any trouble locating it?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: No, I never had the opportunity to have to check maps.</span> <span id="s26">I always had drivers and people that were taking me somewhere, and so I paid very little attention to that, which now I can see is a terrible weakness in my recollection of where I was or what I was doing.</span> <span id="s27">But it seemed to me that it was just a very short time after we left our location that we arrived at Buchenwald and parked outside.</span> <span id="s28">I would judge that by the time we got there, it must have been maybe three in the afternoon of whatever day that that occurred.</span> <span id="s29">The first thing that I think I can remember was people coming up to me and pleading with me for handouts of either cigarettes or anything of that nature.</span> <span id="s30">And that there was a variety of age groups that were obviously prisoners here.</span> <span id="s31">But the majority of everybody I saw were not walking.</span> <span id="s32">They were sitting with their knees up against their chests and leaning over, their backs against the walls of what few buildings were there or fences.</span> <span id="s33">Then scattered throughout there was stacks of the dead.</span> <span id="s34">And on one stack outside of the ovens, draped over the emaciated bodies of the inmates, were these strapping, young husky individuals in their twenties maybe or younger.</span> <span id="s35">About that time an individual whose name I don’t have but who looked very well fed began showing us around.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: This picture is of the crematorium.</span> <span id="s37">And the person in the middle of it is the person in civilian clothes who was well fed and who was now showing you around.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: And could speak some English.</span> <span id="s39">In fact, he spoke quite a bit of English, as I recollect, and it sticks in my mind that he told me that he was a New Yorker, and my obvious first question to him was “How can you explain your condition versus what I’m seeing around me?”</span> <span id="s40">since he had already explained that he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s41">And he said “One has to live!”</span> <span id="s42">and then explained it no further.</span> <span id="s43">What they had conveyed to me or he had conveyed to me was that these strapping, husky, young people that were draped over the piles of the emaciated bodies were the guards of the camp that were pummeled toward the very end by the inmates themselves using maybe just their firsts or whatever they used.</span> <span id="s44">All of that detail is very vague to me.</span> <span id="s45">I was seeing so much and it was such a shock, then again it wasn’t a shock.</span> <span id="s46">Possibly, in war, there is no horror that you’re not prepared to see, really, and only after all these many years when you see something on TV to resurrect it does it have an impact on you in such a way that it shakes you up.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: How many people were with you in your jeep or in the group that went through there?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: I would say that we probably went over in a three-quarter ton and that all of these soldiers in this picture here in the crematorium were part of my group.</span> <span id="s49">I would say maybe with the Captain and myself there could have been as many as eight people.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Were there other Americans or allied soldiers there?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: There were others there.</span> <span id="s52">Vaguely, it seems there were quite a few there, but there wasn’t a tremendous number there at the time.</span> <span id="s53">At this moment, things were moving so rapidly that we were doing what we had been ordered to do when we were in, and I did see some other photographers there, but even that part of it is very vague in my mind now because I was wrapped up in what I was seeing.</span> <span id="s54">In fact, I didn’t take as many pictures as I’d wished I’d taken now.</span> <span id="s55">I didn’t realize that the time we were going to be there was going to be so limited and that we were going to be moving on, but the negatives are gone of many pictures that I did take.</span> <span id="s56">I was hospitalized shortly after that, and when I got back the outfit had moved and the negatives stayed with the outfit and I never saw them again.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: I noticed you’ve written some comments on the back at the time which to me are very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: [Reading] “The civilian is a Jew.</span> <span id="s59">Polished apples for six years at Weimar concentration camp.</span> <span id="s60">Who knows what price he’s paid for his life or what deeds he’s done.”</span> <span id="s61">[Long pause]</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Do you want me to see if I can read it?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Why don’t you finish it for me, Dr. It’s too rough.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: “We need a place to burn.</span> <span id="s65">Our prisoners will build it and run it.</span> <span id="s66">We will supervise it.</span> <span id="s67">6,000 in one day.</span> <span id="s68">6,000 in one day.</span> <span id="s69">Russians, Belgians, Frenchmen, Jews, Americans, English.</span> <span id="s70">The Aryan Race-- the Nazis!</span> <span id="s71">The SS Troopers!</span> <span id="s72">The Supermen!”</span> <span id="s73">And you felt this.</span> <span id="s74">You lived this at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: And it’s still with you.</span> <span id="s77">A: It sure is.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: It’s with us all.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: The 6,000 in one day figure came from...as I understood what the guide was telling me, he said that they had moved out many bodies that they hadn’t burned on flat cars or box cars to Dachau because this was one of the first camps that was overrun by the Americans.</span> <span id="s80">And they were trying to cover up and hide their deeds, but Patton’s forces moved in there just too quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: This is the second picture which we will m ark “B.” Tell us about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: In the blocks where the prisoners slept on boards...the only thing I can liken it to is a broiler house like you might find here in Georgia, and there were either two or three tiers of these shelving arrangements, just boards laying down, and the prisoners slept on those.</span> <span id="s83">Each night as they died in their sleep or whenever they died in these blocks, there were details that each morning took the dead to the end of the blocks and stripped the clothes off of them and then they were moved out into this storage area here.</span> <span id="s84">At least, this is where we found this pile of bodies.</span> <span id="s85">Later, they were burned in the crematorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: I noticed on the back of this one, "If you starve them, when they die you have less to burn, and the more you burn the more healthy your workmen by replacement."</span> <span id="s87">This is obviously something that was written on the walls or that people told you.</span> <span id="s88">The German philosophy was really here.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s90">I didn't dream that statement up; that had to be told to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Was it written on a wall or a paper or one of the guides gave you an official</span></p> <p><span id="s92">paper....</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: No, we weren't there at the time that they were passing anything out.</span> <span id="s94">Q: He was just telling it to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: He was just telling it to me.</span> <span id="s96">We were there at a time when they hadn't any printed matter or if they did have it, we didn't see it.</span> <span id="s97">I didn’t get anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: And you were thinking about people at home, because the next sentence is "This is just another pile of dead people, America!</span> <span id="s99">The Nazis have many more at this place.</span> <span id="s100">This is typical on a small scale.</span> <span id="s101">6,OO0, one day.</span> <span id="s102">The Jew!</span> <span id="s103">Burn the dead person.”</span> <span id="s104">What else do you remember about that afternoon?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: One of the things that I remember in detail was that in the crematorium in the basement, which was off of this end, was the chute that came down into the basement area and the drain in the center of this room.</span> <span id="s106">And there were meat hooks hanging up along the side of the room and looked like an oak club that had a thong through the end of it that was about that big around.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: About three inches big around.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Right.</span> <span id="s109">And what was explained to me was that they brought Russian prisoners in from the front in closed trucks; they had some sort of a way that they forced them in there, in cordwood fashion, and they drew this top over them and that many of them by the time they got to Buchenwald were dead.</span> <span id="s110">They backed the truck up to the crematorium where this chute that came down into the basement was, and as the bodies were pushed down the chute, any that were still moving, their skulls were cracked with this club, and then they were hung at the base of the skull on these meat hooks.</span> <span id="s111">They were stripped of their clothes, their teeth were knocked out and all the gold was rendered from their teeth, and then there was a cart on tracks that they loaded these bodies on.</span> <span id="s112">And an elevator arrangement, the details of which are too vague to me now...but this cart went up and these tracks down the center of this somehow...</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s114">I can see those.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: And they moved these carts up to these ovens and just kept throwing the bodies in.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: And, of course, that work was really done by other prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: By other prisoners, right.</span> <span id="s118">I don't know what he had done or how he had managed to survive in that kind of shape, but that was that aspect of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Do you remember an odor about the place?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: I had a terrible revulsion which I can feel stemmed to a great deal from odor, that being one of the senses that affects you, and if there wasn’t an odor, subconsciously I was thinking there should be, maybe, because of the condition of the prisoners that were still living, breathing, and sitting around the buildings.</span> <span id="s121">The one building that I had the greatest abhorrence about going into and seeing was a building more or less in the center of the area, that had a single pipe that ran around the outside wall, and there was a trough in the center, a pit, and around this pit was a wall no higher than this desk and maybe three or four inches wide.</span> <span id="s122">And it was explained to me that this was the bathroom and that they could get their water.</span> <span id="s123">Now this was a camp, as I recall them telling me, that had at least fifty thousand prisoners, and they told me that in this particular part of the camp, this was the only building to which you could go to get water.</span> <span id="s124">There was no other source of water.</span> <span id="s125">So, I was looking at this and I couldn't even believe what I was hearing, knowing a little bit about how complex it is to feed 600 and whatever, a battalion of men, so in this pit was that aspect of it.</span> <span id="s126">Outside they had dug trenches between some of the buildings or off in one area in which bodies had been thrown.</span> <span id="s127">They were still in there, they hadn't cleaned that out yet.</span> <span id="s128">And there was just evidences of the worst condition that you could believe a human could be in and still be alive.</span> <span id="s129">And it sticks in my mind that there was an odor, but what your eyes were beholding was [what impacted you] and what the people were saying to you and the way they were saying it -- in a voice that was devoid of all energy whatsoever.</span> <span id="s130">Just the lowest possible voice.</span> <span id="s131">A healthy person couldn't possibly speak that low.</span> <span id="s132">Even if he was whispering, he couldn't make that kind of a voice, because it's not possible for a healthy person to speak in this fashion.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: There’s another picture, here, of survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: I think this is the famous Block 64, where the experiments took place.</span> <span id="s135">What was told me here, to the best of my recollection, was that these people had been injected with typhus and that if they survived, their blood was drawn from them and it was taken to Berlin and it was used to inoculate German citizens to prevent them from getting typhus.</span> <span id="s136">And all these people -- they were telling me, and this was being translated -- were dying because of typhus or being inoculated with the typhus germ to see if they would survive.</span> <span id="s137">I think this was the same block that the big tank was in where they were immersing as many as eighteen thousand people, and they found one fellow that lived, I think, eighteen minutes and they were pretty impressed with that where the average man was living about ten minutes.</span> <span id="s138">Inseminating women by hanging them by the ankles and I don't know what else, and these people were in the worst of shape than that same block.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: And here's another film that we’ll put “D” on, and this is also in Block 64.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s141">I don't know what I have written on the back there.</span> <span id="s142">I didn't even read that.</span> <span id="s143">According to what was told us, if we'd been any later the Germans would have machine-gunned 20,000 people in that camp, but because of the rapidity with which the camp was overrun, they didn't have time to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Is this a picture of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: No, this is Arthur Goldberg, a man that drove for me in several instances, and we later came across one another at headquarters command that used to be in Frankfort.</span> <span id="s146">Goldberg and I had been, I think, at Tech or some other place together in the States here, and we ran into one another and he was with me in England for a while, driving.</span> <span id="s147">When we first got to Germany, there was an old fraternization ban on.</span> <span id="s148">You could not fraternize with any of the enemy, and Goldberg said that he was going to fraternize and what he was going to do was to inseminate every German girl that he could in reprisal for what they had done.</span> <span id="s149">But to show you how the fates brew what you quaff in life, about the first girl that he met, he fell so deeply in love with her that it was impossible for him to carry out that particular design to seek vengeance upon the Germans.</span> <span id="s150">And it's one of the things that's stuck with me as to how the fates do twist the direction a person takes as time goes on.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: What time did you leave the camp that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: It was just very close to last light when we walked out the gates and left the camp.</span> <span id="s153">I think the first thing we did was to go to a little town south of Weimar, in the mountains, and we were one of the first in the town, I think.</span> <span id="s154">They didn’t have any military government in there, and we took over their facilities and I wound up in a wash house in a very old kind of a quadrangle-type construction and getting these prints ready for Patton’s war room.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: You went ahead and....</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: It wasn’t that night.</span> <span id="s157">It had to be the next day I started.</span> <span id="s158">I finished it that night.</span> <span id="s159">I think that’s what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: You developed them and went on.</span> <span id="s161">Are there other films in there that...?</span> <span id="s162">A: I have so many here.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: These are the ones that really get after Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s164">A: Right.</span> <span id="s165">Yes, the Buchenwald experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: We’ll come back to that again, and if you don’t mind let me ask you some other things because we’re getting this kind of information for everyone.</span> <span id="s167">What is your date of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: November 23, 1922.</span> <span id="s169">Q: Are you married?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: Do you have children?</span> <span id="s172">A: I have two sons.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: How old were you at the time that this experience occurred?</span> <span id="s174">Do you remember?</span> <span id="s175">A: Let’s see.</span> <span id="s176">I would be....</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Spring of 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: 1922 to 1945.</span> <span id="s179">I would be 23.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: What was your profession or what did you hope to become before the time the war was started?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: I had aspirations of becoming a civil engineer at that time because my father was a contractor and evidenced in his discussions with me that that was something that all good contractors could need more of, so I took off in that direction.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: What is your present occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: At this very moment, since December 5, I’m a senior environmental assistant with the Noise Program for the Environmental Protection Agency, and what’s interesting is that some of the experience I had using the camera I’ve started using it again a little bit because they’ve asked me to take a few pictures for them.</span> <span id="s184">And this is under what they call the Older Americans Program.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: You’re kind of in engineering anyway.</span> <span id="s186">What was your rank?</span> <span id="s187">A: I was a technician, 5th grade, or a corporal.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: And where had you enlisted or where did you come in?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: I was a Canadian citizen, and I was drafted when I was living in Waltham, Massachusetts, and the first place I went to was Camp Devons.</span> <span id="s190">The next thing I knew I was shipped to Spartanburg, S.C. to Camp Croft, and the Judge came up from Greenville and there was 130 of us in a room in the courthouse in downtown Spartanburg, and he said, “Raise your right hand” and thirty seconds later I was a citizen of the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: That’s an amazing story in itself.</span> <span id="s192">I didn’t realize it.</span> <span id="s193">Let me go back over some of the other questions that we hope to get some attitudes about.</span> <span id="s194">When did you first hear about the concentration camps?</span> <span id="s195">Was it before you got to Europe or was it after you got overseas?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: I can’t definitely say except that it does stick in my mind that there was a Jewish photographer on the SS Sea Owl which was a liberty ship that took us over that I believe was telling stories about what he’d been hearing on his previous trips and that he’d made several crossings.</span> <span id="s197">I think that was the first word that I can remember and I don’t even know why I say that, but somehow that sticks in my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Had you heard anymore about them as you finally got into the continent?</span> <span id="s199">Was there any talk about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: No, at that time we weren’t talking about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: You were fighting a war and building bridges and moving out....</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: We were fighting a war and waiting to move up and waiting to find out what we were going to be doing.</span> <span id="s203">We landed at Cherbourg and moved in from there, and we did a lot of traveling very rapidly to try to catch up with Patton to get into position to do this very thing.</span> <span id="s204">And from that standpoint, we weren’t talking about concentration camps because we weren’t really getting any of that kind of news.</span> <span id="s205">It was just where are we going to be today or tomorrow or what are we going to be doing or what’s all that noise and then when we got up to where the Third Army finally was caused to turn south, that was the last foxhole I think I dug.</span> <span id="s206">Right there.</span> <span id="s207">After that, no more foxholes because the war was moving so fast that there was no point in digging foxholes, and by that time we had isolated so many pockets of Germans.</span> <span id="s208">All we were doing was posting guards every night and they were trying to avoid us, and we were trying to keep them from puling any of their last minute stands, so we wound up in a copper mine and used all those facilities to store gallons of gasoline and barbed wire fence and ammunition, and I don't know what else.</span> <span id="s209">Everything we needed.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: But as Buchenwald was suddenly identified and it was there and the order went out “Go there,” what were you thinking as you got up to those gates that you mentioned to us?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: I just had very little concept about what I was going to see.</span> <span id="s212">I wasn't really prepared to see human beings in the condition that I saw them in or was I prepared to see humans stacked like cordwood, after they were dead, and, of course, then they did have the table out next to the opening there with the lampshades and the....</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Of skin.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: And the bookcovers and that sort of [unintelligible] and tattoos that they had.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Did you, in your own little unit, talk much about it after you left the place, or were you just shocked?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: I don't believe that we talked about it a lot.</span> <span id="s217">We went back and were abandoned at a site, because they needed my truck for hauling barbed wire, as I recall.</span> <span id="s218">And there was about three or four of us left at this copper mine.</span> <span id="s219">The next morning when I was on duty, two prisoners came out of the woods, and one of the fellows [in my unit] -- I know he didn't go to the concentration camp -- wanted to shoot them right there, but I said "No, we're not going to do that" and then we turned them in to one of our sites where we just had...I couldn’t even count the prisoners.</span> <span id="s220">As far as you could see -- German prisoners.</span> <span id="s221">And I took some [photographs], a classic one, showing a naval officer.</span> <span id="s222">How in the hell we ever got him makes no...I guess he might have been home on leave or something and he looked pretty perplexed about what was going on around him, I know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Have you ever heard anything about what happened to the people who were still alive in the camp?</span> <span id="s224">Was there any other comment or information that you picked up later about what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Later, I had one experience.</span> <span id="s226">I read Frankel’s The Meaning of Life.</span> <span id="s227">I think that was the title of the book.</span> <span id="s228">It was about how he survived six years of a concentration camp by either going right or left, or saying "yes" or “no”, and his observation was that when the prisoners got out of the concentration camp, dressed in that horrible, God-forsaken, striped gown, pajama type uniform they were forced to wear...and since that time I’ve never been able to look at striped pajamas.</span> <span id="s229">And you'd see them on the roads, in ones or twos, maybe threes, but not often threes -- walking back, walking, going somewhere.</span> <span id="s230">Frankel explains in the book, which points up the selfishness of man, about when one of them got back home and his neighbor was standing there who hadn't been in the concentration camp, and he said, “Here I am.</span> <span id="s231">I just survived six years of Buchenwald!"</span> <span id="s232">And the neighbor said, "Well, it's been pretty rough here, too.”</span> <span id="s233">And at that point, the former prisoner of Buchenwald wished he was back in Buchenwald because Frankel said that you knew what to expect each and every minute when you were in the camp.</span> <span id="s234">There were no surprises.</span> <span id="s235">But, you weren’t prepared for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: What happened to the pictures you developed and printed?</span> <span id="s237">A: Most of them went to Patton's war room.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Very quickly after you had been able to....</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Very quickly.</span> <span id="s240">I was asked to get the job done.</span> <span id="s241">Q: And you got it done and....</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: The preservation of these prints for hypo and all that stuff.</span> <span id="s243">Some of these were done in tents out in the...the men would set the tent up for me, and they treated me like I was General Patton himself because I was taking pictures of them and they were sending pictures home.</span> <span id="s244">And officers on down, it didn't matter, if you were a photographer, you had first class go about what you...they had all of England restricted to quarters, but they didn't restrict any photographers to quarters.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Isn't that amazing.</span> <span id="s246">Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: It was an amazing thing.</span> <span id="s248">They never seemed to pick out the photographers to do anything but to make him feel wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: And let him do his job.</span> <span id="s250">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Was the captain of your unit with you in...?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: It was a different captain.</span> <span id="s253">He was anxious to go and I guess he wanted to see it and if it hadn't been for him, maybe some of the things we wouldn't have seen.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Because he was an officer and they realized it.</span> <span id="s255">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Did you say anything to your own officers about...of course, I bet they saw all the pictures of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s258">Everybody saw the pictures.</span> <span id="s259">You see, this was the impact of my visit to Buchenwald, and I guess I did discuss it because everybody in headquarters company was always wanting to see what came out of the dark room.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s262">And these were seen by all of the officers and many of the GI’s that were with me and that I depended on to help me out.</span> <span id="s263">And there were some mean things going on by Americans at this time.</span> <span id="s264">There was this little town, if I could think of the name of it, south of Weimar, where we wound up and where I did the developing of these particular pictures.</span> <span id="s265">There was one military government person from PFC, and there was a curfew on.</span> <span id="s266">No German was supposed to be on the road after seven p.m. or an hour before sundown, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s267">And he had gone out and brought in two men dressed in civilian clothes -- had them in the back of the jeep -- and wanted to know if anybody wanted to go with him while he interrogated them.</span> <span id="s268">And nobody did, and later it was discovered that he had taken them out in the field and shot them.</span> <span id="s269">He claims that he did that because he found a list of towns on these people where ambushes had occurred, but I didn’t feel myself that the PFC had the authority to take life.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Were these SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: They were dressed in civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s272">Who knows what they were.</span> <span id="s273">In this particular town, we do know that every night there was an influx of people from out of the woods from the surrounding countryside.</span> <span id="s274">We could hear them coming in, but we were headquarters company and that wasn't our function at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Did you see any SS Troopers during your run through that part of Europe?</span> <span id="s276">A: We captured an SS Headquarters in which I did not see any personnel.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Yes, but there weren't any still at the prison?</span> <span id="s278">They'd all either fled or been killed or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: What had happened in this same town that I'm describing where I did the developing was this driver [in photograph] standing with these dead....</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s281">This is on film.</span> <span id="s282">Picture B.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: We had two German prisoners working in the kitchen in German uniform, and when we got to this little town they were close to where they lived and somehow somebody in the kitchen got to talking about they wanted pancakes.</span> <span id="s284">But they needed some baking power to make the pancakes, to make them rise.</span> <span id="s285">One of these German prisoners said, “Oh, my home’s not too far from here.</span> <span id="s286">We can go over there and maybe we can get some from my wife.”</span> <span id="s287">Naturally he wanted to go home and see his family and see what’s going on, so this driver, a carpenter by the name of Jones from Arkansas, and one or two of the cooks came to me and said “Come on and go with us and get this baking power.</span> <span id="s288">We want to use your three-quarter ton.”</span> <span id="s289">And I said, “You’re going to have to check with the Captain first and see if you can do that.”</span> <span id="s290">So they came back and said, “Yes, he said we could use this three-quarter ton.”</span> <span id="s291">And now here it was about sunset of that second day when I was still working on these pictures and I said, “No, I’ve got to get this out.</span> <span id="s292">I can’t go.”</span> <span id="s293">And that truck, that three-quarter ton, was ambushed about two miles out of town.</span> <span id="s294">Everybody died, except the carpenter, and what happened was the carpenter got out of the back of the truck after he fired every round of his M1 and the rest of them drove off the pocket of Germans probably led by an SS Trooper.</span> <span id="s295">In fact, the two that we captured back at the copper mine said that they had escaped from an SS Trooper, that they didn’t want to fight any more.</span> <span id="s296">And Jones got out in his stupor and turned the truck around but fainted and drove into a bank, and the next morning a heavy maintenance outfit loaded that truck and everybody on it and took it to a field hospital.</span> <span id="s297">And late the next afternoon we discovered where they were and they went and got the story from Jones.</span> <span id="s298">So, this man standing here [in picture] that had driven us to Buchenwald, as the fates would have it, added him to the pile.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Did you see many German civilians around the [unintelligible] or as you moved away from it or towards it?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: This is very vague, and it may be that I’m thinking things that I’ve read more than I’m remembering things that I saw, but it does stick in my mind that we saw some civilians, but that camp was in a remote location from Weimar.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: What do you think the civilians knew about it?</span> <span id="s302">Do you think the German civilians around there knew the camp was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: We were told that Patton had already made them come out and see it.</span> <span id="s304">We were told when we got there that they had already been out there and seen the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Did your own feelings about the German civilians change after you’d seen the</span></p> <p><span id="s306">camp at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: No.</span> <span id="s308">Part of the reason for this, I think, was some of the contact that I had in talking with the Germans.</span> <span id="s309">And I don’t think I said to myself “I’m here out of no choice that I had, so what control do people have over their government if it goes bad?”</span> <span id="s310">I don’t know that that happened until later when I was in Frankfort and I talked with some of the Germans and they posed the question “What could we do about it?</span> <span id="s311">If we were against him or against the government or if we didn’t agree with it, what could we do about it?”</span> <span id="s312">And it was a good question.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: How long did you stay in Germany?</span> <span id="s314">In other words, when did you start back home?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: I left Germany and I was in Paris for three months and went back to Germany and was in Germany another three or four months, and I started home in December from Antwerp and got home just before Christmas.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: But you’d bee n back and forth to Germany several times.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s318">I’ve been in and out of Germany, from Holland and Belgium and France.</span> <span id="s319">Q: That’s interesting.</span> <span id="s320">Did you write home or say anything to your folks about...?</span> <span id="s321">A: I sent all these pictures and I sent some to the newspapers.</span> <span id="s322">I sent some to the Waltham News Tribune which was our hometown paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: You thought it was important then that they knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: I did.</span> <span id="s325">And I was disappointed in some of the responses that I got from my folks.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">I didn’t feel as if they placed the grave thoughts about how did this happen or why did it happen that I placed on it, and which goes to show you that a picture is very descriptive, but there is a lot left out.</span> <span id="s327">And if you don’t experience it first hand, then the picture can only tell you so much.</span> <span id="s328">It can only imply.</span> <span id="s329">It’s not the territory, it’s only the map.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Only the map.</span> <span id="s331">Were you married at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: I married just before I went over.</span> <span id="s333">Had been married about three weeks when I</span></p> <p><span id="s334">went over.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Did you tell your wife about it when you came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: I don’t think I doted on it.</span> <span id="s337">I don’t think she was inquisitive about any of it.</span> <span id="s338">She had one brother in the Marines in the Pacific, and they lived from day to day and wondered whether he was going to come back, and then she said that she was very concerned about me when I was over there.</span> <span id="s339">We would only see it on TV on National Education Television.</span> <span id="s340">It was not too many months ago now, maybe in the winter some time, that I had watched this accounting and it was difficult for me to watch it.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: What about your children.</span> <span id="s342">Did you ever tell them any of it?</span> <span id="s343">A: Yes, I told them and showed them the pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: About how old were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: I didn’t spare them if they wanted to look at them, and I can’t remember now just how old they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Were they teenagers?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: I don’t think they were.</span> <span id="s348">I believe they were younger than that when they first saw these pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: It's really a fascinating pattern that we 're seeing because there are some people who just put them away and don't even let their minds think about it.</span> <span id="s350">It's just destructive.</span> <span id="s351">Others wanted the world to see what had happened with their own eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: My experience with it went to the degree that when I got to Paris, I had these pictures with me.</span> <span id="s353">I was in the hospital and a lady by the name of Madame Susan Bouchie, whose husband M. Bouchie, had printed the [unintelligible], the French Underground Paper, and she was a Grey Lady and I was very surly in the hospital against the Red Cross and the Grey Ladies.</span> <span id="s354">I don't know.</span> <span id="s355">I think this was a semantical reaction I was having at that time.</span> <span id="s356">I didn't realize it.</span> <span id="s357">And she persisted and was very kind and invited me to her home and wanted me to bring these pictures and show them to her husband.</span> <span id="s358">I didn't realize at this time the contribution that this family had made to the war.</span> <span id="s359">But, they had saved seventeen American and allied flyers, including their little boy, who was 7 at the time, and their little girl, who was 9, and by the time I met them they were 9 and 11, something like that.</span> <span id="s360">But, then she had a party and she particularly wanted me to come to the party and bring these pictures because there was a Swedish salesman there that had been selling material to the Germans, copper in particular, I think it was.</span> <span id="s361">And he would have none of this concentration camp stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: It didn’t happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: “It never happened.”</span> <span id="s364">And so she wanted me to shove these pictures up in his face.</span> <span id="s365">And I can remember her absolute distaste for this person but determination in every way to rub it in that he had done wrong and that he was not neutral as they claimed and that Sweden was more guilty of acts than France was in letting Germany overrun them.</span> <span id="s366">So, at this party in her apartment, I had these pictures in a pocket secretary, like I always have carried them, and I whipped them out and said, 'What do you think of these?"</span> <span id="s367">and he said, "What are these?"</span> <span id="s368">And I said, "These are the pictures I took in Buchenwald concentration camp in Weimar, Germany" and looked him in the eye.</span> <span id="s369">He said, "You could have taken those in America."</span> <span id="s370">So, I didn't beat him to death or anything like that [laughter], I just said that just shows the [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s371">That's exactly what his answer had to be.</span> <span id="s372">It could be nothing else, you see, unless you were to drag him by the scruff of the neck and taken him back there and show it to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: When you thought of this, then, did you think that it was just Jews or did you...?</span> <span id="s374">A: No!</span> <span id="s375">No!</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Were you aware that it was as you'd written on the back of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: They knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: They knew that it was everybody.</span> <span id="s379">A: Yes, it just wasn’t Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Were there any religious overtones that you might have had?</span> <span id="s381">Did this do anything to your religion or make you think anything about religious questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: I can't recall that that was....</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Did you ever talk to a chaplain about it, or did you ever see a chaplain?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: No.</span> <span id="s385">No.</span> <span id="s386">I never did that and I never dreamed about that [my Buchenwald experiences], because I'd had an experience earlier in my childhood when I went to Brandeis University.</span> <span id="s387">It wasn't called Brandeis at the time, but I can't think of the name of it.</span> <span id="s388">Anyway, before it was Brandeis, it was a medical school of less than perfect reputation.</span> <span id="s389">It was an old castle type place, and they had cadavers that they operated on.</span> <span id="s390">This fellow took me there when I was about nine and we looked through the windows, and I dreamed for a solid year after seeing this about a dead person down in the basement, so I must have gotten over death about that point.</span> <span id="s391">I didn't have any need to go see a chaplain.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: I just wondered if anybody did.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: I can't recall that.</span> <span id="s394">My religious experience in the Army was absolutely zero as I recall, excepting when I was in Paris.</span> <span id="s395">This family, the Bouchies, their children would take me into Paris and I would photograph Notre Dame, and I had great reverence for this evidence of history and of the timelessness of what it represented in terms of what these people adhered to and believed in.</span> <span id="s396">And only when I got back and I had reached the age of about 30 did I have a religious experience.</span> <span id="s397">And it was because of a man that I met while I was having my car repaired.</span> <span id="s398">He invited me to come to Sunday School Class.</span> <span id="s399">And shortly after I joined the Church I became one of the youngest elders of the Church.</span> <span id="s400">So, that was a very enriching experience</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: But, during that period of the war and after war, there just wasn't a problem of religion or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: There wasn't that sense of values or I wasn't calling on God to explain to me why this happened or how it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: What about your political beliefs?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: I'm an Ike man.</span> <span id="s405">I mean he was supreme commander and he was....</span> <span id="s406">Q: It didn't really matter if he was a Republican or a Democrat.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: I would have to say that I'm biased towards the Republicans because my family is.</span> <span id="s408">My parents have been Republicans.</span> <span id="s409">My father’s a Republican.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Yes, but political questions didn't come into this either, did they?</span> <span id="s411">A: No.</span> <span id="s412">Not at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: Did it affect any of the political interests and activities that you had?</span> <span id="s414">A: None.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: You did mention that you had seen on the television some of the Holocaust things.</span> <span id="s416">Was it the Holocaust show?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: No, I avoided that because that to me was trading on the war in a fashion that was not a historical documentation.</span> <span id="s418">I cannot bring myself to be interested in that kind of show.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: This is why you did make the very exact distinction between the educational television that actually had parts of those stories that were so real that no one can deny them, but not for the commercialized version.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: You can't trade on that.</span> <span id="s421">In my mind, you just can't do it.</span> <span id="s422">No matter what you do, there's no way that you’re going to fake this and you're not going to relive it and you're not going to act it and there's nobody that's going to portray it.</span> <span id="s423">They can forget that.</span> <span id="s424">In my mind, there's only one way that you have to discuss this and that's totally on the basis of the facts and the historical significance of it from that aspect.</span> <span id="s425">That is my neurosemantical feeling about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Do you think it can happen again?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Absolutely!</span> <span id="s428">And I wouldn't even doubt that it's not happening this very minute somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: What in your own life do you think the impact of that experience at Buchenwald has been on yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: To recognize that a human is a very difficult thing to get rid of, number one, and that there isn't anything that a human will not do to another human, and that the leadership of this world has not paid close attention to the tremendous pressures that population is causing us to have to contend with at some point and not too far down the road.</span> <span id="s431">This is my impression and feeling and observation of what’s going on here.</span> <span id="s432">I mean, here was civilization, as old as it is, and what’s very obvious is that our ability to communicate to each other and to exact commitments as to what I feel is the worst dereliction of our leaders, and that is to permit us to think we can just go on and on and on.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: I deeply appreciate your sharing this with us.</span></p></body></html>
