id="s4">I am Michael Garelick, and Rosalyn Smith is going to be one of the interviewers, also.</span> <span id="s5">We are making an oral history for the Anti-Defamation League on the Holocaust and

your complete name, including your Jewish name, if it’s different at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: My name is Sabina Swarcz Zimering.</span> <span id="s9">My Jewish name was Sara Schwartz.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Q: Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: I was born February 24, 1923, in Warsaw and grew up in Piotrkow, Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: What were your parents’ names, grandparents’ or great grandparents’?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: My father’s name was Bernard Schwartz, my mother’s name was Tauba Finkelstein Schwartz.</span> <span id="s14">My father’s parents lived in Piotrkow, where I grew up, and they were Tauba and Yitzhak Schwartz.</span> <span id="s15">My mother’s parents -- I didn’t know my grandmother, she was dead, but my grandfather was Finkelstein.</span> <span id="s16">I don’t remember his first name.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: The occupation of your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: My mother was a teacher.</span> <span id="s19">My father was a businessman.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: As far as languages were spoken at home…which type?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Polish and Yiddish.</span> <span id="s22">The children spoke Polish mostly, the parents spoke mixed Yiddish and Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: You can speak Polish and Yiddish very easily yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Well, I can communicate.</span> <span id="s25">I didn’t use it for a long time, so it’s not “easily.”</span> <span id="s26">But I could</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Concerning the family, was it a secular or religious family?</span> <span id="s28">If they were religious, were they observant, were they Zionists or were they Hasidic in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Well, my father’s family, my grandfather was very Hasidic.</span> <span id="s30">Very active in a little shul.</span> <span id="s31">My father was supposed to grow up to be a rabbi, but he ended up being a socialist (laughter) to my grandmother’s great disappointment.</span> <span id="s32">In our home, we did not observe, but we definitely knew that we were Jews, and observed the main holidays.</span> <span id="s33">As a high school girl I was not politically active, but I knew, and I had some contacts with, Hashomer Hatzair, to which my cousin belonged, and was one of the leaders in town.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Did you have any formal Jewish education, or was it mainly in the home?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: Well, I went to a Jewish gymnasium, and I had four years of Hebrew language and religious education.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: As far as the events from the mid 1930s to, let’s say, 1941 -- things that were happening in the world -- at that point did you have knowledge of other events around you -- what was going on -- or just in Poland itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: I was pretty aware of what was going on, and the main reason was that my father was a self educated man who was extremely interested in current events and in politics in general, and he carefully followed the events in Germany and all the political things, so he talked bout it at home and I knew what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Did he find out, let’s say, from the newspapers or radio, or was it mainly word of mouth?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s40">Definitely the press.</span> <span id="s41">He read several papers every day.</span> <span id="s42">There were very few radios, there was no T.V., so the main source of information was the press, the papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">R.S.</span> <span id="s44">Did you hold the press as being real reliable, or…</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Well, he read the Polish press.</span> <span id="s46">A city of our size, we had maybe, oh, 60-70,000 people in the whole city.</span> <span id="s47">Minneapolis has only one paper.</span> <span id="s48">There were maybe half a dozen various daily papers, and there were several Jewish papers -- depending on the political – and the same Polish.</span> <span id="s49">So you had enough information from reading several papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Did you find, or did he find to communicate to you, that the newspapers at that point were anti-Semitic?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Oh, yes, definitely.</span> <span id="s52">A lot of Polish papers.</span> <span id="s53">The Socialist, the leftist papers were always very sympathetic, but the official Polish papers, the government or the writers’ organizations, were definitely anti-Semitic.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Do you think they were reflecting the opinion of most people in Poland at that point as being anti-Semitic?</span> <span id="s55">Was Poland in the 30s -- the average person -- were they anti-Semitic?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s57">They sure were.</span> <span id="s58">In fact, there was a difference, I think, between Poland and Germany, from what we remember.</span> <span id="s59">In Poland, the average Pole just grew up with the feeling of hating Jews and blaming everything on the Jews, and the government knew enough to try and pretend.</span> <span id="s60">They tried not to show it.</span> <span id="s61">So it was like a two-faced situation.</span> <span id="s62">The true feeling was anti-Jewish, but the official language and the official form was hiding it.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">I think in Germany it was the other way around.</span> <span id="s64">The average population, for a long time, was very close to Jews and lived with them, and so on.</span> <span id="s65">But the regime was, right way, under Hitler, the regime was very anti…</span></p> <p><span id="s66">R.S. Do you think in Poland, the anti-Semitism might have been related to the Church at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s68">It was.</span> <span id="s69">To the Church.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: In what setting or settings did you have contact with gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Well we lived in a Polish neighborhood.</span> <span id="s72">I grew up with Polish friends.</span> <span id="s73">I went to a Polish school.</span> <span id="s74">I knew the Polish customs, holidays, and so on.</span> <span id="s75">In fact, I remember I was in grade school when some of my friends were saying, “Oh, you’re such a fun kid!</span> <span id="s76">Why don’t you just come with me to church and convert!”</span> <span id="s77">(Everyone laughs.)</span> <span id="s78">And I came home and told it to my mom and for an answer I got a big laugh.</span> <span id="s79">She laughed.</span> <span id="s80">She thought it was funny.</span> <span id="s81">It made me feel very embarrassed.</span> <span id="s82">And that was it.</span> <span id="s83">We never talked about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Did you family do business with gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: What about bringing gentiles into the home?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s88">We had friends all the time.</span> <span id="s89">I don’t think that the parents had many formal friends, but they had business associated and neighbors.</span> <span id="s90">I guess that’s why I survived the war.</span> <span id="s91">I grew up in a Polish neighborhood.</span> <span id="s92">My Polish language was very accent free.</span> <span id="s93">I was very aware of and familiar with Polish customs, and because of that I was able to pass as a non-Jew during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">R.S.</span> <span id="s95">In the community that you lived in, would you say the people were more professional people, highly educated?</span> <span id="s96">Or were they more…</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: No.</span> <span id="s98">It was a mix.</span> <span id="s99">There was some of everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Prior to the outbreak of the war -- we talked a moment ago about anti-Semitism in the newspapers -- what did you experience, or your family experience, as far as anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: (Laughter) Every day.</span> <span id="s102">Stones were thrown at us, and we were called names, and there were -- I don’t know what you call it -- graffiti.</span> <span id="s103">There were signs always written on walls.</span> <span id="s104">It was very open.</span> <span id="s105">Nobody made any bones about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Did this make you hate, in return, the gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s108">Fear was the first thing, and hate, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: So you saw slogans?</span> <span id="s110">There were stonings?</span> <span id="s111">What else?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: For example, we lived in a Polish neighborhood, and my grandfather had a long beard and was wearing the traditional Jewish Hasidic outfit.</span> <span id="s113">They didn’t dare to come to visit us because they just weren’t safe to walk in this part of town to come and see us, because they would be chased by young Polish kids, and attacked, and…you know</span></p> <p><span id="s114">R.S.</span> <span id="s115">You said your father had a business?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">R.S.</span> <span id="s118">Did his business gradually decrease as anti-Semitism worsened?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Well, no.</span> <span id="s120">It was really not because of the anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s121">It was the economic situation that was bad before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Do you feel that the anti-Semitism that you experienced and your family experienced at that point -- was that typical of what was happening throughout Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s124">Definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: So it wasn’t isolated in the Warsaw area?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: No.</span> <span id="s127">No-no-no.</span> <span id="s128">You hear about Jewish students.</span> <span id="s129">First of all they had what they called “numerous clauses.”</span> <span id="s130">They didn’t let in more than a certain small quota of Jewish students to the universities.</span> <span id="s131">And the ones that did go, were all so abused and beat up and just bodily attacked, that a lot of wealthy Jewish people sent their kids abroad to universities.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Were they attacked by gangs?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: No, by their own classmates, by the students.</span> <span id="s134">You haven’t heard about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Yes, we’re going to be getting to that in a little greater detail.</span> <span id="s136">What I need to know now is, did any of your relatives live outside the community?</span> <span id="s137">Any cousins outside the shtetl or the part of Poland that you were in?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: You mean outside of Piotrkow.</span> <span id="s139">My hometown?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Well my mother’s family was from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s142">This was the city where my father came from, and all his family, they lived there.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: To your knowledge, do you know what happened to them, and when?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Well, my mother’s family, I know very little, because they lived in Warsaw and I guess they just perished in the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s145">My father’s family -- now let’s see.</span> <span id="s146">He had parents, and there were five children -- I wanted to say he’s the only survivor; well, he didn’t survive either -- so there was no one out of the aunts and uncles.</span> <span id="s147">And out of the grandchildren, there are just four or five.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: What age were you at the outbreak of the war?</span> <span id="s149">We’re looking, probably, a little before 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: What do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: How old were you at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Well, when the war broke out, September 1, 1939, I was sixteen years old.</span> <span id="s153">Are you interested in my experiences right the same day?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Yes, I want to know how you received news of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Well, for weeks before the war broke out, there was a lot of tension, because Germany and Poland were exchanging all kinds of threatening diplomatic_-- whatever you call it.</span> <span id="s156">The population was being prepared for war and for attack and we had to practice covering the windows in case of bombing attacks, and so on.</span> <span id="s157">So, September 1st was a Friday, and I remember I went with my mother to a farmers’ market, and we were coming back after the shopping and we heard, again, a siren.</span> <span id="s158">And we all assumed it was another, just, trial, preparation for what we hoped would never happen.</span> <span id="s159">We were supposed to get off the street and hide in a building.</span> <span id="s160">A few minutes after that, bombs were falling.</span> <span id="s161">This was September 1, 1939.</span> <span id="s162">Piotrkow was bombed and attacked by the Germans.</span> <span id="s163">And that was it!</span> <span id="s164">It was a very drastic beginning of the war, and the family ran away.</span> <span id="s165">My father had an idea of going east.</span> <span id="s166">He hoped that Poland will give the German forces enough resistance so that we will have time to go east and possibly to Russia or to the eastern part, because Piotrkow was on the western part of Poland.</span> <span id="s167">We all gathered our belongings, went to the grandparents, and the family ran away.</span> <span id="s168">But a week later, it was over with.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Before the actual bombing started, did your family have any thoughts or desire about leaving Poland -- before the actual war began?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Well, if they did, it wasn’t anything that looked like they were going to do it, and it was because of economic situation.</span> <span id="s171">It was very expensive and was very involved to leave Poland before the war.</span> <span id="s172">I knew very few people.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Did you have to bribe anybody to get out at that point, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Frankly, I didn’t know anyone among our friends and relatives.</span> <span id="s175">The only thing I remember is some relatives of my mother left for Israel, but this was quite a few years before the war.</span> <span id="s176">They were Zionists, and they were just leaving because of the general situation in Poland -- anti-Semitism, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">R.S. Was there kind of a thought, too -- besides economics, and not trying to get out of Poland -- that maybe your city wouldn’t be bombed, and that you would be okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Oh, you mean…</span></p> <p><span id="s179">R.S.</span> <span id="s180">When you were making preparations for the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Well, we didn’t really make any preparations.</span> <span id="s182">We just hoped that it would not happen, and just went along, but I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s183">Later on, during the war, I remember my father was seriously thinking about crossing over -- you know, Poland was divided, Eastern Poland was Russian -- and a lot of young people that could take off and go, left and went to Russia.</span> <span id="s184">They were talking about it, and they were beginning to make serious plans, but I guess he gave up because it was too big a project for a family of five, with three small children, and not enough money, so they didn’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Before the war, there was a lot of anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s186">When the actual war started, do you remember what was the reaction of the Jewish community?</span> <span id="s187">What did the neighbors say when the war started, and were there any meetings held in synagogues to act as one -- to come together?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Well, I was sixteen, so I was mostly preoccupied with, you know, activities and friends of my own age, so I didn’t follow that too well.</span> <span id="s189">But I remember there was a great fear, and families were getting together and discussing, and trying to figure out what will happen.</span> <span id="s190">But what happened in Piotrkow, that I didn’t know then, I found out later, was that we were the very first ghetto under the Nazi-occupied Poland.</span> <span id="s191">I think it was the end of October, beginning of November, people that lived outside the Jewish section, like we did, lost their apartments, and had to go in into the restricted area, and our family of five, right away, was put in one room with another family.</span> <span id="s192">So you were, right away, together with a lot of other people, and I remember it was in the same building where my grandfather lived, so every evening the parents would get together and just discuss things and talk and try to figure out and look into the future, and hope for the best.</span> <span id="s193">As far as any organized meetings, Piotrkow had a good-sized Jewish community before the war, that had…</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: About how big?</span> <span id="s195">Any idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Oh, I think it must have been 20,000 Jewish people.</span> <span id="s197">And they were very well organized.</span> <span id="s198">They had like a Jewish community.</span> <span id="s199">They had self-rule, and this just continued through the war, during the war.</span> <span id="s200">In fact the Germans turned over quite a few of the functions of running the ghetto to the Jewish committee.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Was it like a Jewish Council?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Right, something like a council, like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: What opinions did other people in the Jewish community have of the Council members?</span> <span id="s204">Did they think they were collaborators in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Well, that depended.</span> <span id="s206">Some people were above reproach, some of the Council members.</span> <span id="s207">They were very honest, they were very dedicated.</span> <span id="s208">And some were doing things that weren’t quite right.</span> <span id="s209">And things got tougher when the German demands became more and more strict -- difficult -- and the Jewish Council had to execute that, and have to do whatever the Germans wanted them to do.</span> <span id="s210">I remember it started out with…let’s say, they would come in and say, “We need 20,000 zlotys.</span> <span id="s211">We’re giving you twenty-four hours.</span> <span id="s212">You come up with it, and we don’t care from what Jews you get it.</span> <span id="s213">If we don’t get the money, 200 Jewish men will be shot or sent off.”</span> <span id="s214">The Jewish Council was left with the job of coming up with the money, so they had to approach various people, and of course, this didn’t create any good feelings.</span> <span id="s215">Or I remember that they would come and say, ”All fur coats, and all fur collars, have to be delivered within forty-eight hours.”</span> <span id="s216">And again, it was their job to do it.</span> <span id="s217">And things got worse as the war got worse, and as they needed more Jews for all kinds of jobs.</span> <span id="s218">The Jewish Council had a special department.</span> <span id="s219">It was called the Arbeitzung, which means, “the work.”</span> <span id="s220">I don’t know how you translate it.</span> <span id="s221">For supplying people for work.</span> <span id="s222">And again, the Germans had a special project, and they said, “We need 5,000 strong men by tomorrow, 8 o’clock in the morning, and you have to provide them.”</span> <span id="s223">And usually, the 5,000 people that were sent off didn’t come back.</span> <span id="s224">Either part came back, or they were abused, beaten or whatever.</span> <span id="s225">So it was not an easy job to have.</span> <span id="s226">I guess the Jewish community was still glad to be able to deal with Jews rather than immediately with the Germans, but it wasn’t anything very pleasant for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">R.S.</span> <span id="s228">What kind of communication did you have outside the ghetto?</span> <span id="s229">Were you able to get papers then still, or find out what was going on outside of your perimeter?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Well not really, not very much.</span> <span id="s231">I don’t remember when, but within a few months, they gave us armbands with a Mogen David, and you were supposed to wear it all the time when you went outside of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s232">You had to wear this.</span> <span id="s233">And there were certain hours when you can be out, and other hours you couldn’t be out.</span> <span id="s234">So the contact was very skimpy.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: As far as the Nazi occupation, how quickly did that occur?</span> <span id="s236">You said your city was one of the first.</span> <span id="s237">Was it within a week, a couple days?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Well, let’s see.</span> <span id="s239">We left the city the night after war broke out, after the bombing.</span> <span id="s240">We were going on foot, and you didn’t dare to walk in the daytime, because the German planes were so daring that they would come down really low, and they were able to use machine guns, and just shoot at people on the ground.</span> <span id="s241">So we were hiding out in the woods in the daytime, and just walked at night.</span> <span id="s242">So within a whole week, we put in only 30 miles.</span> <span id="s243">And then they overtook us.</span> <span id="s244">The Germans were already where we were trying to run away, so we just went back home.</span> <span id="s245">So to answer your question, Piotrkow must have been occupied within three or four days after the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: You mentioned the Jewish Council with the Germans, etcetera.</span> <span id="s247">What action did the actual German forces take in the early months of the occupation?</span> <span id="s248">Did they do anything else besides set up the Councils?</span> <span id="s249">You talked a little about the edicts they were given.</span> <span id="s250">Were they patrolling the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s252">That’s right.</span> <span id="s253">Definitely.</span> <span id="s254">You could not only see them, but you could hear them.</span> <span id="s255">I remember the German soldiers’ boots were so heavy, and they always walked, like either two or three soldiers together, and they were -- well.</span> <span id="s256">The goose-step, I guess you call it?</span> <span id="s257">You could hear them blocks away.</span> <span id="s258">It was really terrorizing.</span> <span id="s259">They patrolled like that right away, the Polish part as well as the Jewish part.</span> <span id="s260">They would come to stores and just take things they liked, and didn’t pay for it.</span> <span id="s261">It was just pretty scary, right away.</span> <span id="s262">And there were the decrees.</span> <span id="s263">The orders were given.</span> <span id="s264">Practically every other day there was something new.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: This is what I want to find out.</span> <span id="s266">What kind of legislation or anti-Jewish measures were given at the time of the occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Well, one of the first things was to put all the Jews from Piotrkow in a small part, an old part, of the city that was traditionally the Jewish section.</span> <span id="s268">So whoever happened to be lucky and lived there all the time, had their own apartment, and stayed, and they weren’t much uprooted.</span> <span id="s269">But we happened to be in the Polish part, so we had to leave right away.</span> <span id="s270">Schools were right away closed.</span> <span id="s271">I’d just finished gymnasium, but it was closed immediately.</span> <span id="s272">Even grade schools for Jewish children were closed while the Polish ones were kept open.</span> <span id="s273">What was most important to me was the schools and where we lived!</span> <span id="s274">And this was right away changed and taken from the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: When all this started, when the war started, did you have any knowledge of what was happening in other ghettos, of any concentration camps, or any killings of any kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Well, as I said at that time I was a teenager, I did not read the daily paper, but my father did, and he used to talk about it, and he wanted us to know that.</span> <span id="s277">So we knew that Jews in Germany are being persecuted and are undergoing terrible times.</span> <span id="s278">In fact, it seems to me I remember a shipment of German Jews that was brought to Poland.</span> <span id="s279">But that was all I knew.</span> <span id="s280">I read books that already at that time were writing about the Nazi things.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Did you believe it was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Oh yes, definitely.</span> <span id="s283">There was no doubt about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">R.S.</span> <span id="s285">Did you have a conceptualization of what the concentration camps really were?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: That I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s287">I just remember some articles father read or pointed out to us to read, about individual German Jews -- what was happening in their lives when the Nazis came to power.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Did the Nazis go mainly after the community leaders or they didn’t really care when they first came in?</span> <span id="s289">To give the rest of the community examples?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Well, there were various approached, like, my uncle was very active in the Jewish Council, and he was a very politically active man way back before the war, and very respected.</span> <span id="s291">And at one point they rounded up all politically active Jews, and he was one of them.</span> <span id="s292">And ay another point, they would just at random, go into a neighborhood and find all the able-bodied men, took them away, and they either didn’t come back or came back, you know, beaten up and so on.</span> <span id="s293">So there were various things.</span> <span id="s294">There wasn’t just one.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: (To Smith).</span> <span id="s296">All right.</span> <span id="s297">Did you have any more you want to add to the introduction?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">R.S. I just want to ask, when you said people were getting called out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s299">Did many come back?</span> <span id="s300">Or, when they left, did you feel that they were maybe going to concentration camps, or going just for labor positions, or…</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: Well, they used to say that they are taking them for work, and they’ll be back tomorrow, and so on.</span> <span id="s302">But most everyone was very fearful and didn’t trust them.</span> <span id="s303">And until you saw the person back, you expected the worst, because so many times they never did come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">R.S. And the few that came back.</span> <span id="s305">Did they say what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Well, I suppose they talked to very close people.</span> <span id="s307">Our father was taken several times and came back, and I just don’t remember him talking to us.</span> <span id="s308">I don’t know, maybe he talked to my mother or his contemporaries, but I don’t recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Did people who were taken -- did the Germans try to make them become spies within the community at all?</span> <span id="s310">Do you remember anything about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: No.</span> <span id="s312">That I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s314">What I want to get into right now is a little bit about the hiding and the partisans, etcetera.</span> <span id="s315">If you were in hiding, who hid you?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: I survived the war because of two Polish friends that were my childhood friends.</span> <span id="s317">They were daughters of our teacher.</span> <span id="s318">(They) supplied me with a Polish false identity card.</span> <span id="s319">And after the ghetto was liquidated, when they sent off everybody and kept only a small group, my sister and I survived together.</span> <span id="s320">They hid us out in their home.</span> <span id="s321">And after that, we went to Germany.</span> <span id="s322">We signed up as Polish girls, volunteering for work in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: By “hiding in their home,” did you have a secret hiding place, or did you actually become part of the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Well it was a little unusual situation.</span> <span id="s325">These two sisters and the mother, what I didn’t know then, they were always very patriotic, and they were in the Polish underground at that time.</span> <span id="s326">And that’s why they were able to supply us with false papers.</span> <span id="s327">Now the father was not in favor of that activity, and he was afraid of the risks, so when they brought us to their home, he didn’t know we were there.</span> <span id="s328">They were hiding my sister and myself up in the attic where the mother and the two sisters knew and the father did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: How long did that go on?</span> <span id="s330">Before he knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: Well, he never knew.</span> <span id="s332">We were there for, I guess, a couple weeks, and then we had to leave because it was too dangerous for them, and we went…</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: You lived in the attic and the father did not know?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Now the actual arrangements for the hiding, this was done by the mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: And the two daughters.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: And the daughters were about the same age as you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: You were hidden in the house.</span> <span id="s340">Did you hide throughout the war, or just part of the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s342">It was just a short time.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: What length of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: Maybe a week or two.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: After you were hidden, did you keep in contact with these particular people?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: How did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Well, first of all, in ’42, the ghettos were being tightened, and eliminated, and so on.</span> <span id="s349">And pretty soon, gossip, or news -- word-of-mouth --was going that the Germans systematically, are exterminating one ghetto after another.</span> <span id="s350">That was in ’42, and I was 19 years old, and I remember, I began to realize…(pause)…I remember when it was pretty obvious that it’s just a matter of time when the Piotrkow ghetto will be liquidated --what they did was they would surround the ghetto and sort out and maybe keep 2,000 out of the 22,000 people, and the rest were sent off to Treblinka -- and when I realized that this is like the end for me, I got very upset, and I had a feeling of inner revolt.</span> <span id="s351">I said, “I don’t want to die, and I don’t want to let the Germans kill me.</span> <span id="s352">Not now.”</span> <span id="s353">And I began to nag my mother, “what can be done?</span> <span id="s354">We should do something about it.”</span> <span id="s355">My father was the only one that was saved, because he had a job that made him useful to the Germans, but the rest of us were just…I remember my mother said, “Don’t bother me.</span> <span id="s356">Whatever will happen to everybody else, will happen to us.”</span> <span id="s357">The parents, from hunger and from the war, they just didn’t have energy to think about anything but one day at a time.</span> <span id="s358">But I guess I made enough of a nuisance of myself, and she began to think, what could be done to do something about it.</span> <span id="s359">And she said, “Well why don’t we approach our friends and see if they can do something for us?”</span> <span id="s360">She said the only hope would be to approach our friends and see if they can help us.</span> <span id="s361">And what she had in mind was to ask one of the sisters to give me her passport and give me a chance to save myself.</span> <span id="s362">So we contacted them.</span> <span id="s363">They came to the ghetto, and we told them what’s what.</span> <span id="s364">So they said, “Well, we’ll go home, think about it and come back and tell you.”</span> <span id="s365">A few days later they came back and they said, “We can give you three papers for all of your women.”</span> <span id="s366">Men in Poland had no chance of pretending not to be Jews because no one else was circumcised, only Jewish men.</span> <span id="s367">So she offered a passport to my mother, my sister, and myself, and we just couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s368">And no money -- it was unbelievable!</span> <span id="s369">My name was Schwartz, and this was considered a Jewish name, so she said, “Pick any Polish name, and have a picture ready, and we’ll be back in a few days.”</span> <span id="s370">So that’s how we got the papers.</span> <span id="s371">And when the Germans came and surrounded the ghetto, it was, I remember, midnight.</span> <span id="s372">We were able to run out, just a few hours before it would have been too late, and that’s how we stayed outside of the ghetto and then went to Germany.</span> <span id="s373">Worked there as Polish girls.</span> <span id="s374">My mother didn’t make it because somebody caught her right in our hometown -- although she looked much less Jewish and her Polish was even…</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: So the three passports you did receive.</span> <span id="s376">One was for you, one was for your sister, and one for your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s378">We all had different names.</span> <span id="s379">My mother -- this was her idea -- she said, “the two of you, even if you plan to be together, have different names.</span> <span id="s380">In case one gets caught, you can pretend you just have nothing to do with each other, so you don’t automatically destroy or point to the other one.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: After you left the Polish friends, because you had a passport, saying you were Polish, did you make any attempt to contact any resistance groups?</span> <span id="s382">Any Jewish groups at all?</span> <span id="s383">Or would that be too risky?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Well, the only contact that I had with a resistance group was during the war in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s385">It must have been maybe ’41 or ’42.</span> <span id="s386">Most Jewish kids, as I said, couldn’t continue their education officially, because all the Jewish schools were closed, but there was a lot of informal education going on.</span> <span id="s387">Like I was teaching Jewish grade school kids.</span> <span id="s388">And some of the Jewish professors that came from other towns or from our town that were laid off -- had no work -- had…You were not supposed to be meeting.</span> <span id="s389">No Jewish groups were allowed, but we were illegally meeting with our teachers and just were studying, just as if it was in high school.</span> <span id="s390">And at one point, we had a group of maybe fifteen, twenty young people that were getting together just like, maybe, a literary club or a historical club.</span> <span id="s391">And one of the leaders of the club who was a Hashomer Hatzair leader in town, brought up the idea.</span> <span id="s392">He said, “We know what’s happening.</span> <span id="s393">We know what the Germans are doing to us.</span> <span id="s394">Why don’t we resist?</span> <span id="s395">Why don’t we do something about it?”</span> <span id="s396">I remember this was such a surprising thought, and we were just so shocked (laughter) and surprised about it.</span> <span id="s397">For example, my parents didn’t know that I belonged to that group because they would have been afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Was it mostly a Jewish group?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: It was all Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">R.S.</span> <span id="s401">In the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: In the ghetto, right.</span> <span id="s403">But when he brought up the idea, we all began to think about it.</span> <span id="s404">And apparently, later on, I found out, he had contacts with Warsaw’s underground Hashomer Hatzair, and he was going to organize something, and this was the group of people that he felt would be right for it.</span> <span id="s405">But before we had any chance to do anything, the ghetto was exterminated.</span> <span id="s406">It was just too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">R.S.</span> <span id="s408">How much support was there?</span> <span id="s409">Was it just your young group?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Well, all these things were strictly secret, so it could be that things like that were going on among other groups of young people, and we just didn’t know about it.</span> <span id="s411">But I remember personally, that this was something that was contemplated, and never came off, because it was too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Did you act at all during the war as a partisan?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: No.</span> <span id="s414">No.</span> <span id="s415">I didn’t have a chance.</span> <span id="s416">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s418">I want to go into a little bit more about the hiding area.</span> <span id="s419">I want a physical description of what it was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Well, it was a private home.</span> <span id="s421">The parents of my friends were well-to-do, both professional teachers that had their own home, a lot of land.</span> <span id="s422">This was outside of the city, and they had like a little shed in the garden.</span> <span id="s423">And I remember the very first night when we ran away, we slept there -- the two friends and my sister and I. And we could hear the shots coming out of the ghetto, which was some miles away.</span> <span id="s424">But the actual hiding was a private home where we were kept upstairs in the attic.</span> <span id="s425">And we had to be there, very quietly, when the father of the girls was at home, but when he went away to work, we were allowed to come down and have breakfast or sit in the kitchen and visit with them and so on.</span> <span id="s426">And also, what I found out when they were here two years ago visiting me, was that the reason why they told us they couldn’t keep us any longer…Apparently, at the same time they had, in their home, a very important member of the Polish underground -- a man who was from somewhere out of town.</span> <span id="s427">And he heard us.</span> <span id="s428">And he apparently knew what was going on, and he told the lady of the house, “I know whom you have here.</span> <span id="s429">This is very risky.</span> <span id="s430">You’re endangering not only yourself, but our whole organization.</span> <span id="s431">They have to go.</span> <span id="s432">If you won’t do it, I will.”</span> <span id="s433">And she just told us that we couldn’t stay any longer, and at that time we left for Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">R.S.</span> <span id="s435">When you first asked if you could hide in their home, were you afraid that maybe they might have gone and turned you in?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: When they told you to leave, what were your thoughts?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Well, I didn’t suspect it.</span> <span id="s439">I thought that they just couldn’t go on any longer, because the father didn’t know, and he was against it, and we knew at that time it was very risky for the Poles to do that.</span> <span id="s440">There was a death penalty for any Pole helping a Jew during the war.</span> <span id="s441">So we really didn’t expect to be there that long.</span> <span id="s442">It was just a temporary thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: So while you were in the attic hiding, you lived a normal life when he did go to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: While he was up there, while you were in the attic and he was home, were you restricted on any movement or talking…</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: Oh, definitely!</span> <span id="s447">(Laughter0</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: I want you to talk about that some.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: You couldn’t move, you couldn’t cough, you just had to be practically, completely frozen, because the attic was above the kitchen, and every move would be heard downstairs.</span> <span id="s450">And I’m sure that the mother and the two daughters tried to distract him, and if there was, by accident, some suspicious noise, they tried to, you know, get his attention from it.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">R.S.</span> <span id="s452">How much space was there?</span> <span id="s453">Could you stand up or was it just enough that you had to lie down flat?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: I don’t remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: It was a small area.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Yea.</span> <span id="s457">It was a small area.</span> <span id="s458">I think we could stand up.</span> <span id="s459">I don’t think we had to lie down, but there was nothing to sleep on.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Your sister was there?</span> <span id="s461">You were there?</span> <span id="s462">Was your mother in the attic too?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: No.</span> <span id="s464">We split up.</span> <span id="s465">There were four of us.</span> <span id="s466">My mother and my little brother were hiding out with other Polish friends, and my sister and myself were with them.</span> <span id="s467">And the original hope was that when the extermination commander was done, and left and went to the next city, father hoped that he would be able to add us on to the legally left group that was working for the Germans.</span> <span id="s468">So that’s why we originally hoped to just make it in the city, to wait it out, and then join him.</span> <span id="s469">In fact, he told us, “Don’t go to the main office in our town,” because people knew us too well.</span> <span id="s470">He said, “Go on foot.”</span> <span id="s471">He was directing all our moves.</span> <span id="s472">He made the plans for us.</span> <span id="s473">“Don’t take a train out, or a bus or whatever, go on foot to the next small town, and sign up.</span> <span id="s474">Show ‘em the papers, and…” They were looking very much for people to work in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">R.S.</span> <span id="s476">When your mother was caught, did you know where she was taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: She was taken to Treblinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Did you know what was happening there?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: We pretty well knew, yah.</span> <span id="s480">Towards the end people knew that Treblinka was just a place where there were crematoria, and just no one came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">R.S. Was your little brother with your mother when she was caught?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s483">It was a very sad story.</span> <span id="s484">She was with him together, and we kept in touch.</span> <span id="s485">Father was in the ghetto, working officially.</span> <span id="s486">So my mother sent my brother -- he was then maybe ten years old -- to the ghetto with some message, and he was supposed to come back and tell her what father said.</span> <span id="s487">And as he was coming back, some Polish kids recognized him, and started to run after him, and call him “Jew!”</span> <span id="s488">Jew!</span> <span id="s489">Jew!”</span> <span id="s490">And police followed, and he, in his big panic, went to where my mother was.</span> <span id="s491">So when the police came, they right away arrested her.</span> <span id="s492">But in the big commotion, she told him, ”Hide and run!”</span> <span id="s493">So he was able to escape and get away.</span> <span id="s494">They got her and took her to the main synagogue, which at that time, was the place where they were accumulating people, and sending them off to Treblinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Do you feel that the average Polish person knew what the death camps were early in the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Frankly, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: When did you understand them to be death camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Well that was during the war in the ghetto when we heard people talk about what was happening, and where they were going, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: That would have been in the early ‘40s?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: ’41, probably.</span> <span id="s501">We knew what was going on in the Warsaw ghetto -- the great extermination, the hunger, and the sending off people, and so on.</span> <span id="s502">But Treblinka and other places…I guess we did know about concentration camps before, because I remember when my uncle was arrested as a political leader, people were afraid that that’s where he will end up going, but he was released.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: You were hiding for a little bit.</span> <span id="s504">You were given false passports.</span> <span id="s505">Did you spend the rest of the war in Germany working?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: And at the end you just left Germany when the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: While the war was going on, did you have any encounter with gypsies, Jehovah’s Witnesses, homosexuals, any Soviet prisoners of war, or any baptized Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: No, none of those.</span> <span id="s511">I have seen prisoners of war, like French prisoners, and Czech, and I ran into a lot of nationalities, but I don’t remember seeing any gypsies.</span> <span id="s512">There were a lot of gypsies in Poland, but I don’t remember them in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Yourself.</span> <span id="s514">What did you witness, or what were you aware of, about any systematic killings, or fatalities from other causes?</span> <span id="s515">What did you witness as far as what the Germans did to the Jews?</span> <span id="s516">Any violent acts?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: Oh, yea.</span> <span id="s518">There were plenty.</span> <span id="s519">(Sardonic laughter).</span> <span id="s520">One, for example, I remember there was a very feared SS officer who would come to the ghetto every day or every other day with a huge German Shepherd dog, and let him loose on the Jewish children.</span> <span id="s521">And when you saw that guy, the street would immediately empty.</span> <span id="s522">Or he would go into the best bakery and just have the Jewish woman put a whole bunch of the best tortes and pastries, and the dog would eat.</span> <span id="s523">So, these things you could see all the time.</span> <span id="s524">Or just abuse and violence.</span> <span id="s525">My grandfather had a beautiful, white, clean beard, and for a long time he was afraid to walk, because Germans -- if they were more civilized and polite, they would take pictures of him, because he was so unique and unusual to them -- and other friends with beards would come back, beaten up, and the beard cut off, by them.</span> <span id="s526">And all kinds of just inhuman things.</span> <span id="s527">That was pretty much just a daily routine.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: How did that affect you?</span> <span id="s529">Did you become angry?</span> <span id="s530">Did you want to do something back?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s532">I remember when (laughter) I was a child, or a young teenager, I remember my parents were saying that I was talking in sleep.</span> <span id="s533">And shortly after the war broke out before we even left our regular place, I guess I was saying in the middle of the night, “Why?”</span> <span id="s534">and “What will happen?”</span> <span id="s535">and apparently, this expressed my resentment and my fear, but well, there was hatred!</span> <span id="s536">You saw a German or you heard a German walk, and you couldn’t stand the sight of them!</span> <span id="s537">But it wasn’t possible to think or plan any systematic resistance, to do anything against them.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: While you were “passing”, did you have any contact at that time with any Jews or relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: “Passing” for…</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: “Passing” once you were in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: Well we signed up and were included in a transport of Polish young people that were going to Germany.</span> <span id="s542">And we ended up in Thuringen which is in central Germany, in a big work camp that had hundreds and hundreds of -- there was one camp for men, one for women -- we were in the camp for women -- and they were from all over Europe.</span> <span id="s543">My sister and I had different passports, but there was resemblance, so we couldn’t say we were strangers, so for a while we were saying we were cousins.</span> <span id="s544">And we could see, with each new transport, there were one or two girls that looked to us, like they were just like we were.</span> <span id="s545">They were not Polish, they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s546">And I was telling my sister that the situation is getting risky.</span> <span id="s547">We should get out of there while we can.</span> <span id="s548">And we did.</span> <span id="s549">We got caught, but then we made it again.</span> <span id="s550">We got out of there.</span> <span id="s551">And apparently after we got arrested, the other Polish women openly were saying, “These two cousins were not Polish.</span> <span id="s552">They are Jewish.”</span> <span id="s553">So is that what you meant?</span> <span id="s554">That’s what you asked me?</span> <span id="s555">This was the contact, where we could spot other Jewish women, but we tried to avoid them.</span> <span id="s556">They were avoiding us.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Were there ever any attempts of secretly, that you could meet one another, try to establish some kind of…</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Well, no.</span> <span id="s559">There were a few incidents that I remember during Christmas time.</span> <span id="s560">They celebrated in the camp, and part of the custom, as you break off a piece of the -- I don’t remember how you call it, but it’s a special Christmas bread -- and you wish each other a good year, and the girl that gave it to me, I broke it off, and she whispered in my ear, ”You broke off too big a piece.”</span> <span id="s561">She was Jewish and I didn’t know, and she was just giving me a very quick advice.</span> <span id="s562">Then when we ran away and got caught and were brought back to the camp -- she worked on a different shift, so she was in the camp in the daytime when we came -- she told us, “Run, run.</span> <span id="s563">Ever since you were caught, everybody in the camp was saying you are Jewish.</span> <span id="s564">You cannot be here another minute.”</span> <span id="s565">So we ran away.</span> <span id="s566">These were the contacts, you know.</span> <span id="s567">She didn’t say, “I’m Jewish, too,” but it was obvious.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">R.S.</span> <span id="s569">What kind of work did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: We worked in a factory that was manufacturing great road machinery, and big…</span></p> <p><span id="s571">R.S.</span> <span id="s572">Did they make weapons, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: This particular one did not make weapons.</span> <span id="s574">I happened to work in the office.</span> <span id="s575">I had German in gymnasium before the war, so my German to them, was quite valuable, so I was put in better work.</span> <span id="s576">Oh, what’s also interesting, in that factory, the German workers, the German men, some of them were very friendly to us.</span> <span id="s577">We suspected that they knew we were Jewish -- they were either communists or socialists -- but they invited us to their homes, they gave us clothes.</span> <span id="s578">The wives gave us food, shoes, things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Did anybody ever say, on the job, “You’re Jewish?”</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: No.</span> <span id="s581">Well, yes!</span> <span id="s582">After we ran away from the factory, we went south and ended up working in a hotel in Regensburg, and I remember I was cleaning a big room after a big meeting -- this was the main hotel for the city that had all the high ranking German military people -- and as I was cleaning, he called me over, and he said, “Where are you from?”</span> <span id="s583">And I told him.</span> <span id="s584">And he said, “Did you have any Jews in your family?”</span> <span id="s585">(Everyone laughs) Just like that.</span> <span id="s586">No warning, nothing!</span> <span id="s587">I was shocked, but I pretended I’m offended!</span> <span id="s588">I said, “What do you mean!</span> <span id="s589">I’m Polish!</span> <span id="s590">I never had -- not as far as I know!”</span> <span id="s591">And he said, “Well, the reason I’m asking, is that,” he said, “I’m in anthropology.</span> <span id="s592">I’m interested in the shape of your head.”</span> <span id="s593">(laughter) I remember at that time I had my hair behind my ears, so my ears were showing.</span> <span id="s594">Ever since then I have covered them.</span> <span id="s595">(laughter) He apparently was looking at me from the profile.</span> <span id="s596">He said, ‘Your ears and your whole structure of your face, there must have been some Jews in your family, because there’s a lot of resemblance to Jews.”</span> <span id="s597">So I just exchanged a few words with him, and left.</span> <span id="s598">I said, “I’m too busy.</span> <span id="s599">I don’t have time.</span> <span id="s600">And I don’t know of any Jews.”</span> <span id="s601">But I remember, I went to my sister, and I said, “Well, let’s be prepared.</span> <span id="s602">This man said such and such a thing to me, and something might happen.”</span> <span id="s603">But it didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">R.S. Was your sister older than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: Younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">R.S.</span> <span id="s607">How much younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: Two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: Do you recall any specific units of the Nazi police or the German Army?</span> <span id="s610">Any particular numbers that they might have had?</span> <span id="s611">Division numbers?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: No.</span> <span id="s613">I remember different groups.</span> <span id="s614">One was strictly military Germans, and the other ones were the SS.</span> <span id="s615">They were the real Nazis, the people that were doing all the atrocities.</span> <span id="s616">And there was a difference between them, because SS were all just tyrannical, and inhumane, while the German soldiers, once in a while, you could run into someone who seemed decent, or just, really, not comfortable with what they were doing.</span> <span id="s617">But after we were in the ghetto, there was hardly any contact with them – except for these scary visits.</span> <span id="s618">They came and knocked on peoples’ doors and just…although, even most of these things were done by the Jewish police.</span> <span id="s619">The Jewish Council had their own Jewish police that had to round up people and just…</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: And give them to the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: Yea.</span> <span id="s622">There was a lot of bad feelings.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Do you think they did it under the guise: If they don’t do it, they’re going to go themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Going a little bit towards the end of the war -- or when the war was over -- you were in Germany at that point.</span> <span id="s626">Did you know that Germany was losing the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s628">By that time -- too bad my father didn’t see what an avid paper reader I turned out to be, because he was always so interested in politics, and couldn’t understand why I didn’t read papers --– well I followed it very carefully, and I knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s629">And I knew that Germans were retreating in Russia and that after D-Day, when the western nations attacked, so it was just a matter of time.</span> <span id="s630">I was scrubbing the basement floor when I heard the great, “happy” news --on their radio -- that Roosevelt died.</span> <span id="s631">And they said, “That’s it.</span> <span id="s632">The war will turn around and we will win.”</span> <span id="s633">It was just a few weeks before we were liberated!</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: Let’s talk a little bit about the liberation.</span> <span id="s635">Did the war end for you when soldiers came into your town?</span> <span id="s636">American or Russian soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: American soldiers, yea.</span> <span id="s638">The war ended on April 27, 1945.</span> <span id="s639">And before that, for maybe a week or so, the city was being shelled by heavy artillery.</span> <span id="s640">It was bombed before, so there was chaos, and you could see for months, retreating German soldiers, coming from east and west, and just sleeping everywhere -- in hallways -- and wounded and it was very obvious that they were collapsing.</span> <span id="s641">At that time -- I remember the owner of the hotel where I worked was a very aristocratic family, and they had coffee every day, and I was the one that would bring the coffee in -- and when I came in, they would stop talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Which town were you in?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: In Regensburg, near Munich, north of Munich.</span> <span id="s644">And once I overheard them saying, “Well, we know it’s over with.</span> <span id="s645">Let’s hope that we don’t get the Russians, that we get the Americans to liberate us,” so it was pretty obvious that they just losing, and it was a matter of time.</span> <span id="s646">And we all hoped that it wouldn’t be the Russians that would come to liberate us.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: You hoped that, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: When the Americans came into town, was it at that point that you felt liberated, or had many of the German units left the city already?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Well, when the shelling was becoming very heavy, we all hid out.</span> <span id="s651">And we hid out with Polish friends that even then didn’t know that we were Jews.</span> <span id="s652">That was also interesting.</span> <span id="s653">There was a small group of Jewish men that were wearing concentration camp outfits.</span> <span id="s654">There was one unit of Jewish concentration camp inmates that were brought to the city to clean up the debris of the bombing of the main railroad station.</span> <span id="s655">They were walking by the hotel, and I remember every day when I knew they were coming, I looked at them in hope that maybe I see my father there.</span> <span id="s656">And the last few days before the city was liberated, we all hid out in a hospital -- in the basement.</span> <span id="s657">And the concentration camp Jews were there, too.</span> <span id="s658">And at one point I wanted to go and visit with them, and see who’s there.</span> <span id="s659">And my Polish friends, one of my Polish friends, said, “Don’t go to them!</span> <span id="s660">They’re Jews!</span> <span id="s661">Didn’t you know that?”</span> <span id="s662">So I didn’t go.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: How soon after the Americans came in did you start admitting to other people you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: Well, (laughs) this was interesting.</span> <span id="s665">How could we tell that the war was over -- it got quiet.</span> <span id="s666">There was no more shelling, and just a very, very unusual quiet over the city.</span> <span id="s667">And people started to go out, out of the hiding, and could see that the Germans are gone and the Americans are there!</span> <span id="s668">And we went out too, and there were truckfulls of American soldiers driving through the city and shouting, “Hitler kaput!”</span> <span id="s669">and “Fraulein!”</span> <span id="s670">and throwing cigarettes and throwing candy!</span> <span id="s671">I resented them being so friendly to the German population, because I remember when the Germans came and occupied us, it was a completely different picture.</span> <span id="s672">When the Germans soldiers walked in, into that town, the way they walked, the way they looked and behaved was sheer terror, the boots and the stomping and the big rifles.</span> <span id="s673">And one thing I couldn’t believe was the American soldiers looked like kids!</span> <span id="s674">Like just civilians.</span> <span id="s675">They had very soft-soled shoes.</span> <span id="s676">You couldn’t hear them walk!</span> <span id="s677">There was no terror when you saw soldiers that walked just like civilians!</span> <span id="s678">And so they were right away very friendly to the population, and very nice, and even the Germans responded to them with friendliness.</span> <span id="s679">And yes, right away.</span> <span id="s680">I wanted to make sure that I go back to my original identity.</span> <span id="s681">We seeked out the CIC, the military intelligence, and I remember I talked to one man who was German-speaking -- they placed, in those positions, Americans that knew German – I remember I told that man who I am, how I survived, and this is my paper, but it’s false, I like to go back to my original name, and I’m Jewish, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Did he interrogate you at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: Right!</span> <span id="s684">This man was very unsympathetic!</span> <span id="s685">And it was a very scary experience!</span> <span id="s686">He began to quiz me and ask me, “Where did you get the false paper?</span> <span id="s687">You know that’s not legal!”</span> <span id="s688">And, “who are you?</span> <span id="s689">’” and so on.</span> <span id="s690">And I was just frightened, and very disappointed!</span> <span id="s691">And he told me, come back the next day.</span> <span id="s692">So we came back the next day, and we ran into someone completely different!</span> <span id="s693">And that man was apparently a Jew, because it was a completely different approach!</span> <span id="s694">He was so excited, and he was so happy to run into two Jewish girls that survived the war.</span> <span id="s695">He asked me, “What can I do for you?</span> <span id="s696">Where did you work?</span> <span id="s697">Do they owe you money?</span> <span id="s698">Can I do anything for you?”</span> <span id="s699">And I said, “Well, we like a couple of suitcases.</span> <span id="s700">We’d like to go back to Poland and see who survived the war.”</span> <span id="s701">And he asked me, “How were you treated?”</span> <span id="s702">And I told him that the owner of the hotel was not very nice.</span> <span id="s703">She sent me to Gestapo at one point, and so on.</span> <span id="s704">So he sent for her right away, and put her in jail, because of us.</span> <span id="s705">So it was unbelievable to see two American official people that responded like day and night to us.</span> <span id="s706">Well, he was taking care of us, and tried to help us, and so on, and then he was transferred.</span> <span id="s707">We never saw him again.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: As far as other family members, who survived the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: My sister, myself, and my little brother.</span> <span id="s710">My father was in Buchenwald and he perished a day before they were liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: How did you find that out?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: My brother was with him and he said how it happened.</span> <span id="s713">He was in a special barrack for young children that were treated a little better -- better food and so on --and my father just knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s714">They listened to radio -- illegal radio -- and he knew.</span> <span id="s715">In fact, he told my uncle, he said, “Well, we made it.</span> <span id="s716">We made it through the war.”</span> <span id="s717">And he knew where we were because we were corresponding with my father in Poland through these Polish friends.</span> <span id="s718">We’d write letters to them, and they would deliver it to him, and vice versa.</span> <span id="s719">He would send letters through them to us.</span> <span id="s720">So he knew where we were.</span> <span id="s721">He thought that he already made it, and just a few hours before they -- my brother was hiding him -- and he just ran out to, I guess, look for a paper or listen to a radio or something and got caught, and took off, and we never knew where and what.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: After the war, did you go back to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: Did you go back to your town, mainly to find out who survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: And how long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Oh, maybe a couple of months.</span> <span id="s728">It was in the summer of ’45.</span> <span id="s729">The only person we found was that uncle and his daughter, and we brought them to Germany, and never went back again.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: How long were you in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: I was in Germany until 1950, to when we immigrated to the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: Was there any question in your mind between, let’s say, choosing the United States or Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s734">There was.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: Tell me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: I was a student at the university over there in Munich, in Germany, and the Jewish students had an organization, and we were quite interested in what was going on in Israel.</span> <span id="s737">In fact, I remember when Israel was declared independent, it was a big…</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: What organization were you in?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: In 1948, it wasn’t a political organization, it was an organization of Jewish students, survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Did it have a name of any kind?</span> <span id="s741">Do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: I guess it was the Jewish Organization of Students in Munich.</span> <span id="s743">It was supported by the Joint.</span> <span id="s744">It was nothing political.</span> <span id="s745">But people were discussing it all the time, and trying to make a choice, and I was thinking about Israel, seriously, but my sister was married, and she came here, and my uncle came here, and it was just more-or-less family ties.</span> <span id="s746">I hated to be separated, so I came here, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: Did the other family members come to Minnesota?</span> <span id="s748">How did you arrive here/</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: Well, there weren’t too many family members.</span> <span id="s750">There was my sister, myself, uncle and his daughter.</span> <span id="s751">The uncle had a sister in Milwaukee that lived here for 20 or 30 years and had established a family, so she brought him over -- him and his daughter.</span> <span id="s752">And then we tried to be close to where he is.</span> <span id="s753">My sister came first.</span> <span id="s754">I was there in medical school and I wanted to finish, so I stayed on.</span> <span id="s755">So she came here first, and then I followed.</span> <span id="s756">We didn’t know…</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: That was Minneapolis then?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: Right.</span> <span id="s759">We came right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Did you finish medical school?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Are you practicing as a doctor now?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: Where do you practice?</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: I’m an ophthalmologist.</span> <span id="s766">I work at a Columbia Heights office.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s768">I want you to tell me, a little about how the people who were hiding you, how they came here, and what happened the last couple of years when you did bring them to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: Well, when the war was over, we went back to Poland to see who survived.</span> <span id="s770">We didn’t find too many people.</span> <span id="s771">We visited with our friends.</span> <span id="s772">Their mother was in a concentration camp, herself.</span> <span id="s773">Her underground activities were discovered -- the Polish underground activities -- and she was in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s774">One of the sisters was on the Gestapo (list) and almost exterminated at Warsaw, but she was saved.</span> <span id="s775">We came back to Germany, but we kept in touch.</span> <span id="s776">We corresponded all the time, and I was sending them packages and medicine -- one of the sisters developed T.B.</span> <span id="s777">They are still very deep patriots.</span> <span id="s778">I get letters from them all the time, even now.</span> <span id="s779">So we kept in touch, and I felt that I wanted to do something to show my appreciation for what they did for us and the risk they took.</span> <span id="s780">I brought them over here, and I had Yad Vashem issue a certificate of gratitude and a medal for them, and the ceremony was performed at the Israeli Consulate in New York.</span> <span id="s781">And they were also honored by Rabbi Goodman in our synagogue (Adath Jeshurun) they were present at one Friday night sermon.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: Did you have much contact with them after the war, or was it really just intermittent?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: Well it was steady, but not very frequent.</span> <span id="s784">Like I would send a package a couple of times a year, and we would write maybe four or five times a year, exchange letters and pictures and so on.</span> <span id="s785">So we kept in touch, but it wasn’t anything very, very frequent.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">R.S. Can I go back and ask a question?</span> <span id="s787">When you went back to Poland and then you went back to Germany to study, what was the climate of the people like then?</span> <span id="s788">Was there still underlying anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: (Laughter) That’s a good question!</span> <span id="s790">The medical school was overcrowded, because during the years of the war, I guess they couldn’t go on, and a lot of German students -- men -- were in the war.</span> <span id="s791">So when the war ended, there was a great influx, and there were hundreds of students, and they were all crowded.</span> <span id="s792">And the Jewish students resented it very much that we had to be together with them, because they were all, you know, just out of the Front, and we felt that they were doing terrible things to us, and here we are sitting on the same bench and listening to the same professor.</span> <span id="s793">So we kept to ourselves, although we had to be together with them.</span> <span id="s794">But there was a definite coolness, and a definite distrust.</span> <span id="s795">There was one incident that I remember.</span> <span id="s796">It was very shocking.</span> <span id="s797">It was a psychiatry class, and the professor presented a patient, a schizophrenic or whatever the woman’s problem was, and he was going to demonstrate how her thinking is distorted, and so on, and he started to ask her something, and she just came out with anti-Semitic…just tirades!</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: This was the doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: This was the patient that was interviewed by the German professor of psychiatry in front of hundreds of students, mostly German, and some of us Jewish students, together.</span> <span id="s800">And the woman said, “All these Jews are buying out our best chicken.</span> <span id="s801">They get all the good food.</span> <span id="s802">They just have everything.”</span> <span id="s803">And all the hundreds of German students were applauding1 And whistling!</span> <span id="s804">And yelling!</span> <span id="s805">And this was 1945 or ’46.</span> <span id="s806">Way after the war.</span> <span id="s807">They were defeated, you know, so…</span></p> <p><span id="s808">R.S. Were there still, like small groups, of what you might call at that point, neo-Nazis -- or do you think they were trying to re-establish or keep struggling?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A:” Well, we didn’t trust most of them, because whenever you talked to a German, they all said, “Oh!</span> <span id="s810">We didn’t know anything about it!</span> <span id="s811">And that’s terrible!”</span> <span id="s812">and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s813">But it was very difficult to believe.</span> <span id="s814">You could tell that some were genuinely sorry, but the majority just…and another thing, too, that they all said, “Well, I had nothing to do with it.”</span> <span id="s815">But I also remember there was a very outstanding anatomy professor that was just a very known and famous man, and he would lecture, and one day he didn’t show up, and we asked, “Where is Professor von So-and-so?”</span> <span id="s816">Oh, he got arrested.</span> <span id="s817">He was a Nazi active.</span> <span id="s818">He won’t be teaching anymore.</span> <span id="s819">Here is his substitute.”</span> <span id="s820">(laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: Let’s talk a little about Judaism and how your thoughts might have changed after the war.</span> <span id="s822">You saw what happened to the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s823">Because of what happened to you and what you witnessed, did your faith in God diminish at all?</span> <span id="s824">Do you still consider yourself a believer after you saw what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: Well, (sigh).</span> <span id="s826">I was never very religious in the sense of a person that had religious beliefs.</span> <span id="s827">I don’t know how to express it.</span> <span id="s828">I had my own feelings, but we didn’t have a kosher home, and I didn’t especially go with the established religious.</span> <span id="s829">Well, to answer your question, it did not change, really.</span> <span id="s830">It did not make me a disbeliever while before I was a believer.</span> <span id="s831">I still believed in the human race, and I still thought that this was a terrible thing, but it doesn’t mean that everybody’s like that, and that the world will be like that again.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: Do you have any contact now with the Jewish community, besides the synagogue, to be involved in?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: Oh yes, definitely.</span> <span id="s834">Most of our friends are Jewish.</span> <span id="s835">We moved to St. Louis Park so that the kids would grow up in a Jewish surrounding.</span> <span id="s836">They went to Talmud Torah.</span> <span id="s837">And we are extremely interested in what’s going on in Israel.</span> <span id="s838">So we are “good” Jews, even though we don’t feel that in order to be a good Jew you have to be a very practicing Jew.</span> <span id="s839">In fact, in Poland, there were a lot of very devoted Jews that had very little to do with the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: As far as contact with other survivors or survivor organizations after the war, what did you do with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: Well we were a very active part of the student body in Munich.</span> <span id="s842">It was the largest group of surviving youth in Europe.</span> <span id="s843">Germany was a place where a lot of survivors of other nations, and Jews, too, concentrated.</span> <span id="s844">And Munich happened to be the largest center.</span> <span id="s845">So we kept in touch the five or six years that we were there.</span> <span id="s846">When I came to Minneapolis there was a small organization of survivors, that somehow fell apart, but informally we do meet with survivors.</span> <span id="s847">We have a lot of friends that used to go to school with me, together in Chicago.</span> <span id="s848">They have a very active group, but it’s more just close friends or professional ties, rather than specifically a survivor or political orientation.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: As far as your thoughts now about Germans.</span> <span id="s850">Do you have a very negative feel towards people who say they are Germans, or do you differentiate between the German leaders and the German people?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: No.</span> <span id="s852">It’s difficult for me to make a blanket statement that all Germans are no good, and they are Nazis, and so on.</span> <span id="s853">I remember there were instances when I was there working and pretending not to be a Jew, and scared of being found out -- I was mixing with German people, with the population -- and I witnessed several scenes where they were very moving to me.</span> <span id="s854">And I felt for the German people what they are going through.</span> <span id="s855">I remember…</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: You mean the suffering they were…</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s858">I remember we got together in a factory for a coffee break, and one German mother was just in tears because she got a letter from her son, that he got wounded in the war, or something like that.</span> <span id="s859">And it was very painful to witness, and she was talking about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s861">Tell me how you met your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: Oh, okay.</span> <span id="s863">(Laughter) We met in Munich after the war.</span> <span id="s864">He’s an electrical engineer, so he was studying in a technical college, and I was in medical school.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: How soon after the war did you get married then”</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: Well, we got married here in 1950, after we were done with our studies.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: Can you tell me, with a deep feeling, what it means to be a survivor?</span> <span id="s868">Is it a special type of person?</span> <span id="s869">Do you feel you survived to have a mission now?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: (Laughs) Well, I think to me, it seems like a combination of things.</span> <span id="s871">First of all was this very strong will to make it -- not to give in -- and do something to survive.</span> <span id="s872">And the other one was just circumstances and luck, and so on.</span> <span id="s873">Every so often I think about it, but I think it’s difficult to say.</span> <span id="s874">It’s probably a combination of things.</span> <span id="s875">You had to have the will and the desire and the drive, and then the conditions had to be such that it became possible, because there were a lot of people that wanted to survive, and never made it,</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: So a lot of it was luck, but the under-riding thing was the strong will.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: Well, first you had to have the will and the drive and the persistence and it took some planning, and to be quick with it.</span> <span id="s878">There were several instances where I was almost caught, and just, by a quick presence of mind…I was taken to Gestapo, and they found something on me that I didn’t know I had, some papers that showed I ran away from another place, and they asked me what it is, and I just in a couple seconds came up with an excuse.</span> <span id="s879">So there were close calls.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: In the world today, there are some people going around the country who are listened to, saying that the Holocaust didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s881">How would you respond to someone like that/</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: It’s just frightening to hear something like that.</span> <span id="s883">And everything has to be done to prove it to the world.</span> <span id="s884">These people are vicious.</span> <span id="s885">I don’t think they’re ignorant, I think they’re just plain vicious.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: The way the Holocaust’s being portrayed now through television shows.</span> <span id="s887">Do you feel that is a valid interpretation?</span> <span id="s888">Is it being glorified in any way?</span> <span id="s889">What do you think should be brought out?</span> <span id="s890">if you were to sit with somebody who is young right now and say that this happened to you, and they say to you, “How and why did this happen?”</span> <span id="s891">What would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: You mean the whole Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: Why it happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: What would you say to a young child who is Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: Well (laughter) that happened because the Nazis and Hitler succeeded in getting his terrible, crazy ideas across to the German people, forcing them into doing what he wanted them to do.</span> <span id="s897">And it’s hard to believe now, but I guess there were all kinds of conditions that made it possible for him to achieve what he did and for the war to go along with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: Let’s talk about conditions for a minute.</span> <span id="s899">Do you see any kind of parallel between what happened then, and what’s happening here now, as far as the economics -- the way people are thinking -- becoming more conservative?</span> <span id="s900">Can a Holocaust happen here?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: Well, it’s possible.</span> <span id="s902">I think it is possible, given the right circumstances and combination of things.</span> <span id="s903">It’s probably not nearly as possible as it was in Poland where there were always anti-Semitic elements, or in Germany where the regime was so very fanatically anti-Jewish.</span> <span id="s904">It might not be as easy, but I would say it is not impossible for us here.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: Do you see any correlation, let’s say, between the right wing of Jerry Falwell to the Nazi party?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: How do you see a similarity?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: Well, it’s the same -- the same narrow minded and self -righteous and hateful group of people that’s trying to impose their philosophy on the rest of the population.</span> <span id="s909">All they lack now, that Hitler didn’t, is the power to terrorize the rest of the population.</span> <span id="s910">It’s one thing to have a political view, and it’s another thing to have the power to force the rest of the population to do what you want them to do.</span> <span id="s911">It usually takes only a small number of people to terrorize the large nation, or large group of people.</span> <span id="s912">That’s what happened there.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">R.S. Will the same thing follow, though, and encompass a large number of people?</span> <span id="s914">Is the psychology, is it right for it?</span> <span id="s915">Do you think they would need the terrorism?</span> <span id="s916">Or maybe just the psychology?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s918">Psychology alone, I don’t think, would do it.</span> <span id="s919">It takes organization.</span> <span id="s920">You have to subdue a lot of people that are maybe either slightly sympathetic or neutral or even against you, but they’re afraid of speaking up and doing anything different.</span> <span id="s921">I think that’s the way it happened in Germany.</span> <span id="s922">There were a lot of decent Germans that were just afraid for their own skin, and they went along with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: In the last few months, there have been articles published that Roosevelt, and many other people who were high in the United States government, knew of the concentration camps, and they chose not to bomb the railways.</span> <span id="s924">Their rationale was that it wasn’t important for us to bomb this.</span> <span id="s925">We should concentrate on the military, or whatever.</span> <span id="s926">What kind of thoughts do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: I think it was wrong.</span> <span id="s928">It was very wrong.</span> <span id="s929">This country was very powerful, very strong -- it’s true, they were fighting the war and they were trying to get Hitler in a military way, to subdue him -- but if they knew, which I understand they did, it would have taken very little extra effort to save a lot of Jews.</span> <span id="s930">Jews were being shipped for hundreds of miles in trains, across countries.</span> <span id="s931">All it would have taken was a few bombs thrown in some strategic places.</span> <span id="s932">They could have thrown that plan into disarray, and liberated a lot of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: As a person who has experienced this, to a young Jew who’s growing up…</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: Like my kids?</span> <span id="s935">(Laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: Like your kids.</span> <span id="s937">Do they have the knowledge of what you experienced?</span> <span id="s938">Have you sat down with them?</span> <span id="s939">And when you sat down with them, the first time, was this one of the hardest things you could tell them?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: Well we were talking about it.</span> <span id="s941">When the children were small and were at home, it was hard for me to talk about it, because it was very painful, it was very fresh.</span> <span id="s942">As my daughter said, “We hated to ask you because whenever you started to talk about it, you would cry, and we hated to see you cry, so we just never brought it up.”</span> <span id="s943">And now later, as things became less difficult to talk about, the children grew up and they were away at school, colleges.</span> <span id="s944">Now we do talk about it, but we don’t formally plan a session and sit down and say, ‘Well, this is the hour we will spend on Holocaust, and ask me and I will answer you.”</span> <span id="s945">It just happens.</span> <span id="s946">In a daily routine, something comes up that brings back a memory, or they ask.</span> <span id="s947">That’s how we talk about it, in a way that’s more or less spontaneous, not really planned.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: This is the 11th of August.</span> <span id="s949">1982.</span> <span id="s950">This is tape two with Mrs. Zimering.</span> <span id="s951">What I would like to do, maybe before we get into the tape, is review these articles.</span> <span id="s952">Why don’t you just explain them.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: Alright.</span> <span id="s954">This snapshot is of the two Polish friends of mine who were visiting in Minneapolis in ’79.</span> <span id="s955">They are Danuta and Maria.</span> <span id="s956">Right now the younger one is a medical doctor, the older one is an accountant.</span> <span id="s957">These are the two people that saved my life by giving me the false documents and hiding me out in their own home for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: In the years that preceded the war, how much communication did you have with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: Well, when we were small children, we grew up playing together.</span> <span id="s960">We lived not too far from each other.</span> <span id="s961">And then during grade school years, their mother was my teacher.</span> <span id="s962">But then when we went to gymnasium, I went to a Jewish gymnasium, they went to a Polish, and the contact was not quite as close as before.</span> <span id="s963">But we still kept in touch.</span> <span id="s964">We visited each other, and during the summer in the country.</span> <span id="s965">And then of course, when the war broke out, we just reached out to them as the only ones that we felt we could trust and hope for help, and they came through.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">R.S: And there was no hesitancy on their part?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: What about your contact after the war?</span> <span id="s969">Had you seen them?</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: After the war, in 1945, I went back to Poland to look for survivors.</span> <span id="s971">I hoped that my father survived, I hoped to find more family.</span> <span id="s972">And I did go to their home, and I did visit with them, but this was in late summer of 1945.</span> <span id="s973">It was a very short visit.</span> <span id="s974">Their mother, who was my teacher -- she ended up in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s975">In fact, they all were.</span> <span id="s976">Their job during the war, the younger one was smuggling information between various fighting groups of underground Polish, and the older one was smuggling weapons.</span> <span id="s977">In fact, when they were here, they told me that several times the mission took them right near the Warsaw ghetto, and they were going by on a street car, and they could see the ruins and the terrible despair.</span> <span id="s978">And she said, “We just couldn’t look.</span> <span id="s979">We just had to keep going.”</span> <span id="s980">So anyway, she was caught by Gestapo and was in jail and she was pretty close to being executed.</span> <span id="s981">Lucky for her, the war ended, and she was free.</span> <span id="s982">But what happened was, she came down with T.B. And shortly after the war, we re-established contact.</span> <span id="s983">I was in Germany.</span> <span id="s984">I wrote to them.</span> <span id="s985">And I was sending them packages and medication, and we kept in touch ever since</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: So it was your idea for them to come to visit you?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: Well, yah.</span> <span id="s988">How the whole thing started was, the older sister’s son spent a year at M.I.T. as post graduate.</span> <span id="s989">He’s an engineer.</span> <span id="s990">And my son was at Harvard then, and they got together, and we met him there at my son Mark’s graduation.</span> <span id="s991">And this somehow opened up my eyes.</span> <span id="s992">If her son can be here, why couldn’t the mother and the sister come?</span> <span id="s993">And that’s how we got started.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s995">What did you feel when you saw them at the graduation?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s997">I saw the son.</span> <span id="s998">The boy was born after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: When they did come here, how did you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: Well, it was…it was…it was very moving.</span> <span id="s1001">Of course we all looked different (laughing).</span> <span id="s1002">When they got off the plane, well, they called me from New York.</span> <span id="s1003">There was a whole complication.</span> <span id="s1004">Whoever was going to pick them up didn’t show up, so my son went there.</span> <span id="s1005">They couldn’t communicate.</span> <span id="s1006">He didn’t speak Polish, they didn’t speak English.</span> <span id="s1007">But when they got here, it was…very moving.</span> <span id="s1008">And I found out a lot of things that I didn’t know during the war, what they were involved with.</span> <span id="s1009">Like why they were able to supply us with the papers.</span> <span id="s1010">Came out now that they were in the Polish underground, and they themselves were on false papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: And the father had no knowledge of what was going on…</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: Well, the father knew that the mother and the daughters are in it, and he was very much against.</span> <span id="s1013">He was very afraid.</span> <span id="s1014">In fact they told me that the mother always told him, “Don’t worry.</span> <span id="s1015">If they come for me, I will tell them you had nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s1016">So you’re not in any danger.”</span> <span id="s1017">And sure enough, one night,, the Gestapo did come and arrested mother, and they didn’t touch him.</span> <span id="s1018">They apparently had good enough information to know who was involved and who was not.</span> <span id="s1019">And the daughters were already hiding out because they were warned, so they weren’t caught then.</span> <span id="s1020">So they went through a lot themselves.</span> <span id="s1021">In fact, I just sent off a package again to them, and the son, an engineer, wrote me a postcard from France -- he’s at a meeting -- and he says, “That’s the only time we can write freely.”</span> <span id="s1022">Apparently the two sisters are active in Solidarity!</span> <span id="s1023">(laughter) In the underground movement!</span> <span id="s1024">So they…no matter what comes!</span> <span id="s1025">(laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">R.S. It’s in their blood.</span> <span id="s1027">(laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1029">They loved this country.</span> <span id="s1030">They were very impressed, but they said, “Our place is Poland.</span> <span id="s1031">This is our country, and we have to help it the best we can.”</span> <span id="s1032">So we were just lucky to have had, for friends, such unusual human beings as they were.</span> <span id="s1033">At that time, they were only children, so they did whatever their mother decided should be done, but she was quite exceptional.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: It’s quite a role model for them.</span> <span id="s1035">When the war was going on…any more you’d like to tell about the family that was hiding you, or what happened to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: Well one thing that came out that I didn’t realize, also, was that when things were getting very, very crucial, during the liquidation of the ghetto, apparently, my mother came to their mother, and begged her to save us!</span> <span id="s1037">(a short break to regain composure)…This always happens, But anyway, what they said, they had an older brother who was an epileptic, a very sick child.</span> <span id="s1038">And before the war, they had a special maid that watched over the boy.</span> <span id="s1039">And we played together in a park that was close to our business, and whenever the boy got an attack of epilepsy, the young maid couldn’t handle that, so our mother came and helped out.</span> <span id="s1040">So apparently, their mother felt very indebted and very thankful to her.</span> <span id="s1041">And she told her girls that, “I have to help her, for what she has done for me.”</span> <span id="s1042">So that’s how she took the risk, and hid us out, and did all the things she did for us.</span> <span id="s1043">That’s something I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1044">I had no idea.</span> <span id="s1045">It just came out during their visit here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: How long ago was the visit?</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: In October of ’79.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1049">Tell me what happened when they did come here.</span> <span id="s1050">There were some newspaper articles written, also.</span> <span id="s1051">Maybe we can go over that a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1053">Well, when they came, it was strictly for a private visit, a reunion between us, and for them to have a chance to get out of Poland, and have a vacation.</span> <span id="s1054">But I talked to Rabbi Goodman about it, and he was very interested in it, and he said, “Why don’t you bring them over for a Friday evening service, and we will honor them in front of the whole congregation.”</span> <span id="s1055">We did that.</span> <span id="s1056">And it was a very moving occasion.</span> <span id="s1057">I have this little writing from the synagogue paper.</span> <span id="s1058">Rabbi Goodman took my letter to Yad Vashem when he was there on a trip.</span> <span id="s1059">And I reported to Yad Vashem about what they had done, and I asked for recognition.</span> <span id="s1060">And Yad Vashem had a meeting, and they approved, and they sent out a certificate and a medal that they were given in a very official ceremony at the New York Israeli Consulate.</span> <span id="s1061">I wanted them there, because our children were out east, and I wanted to make sure that they meet the children and my children meet them.</span> <span id="s1062">And this was written up in several Jewish papers, and English papers.</span> <span id="s1063">Some friends of mine in Israel were sending me clippings, little notices about it, even in Israel, because unfortunately, there weren’t too many instances like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: So what they did, you feel was something that happened on a very exceptional level.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1066">In fact, one of the reporters that was present at the New York ceremony was a Polish reporter from a Polish press, and he apparently forwarded the news to Poland.</span> <span id="s1067">And when they came back, they were big heroes!</span> <span id="s1068">They were written up in Polish papers.</span> <span id="s1069">The news was on T.V. and their husbands said, “At home we were getting phone calls, and telegrams!”</span> <span id="s1070">(laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: Have they told anybody, before the publicity, what they had done?</span> <span id="s1072">Or was it a secret?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: Well, that’s a good question.</span> <span id="s1074">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1075">I remember after, I think it was the ’67 War -- I think she came up with the idea -- where Israeli representatives were in Poland, and they were honoring some Polish people like they were, for saving Jews.</span> <span id="s1076">And she was sending me the clippings -- one of the sisters.</span> <span id="s1077">And I guess that’s how she got the idea, and I got the idea, that we could somehow bring this into the open.</span> <span id="s1078">But I don’t know whether they were privately talking to their friends about it, or just keeping it quiet.</span> <span id="s1079">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: Let’s talk a little about the article that was written.</span> <span id="s1081">Was it in the synagogue newspaper?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: Yea,</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: Maybe that could even be read into the record.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: So much red tape before they allowed them to come here!</span> <span id="s1085">Well, this is just a short article, and it’s really good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: The article is from the Clarion publication of Adath Jeshurun Synagogue as of October 17, 1979.</span> <span id="s1087">And it says: “Yad Vashem Letter Lauds Aides of Polish Friends.</span> <span id="s1088">On Saturday evening, October 19, two Polish sisters who were instrumental in saving Dr. Sabina Zimering and members of her family during the Holocaust, will be at Shabbat Eve services.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Below is Sabina Zimering’s letter:</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Dear Rabbi Goodman, The following is a Summary of a letter I sent to Yad Yashem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Mrs. Danula Trybus, a 56 year-old accountant and Maria Spiewak, a 54 year-old medical doctor, of Pi0trkow, Poland, are two sisters who were my childhood friends, and their mother my grade school teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">In 1942, when we were threatened by the Nazis with deportation to Treblinka, we turned to them with a plea for help, and they provided my mother, my sister, and myself with false Polish documents, without any compensation.</span> <span id="s1093">These documents enabled us to escape from the ghetto a few hours before the extermination brigade surrounded it on October 20, 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Our friends and their mother, without the knowledge of their father, who was against it, were hiding us out in their home until we left for work in Germany as Polish girls.</span> <span id="s1095">The penalty for helping Poles at that time, as far as I recall, was death.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Our mother was caught and sent to Treblinka where she perished.</span> <span id="s1097">Our father and younger brother remained in Piotrkow in a forced labor camp.</span> <span id="s1098">From the end of 1942 until the beginning of 1945, when the camp was liquidated, my sister and I were able to communicate with our father and our young brother from Germany to Piotrkow by sending letters and occasional food packages, to our Polish friends, which they delivered to them.</span> <span id="s1099">His letters to us were transmitted the same way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">This continued contact was a great moral support to all of us.</span> <span id="s1101">Our friends understandably were taking great risks for our sake.</span> <span id="s1102">My father perished in Buchenwald in April, 1945, two days before the liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">I have kept touch with my friends since the end of the war, trying to help them in various ways.</span> <span id="s1104">The two sisters and the mother during the war, were actively participating in a Polish underground which was fighting the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1105">Their activities were uncovered and the mother was sent to a concentration camp, Ravensbruck, in Germany, after which she spent several months recuperating in Sweden, and returned in poor health back to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">The older sister, Mrs. Trybus, after her release from Polish jail, came down with tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s1107">For a while I supplied her with streptomycin, not available in Poland at that time, food packages and warm clothes to help her recover.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">I expect them in Minneapolis the second week of October.</span> <span id="s1109">I appreciate your interest very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Yours truly</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Sabina Zimering.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">So this was the letter that I sent to Yad Vashem, and as I was explaining to Rabbi what I was doing, he just wrote the whole letter in the Clarion, and this was sent out to the congregation, and then read again during the service.</span> <span id="s1113">It was very moving.</span> <span id="s1114">It was part of the regular Shabbat evening sermon, and they read the letter, and then the older sister, Danuta, she felt she wanted to express her appreciation for being honored.</span> <span id="s1115">They have never been to a synagogue before…this was the first time in their lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Did they have any religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: Oh, they are very devout Catholics!</span> <span id="s1118">They were observant.</span> <span id="s1119">They were very religious.</span> <span id="s1120">But, the rabbi explained to them that in a synagogue, no matter what goes on, however moving the sermons are, there is no applause -- ever.</span> <span id="s1121">And when the thing was winding down, she got up and said a few words, thanking the congregation and the rabbi about what a moving experience it was.</span> <span id="s1122">She knows no English.</span> <span id="s1123">So we wrote it out.</span> <span id="s1124">She told me what she wants to say, and I wrote it out in Polish, English sounding words.</span> <span id="s1125">And there she got up in front of hundreds of strange people, and gave this speech, and you could tell right away she did not understand, because the accent was on the wrong…and the synagogue just broke out in applause!</span> <span id="s1126">And Rabbi Goodman said this was the very first time that he remembers a response like that!</span> <span id="s1127">And a few minutes before, he told her, “Don’t expect applause.”</span> <span id="s1128">(Laughter) so it was extremely moving.</span> <span id="s1129">And there is another thing, with the strikes -- which was a week later -- he had a comment about it in the Clarion, too.</span> <span id="s1130">(Looking at papers).</span> <span id="s1131">So I was so happy that this thing came off, because they really deserved so much more, but they don’t want to leave their home town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: Do they still live in the same house that you were…</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1134">That’s right.</span> <span id="s1135">The younger sister lives there.</span> <span id="s1136">The older sister lives in another…(Still looking at papers).</span> <span id="s1137">This is what this looked like.</span> <span id="s1138">This was sent special mail, special delivery, to the Consulate.</span> <span id="s1139">There are some pictures, you wanted to know, of some concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1140">Would you like to look at other things?</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: Yea.</span> <span id="s1142">Let’s do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: Oh, here.</span> <span id="s1144">This is the Rabbi’s study.</span> <span id="s1145">Let’s see, where the part about the…”Last Friday, it came out together in response to the Polish sisters…”</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: I think it might be good for you just to read that one or two paragraphs, and explain what it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: Yea.</span> <span id="s1148">This is another issue of the Clarion.</span> <span id="s1149">It was the issue a couple weeks after the honoring of my friends at the Adath.</span> <span id="s1150">And the Rabbi writes, among other things: “During the Friday night service of October 19, it all came together with the presence of two Polish sisters, Mrs. Danuta Trybus and Mrs. Maria Spiewak, who during the Holocaust had risked their lives to save Sabina Zimering’s family It was only during the past week that we learned that Yad Vashem had accepted Sabina’s deposition, testifying to the heroism of the women.</span> <span id="s1151">They are now recognized by the State of Israel and the Jewish people as Chesed B’Shalom, “The Righteous of the Gentiles.”</span> <span id="s1152">In their honor, trees will be planted in Yad Vashem grounds on the special path called the Walk of the Righteous.</span> <span id="s1153">Their presence in our midst was a reminder that not all humanity stands indicted because of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1154">There were men and women of good will and rare courage who somehow restore our faith in human kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">When these two women were asked to rise, the congregation strained to get a glimpse of them.</span> <span id="s1156">When they were called to the pulpit to respond to Dora Zaidenweber’s beautiful greetings in English and Polish, a hush fell upon the entire congregation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Danuta and Maria ascended to the pulpit to the joyous singing of “Shalom Aleichem!”</span> <span id="s1158">In their brief English response, they emphasized their belief that they were not heroes.</span> <span id="s1159">They just did what any decent human being should do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">We, of course, know how rare such people were, and how great was their risk.</span> <span id="s1161">Following their response, an unprecedented wave of applause swept the congregation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">At the Oneg Shabbat, Maria and Danuta were surrounded by dozens of men and women, eager to have more contact with them.</span> <span id="s1163">Although these women spoke no English, and few of our members spoke Polish, it was amazing how much communication did take place.</span> <span id="s1164">Hearts responded to hearts.</span> <span id="s1165">We who were there felt privileged.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: Is there anything else related to them, or do we go on to something else now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: Well, this is the speech of the Israeli Consul, during the ceremony, but I don’t think we need to read this, unless you want to.</span> <span id="s1168">It’s pretty much the summary of what was said in the other one.</span> <span id="s1169">But this was given at the Consulate in the presence of all kinds of officials of survivors, and Jewish organizations, and reporters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: When we finish the interview, I think this last page would be very good to finish it with.</span> <span id="s1171">You can read that into the record.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: And there were various articles that came out in the papers.</span> <span id="s1173">They were interviewed and written up in Poland.</span> <span id="s1174">Now this was the picture, the only picture we have of the mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: How was this reported in Poland?</span> <span id="s1176">You said the people refer to them as heroes.</span> <span id="s1177">Is that the customary thing, like, appearing that sometimes the Polish press is anti-Semitic…</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: Right!</span> <span id="s1179">We were very surprised.</span> <span id="s1180">It probably isn’t like that any more, but a few years ago, this created quite an impression.</span> <span id="s1181">We were getting a lot of positive publicity.</span> <span id="s1182">In fact, they were considered heroes.</span> <span id="s1183">They were interviewed, and every letter I got, they said there was another interview.</span> <span id="s1184">Somebody came from Lodz, somebody came from Warsaw, and they were constantly being written about and talked about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">R.S. Is there any reason that they were quiet for so long, besides being modest in the things that they did!</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">R.S. Do you think they were quiet because of the feelings after the war of anti-Semitism and…</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: Probably, probably.</span> <span id="s1189">And I think it so happened that the political situation at that time was more liberal and more favorable.</span> <span id="s1190">“Cause things in Poland over the years have been changing and u think it was just more probably the right time for something like that to surface.</span> <span id="s1191">Maybe the fact that the Polish reporter from New York sent it on as an important mission, they picked it up as something that -- she was telling me that they usually listen to the news in the States, and if there’s anything that pertains to Poles, like, for example, they knew that we had a Polish symphony director, they knew about Skrowaczewski -- laughter -- apparently they like to know what’s happening.</span> <span id="s1192">Any Polish-related events in the States are reported over there.</span> <span id="s1193">So when this came through, and they knew its women that lived there, they just made a big fuss over it.</span> <span id="s1194">Now I have some pictures brought to me from my hometown.</span> <span id="s1195">This is the house where we were hiding out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: And you hid in the attic?</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1198">Way up there.</span> <span id="s1199">Before they left, I asked them to take pictures of things that would be of interest to me, and they have, like the Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s1200">This was a common grave of the Jews.</span> <span id="s1201">Several hundred Jews were led out of town and shot, and I guess, after the war, they erected this special monument.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: Were there any names put in this spot, or is it just a memorial?</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: I think they did.</span> <span id="s1204">She was saying that she was going every year and putting fresh flowers on that.</span> <span id="s1205">This is the house where we lived then.</span> <span id="s1206">This is the street where my father’s business was, but she just cut off a little piece, so…I recognize the street, but the actual business doesn’t show up.</span> <span id="s1207">And that’s an inscription.</span> <span id="s1208">And she magnified what was on this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1210">The tomb is somewhat in disarray.</span> <span id="s1211">Does the Polish government keep it up, or is it the responsibility of the citizens?</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: I think it was official.</span> <span id="s1213">I don’t remember for sure.</span> <span id="s1214">Whenever there was anything good going on in Poland after the war, that’s related to Jews, she was quick to write to me about it.</span> <span id="s1215">She was very proud.</span> <span id="s1216">There was one old Jewish doctor that survived in town, and apparently he was active in the underground, and she kept writing me that he’s so admired by all the Poles, and he’s so loved, and so on and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">R.S: Did they ever do censorship of her letters?</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: (Laughter) She was always very brash.</span> <span id="s1219">In fact, when we corresponded from Poland to Germany where I was, I remember at one point she wrote me about the heroism of the Warsaw ghetto, at the time when it was going on.</span> <span id="s1220">And I was petrified!</span> <span id="s1221">I thought, “All anybody had to do was open the letter to me!</span> <span id="s1222">Why would a Polish girl care about the heroism of Jews in the Warsaw ghetto?”</span> <span id="s1223">And I immediately destroyed it.</span> <span id="s1224">But I was still very happy and proud to see that she wrote about it.</span> <span id="s1225">I guess then this would be all about them.</span> <span id="s1226">Unless you have any questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: Just a little more in depth with what was actually happening in the ghetto, if you can give us some idea.</span> <span id="s1228">Your impressions of, let’s say, life in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1229">How did the people actually survive?</span> <span id="s1230">Is it mainly will power?</span> <span id="s1231">Or were they actually given any assistance from the underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">A: Well, everybody was for themselves, I remember financially.</span> <span id="s1233">We were right away refugees, as I told you.</span> <span id="s1234">We happened to live in a Polish part of town.</span> <span id="s1235">And a few weeks after the war broke out, we were displaced, and our hardships began immediately.</span> <span id="s1236">My father’s business was very shortly liquidated, so I guess we just survived on saved-up money and selling off our household goods and so on.</span> <span id="s1237">Certain businesses were able to go on.</span> <span id="s1238">Like if, let’s say a bakery happened to be in this part of the city before the war, the same bakery went on and they baked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">R.S. Even if it was owned by a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1241">Right.</span> <span id="s1242">Because this was the ghetto, so the Germans or the Poles didn’t mix into it.</span> <span id="s1243">It was running pretty autonomous.</span> <span id="s1244">So some people were able to continue their work, like all kinds of craftsmen, tailors and shoemakers, and so on.</span> <span id="s1245">But the majority was right away thrown into very great financial crisis.</span> <span id="s1246">And food was rationed, so there wasn’t very much to be bought.</span> <span id="s1247">There was a black market, and you had to have a lot of money for anything you needed.</span> <span id="s1248">So it was tough, right away.</span> <span id="s1249">And after maybe two years of being in a ghetto, where epidemics of typhus were very rampant, people were dying, it was just a mess.</span> <span id="s1250">There were obvious pictures of hunger.</span> <span id="s1251">You could see children with big stomachs and the typical undernourished child with rickets, and people sitting around in the streets that couldn’t move, and they were just slowly dying.</span> <span id="s1252">So it was very obvious that the population was just dying out for whatever reason, either hunger, or disease, or just being shot or executed by the Germans.</span> <span id="s1253">And it was very constant and on a high level that extermination was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: To the degree that the underground helped to get supplies, do you know anything about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: Well I really didn’t know much about the underground except at this one point when we were asked by one Hashomer Hatzair leader to form an underground group, and he indicated that there are, but I had no knowledge of anything official.</span> <span id="s1256">These things I’m sure, were done in great secret, and only people that were active knew about it, and I was a young teenager.</span> <span id="s1257">I had no access to any of these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: The community of Poland, the Jewish community, was very religious, from what I can understand…</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: Not true.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: Not true?</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1262">in fact, the thing that I noticed that’s different in the Jewish communities in this country as compared to what I grew up in Poland, there were many, many factions.</span> <span id="s1263">Some were religious and they were from extreme, very orthodox, to less orthodox, and so on.</span> <span id="s1264">In the city of Piotrkow, there was one official synagogue.</span> <span id="s1265">I was in a Jewish gymnasium, and every Saturday the whole class was expected to go to the synagogue and listen to the official rabbi in a sermon.</span> <span id="s1266">And it was a beautiful, huge building.</span> <span id="s1267">They made it into a library now, my friends told me.</span> <span id="s1268">But there were always two Polish military men present during each sermon, to check up on the rabbi, what he’s preaching about.</span> <span id="s1269">But to answer your question, there were a lot of people that were completely not affiliated with any religion.</span> <span id="s1270">Didn’t belong to synagogue, didn’t go to services, but they sure knew and felt as Jews.</span> <span id="s1271">And I think you have still more of that in Israel, now.</span> <span id="s1272">There are quite a few non-observing Jews that know darn well who they are, and fight for the country, and so on.</span> <span id="s1273">And there were a very few assimilated Jews that were hated by the rest if us with a passion.</span> <span id="s1274">We had maybe two families.</span> <span id="s1275">They were usually very well off, aristocratic, educated abroad, and had all their social and business contacts only with high-class Poles.</span> <span id="s1276">And they considered it below their standing to identify with the rest of us.</span> <span id="s1277">Some of them did intermarry, but that was very rare.</span> <span id="s1278">And they were just hated with a passion.</span> <span id="s1279">(chuckle) There were very few.</span> <span id="s1280">The majority were either observing Jews or non-observing, but very Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: Were there large Hasidic communities?</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1283">My grandfather was very, very Hasidic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: Alright.</span> <span id="s1285">When the violence did come to the ghetto, did he convey to you any reason, or any thoughts on.</span> <span id="s1286">Why is God doing this to us?</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A: He had a very, very definite way of looking at it.</span> <span id="s1288">I remember we used to congregate in the grandfather’s kitchen, and this was the pastime.</span> <span id="s1289">People would get together and review what were the rumors.</span> <span id="s1290">There was no press, nobody had a radio, so all the news was word by mouth.</span> <span id="s1291">And you would hear that Lodz expelled so many Jews, and we were getting a trickling of them in, and they would tell their horror stories.</span> <span id="s1292">Or some other town, or whatever happens right in our town!</span> <span id="s1293">There was plenty of horror stories.</span> <span id="s1294">Whenever grandfather was present, he didn’t allow anybody to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1295">He said, “I don’t believe in it!</span> <span id="s1296">God wouldn’t allow it!</span> <span id="s1297">This is not true!”</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: Is that typical of the whole Hasidic community, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: Well, I don’t remember having contact with other people.</span> <span id="s1300">Grandfather was a small man, but a very strong personality, and when he said, “I don’t want to hear about it!”</span> <span id="s1301">, nobody talked about it in his presence.</span> <span id="s1302">And it was so obvious that he was not in touch with reality, because this sure was true!</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: Did he make a change, though?</span> <span id="s1304">Did he come to admit that there was a problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">A: No.</span> <span id="s1306">To the very last minute.</span> <span id="s1307">In fact, later on, or maybe already then, I felt that this was his way of coping with the situation.</span> <span id="s1308">He probably knew that it’s just terrible, and how can something like this happen, how can God allow it, so this was his way of denying that this is happening.</span> <span id="s1309">And he said, “I don’t want to hear about it!</span> <span id="s1310">It’s not true!</span> <span id="s1311">And nothing will happen to us,” and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">Q: When you were in the ghetto, was there any fear of the Jewish police?</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">A: Oh, yes,</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: …who were conspiring with the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: Well, I don’t know whether they were “conspiring” with them.</span> <span id="s1316">They were just carrying out their orders, which was a terrible task.</span> <span id="s1317">But because they were the people that knocked on the door and came -- and I remember once in the middle of the night, pulled out my father -- you have to be afraid of them, and you had to dislike them.</span> <span id="s1318">There were some rumors that sometimes they did more than they had to and needed to, but most of the time, people understood, because they tried to save their own skin, and they happened to be picked for the job, and they did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">R.S.</span> <span id="s1320">When you tried to practice like a Shabbat observance or a holiday within the ghetto, was there fear of doing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: Well, as I say, my family was not too observing.</span> <span id="s1322">I don’t remember whether grandfather was going to his little shul or not.</span> <span id="s1323">I think he was.</span> <span id="s1324">But it was illegal for Jews to assemble.</span> <span id="s1325">Any group that was larger then five or six people, was considered dangerous to the Germans, and they didn’t allow it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">R.S. Even within your own house, couldn’t you practice…</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">A: Oh, yea.</span> <span id="s1328">In a home you could.</span> <span id="s1329">I don’t think anybody would come and look and see what you’re doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">R.S. And there was no fear of the Jewish patrol, either?</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">A: No.</span> <span id="s1332">The Jewish police wouldn’t spy on that, no.</span> <span id="s1333">But it was very beautifully run --the administration of the ghetto-- it was just very amazing to see what a group of people that are just devoid of any external help.</span> <span id="s1334">How they were running the everyday business of the Judenrat, and all the branches.</span> <span id="s1335">Like how the food was distributed, how the hospital functioned, how sick people were taken to a hospital and families were put in quarantine for typhus, and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s1336">That’s a tremendous job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">R.S.</span> <span id="s1338">The leaders just emerged kind of on their own?</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">A: Well some continued, like my uncle, who was a political leader and active before the war.</span> <span id="s1340">He just stayed on.</span> <span id="s1341">He was an elected official and he just was respected by the community, so he stayed on.</span> <span id="s1342">He was in charge of supplying people for work.</span> <span id="s1343">(Laughter) I heard his daughter say that every so often somebody would come in and try to bribe his wife.</span> <span id="s1344">And she was so happy to accept a present from somebody until he came home.</span> <span id="s1345">He said,” Why did you take this from such-and-such!</span> <span id="s1346">I want to send that back!</span> <span id="s1347">He doesn’t want his son to go and be taken to work just because he’s rich, and I have to take all the poor boys!</span> <span id="s1348">I won’t accept it!”</span> <span id="s1349">So it was really a complicated life, and it functioned just great.</span> <span id="s1350">I’m bringing it up because, remember John Hersey, that wrote The Wall?</span> <span id="s1351">That was -- whew, I’m getting all excited (chuckle) -- my youngest daughter is a friend and roommate of their daughter, and we became friends, and we see them every summer when we go east.</span> <span id="s1352">And one summer I asked him how he came about to write the book, because they’re not Jewish, you know.</span> <span id="s1353">Hersey isn’t Jewish.</span> <span id="s1354">He said at that time, he was a reporter for Life magazine and he was in Russia, and he traveled through Poland, and he ran across a Jewish survivor from some small town in Lithuania, and he talked to him and was interested how he survived, and so on.</span> <span id="s1355">And what he said was, “What intrigued me the most was how these ghettos functioned, where they were just all on their own without any outside help, just a group of Jews that were so oppressed by the whole world.”</span> <span id="s1356">And he decided to find Warsaw ghetto survivors, and that’s how the book came about.</span> <span id="s1357">He followed them to Israel.</span> <span id="s1358">He lived in Israel for a while interviewing people.</span> <span id="s1359">To him, for some reason, this was the most interesting part of the Holocaust -- how the ghettos could function.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: When the war was going on, you were very young.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">AL Right.</span> <span id="s1362">I was sixteen when the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: Do you feel that, because of that, you missed a lot in life, in a normal growing up situation.</span> <span id="s1364">Were you able to have any kind of relationships while you were growing up under those particular circumstances?</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1366">I think when you don’t have something, you really don’t know whether you miss it or not.</span> <span id="s1367">I mean you make the best of whatever situation you live in.</span> <span id="s1368">I remember I used to be hungry continuously, and now I feel hungry and I know how it will feel one hour from now, and two hours from now, and so on.</span> <span id="s1369">But we had friends, and we were getting together, and we somehow managed to live like eighteen and nineteen-year-olds, or seventeen year olds.</span> <span id="s1370">Even though there was constant fear and oppression, I think when you’re young, there’s somehow so much strength and normal fun for life, that you create it no matter where you are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">R.S.</span> <span id="s1372">But you were so limited, though, in what you could do…</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A: Right, we were limited.</span> <span id="s1374">Our house was right on the edge of the ghetto, and there was a constant curfew.</span> <span id="s1375">After eight o’clock, you had to be inside.</span> <span id="s1376">And in the building where we lived, there were families from Lodz and other towns, and they had teenaged boys, and it was very exciting to meet the boys, and talk to them, and joke with them and get together.</span> <span id="s1377">So I wasn’t looking at it, “Oh, how great it would have been if the war wasn’t here.”</span> <span id="s1378">We just made the best of what we could.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">R.S.</span> <span id="s1380">So you’re not resentful or…</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">A: No, not in that sense, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: Did you feel envious at all, after the war, to people who had not gone through what you had?</span> <span id="s1383">Was there any jealousy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: Well, I guess that the most thing that I was unhappy over was that I lost my family, and my education was interrupted, and that people who were close to me, friends and relatives and so on, suffered so immensely.</span> <span id="s1385">But just to think of it as missing fun, I don’t remember thinking of it that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">R.S.</span> <span id="s1387">It isn’t so much missing fun, but like growing up, the experiences of an adolescent</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">A: Well, I don’t think I missed it.</span> <span id="s1389">As I said, I remember we had friends, and we dated, and we had long walk with my friends, and talked about boys or talked about how wonderful it would be -- or will be -- when we make it.</span> <span id="s1390">So somehow, we just adjusted to the situation.</span> <span id="s1391">We were still acting like young people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: Did you feel guilty that you survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: Umm.</span> <span id="s1394">That’s something that I guess everybody has.</span> <span id="s1395">You feel that it’s such a random thing!</span> <span id="s1396">There’s, let’s say, a whole family!</span> <span id="s1397">And after it’s over with, some people that you considered very valuable, and very worthwhile, and very deserving are gone, and I am here -- or among friends!</span> <span id="s1398">That was always a very strong feeling!</span> <span id="s1399">It was guilt and embarrassment, and you just felt awkward about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">R.S.</span> <span id="s1401">It was obvious you had such strong desire and determination.</span> <span id="s1402">Do you ever feel that the people who didn’t survive -- are you ever angry with them that they didn’t have the will, maybe?</span> <span id="s1403">Or the…</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: Or that they didn’t try?</span> <span id="s1405">Well, I don’t remember thinking about anyone in particular like that.</span> <span id="s1406">It’s hard to explain why some people make it and others don’t, but determination was one of the factors.</span> <span id="s1407">And some people, that’s right, just gave up and didn’t care.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: What I would like to do is get a statement from you on what you would say to future generations.</span> <span id="s1409">And then I want to have you read this particular article as the conclusion.</span> <span id="s1410">To your grandchildren, (Zimerman sighs) what would you say to them, what should they be aware of, what should they fear and not fear?</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: Well, first of all I think it starts with every single human being.</span> <span id="s1412">You would hope and try to eliminate the hatred in people that would create a situation that happened during the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1413">But that’s, of course, Utopia.</span> <span id="s1414">It’s not possible.</span> <span id="s1415">People will fight each other, and hate each other, and so on.</span> <span id="s1416">So, as Jews, a lot of us are still a minority surrounded by powerful majorities in whatever countries we live.</span> <span id="s1417">It’s very important to be aware of any signs of anti-Semitism, be more courageous and speak up and act in our own defense, and not make the mistakes that, unfortunately, were done during the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1418">It’s not a…</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: What was the biggest mistake?</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: Well, I think there were many.</span> <span id="s1421">First of all, the Jews at that time were strictly people of the Book.</span> <span id="s1422">And they considered everything physical below their level.</span> <span id="s1423">They thought, “this is for goyim -- to go into sports, or to be strong, or to be able to take care of yourselves -- that’s for the very ordinary goyim.</span> <span id="s1424">We are people of the mind, we are learned people.</span> <span id="s1425">We don’t need that.”</span> <span id="s1426">And when we got confronted with anything that required fighting back in just an ordinary way, we were very weak.</span> <span id="s1427">We just ran instead of fighting back.</span> <span id="s1428">This was one thing.</span> <span id="s1429">And another thing was that psychologically, we really were brought up just in a completely different, unfortunately unrealistic way.</span> <span id="s1430">We thought, “All we need to do is just stick to our business, be good Jews and believe in God, and everything will be fine.”</span> <span id="s1431">And then when we had to take care of ourselves, we were unable to.</span> <span id="s1432">Plus, because we were psychologically not geared to that, we haven’t done anything to be physically in the right shape, too.</span> <span id="s1433">We had no weapons, we had no contacts, and we were completely caught, surrounded by the majority that wasn’t friendly.</span> <span id="s1434">It was a pretty desperate situation to begin with.</span> <span id="s1435">Because not only did we have the occupying Nazis that were just set to destroy us for who knows why, but our immediate neighbors, the hosts of the country where we grew up and where we were for generations, were gladly cooperating with them, and were against us.</span> <span id="s1436">And there were many instances where young Jewish people went into the woods and tried to create an underground movement.</span> <span id="s1437">I lost my cousin like that, one young woman who was a Hashomer Hatzair leader.</span> <span id="s1438">She ran into the woods and joined a Jewish underground -- I guess they had contacts with Warsaw, they had money, they had weapons -- and they were found out by Polish underground.</span> <span id="s1439">The Polish underground, by the way, had two main factions.</span> <span id="s1440">One was the Rightist, nationalist group that was very anti-Semitic, and whenever they found any Jew trying to either join them or fight, they would catch them and either finish them off themselves, or turn them over to the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1441">And there was another faction that was Socialist, and they were much more sympathetic and helpful to the Jews.</span> <span id="s1442">So if you went into the woods, and you happened to run into the Socialist Polish group, you were fine.</span> <span id="s1443">They took you in and you were part of a group, and you could do something.</span> <span id="s1444">If you happened to run into the Rightists, the Nationalist group, you were finished.</span> <span id="s1445">And that’s what happened to my cousin.</span> <span id="s1446">So the situation was just helpless from any point of view.</span> <span id="s1447">We weren’t ready psychologically, physically.</span> <span id="s1448">We were surrounded by enemies -- double enemies.</span> <span id="s1449">So it was hopeless.</span> <span id="s1450">So what I would tell my grandchildren is to least avoid the mistakes we have made.</span> <span id="s1451">And what I see now is much better.</span> <span id="s1452">Jewish kids are good athletes, they are tackling physical tasks, and they are just as able.</span> <span id="s1453">And now looking at Israel -- you know (laughs), they have the best army in the world, like Begin said, and he’s right!</span> <span id="s1454">So at least this will be not again the same.</span> <span id="s1455">And we have to hope that humanity will make progress, and if not, that we will just try to fight back and take care of ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">R.S. Where were we politically, and where will we be now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">A: Well, I think that’s pretty unpredictable.</span> <span id="s1458">I guess, at least during Hitler’s time, the whole thing started with very bad economic situation where people were out of jobs and disillusioned, and they were easy prey for Hitler’s rhetoric.</span> <span id="s1459">So I suppose this is possible again, here, if things get very, very bad, and some demagogue gets hold of the nation.</span> <span id="s1460">I guess there are always gullible people, or that it’s always easy to convince someone that it’s somebody else’s fault, and to create a hatred.</span> <span id="s1461">That’s what you meant?</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">R.S. Do you think that war retributions really are enough, and there’s a sense of, like penance?</span> <span id="s1463">Or should there be other kinds of retributions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">A: Retribution?</span> <span id="s1465">You mean punishing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">Q: Well, money given to survivors.</span> <span id="s1467">(She means “reparations,” not “retributions.”)</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">R.S. Is money really a way of kind of paying off/</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1470">It’s not a way of paying off.</span> <span id="s1471">I think it was Ben Gurion who accepted the offer by Germany after the war.</span> <span id="s1472">For a long time, Israel didn’t want to have anything to do with German restitution payments, and then he said, “Well, they will not undo what they have done, but whatever we lost economically and financially, we have it coming, and why not accept it?”</span> <span id="s1473">So I would look at it the same way.</span> <span id="s1474">I don’t think that they even hoped to undo by the restitution, by the “Wieder gut machen” (reparations) for what they have done.</span> <span id="s1475">But they tried to, somehow, lessen their guilt feelings, I guess, and help the surviving Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: What I’d like you to do is tell us a little about when this was read, and to read it to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1478">This was (opening envelope) the ceremony in New York City on October 29, 1979, when the Consul General of the Israeli Embassy in New York, Mr. Kadar, read the speech to the present guests and officials, and he said: “Mrs. Trybus and Mrs. Spiewak, distinguished representatives of various organizations of Jewish Nazi fighters, dear friends: It is with a feeling of awe, but also with a feeling of great pride, that I award, on behalf of Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, the Medal of the Righteous Gentile to two ladies from Poland who are with us here today.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">If it may seem odd to some outsider that an event that occurred thirty-eight years ago to a handful of people in a distant country should create such a commotion and generate such interest today, the answer lies in the fact that it is both of human and of historical significance, the human side of the simple story of how one family helped the other in the time of mortal danger as a matter of course, and without demand for compensation of any kind…” Oh, the medal that they got, by the way -- Yad Vashem has various degrees of honoring people -- the fact that they didn’t ask for any compensation made them eligible for the highest degree.</span> <span id="s1480">Apparently quite a few people survived because they were able to pay and buy their papers, but they did not ask for anything, and that’s why he is stressing that here, “The story as told by Dr. Sabina Zimering of Minneapolis, who is present in this room, is the following; Danuta and Maria Eustina and I were childhood friends in Piotrkow before the war, and while during the Nazi occupation my family was threatened with deportation to Treblinka, they provided us with Polish documents without any compensation.</span> <span id="s1481">The documents allowed us to escape from the ghetto a few hours before the extermination brigade surrounded it on October 20, 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">The two sisters and their mother provided shelter and food for us for several days without the knowledge of their father, who was against it.</span> <span id="s1483">The penalty for Poles helping Jews, at that time, was death.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Our mother was caught and sent to Treblinka where she perished.</span> <span id="s1485">My sister and myself survived in Germany, posing and working as Polish girls.</span> <span id="s1486">Our father and youngest brother remained in Piotrkow in a forced labor camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">From the end of 1942 until the beginning of 1945 when the camp was liquidated, we were able to communicate with our father and brother by sending letters and occasional food packages to our Polish friends, which they delivered to them.</span> <span id="s1488">My father’s letters to us in Germany were transmitted the same way.</span> <span id="s1489">This continued contact was of great moral support for all of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">My father perished in Buchenwald in April of 1945, two days before the liberation of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">Our friends, understandably, were taking great risks for our sake.</span> <span id="s1492">They and their mother became involved in the Polish underground, fighting the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1493">They were discovered.</span> <span id="s1494">The mother was sent to Ravensbruck camp and Bergen-Belsen, from where she returned in poor health.</span> <span id="s1495">Danuta was arrested and jailed in Czestochowa, and upon liberation came down with a dangerous illness.</span> <span id="s1496">(He meant tuberculosis.)</span> <span id="s1497">As a doctor, I was fortunate and able to provide them with rare medication after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">It is a story of human kindness and love, and great tragedy as well, but although only a few people were involved, it brings to mind the Talmudic saying.</span> <span id="s1499">‘He who saved one human being, only, saved the entire world.”</span> <span id="s1500">But this simple story of kindness, love and heroism, assumes much, much greater proportions when it is set against the background of cruelty, inhumanity and murder of millions which prevailed at that time.</span> <span id="s1501">This is a matter whose impact, not only at thirty-eight, but at a thousand years, cannot diminish, and whose significance and importance for us as Jews, and for the world as a whole, will never wane.</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">We cannot forget, and we will not forget.</span> <span id="s1503">And therefore, when we discover, even at this late hour, an act of decency and devotion that shines like a bright candle in that world of darkness that was the Holocaust, it is an occasion for celebration and expression of thanks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">In the name of the Jewish people, I thank you Danuta Trybus and Maria Spiewak, for the act of humanity and heroism you performed in those dark days, and wish you a happy, prosperous and long life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">That’s when he handed them their certificate and their medal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s1507">(Sigh) thank you.</span> <span id="s1508">It is something which I’m afraid we all must be aware of.</span> <span id="s1509">Michael Garelick, Rosalyn Smith.</span> <span id="s1510">Thank you, Dr. Zimering.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">PAGE 45</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">PAGE 45</span></p></body></html>
