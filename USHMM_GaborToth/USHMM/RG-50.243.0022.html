id="s16">00:00:30 I was born in 1932, in February.</span> <span id="s17">Lived for a couple of years in Boulogne, in France.</span> <span id="s18">My mother was French, my father Dutch.</span> <span id="s19">Then back to Brussels.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">00:01:00 Until 1943.</span> <span id="s21">My name is Zezette, not a common name.</span> <span id="s22">I had another name, Clemence.</span> <span id="s23">Both names were difficult for English to pronounce.</span> <span id="s24">It was changed during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">00:01:30 I did not have a Yiddish name.</span> <span id="s26">I came from an absolutely non-religious family.</span> <span id="s27">I did not have a Hebrew name.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">00:02:00 I am not sure how my mother met my father.</span> <span id="s29">She was born in France.</span> <span id="s30">At one point, her parents moved to Belgium.</span> <span id="s31">His business was there.</span> <span id="s32">They met and married.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">00:02:00 There is a tendency to idealize what you don't have, but I'm saying it with great conviction.</span> <span id="s34">They were loving, caring, and over protective.</span> <span id="s35">I'm talking about the beginning of the war, and</span></p> <p><span id="s36">they're trying to</span></p> <p><span id="s37">00:02:30 protect me from the suffering.</span> <span id="s38">I was a young child, and now maybe I label that as over protective.</span> <span id="s39">My father had a great sense of humor.</span> <span id="s40">So did my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">00:03:00 I'm sure that carries through the family.</span> <span id="s42">A love for life.</span> <span id="s43">She loved to sing and I cannot, but I have a love of music.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">My father just being a nice person.</span> <span id="s45">I think that the 11 years that</span></p> <p><span id="s46">they gave me.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">00:03:30 And I say that with conviction, must have been very god because it left me, even though there were some hard years, left me as a caring person.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">00:04:00 I have a brother.</span> <span id="s49">He is still alive.</span> <span id="s50">My brother was not in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s51">He is older.</span> <span id="s52">He was not at home when we were picked up in 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">00:04:30 I adore my brother to this day.</span> <span id="s54">You are touching on a hard subject.</span> <span id="s55">I think Marcel suffers so much</span></p> <p><span id="s56">00:05:00 of the guilt of the survivors, that he and I have never talked of the past, of my parents.</span> <span id="s57">It is only in the past several years that I have been able to talk more, and what he talks about</span></p> <p><span id="s58">00:05:30 "Your" parents, or about "our" parents.</span> <span id="s59">he will not talk about the war years.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: What was your father's business?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">00:06:00 The textile business.</span> <span id="s62">He was a salesman.</span> <span id="s63">He had to travel.</span> <span id="s64">Between Holland and Belgium.</span> <span id="s65">Most of the time he came</span></p> <p><span id="s66">home evenings.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">00:06:30 I think he was successful.</span> <span id="s68">We never wanted of anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Lived a reasonably comfortable life.</span> <span id="s70">His name was Henri.</span> <span id="s71">His</span></p> <p><span id="s72">parents were Dutch.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">00:07:00 I have no recollection of where his parents were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">My mother's name was Ester de Rose.</span> <span id="s75">They were of Sephardic background, but not all religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">00:07:30 We were definitely Jewish.</span> <span id="s77">But formal Jewish education was not part of our lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">00:08:00 We celebrated Jewish holidays to a minimal degree.</span> <span id="s79">We were completely assimilated into the life of Brussels.</span> <span id="s80">We knew we were Jewish, but that did not mean going to Temple.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">00:08:30 A way of life but not a conviction.</span> <span id="s82">I went to public</span></p> <p><span id="s83">school.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">00:09:00 We knew we were Jewish, but did not connect at all with any synagogue.</span> <span id="s85">It did not come up until 1940.</span> <span id="s86">It did not come.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">00:09:30 Into our conversation.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: What are some of your memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">00:10:00 I had a big brother who was really a pain in the neck, who took a tremendous amount of pleasure in teasing me.</span> <span id="s90">I think that I served as a conduit.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">00:10:30 When he liked one of my girlfriends and wanted to make contact, then I was the best sister he had.</span> <span id="s92">otherwise if I had to take medicine, and forgot, he was the one reminding my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">00:11:00 The reason I mention the very affectionate woman she was is, and maybe I remember because of the pain of separation, there</span></p> <p><span id="s94">was a ritual.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">00:11:30 Every day - we lived on the second floor of an apartment building and my mother had to say good-bye ten times and wave watching me down the street.</span> <span id="s96">And it was reciprocal.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">00:12:00 That was a ritual.</span> <span id="s98">Like getting up every morning.</span> <span id="s99">She was an exceptionally warm person and so was my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">00:12:30 I don't remember how far my mother's education went, but I do remember she was involved in a number of activities involving school.</span> <span id="s101">She was always home when we arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">00:13:00 My father was very curious politically, though not involved.</span> <span id="s103">I remember many conversations that were beyond anything I was interested in.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">00:13:30 I think they were both intellectually curious and reading was very much part of my family life.</span> <span id="s105">Papers and books around the house.</span> <span id="s106">They were inquisitive people.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">00:14:00 They took the education my brother and I were getting very seriously.</span> <span id="s108">They were helpful with the homework.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Did you have any extended family living nearby?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">00:14:30 Yes, in Brussels, I had one aunt and several people I called aunt.</span> <span id="s111">My father's family was mostly in Holland - he had two sisters and one brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">00:15:00 I had cousins.</span> <span id="s113">The 49 people within my immediate family just never came back.</span> <span id="s114">My father's family, one sister and his brother were hidden during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">00:15:30 One sister went to Bergen-Belsen with her husband, and he died there.</span> <span id="s116">The sister died about 10 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: The language you spoke in the home was French?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">00:16:00 Our common language was French.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: You were such a young girl when the situation developed.</span> <span id="s120">What</span></p> <p><span id="s121">was your experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">00:16:30 I'm very conscious of their listening to the BBC and trying to make sure we were not involved in listening.</span> <span id="s123">My brother, who was four years older than me, tried to explain what he</span></p> <p><span id="s124">understood.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">00:17:00 In 1940, when the Germans invaded, I was so young, but I knew it was frightening, I knew there was pain at home, but I did</span></p> <p><span id="s126">not understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">00:17:30 In 1940, we left Brussels and started trying to leave the country walking to the border of France.</span> <span id="s128">But i did not understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">00:18:00 I knew that the routine that kids get so used to, so comfortable in, was completely gone.</span> <span id="s130">I was frightened.</span> <span id="s131">Events</span></p> <p><span id="s132">occurred so quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">00:18:30 We were being dislocated, and parents were focussed not only on their children but many other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">00:19:00 I continued to go to school for a very short time.</span> <span id="s135">When the Jews were told to wear the yellow stars, was when my life</span></p> <p><span id="s136">started changing.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">00:19:30 For the first time I realized I was not like all the other kids, I was wearing a Jewish star.</span> <span id="s138">Clear memory of walking in Brussels with my father and wearing a star.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">00:20:00 Walking in the center of Brussels and German soldiers coming down the same sidewalk and my father being pushed off the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s140">it's very vivid.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">00:20:30 It stays in my memory.</span> <span id="s142">It was shortly thereafter that a decision was made that we had to separate and my parents</span></p> <p><span id="s143">00:21:00 Moved into another neighborhood and rented the lower level of a house.</span> <span id="s144">In a suburb of Brussels.</span> <span id="s145">It was also the time</span></p> <p><span id="s146">00:21:30 I was separated from them.</span> <span id="s147">It was a moment - I'm sure it was not that - I was told that my name is not Zezette and my last name was not Van de Sluis - Larsen is my Married name</span></p> <p><span id="s148">00:22:00 My name was marguerite Mechels (ph)</span></p> <p><span id="s149">00:22:30 I was going to a Catholic convent, boarding school.</span> <span id="s150">I was told to do what the other kids did, not to talk about my</span></p> <p><span id="s151">parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">00:23:00 It was a very quick separation.</span> <span id="s153">It was the beginning of</span></p> <p><span id="s154">1942 my brother</span></p> <p><span id="s155">00:23:30 was sent to another part of Belgium, to a Trappist monastery.</span> <span id="s156">I was brought to the Catholic convent by some friends who were not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">00:24:00 I lived there until 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">00:24:30 One of the things I remember very clearly - obviously at the beginning, going into a world that was so foreign to me, it's</span></p> <p><span id="s159">so vivid.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">00:25:00 In late afternoon, I heard a bell being rung, and saw all the kids lining up on two sides of the corridor</span></p> <p><span id="s161">00:25:30 Putting a veil on their head, which I did, and going into the chapel.</span> <span id="s162">We went to chapel every morning and AFTERNOON BEING CONSCIOUS TO KNEEL WITH THE OTHER KIDS and get up with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">00:26:00 I tried to move my lips because I had no idea what they were saying.</span> <span id="s164">I think the trauma of that day, the events of the day must have been so traumatic that I see it in front of me so</span></p> <p><span id="s165">clearly.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">00:26:30 In any case, I became Marguetie M. I didn't say much though before I had a lot of joie de vivre.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">00:27:00 However, it disappeared pretty quickly being in this environment.</span> <span id="s168">I went to confession.</span> <span id="s169">I didn't have anyone to talk to, I didn't know what was going on</span></p> <p><span id="s170">00:27:30 with my parents nor my brother.</span> <span id="s171">In many ways it was the beginning of me becoming a robot.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">00:28:00 Doing what people told me to do.</span> <span id="s173">Maybe that's why now I don't like to do what people tell me.</span> <span id="s174">I don't remember if it was three months after I entered</span></p> <p><span id="s175">00:28:30 or a little more, I spoke with one of the priests.</span> <span id="s176">I had to share - as I look at it now, I felt I had to tell the truth and maybe someone would tell me where is my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">00:29:00 The result was that I was baptized.</span> <span id="s178">I guess that was their way of making me, quote, legitimate.</span> <span id="s179">I had been taking communion every day because everyone else had been.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">00:29:00 So I was BAPTIZED Catholic.</span> <span id="s181">There was a small ceremony.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A few sisters were there and this priest.</span> <span id="s183">My life didn't change.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">I didn't learn where my parents were.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">00:29:30 The interesting thing to me was that there were a group- of people who knew I was Jewish and being hidden in the convent.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">They took a risk with my being there.</span> <span id="s187">It could have turned out very different.</span> <span id="s188">I didn't realize this.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">00:30:00 In 1943, the people who had brought me, came to see me, and I begged them to let me see my parents.</span> <span id="s190">They told me about them but it was so strange, I needed to see them.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">00:30:30 In Easter 1943, I went to see my parents.</span> <span id="s192">I,m smiling because I remember it as such a wonderful reunion.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">00:33:00 I knew that I had to go back.</span> <span id="s194">Did I understand what was going on?</span> <span id="s195">No, I was so young.</span> <span id="s196">I only suffered the trauma.</span> <span id="s197">Even today I don't understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">00:35:30 Easter Sunday, my father decided that we would go fishing, the three of us.</span> <span id="s199">My mother, my father and myself.</span> <span id="s200">We left at dawn and we spent a wonderful day.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">00:36:00 I remember that vividly.</span> <span id="s202">We came back when it was dark.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">But we were followed.</span> <span id="s204">That night the knock came.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">00:36:30 (Wipes away tears) And we were picked up.</span> <span id="s206">I have a very vivid memory from the knock.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">00:37:00 No, we weren't wearing the Jewish star.</span> <span id="s208">I think we were denounced, and that my parents probably had been.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">00:37:30 It was just a coincidence that I was home.</span> <span id="s210">They also didn't go out very much.</span> <span id="s211">Very seldom.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">00:38:00 Your parents were passing as non-Jews and that is why they moved to a different part of town?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: No, they were not passing as non-Jews.</span> <span id="s214">They went into hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">00:38:30 When they had to report to M?</span> <span id="s216">which was like the holding camp for Jews.</span> <span id="s217">From there people were sent to Birkenau.</span> <span id="s218">But they had registered as Jews.</span> <span id="s219">When they were caught, they were wearing a star, and I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">00:39:00 I'm sorry, I didn't explain, - they went into hiding, I went to the boarding school, and my brother to the monastery.</span> <span id="s221">The day we went fishing, I cannot tell you whether we were wearing the star, probably we were not.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">00:39:30 When the knock came, we were transported to Maline.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Luckily, my brother was not home.</span> <span id="s224">There was no evidence of my</span></p> <p><span id="s225">brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">00:40:00 They just pulled us out.</span> <span id="s227">It is a vivid memory, mostly of their tears, their complete sense of helplessness.</span> <span id="s228">They knew where they were going.</span> <span id="s229">I did not.</span> <span id="s230">We stayed in Maline for about</span></p> <p><span id="s231">00:40:30 Four of five days.</span> <span id="s232">We were transported by bus, or rather "camions," its a truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">00:41:00 The days at Maline are vivid to me, because there was no way there my parents could protect me for others' conversation.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">00:41:30 Although I didn't understand what was going on brut I saw</span></p> <p><span id="s235">people suffering.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">00:42:00 The week after Easter, 1943, we went on the train, and that was that.</span> <span id="s237">My memory of the train</span></p> <p><span id="s238">00:42:30 My parents had become two very old people.</span> <span id="s239">The memories are that of the stench, of the screaming, of my mother putting a spoon through the bars</span></p> <p><span id="s240">00:43:00 to collect rain, to get some water to give me.</span> <span id="s241">Where she had gotten it I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">00:43:30 We had cans of condensed milk, and of her stuffing me with it, hoping to - I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">00:44:00 We were on the train for days.</span> <span id="s244">Then we arrived in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s245">As I have told you, I have gone back three times now.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">00:44:30 I call it the end of the line.</span> <span id="s247">And for me it is.</span> <span id="s248">Again, its the things you know and that have been written about.</span> <span id="s249">Its.</span> <span id="s250">at</span></p> <p><span id="s251">that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">00:45:00 I was holding on to my mother's arm and vice versa, and by hindsight that was probably a big mistake.</span> <span id="s253">The fact that I was holding on so dearly to her</span></p> <p><span id="s254">00:45:30 probably contributed to her going to the right and me to the left.</span> <span id="s255">My father went to the men's camp, she went straight into</span></p> <p><span id="s256">the crematorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">00:46:00 I went into the camp.</span> <span id="s258">I have very vivid memories of prisoners - of coming out of the train and looking at skeleton</span></p> <p><span id="s259">walking.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">00:46:30 Trying to grab whatever we had.</span> <span id="s261">I said to you earlier I had become something of a robot doing what I was supposed to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">00:47:00 Talking very little.</span> <span id="s263">And i think at that point I became a robot.</span> <span id="s264">- Seeing - being pulled from my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">00:47:30 I don't talk about the years in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s266">First of all,</span></p> <p><span id="s267">00:48:00 much has been written by people more eloquent than I. My vocabulary doesn't contain any words to describe those years.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">00:48:30 I don't think those words exist in the English language or any language.</span> <span id="s269">I also don't think that's the object of us</span></p> <p><span id="s270">talking together.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">00:49:00 The reality was that, because I was Jewish, my life was stopped.</span> <span id="s272">My mother went into the gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">00:49:30 Two absolutely wonderful human beings who were, "quote", of the wrong religion, who's life was stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">00:50:00 Because of the insanity of a regime.</span> <span id="s275">I saw my father one time.</span> <span id="s276">He gave his ration of potato peels.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">00:50:30 To come to the women's camp to see me.</span> <span id="s278">We did not talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">We both had shaved heads.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">00:51:00 We were very thin.</span> <span id="s281">But again this is a vivid recollection for me.</span> <span id="s282">This was the last time I saw him.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">00:51:30 My assumption is that my father died in the death march when we were evacuated.</span> <span id="s284">I saw him sometime in '44.</span> <span id="s285">I have to</span></p> <p><span id="s286">00:52:00 I think THAT IS APROPOS IF THE TAPE IS GOING TO HAVE some value for young people, one has to find reasons, the absolute</span></p> <p><span id="s287">00:52:30 Lack of where he died, or how, I'm telling you he died of a death march - I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">00:53:00 It makes more sense that way than not to know.</span> <span id="s289">I came back in July, 1945.</span> <span id="s290">I spent three months in a hospital in Leipzig.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Actually what happened - from Auschwitz</span></p> <p><span id="s292">00:53:30 I went to Ravensberg in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s293">I marched - it was the spring of '45.</span> <span id="s294">There were no calendars.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">00:54:00 On the last march - at one point</span></p> <p><span id="s296">00:54:30 I just sat down.</span> <span id="s297">I was a pretty sick kid.</span> <span id="s298">I didn't think about the consequences.</span> <span id="s299">If I was going to die, I was going</span></p> <p><span id="s300">to die.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">00:55:00 The march went on.</span> <span id="s302">There were relatively few SS left with us at that time.</span> <span id="s303">There were few people - really skeletons</span></p> <p><span id="s304">00:55:30 After a while, they continued to march and I got myself up.</span> <span id="s305">I started to walk in the direction opposite to them, and walked right into the arms of two American soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">00:56:00 That's something that's as clear to me as two and two is four.</span> <span id="s307">Then I don't remember how, I found myself in the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">I was transported back by the Red Cross to Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">00:56:30 Q: in 1943, you were 10 or 11, very young, why do you think you were treated as an adult?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: It hard to give you an answer, just as it is hard to answer the question.</span> <span id="s311">"How come you came back?"</span></p> <p><span id="s312">00:57:00 I don't know the answer.</span> <span id="s313">In my better mood days, I would tell you it was just luck.</span> <span id="s314">Pure luck, pure coincidence, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Yes, I am one of the youngest ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">00:57:30 I don't think I looked any more mature than the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">I know a cousin who is still alive, but we haven't talked about this.</span> <span id="s318">I don't know the answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">00:58:00 I don't know whether there were other children in Birkenau, because I never made any connection.</span> <span id="s320">I don't know.</span> <span id="s321">it was not the kind of place where you asked people how old they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">00:58:30 There were not such conversations.</span> <span id="s323">Not there.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Did anyone look out for you because you were a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">00:59:00 No, I think that the emotional shock</span></p> <p><span id="s326">00:59:30 The environment, the people that walked around, the continuous threat, of the kapos, I didn't take care of anybody, and nobody took care of me.</span> <span id="s327">And I don't think that is unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">01:00:00 I have been asked if I tried to survive.</span> <span id="s329">Maybe the answer is yes, but not consciously.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: As a French speaker, you were surrounded by people who were speaking Polish etc.</span> <span id="s331">Did you have anyone to converse with?</span> <span id="s332">did you understand what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: No</span></p> <p><span id="s334">01:00:30 No, I was just there.</span> <span id="s335">I was in such a minority.</span> <span id="s336">I didn't know Yiddish, and I didn't speak Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">01:01:00 I think also, the reality of it, the faces changed, faces disappeared.</span> <span id="s338">People died, or were sent to crematoriums.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">01:01:30 My recollection, and it took me three times going back to Auschwitz, the latrines, it took me until the third time to enter</span></p> <p><span id="s340">the building because</span></p> <p><span id="s341">01:02:00 My memory is the pushing and shoving and the inhumanity to each other because how can one be human when dying.</span> <span id="s342">That's why I said in the beginning that my mother</span></p> <p><span id="s343">01:02:30 Could never have survived this.</span> <span id="s344">She could not have taken two years of this.</span> <span id="s345">My youth is what gave me my strength.</span> <span id="s346">I don't want bluntly to say that there weren't people who tried to help others.</span> <span id="s347">Clearly, when we had to stand on "Apel,"</span></p> <p><span id="s348">01:03:00 There was a great effort to see that everyone in the barracks got out, because you knew that if someone did not, that would be the end.</span> <span id="s349">So, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">01:03:30 There was support in helping people get on their feet, but there was no lasting attachment.</span> <span id="s351">I wouldn't want to leave the impression that people didn't try to be human to others.</span> <span id="s352">But there</span></p> <p><span id="s353">was no</span></p> <p><span id="s354">01:04:00 Lasting connection.</span> <span id="s355">But maybe that was an unconscious way of protecting yourself because there had been so many losses.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Do you want to talk about the kind of work you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">01:04:30 For a while - some of it I will tell you, and some of it not - but for a while I worked in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s358">Peeling potatoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">I passed the spot when I was in Birkenau a few months ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">01:05:00 I also moved stones from one spot to another.</span> <span id="s361">And then back to the other spot.</span> <span id="s362">For a long, long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">01:05:30 I also worked in the factory for a short time, making</span></p> <p><span id="s364">ammunition.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">01:06:00 Did you know where you were marching?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: Absolutely not.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Were there rumors that the war was lost or that the Americans</span></p> <p><span id="s368">were coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">01:06:30 A: Yes, I do remember.</span> <span id="s370">My language handicap kept me much more distant for other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">01:07:00 I didn't encounter many French-speaking people.</span> <span id="s372">When we evacuated Birkenau, it was clear that the SS, the Kapos,</span></p> <p><span id="s373">01:07:30 There was a desperation.</span> <span id="s374">This organization, with its organized life, it was clear that something was happening that we had to leave Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">01:08:00 That the Germans did not have the upper hand anymore.</span> <span id="s376">I can only talk about myself, I was too sick to think about</span></p> <p><span id="s377">liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Aside from malnutrition, was there anything specific?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">01:08:30 Malnutrition.</span> <span id="s380">It takes - living on a ration of food for two years, takes everything out of you.</span> <span id="s381">It was pretty much of a miracle that we could put one foot in front of another.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">01:09:00 Q: And that's what you did, put one foot in front of another, and at night you slept on the ground?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Yes, and I'm also conscious of trying to find the roots of potatoes, in the fields that we would pass.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">01:09:30 Trying to find the roots of something to get some nourishment.</span> <span id="s385">My mouth, by this time was in such deplorable state.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">01:10:00 That I couldn't chew anymore.</span> <span id="s387">So it was literally putting one foot in front of another.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">01:10:30 I think the early separation, the first one being when I went into the boarding school.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">01:11:00 The second separation, at the railroad, was so traumatic to me, that my defense was not to feel anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">01:11:30 It was as simple as that - or as difficult.</span> <span id="s391">Because I'm so geared to young people, so committed to committed to fighting</span></p> <p><span id="s392">against stereotyping</span></p> <p><span id="s393">01:12:00 I try to look at people as people and learn the right lessons from history and not become desperate form what is going round in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">01:12:30 Because in many ways we have not learned at all, and I have to convince myself to do my own thing in my own way to have some peace.</span> <span id="s395">To bring it back</span></p> <p><span id="s396">01:13:00 communication, an explanation, being explicit with people, frankness is so important in my life now.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">01:13:30 Because I've suffered so much from not being told, living in the dark, being open and frank with young people.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">1:14:00 Its so much healthier.</span> <span id="s399">Bring me back.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: The death march.</span> <span id="s401">Did you stay in Ravensbruck?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Yes, but not for long.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">01:14:30 By that time the Germans were being encircled.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: And than to Buchenwald, and then was when you gave up?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Yes</span></p> <p><span id="s406">01:15:00 Then I was liberated, when to a military hospital, and was sent to Belgium by the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s407">I got good care there - I</span></p> <p><span id="s408">was very young.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">01:15:30 There was very little distinction between adults and children because there were no children (in the hospital).</span> <span id="s410">Its interesting - when you have a shaved head, everybody looks alike.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">01:16:00 I was on a military train.</span> <span id="s412">My brother, and an old aunt and uncle of my mother had attempted to trace all of the people in the family who were not around anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">01:16:30 My name was on the list of people who were being traced, and that's how I landed back in Brussels.</span> <span id="s414">This old uncle and aunt advised my brother who was in Holland living with</span></p> <p><span id="s415">01:17:00 my father's brother who had been hidden during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">My brother came to get me and I went t live with him, my father's sister, who had come out of Bergen-Belsen</span></p> <p><span id="s417">01:17:30 I lived in Holland for five years, until 1950, learned Dutch, and never spoke of my experience.</span> <span id="s418">I was never asked.</span> <span id="s419">My aunt, who had been in Bergen-Belsen</span></p> <p><span id="s420">01:18:00 was the one person who could talk to me.</span> <span id="s421">I was very close to her; it was a great loss to me when she died.</span> <span id="s422">She could talk to me about my mother and father.</span> <span id="s423">Those who did not go to camp could not talk me.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">01:18:30 In hindsight, I fully understand it.</span> <span id="s425">It had taken me</span></p> <p><span id="s426">till the</span></p> <p><span id="s427">01:19:00 I went back to Auschwitz the first time in 1978.</span> <span id="s428">I just</span></p> <p><span id="s429">wonder sometimes if</span></p> <p><span id="s430">01:19:30 I had been in an environment in which I was encouraged to talk, if that wouldn't have been healthier for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">01:20:00 As I'm talking t you I'm thinking about it.</span> <span id="s432">Probably the answer would be yes.</span> <span id="s433">I know it was done in good faith.</span> <span id="s434">People didn't want to hurt me.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">01:20:30 Did they understand that I was sad, hurt, that it was healthier to talk?</span> <span id="s436">That was about the time I got in touch with</span></p> <p><span id="s437">facing history.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">01:21:00 That helped me, through I still am not a big talker.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: What was your brother's experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: I have absolutely no idea.</span> <span id="s441">He has never talked about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">01:21:30 My aunt and I, we never talked about it.</span> <span id="s443">There has been so much silence in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">01:22:00 Sometimes I think that I should help him, now that I am a healthier person.</span> <span id="s445">I'm as guilty as everyone else - I don't want to hurt him.</span> <span id="s446">I'm convinced that</span></p> <p><span id="s447">01:22:30 I would be better for him to speak.</span> <span id="s448">But he has to have a choice.</span> <span id="s449">I will be seeing him next month in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">01:23:00 We talk on the telephone quite regularly.</span> <span id="s451">I don't know -</span></p> <p><span id="s452">its scary.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">01:23:30 The very scary part - he has three sons and they have little understanding of what happened.</span> <span id="s454">His oldest son was here</span></p> <p><span id="s455">with me</span></p> <p><span id="s456">01:24:00 a couple of months ago.</span> <span id="s457">His name is Paul Henri.</span> <span id="s458">My mother's name was Esther Henry.</span> <span id="s459">My father was Henri.</span> <span id="s460">My brother gave him the name of Paul Henri.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">01:24:30 And I said, "Paul Henri," something or other.</span> <span id="s462">And he said, you're the only one who calls me Paul henri.</span> <span id="s463">He said everyone called him Paul.</span> <span id="s464">I said I called him Paul Henri because his name was so significant to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">01:25:00 He said, "Why", and I was speechless.</span> <span id="s466">I made it my business to talk to him, and his wife was tremendously helpful.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">01:25:30 I pulled some pictures and we looked together.</span> <span id="s468">He asked me questions about his father and grandparents I happened to have</span></p> <p><span id="s469">a video</span></p> <p><span id="s470">01:26:00 of the trip we had, with Facing History, one part of it, the evening before we went to Birkenau, I did some speaking before</span></p> <p><span id="s471">the group.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">01:26:30 Then he went back to Holland.</span> <span id="s473">I will see him next month in France.</span> <span id="s474">I think it gets to my brother, either because I want to</span></p> <p><span id="s475">respect his choice</span></p> <p><span id="s476">01:27:00 or because I don't have the guts, I'm committed to telling my nephews something of their heritage.</span> <span id="s477">It struck me.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">01:27:30 The time I feel the best is when I go into the classroom and I do very little of it because there are better speakers than I, but when I have, and I feel I have touched the life of one kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">01:28:00 Then I feel good, and it struck me that I don't have to go into the classroom.</span> <span id="s480">My family doesn't know a thing about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">So that's my story.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">01:28:30 Q: You lived in Holland 1945 to 50, and that's where you</span></p> <p><span id="s483">left me?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Ok, I learned Dutch, and I learned English.</span> <span id="s485">I was exempt from English in school because they didn't think English would be important in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">01:29:00 There's a whole gap in my education.</span> <span id="s487">The last two years I went to the School of Social Work in Rotterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">01:29:30 I earned my Master's in social work.</span> <span id="s489">In 1940, there was an opportunity for me to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s490">Friends of</span></p> <p><span id="s491">uncle</span></p> <p><span id="s492">01:30:00 sponsored me and I decided - actually my aunt and uncle decided it would be good for me but I don't know why.</span> <span id="s493">My brother at that point left living in Indonesia.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">01:30:30 Jakarta, and I came to the United States.</span> <span id="s495">My uncle took on a tremendous amount of burden after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">01:31:00 It was a good idea for us to leave and try to set up a life.</span> <span id="s497">It was an easy separation.</span> <span id="s498">I spoke French and Dutch and America was the kind of opportunity.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">01:31:30 One think I forgot was that I didn't speak English.</span> <span id="s500">So I stuffed envelopes at R.H. Macy's.</span> <span id="s501">This was in Manhattan.</span> <span id="s502">I stayed with friends of my uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">01:32:00 New York is so anonymous but it fitted what I thought I needed.</span> <span id="s504">And I stuffed envelopes for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">01:32:30 Until I went to a school for the foreign born and learned English.</span> <span id="s506">I spent my lunch hours calling agencies and was continually asked if I had American experience.</span> <span id="s507">The chief executive officer of a company</span></p> <p><span id="s508">01:33:00 of five people.</span> <span id="s509">I am very successful professionally.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">The thought of not working</span></p> <p><span id="s511">01:33:30 is very threatening to me.</span> <span id="s512">I have to stay occupied.</span> <span id="s513">I think it goes much deeper than that.</span> <span id="s514">I think it goes</span></p> <p><span id="s515">01:34:00 deeper than that.</span> <span id="s516">I think it's a matter of self-esteem.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">I think if you work, and you're fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">01:35:00 I guess I have to keep on going.</span> <span id="s519">It's so much instilled in me.</span> <span id="s520">I just have to keep on going.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">01:35:30 I think a lot about the years in Birkenau, about the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">I don't think that many days that pass that</span></p> <p><span id="s523">01:36:00 there's not something that will remind.</span> <span id="s524">Or phrases that people use.</span> <span id="s525">let it pass.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">01:36:30 I am very aware that it's an issue for me.</span> <span id="s527">I have to be careful to keep it in focus, because not have strong bonds, then you can't lose them.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">01:37:00 And if you have them, then you risk to have tremendous pain again.</span> <span id="s529">So, any way</span></p> <p><span id="s530">01:37:50 I've talked more this afternoon than for a long time, if ever.</span> <span id="s531">You are a wonderful interviewer.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">.</span> <span id="s533">END.</span></p></body></html>
