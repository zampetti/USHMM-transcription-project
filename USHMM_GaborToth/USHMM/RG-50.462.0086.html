I was born in 1928, on July 2nd.</span> <span id="s18">My mother was the oldest of seven children.</span> <span id="s19">The first three children, no, no, the first three were girls in my grandfather's house.</span> <span id="s20">Then came a boy, a meshiekhel [little messiah].</span> <span id="s21">My grandfather was the rabbi, a rabbi and a shochet.</span> <span id="s22">Actually his profession was a shochet.</span> <span id="s23">You know what that...</span></p> <p><span id="s24">LH: Yes, a slaughterer.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">RH: Slaughterer, right.</span> <span id="s26">Well this is a very dignified position in those days for a religious person.</span> <span id="s27">I come from a religious background.</span> <span id="s28">Then the rabbi of our town died, which not to my knowledge, but I remember the rebbetsin being a widow.</span> <span id="s29">So my zayde [grandfather]was the rov, of, the rabbi, the rov, not rabbi.</span> <span id="s30">Rabbi is a modern expression, but the rov of the town, he with the white beard, and he was the rov of the town.</span> <span id="s31">Because we have to sell chometz, people had to ask shayles [questions].</span> <span id="s32">Then the rebbetsin's daughters grew up.</span> <span id="s33">And one married a rov, and he became rov.</span> <span id="s34">In the meantime my zayde, being an older person, was ailing, and he died, my grandfather.</span> <span id="s35">But, one of my uncles, which is my mother's brothers, became a shochet as a young boy.</span> <span id="s36">And he married a girl, and he moved to a different town.</span> <span id="s37">We were a prominent family in our town.</span> <span id="s38">My grandmother, being she was [unclear] with girls--see my grandmother was a business lady--to provide for the family.</span> <span id="s39">In World War II, in World War I, they ran away from Russia, my grandmother, my grandmother being as a young child, or infant or something, I don't know exactly the year.</span> <span id="s40">They ran away from Russia because of the pogroms, or the persecutions of the Jews in Russia.</span> <span id="s41">And they settled in a small town.</span> <span id="s42">Maybe they settled to a different town, but since my grandmother and my grandfather are not here, [unclear] dead history.</span> <span id="s43">But they settled in a town, which in Yiddish it's called Krevitz [phonetic].</span></p> <p><span id="s44">LH: Krevitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">RH: Krevitz.</span> <span id="s46">In Polish it's pronounced Krzywicze.</span> <span id="s47">In Russian, Kree-vee-chee [phonetic].</span> <span id="s48">The reason I say in the three languages, because this is the languages were spoken in my town.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">LH: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">RH: The Jews spoke Yiddish, and in order to communicate with a, with the farmers [unclear]with the others, with the Gentiles.</span> <span id="s51">Some were Poles.</span> <span id="s52">You speak Polish to them maybe.</span> <span id="s53">And some were Russians, or White Russians, or Belorussia.</span> <span id="s54">You speak their native language.</span> <span id="s55">You know, the Jewish people are people of the book, and they learned.</span> <span id="s56">And that's why, we spoke their language, and they hardly could speak ours.</span> <span id="s57">We had, goyim [non-Jews]; we always had a maid.</span> <span id="s58">She had Sunday the day off.</span> <span id="s59">And on Shabbes, being a very religious family she didn’t housework either, maybe bring some water from the well or wash the dishes.</span> <span id="s60">And she also had a day off.</span> <span id="s61">We had neighbors.</span> <span id="s62">My grandmother being a business lady; why was she a business lady?</span> <span id="s63">There was a house with seven children.</span> <span id="s64">And my zayde was a shochet.</span> <span id="s65">So how many chickens a week he would shkite during the week?</span> <span id="s66">Only for Shabbes.</span> <span id="s67">Or how many cows he would slaughter for the small population of our town?</span> <span id="s68">So my zayde was a learned man, a scholarly man.</span> <span id="s69">He would sit and learn and study the Gemara.</span> <span id="s70">And I remember stories from years back.</span> <span id="s71">The soldiers came to our town, and my grandmother baked bread and sold bread to them.</span> <span id="s72">Now what was her profit?</span> <span id="s73">They were give her ten pounds of flour.</span> <span id="s74">And she had to give them back ten pounds of bread.</span> <span id="s75">So whatever, when you bake bread and put in water and yeast, you get more, more weight than what you put in.</span> <span id="s76">And meat, when you cook, it shrinks.</span> <span id="s77">You put in a pound and you take out less.</span> <span id="s78">But in bread, or in cake, you put in a little bit and you go still a lot.</span> <span id="s79">So this was the arrangement with the officer, for her labors, the extra pounds of bread was her profit, for the labor that she baked for the soldiers the bread.</span> <span id="s80">Maybe a 100 pounds of bread she'd make.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">LH: This was your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">RH: No, my grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">LH: Your grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">RH: When they just came and settled into the town.</span> <span id="s85">Then, this is World War I. And being they were soldiers stationed in our town, this was the profit that my grandmother made.</span> <span id="s86">So when she saw they are soldiers, she provided, so she would bring them cigarettes, or tobacco and sell them.</span> <span id="s87">And that's how she got involved being into business.</span> <span id="s88">That's how she got herself involved into business.</span> <span id="s89">She would go to Minsk, or in other cities, and this was legal, and to sell maybe thread, maybe buttons, maybe this.</span> <span id="s90">And then she started out into business.</span> <span id="s91">Salt was a big thing, salt, sugar.</span> <span id="s92">And she would bring from the big city from the houses with a little food to sell it to the local people.</span> <span id="s93">And that's how my grandmother got involved in the business.</span> <span id="s94">As the children were growing up, they helped out.</span> <span id="s95">And every time, but my grandmother was also busy having babies, and having more children.</span> <span id="s96">So the older children were running the business.</span> <span id="s97">The older children were running the business.</span> <span id="s98">And then, by the, by '39, we had a big store, like a general store.</span> <span id="s99">Because by then the children grew up, and they were running the business.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">LH: This is your parents' generation?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s102">In order, this is, you asked me what...</span></p> <p><span id="s103">LH: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">RH: Where does the family come from.</span> <span id="s105">So I'm just bringing you a foreword...</span></p> <p><span id="s106">LH: I got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">RH: With my, I come both.</span> <span id="s108">In those days, it was very prominent to be scholarly in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s109">So my zayde was a rov for part time.</span> <span id="s110">When the alte [old] rov is geshtorben, died, and then my zayde was a shochet.</span> <span id="s111">This all comes later, I'm telling you.</span> <span id="s112">But we were searched to, to kill us, during the Holocaust, because we were the shochet’s family.</span> <span id="s113">So, I'm just telling you a little background.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">LH: O.K.</span> <span id="s115">Now tell me a little bit about your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">RH: O.K., my parents.</span> <span id="s117">I--my father was killed, and I, it was a long time so, and I was an only child, and I was with my mother, hiding out with my mother.</span> <span id="s118">And my mother’s sister...</span></p> <p><span id="s119">LH: What do you remember about your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">RH: Very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">LH: Very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">RH: Very little.</span> <span id="s123">Because, you have to understand, it's 40 years back.</span> <span id="s124">My father was a businessman.</span> <span id="s125">My father was also learned in Talmud because he went to yeshivah.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">LH: And he...</span></p> <p><span id="s127">RH: And he was, being my mother was the first daughter to get married, and she came from that, from a prominent family for that era in that town.</span> <span id="s128">You see you have lots of scholars in Philadelphia or in New York, but in a small shtetl, the people is the working class.</span> <span id="s129">And he had a good business, and a scholar.</span> <span id="s130">So my mother of course married somebody equal.</span> <span id="s131">He's a fine, prominent family from a different town called [unclear].</span> <span id="s132">She, but, I took, when my mother married my father, I don't remember his parents, because I'm named after the grandmother.</span> <span id="s133">And I have cousins from my father's side who were older than I, and, but they were named after the grandfather.</span> <span id="s134">So I realized that when my mother married my father that, he had no parents at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">LH: What was your life like before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">RH: Before the war, as you see of my age, I was a little girl, going to school, to a, to public school, to Polish public school.</span> <span id="s137">I had friends.</span> <span id="s138">On Shabbes we didn't go to school.</span> <span id="s139">After school, I learned in cheder, in order to learn Hebrew, the prayers, chumash [Bible], whatever was appropriate for my age group.</span> <span id="s140">You started as a seven-year-old.</span> <span id="s141">You learned just Siddur, to read and to write.</span> <span id="s142">You get older, you learn Chumash.</span> <span id="s143">You get a little bit older you learn Novi [Prophets].</span></p> <p><span id="s144">LH: Tell me a little about the Polish school.</span> <span id="s145">Did you have friends who were non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">RH: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s147">I had friends who were not Jewish; they were a little bit anti-Semitic, some were not, as among children, it happens.</span> <span id="s148">Like on Shabbes, or Yom Kippur, I did not go to school.</span> <span id="s149">We would come to the Gentile girls and ask them for homework, and bring them a slice of challah to taste, some our challah which my mother made from homemade, homebaked, or a piece of cake, which my mother baked for Shabbes, for homemade, some to take to school.</span> <span id="s150">For Pesach we bring a few pieces of matzah, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s151">LH: Do you remember how your family got along with the non-Jewish neighbors?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">RH: Nice, nice.</span> <span id="s153">I remember, people would come.</span> <span id="s154">I remember we didn't--one lady, she used to have miscarriages a lot.</span> <span id="s155">And my mother would help her, and for her remedies, what to do when she was pregnant, she shouldn't have a miscarriage the next time.</span> <span id="s156">And then finally, after the miscarried, she had a little girl.</span> <span id="s157">And the girl, there were worms in her stomach.</span> <span id="s158">And my mother was telling her and teaching her how to take care of the child, for the worms to come out.</span> <span id="s159">There is one worm which is called, very long one, three feet long, how to do it, for the little girl, what medicines to give her, what food to give her, what to put in the potty that the worms should want to come up, smell the good food, smell the boiling milk.</span> <span id="s160">Other women would come and tell with a child with his temperature.</span> <span id="s161">My mother would give them remedies what to do, tell them, from homemade remedies what to do.</span> <span id="s162">We got along well with the people.</span> <span id="s163">I remember my mother, or my grandmother, giving cigarettes to the farmers who would come in.</span> <span id="s164">Or people, they would come to the house like with stories, they had a fire and their farm burned down, lend them money they should be able to build up the farm.</span> <span id="s165">And then they would gradually pay off the money.</span> <span id="s166">We got along well.</span> <span id="s167">We tried to get along well.</span> <span id="s168">We n-…</span></p> <p><span id="s169">LH: Did your family belong to any Zionist organizations, or...</span></p> <p><span id="s170">RH: I..</span> <span id="s171">.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">LH: Any other Jewish...</span></p> <p><span id="s173">RH: To tell you the truth, as far as I remember, being that I was a little girl, so, I remember, well--you, like, I went to public school.</span> <span id="s174">And after school we come to the shul.</span> <span id="s175">And I had a, there was a rebbe, and he put me in a group, me and two boys, to learn siddur.</span> <span id="s176">But then, the m--every week, on a Wednesday, we would have a farm day, which all the farmers would bring in their goods to sell - the eggs and the chickens, and the mushrooms in summertime.</span> <span id="s177">And the berries in summertime.</span> <span id="s178">Wintertime the dried mushrooms, [unclear] products, and wheat, and potatoes, and vegetables.</span> <span id="s179">And the Jewish people, or the other people who didn't have vegetables, if they had their own gardens, would buy from their products or the eggs, would buy, and the butter, and the chickens, buy from them.</span> <span id="s180">They would have the money, and they would come to the Jewish stores, and buy goods, salt, and needles and thread, and fabric and galoshes, and shoes, and stockings, and whatever they need.</span> <span id="s181">And herring, and pots, and pails, and sickles, to cut the wheat.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">LH: Tools.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">RH: And to cut in the hay.</span> <span id="s184">They had no tractors in those days.</span> <span id="s185">And I remember they offering, always giving us cigarettes, [unclear] or candy, because he came from a long [unclear] of walking by foot.</span> <span id="s186">So we, we helped each other.</span> <span id="s187">We did business.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">LH: Do you have any recollection of Jewish organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">RH: Oh, yes, so, every Wednesday, after the day was over, the fair was over, they were coming people to the storekeepers to collect money, to build a building to make a Jewish school for the children.</span> <span id="s190">The building was done, but somehow we never got organized, only maybe a year or two before the war, before '39.</span> <span id="s191">But if you had organized, they had a formal school, maybe like [unclear].</span> <span id="s192">But we learned in that school, after the public school we come home and had, whatever, a snack, and go back to that school.</span> <span id="s193">And have a rebbe, and he made us groups.</span> <span id="s194">While teaching me siddur, he would give others to write.</span> <span id="s195">While reviewing their writing, they would give us to write.</span> <span id="s196">This one teacher had a few groups where he would orally test us if we know.</span> <span id="s197">And so we learned in that school.</span> <span id="s198">But I remember coming like there were organizational stuff.</span> <span id="s199">But I can't remember what organization.</span> <span id="s200">I was a little girl, they put up a space [unclear].</span> <span id="s201">I remember speeches.</span> <span id="s202">And I remember there was a posek [interpretation] of Dr. Herzl, and maybe it was his yahrzeit [anniversary of a death].</span> <span id="s203">I me--I don't remember what organization it was, but it was some kind of a celebration.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">LH: You don't have any recollection of your family participating in the organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">RH: Well, my grandmother, O.K., my grandmother was an older person, you understand?</span> <span id="s206">So, I don't think my grandmother went.</span> <span id="s207">And my mother, I don't know, maybe she was busy after a whole day's work.</span> <span id="s208">Maybe when they had this evening, maybe my family all went to this.</span> <span id="s209">But, as a child I was anxious to go much earlier, to get myself a space, where they came in later.</span> <span id="s210">There was an organizational life in our town.</span> <span id="s211">There was an organization life.</span> <span id="s212">But, being I was seven or eight.</span> <span id="s213">Take a child now, I, or nine...</span></p> <p><span id="s214">LH: Well, O.K., you were eleven when...</span></p> <p><span id="s215">RH: When the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">LH: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">RH: Then is no organization.</span> <span id="s218">But till then, let's say in '35 or in '36, I remember being in some kind of meetings.</span> <span id="s219">But I can't remember from what organization or however.</span> <span id="s220">I remember being in meetings.</span> <span id="s221">I remember going to them.</span> <span id="s222">And let’s say the meeting's called for 6:00, we were also sitting there from 4:00 waiting.</span> <span id="s223">Maybe later on my mother or my aunts or uncles came in, too.</span> <span id="s224">But, for children, we should be quiet, we were happy that they let us sit there.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">LH: Did you have any idea of the Nazis in the time before they invaded?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">RH: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">LH: What sort of news...</span></p> <p><span id="s228">RH: We had a, we had, in our family, we had a radio.</span> <span id="s229">So we heard news.</span> <span id="s230">Of course, the newspaper was coming to me also.</span> <span id="s231">We also had a newspaper every day.</span> <span id="s232">But with the radio I could hear.</span> <span id="s233">It was in Polish, so I could hear.</span> <span id="s234">And we heard about Nazis being in Germany, about Hitler being--we were hearing that the German people are running away, to Poland, or to France.</span> <span id="s235">But this was in '38, let's say, during, we heard on the radio that the Germans invaded Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s236">And Germany invaded Austria, other countries, including [unclear], let's say in March, it was very strong news, in March.</span> <span id="s237">That's, before Pesach, and very strong news between the border, Polish soldiers, the Polish-German border, Polish soldiers were shot, or something, something was bad news, [unclear] bad news.</span> <span id="s238">I remember one instance, that our radio, the battery went out.</span> <span id="s239">There wasn't electricity like we have here, it was a battery.</span> <span id="s240">And this expired, the battery.</span> <span id="s241">So my grandmother went across the street to the druggist, they had a radio, to hear news there.</span> <span id="s242">Because my grandmother was very worried about the war, because she had three young men in the house.</span> <span id="s243">She had two sons and a son-in-law, and a third son who was a shochet, who was already married in a different town.</span> <span id="s244">So she wasn't worried about him, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s245">LH: So the son-in-law was your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">RH: No, the son-in-law was my aunt's husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">LH: Your father wasn't in the...</span></p> <p><span id="s248">RH: He was a businessman.</span> <span id="s249">A businessman, my father.</span> <span id="s250">But this was [unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s251">LH: I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s252">I don't understand.</span> <span id="s253">What does that mean?</span> <span id="s254">That means that he didn't live with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">RH: He lived with us, but not in this house.</span> <span id="s256">We lived in a different house.</span> <span id="s257">But my grandmother was worried, because she had two young sons.</span> <span id="s258">One just finished the army, just finished the two years' time of the army, like, everybody had to go at the age of 20 or 21 had to go to serve two years in the army, to learn training.</span> <span id="s259">I, he was enlisted.</span> <span id="s260">Who wants to go?</span> <span id="s261">But there was, forced.</span> <span id="s262">You had to come to the army.</span> <span id="s263">If you're eligible, unless you’re sick or crippled or something.</span> <span id="s264">So, she had three young sons and a young son-in-law, very close [unclear] that she felt if there's a war, they will be drafted.</span> <span id="s265">Let's see, maybe my father was older a little bit, so maybe she wasn't worried about him as much.</span> <span id="s266">There's also ages involved.</span> <span id="s267">So she went to the druggist to get the news, and then she got a cold, and after that she got pneumonia, and she died, in a very short, in one week from this my grandmother died.</span> <span id="s268">And this was a very big shock to the family.</span> <span id="s269">And she left Erev Pesach [Eve of Passover].</span> <span id="s270">And because she went, because this winter there was snow, and warm in the house and it was cold outside.</span> <span id="s271">And she didn't maybe have a sweater on [unclear].</span> <span id="s272">We had very cold winters there...</span></p> <p><span id="s273">LH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">RH: In the northern parts, where I come from.</span> <span id="s275">And she got pneumonia.</span> <span id="s276">And this is before Pesach.</span> <span id="s277">So I remember hearing, and I di--the reason she went there is because of news [unclear] Hitler.</span> <span id="s278">And in '39, on September 3rd the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">LH: So what happened then?</span> <span id="s280">What happened to you immediately?</span> <span id="s281">How did you know about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">RH: I, we had a minyan [quorum of ten adults] in the house, saying kaddish [prayer for a dead person] for my grandmother.</span> <span id="s283">See, we were a close family.</span> <span id="s284">And I came in and the radio was on.</span> <span id="s285">And I heard the news that, somebody was bombing already.</span> <span id="s286">[Unclear] that cities were bombed, and there's a war.</span> <span id="s287">I was telling everybody, "There's a war."</span> <span id="s288">And they couldn't believe me.</span> <span id="s289">They said, "Well how do you know?</span> <span id="s290">What are you talking about?"</span> <span id="s291">I said, "I just heard it on the radio.</span> <span id="s292">I just heard on the radio."</span> <span id="s293">The radio was on and people were busy eating breakfast.</span> <span id="s294">See the radio's in the living room, the breakfast was in the kitchen or the dining room and they, you know.</span> <span id="s295">I heard it, and I mean I came in to get something, and I just heard.</span> <span id="s296">"There's a war!</span> <span id="s297">There's a war!"</span> <span id="s298">Maybe I didn't hear exactly what all they said, because it's 40 some years back to remember what the words...</span></p> <p><span id="s299">LH: Yeah, well then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">RH: There was a war, and fighting.</span> <span id="s301">Fighting.</span> <span id="s302">I remember when there was a, when you were supposed to, the windows supposed to cover with blankets.</span> <span id="s303">There's not supposed to be lights in the house.</span> <span id="s304">There was a curfew, not to be out in the street beyond certain hours.</span> <span id="s305">We were very concerned.</span> <span id="s306">We heard about the bombings in the big cities.</span> <span id="s307">This, it was a Blitzkrieg ["lightening war"-for quick victory].</span> <span id="s308">Six o'clock in the morning they were bombing, and the delegate, a German delegate came to tell the Polish government eight o'clock in the morning when the offices open up, that there's a war.</span> <span id="s309">Hitler declare a war.</span> <span id="s310">We were upset.</span> <span id="s311">I mean, we're hearing this is Germany.</span> <span id="s312">But we knew what Hitler was like.</span> <span id="s313">Maybe we, maybe the, by then they didn't have the concentration camps, yet.</span> <span id="s314">We knew it was bad.</span> <span id="s315">We didn't know how bad, but it was bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">LH: Now do you remember your parents talking about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">RH: Everybody was talking.</span> <span id="s318">Everybody was talking.</span> <span id="s319">Everybody talked.</span> <span id="s320">I mean, you go on the street, you, you eavesdrop, hearing people talk.</span> <span id="s321">Everybody talked.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">LH: But you don't remember your parents specifically discussing it at home, or...</span></p> <p><span id="s323">RH: Everybody talked.</span> <span id="s324">That's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">LH: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">RH: I mean, who talked to us from 45 years back and I was 11 years old.</span> <span id="s327">How can I pinpoint exactly who talked to me?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">LH: Gee, I don't know.</span> <span id="s329">O.K. Look, so what happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">RH: Before you to judge me, put yourself when you were 11 years old.</span> <span id="s331">I mean, specific occasions who talked about what?</span> <span id="s332">If it was a week before the war, or maybe it was a week during the war.</span> <span id="s333">But we were afraid there's going to be a shortage of food.</span> <span id="s334">We had a store.</span> <span id="s335">So we had the groceries.</span> <span id="s336">So I remember my mommy sending me to the next town, to a wholesaler, I should buy soap and salt and whatever I can buy.</span> <span id="s337">She gave me money, and I went with a horse and wagon, with a pa--with a man that my mother rented him, he'll be shlepping [carrying], but I should be the one to handle the money to buy as much as I can.</span> <span id="s338">So I remember in the wholesaler's and my putting down a list, five pieces of long bars of soap.</span> <span id="s339">And then you cut it into pieces.</span> <span id="s340">And then everybody was hopping.</span> <span id="s341">Everybody was grabbing a lot.</span> <span id="s342">I bought more soaps, even more than my mother had told me.</span> <span id="s343">If my mother put me down five sacks of salt, I bought more salt.</span> <span id="s344">Because this, those things are very necessary to surviving, because it's not something you can grow this on the farm, but salt.</span> <span id="s345">And if there's a war we wouldn't have any.</span> <span id="s346">And even for a pound of salt we could get a few pounds of bread from a farmer.</span> <span id="s347">They'll be needing salt and we'll be needing bread, or needing wheat, or meat or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">LH: O.K., so the Blitzkrieg was on.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">RH: The Blitzkrieg was on.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">LH: And it's coming closer to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">RH: But we were far...</span></p> <p><span id="s352">LH: Well what do you remember about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">RH: We were far away, see.</span> <span id="s354">We were near the Russian border, and this was Poland.</span> <span id="s355">The Blitzkrieg was on, near the German border.</span> <span id="s356">Of course, the Luftwaffe was very good, but still not as advanced as today.</span> <span id="s357">They bombed, Polish, the Polish soldiers was very good, but they didn't have anywhere to fight.</span> <span id="s358">They were very patriotic, the Polish soldiers.</span> <span id="s359">Of course the Jewish soldiers who were in the army also were very patriotic.</span> <span id="s360">But they were bare hands.</span> <span id="s361">Because of the Blitzkrieg, all their supplies were cut off.</span> <span id="s362">And one morning, they used to put on, being the radio stations in the big cities were bombed, we did not hear the news.</span> <span id="s363">So we used to put on the Minsk radio, the Russian stations, which by air we were only twenty-some kilometers.</span> <span id="s364">So the waves would pick up the news from the Russians.</span> <span id="s365">And we would hear from their news.</span> <span id="s366">Also we were very happy when France and England declared the war to Germany.</span> <span id="s367">We hoped, being they're coming out to help, maybe.</span> <span id="s368">Maybe somehow the Germans would not reach us.</span> <span id="s369">So we tried to listen to news.</span> <span id="s370">But that [unclear], September 17th the Russians came to us.</span> <span id="s371">It was early in the morning.</span> <span id="s372">They put on the radio, and I heard the Russians crossed the border.</span> <span id="s373">And what was their speech?</span> <span id="s374">They want to take their brethren, White Russians and Ukrainians, under their wings, to survive under their, under their what...</span></p> <p><span id="s375">LH: Under their wings, under their protections.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">RH: Under their protection, their brethren.</span> <span id="s377">And they crossed the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">LH: So...</span></p> <p><span id="s379">RH: So you know what, in a way we were happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">LH: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">RH: We were happy.</span> <span id="s382">Because it's coming the Russians, but not coming the Germans.</span> <span id="s383">And we were happy.</span> <span id="s384">It was the day after Rosh Hashanah, and this was Tzom Gedaliah, [Fast of Gedaliah], it was a fasting day.</span> <span id="s385">And as was customary on that day, also on Tisha B’Av, to go to the cemetery.</span> <span id="s386">I don't know the reasons why.</span> <span id="s387">But for small children it was a big deal because in the cemetery, to see the monuments of the grandparents.</span> <span id="s388">And everybody was going, and everybody was shushken [whispering], telling each other, "Did you hear the news?</span> <span id="s389">Did you hear the news?"</span> <span id="s390">The Russians are across the border.</span> <span id="s391">We were afraid.</span> <span id="s392">Then the Polish were running away.</span> <span id="s393">We were afraid.</span> <span id="s394">There was a bridge in our town.</span> <span id="s395">We were afraid they might burn the bridge, which I think they did.</span> <span id="s396">And couldn’t find out if didn't burn the bridge.</span> <span id="s397">Because then we could get no, no communication from the other side of the town where they burned the bridge already or bombed the bridge or something.</span> <span id="s398">And the Russians came.</span> <span id="s399">And they made local militsia, because for anarchy, from, from, hoodlums, from lootering, from loiting [she must mean looting and loitering], from anything, so, local people made guards with sticks to walk in the streets to watch.</span> <span id="s400">And these Jewish boys joined also, and the Gentiles.</span> <span id="s401">It was like the town, till a government will be settled.</span> <span id="s402">Till the Polish run away and the Russians didn't arrive yet.</span> <span id="s403">So we needed, from local, local protection.</span> <span id="s404">And then shortly after, the school went back to normal.</span> <span id="s405">The school was established.</span> <span id="s406">I went back to school.</span> <span id="s407">They tried to teach us the Russian alphabet, the White Russian alphabet.</span> <span id="s408">I suppose, the lessons that being in Russian, a White Russian, Russian songs.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">LH: So was your life much different with the Russians there from...</span></p> <p><span id="s410">RH: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s411">Life was much different.</span> <span id="s412">First of all, and they started arresting people and sending them to Siberia.</span> <span id="s413">And in this they took first people who were first, prestigious people, like who was a Polish officer, they took them.</span> <span id="s414">Who was a judge, or a lawyer.</span> <span id="s415">they arrested them.</span> <span id="s416">And, of course, some of the rich people.</span> <span id="s417">They took people from our town who were rich.</span> <span id="s418">I don't know whether they accused them of capitalism, or whatever.</span> <span id="s419">And we were also afraid it might be our family, too.</span> <span id="s420">We were afraid it might be us also.</span> <span id="s421">So we tried to disperse.</span> <span id="s422">Everybody tried to leave our, the town.</span> <span id="s423">And it was a different town, where nobody knew us.</span> <span id="s424">And then get a menial job, and to work.</span> <span id="s425">And nobody would know you are a capitalist or Bourgeois.</span> <span id="s426">They would call a Bourgeois, which means rich people.</span> <span id="s427">So we were also scared of them, that they might do that.</span> <span id="s428">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s429">LH: So you moved out of the town while the Russians were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">RH: Right.</span> <span id="s431">Right.</span> <span id="s432">So we were afraid.</span> <span id="s433">Life was much different.</span> <span id="s434">First of all, we were religious people from our background, and this was deprived.</span> <span id="s435">So I remember crying to my mother that I had to go Shabbes to school.</span> <span id="s436">My mother said, "We are in goles [diaspora].</span> <span id="s437">What can you go?</span> <span id="s438">You better go to school.</span> <span id="s439">Try not to write."</span> <span id="s440">So I went to school not to write, wearing my Shabbes dress.</span> <span id="s441">But then we had to write, so again I was upset.</span> <span id="s442">My mother said, “We are in goles.</span> <span id="s443">You have to visit city.</span> <span id="s444">Otherwise, they might send us to Siberia or take us to jail.</span> <span id="s445">What can you do?”</span></p> <p><span id="s446">LH: So, did your whole family, or, where did you go?</span> <span id="s447">What was the town you went to?</span> <span id="s448">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">RH: Went where?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">LH: When you left your hometown because the...</span></p> <p><span id="s451">RH: We weren't really, we were in Krevitz till the Germans came.</span> <span id="s452">And then we left the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">LH: Oh, you were in Krevitz till the Germans came.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">RH: Which is shortly after, a year-and-a-half after.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">LH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">RH: They came in September '39, and in '41, June, July, the Germans came, in '41.</span> <span id="s457">So with the school year was '39-'40, and '40-'41.</span> <span id="s458">The school year was over and the Germans came.</span> <span id="s459">The Germans came.</span> <span id="s460">So people took the shkotsim [non-Jews], the local hoodlums, the teenagers, they're throwing rocks at Jews.</span> <span id="s461">They throw at one old man a rock and he fell.</span> <span id="s462">He hurt his head, and he died a few days later.</span> <span id="s463">They took a few people and they accused them of being Communists and they shot them.</span> <span id="s464">So, of course, the mood it leaves the people, some hoodlums, local, who throw rocks in the windows at night.</span> <span id="s465">So we were all huddled up in one room.</span> <span id="s466">And with six, cause we slept under the beds.</span> <span id="s467">Because we lived not in big apartment houses like here.</span> <span id="s468">One floor houses.</span> <span id="s469">So if the rock falls in and the glass, it falls on you and you get hurt, with the rock and the glass.</span> <span id="s470">So we go to slept under the beds.</span> <span id="s471">So the rock and the glass will fall on the bed.</span> <span id="s472">Especially on Sundays, they would get drunk with the homemade samovanke [phonetic], this is homemade liquor that they made on their own, the moonshine.</span> <span id="s473">And they would get drunk, and then go and, it was a mitzveh [good deed] to hurt a Jew.</span> <span id="s474">It was a mitzveh to them.</span> <span id="s475">So, you know, like teenagers are.</span> <span id="s476">Some are rebellious, and here they had the opportunity.</span> <span id="s477">But, I must tell you, this one time a woman was passing by a house, and she saw that a Gentile woman was hitting her son, with a strap.</span> <span id="s478">And she was hitting him because he was among the shkotsim the night before, throwing rocks at Jewish families.</span> <span id="s479">She felt embarrassed that her son was in this group.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">LH: Huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">RH: The Gen--the Jewish woman walked by a Gentile house, and the mother was hitting the son with a strap.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">LH: Yes, I heard you.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">RH: I want to emphasize.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">LH: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">RH: And the mother was hitting this, the son with a strap, or with a piece of wood, with something, feeling embarrassed that her son, that that teenager, maybe 16, 17, was among the hoodlums throwing rocks.</span> <span id="s486">She does not want to be embarrassed for her neighbors and for the Jews that her son was among the hoodlums throwing the rocks at a Jewish family.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">LH: Now was there much anti-Semitism before, or did this all just seem to come up?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">RH: Before the war, anti-Semitism was such, not so much to hit a, in my small town, not so much to hit a Jew as to support the Gentile, with the strength of Gentile stores with groceries or other stores, to support the local, the local businesses.</span> <span id="s489">Not to buy from the Jewish people, but to buy from the l--to support the Gentile stores, to support them.</span> <span id="s490">Here the Jewish people were in the businesses, small grocery, selling nafta [kerosene] for the kerosene lamps, selling sugar, selling flour, selling herring.</span> <span id="s491">Herring was a big deal.</span> <span id="s492">Because it was a poor section where we lived.</span> <span id="s493">Northern part was mostly farming, no industry.</span> <span id="s494">There were a few Jewish tailors in town, a few Jewish shoemakers, tailors, shoemakers.</span> <span id="s495">So they had Gentile apprentices, taught them the trade.</span> <span id="s496">We had a store, very few sales clerks.</span> <span id="s497">And I was also working.</span> <span id="s498">Later on before the war we even took in bicycles to sell, and parts.</span> <span id="s499">We had a man, a Gentile man, who would put the bicycles together.</span> <span id="s500">First we brought in one summer, regular bicycles.</span> <span id="s501">Then we put in parts to put them together, a bigger profit, to sell parts also.</span> <span id="s502">We had a man who assembled them for us.</span> <span id="s503">We had Polish friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">LH: So what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">RH: During, in '30, in '41, when the Germans came, and they were going to the front, and the army would come into the town, the battalion or army, I don't know, or division or whatever, or a small group, we were afraid that they might hurt us.</span> <span id="s506">So my mother tried to put us children to sleep over the night with goyishe families, with Gentile families.</span> <span id="s507">My mother would go early and ask them to, if she could bring over the children, because they felt, in case there is a pogrom or something, as adults they could run faster.</span> <span id="s508">And us as children would be caught, and wouldn't be able to keep up, and would hinder them.</span> <span id="s509">So many times we slept over in Gentile families, me and my cousins slept over in Gentile houses.</span> <span id="s510">And they would give us bread and milk.</span> <span id="s511">We were allowed to eat bread and butter and milk.</span> <span id="s512">And we would stay over the night.</span> <span id="s513">The next morning everything's quiet.</span> <span id="s514">My mother would come and get us.</span> <span id="s515">Some in town, or, usually in the outskirts, further from the town, not in the center.</span> <span id="s516">Because center was...</span></p> <p><span id="s517">LH: That was where it would happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">RH: Yeah, it wasn't that safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">LH: Let me ask you what happened when the Germans came.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">RH: When the Germans came, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s521">Whether the Germans gave the word, or the local militsia [militia], I don't know, but we were not allowed to walk on sidewalks, and we had to walk in the middle of the street.</span> <span id="s522">And in our town there weren't too many Germans, maybe one or two people who ruled the town.</span> <span id="s523">The only thing is the soldiers going to the front.</span> <span id="s524">They would come to the houses and rob, rob, look for jewelry or look for clothing, and take and send home to their families.</span> <span id="s525">Also, I remember as, I saw them approaching on my street from far, I see, I would put a long dress, my mother's, a [unclear] especially if it's a [unclear] dress.</span> <span id="s526">So it would be long, and if they see me unattractive, they should not hurt me.</span> <span id="s527">Because by then I was already twelve.</span> <span id="s528">In '39 I was 11, but like '42 I was already like 13.</span> <span id="s529">In '43 I was 14.</span> <span id="s530">And I was growing up...</span></p> <p><span id="s531">LH: So you knew about that possibility when you were...</span></p> <p><span id="s532">RH: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">LH: By the time you were 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">RH: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s535">I didn't know exactly what, but we were afraid they shouldn't hurt.</span> <span id="s536">As I saw them coming they would come two, three, and look for food, to take out food or jewelry or clothing.</span> <span id="s537">Anything.</span> <span id="s538">But then we were robbed from the local people, from the local militsia.</span> <span id="s539">They came to the house and took out the nice furniture from us, took out this.</span> <span id="s540">Whatever they wanted, we didn't say a word.</span> <span id="s541">They could hit us with the side of the rifles, hit us.</span> <span id="s542">We had to comply, or they hit us.</span> <span id="s543">And one time they took away, each Jewish family had a cow, it should be sustained us with milk and milk products.</span> <span id="s544">Each family had a cow.</span> <span id="s545">They took away over the Jewish families, the cows.</span> <span id="s546">O.K.</span> <span id="s547">So we didn't have any more milk.</span> <span id="s548">Of course it was a tragedy, because this is the food small children at home.</span> <span id="s549">And it was a big family, because by then one sister came running from a different town with two children and a husband.</span> <span id="s550">Another sister came running with one child.</span> <span id="s551">And we all lived together in the same house.</span> <span id="s552">And my uncle had to, they picked him and some other people to take the cows to the big city.</span> <span id="s553">And there they would be put on transport probably to Germany.</span> <span id="s554">And the cows ran away.</span> <span id="s555">And they beat up my uncle very hard.</span> <span id="s556">And black and blue spots they made him because the cows ran away.</span> <span id="s557">He wasn't a cow man or a cow boy.</span> <span id="s558">He was a shochet [ritual slaughterer]!</span> <span id="s559">He was a yeshiva bocher [student at a yeshiva]!</span> <span id="s560">And they punished him for it.</span> <span id="s561">So when the cows ran away, he did not know how to herd them back.</span> <span id="s562">They ran in, near the other cows which ran away.</span> <span id="s563">The other cows ran away.</span> <span id="s564">This was a big thing.</span> <span id="s565">And then I remember that and this was a local, he was a policeman, but he soon became a Kommandant or something, only, in the police.</span> <span id="s566">And he was a very terrible person.</span> <span id="s567">His name was Lischinsky.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">LH: Lischinsky.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">RH: Lischinsky was his name.</span> <span id="s570">When he was from there- Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s571">RH: A bad person as a person, and he was, being of his background he was.</span> <span id="s572">And now, his wife was come to church, in beautiful Jewish coats and suits and dresses and furs and foxes, which they took away, they robbed from us, from my aunts and uncles.</span> <span id="s573">They took away a whole cellar of clothing, fine clothing from us, to come to church.</span> <span id="s574">She became the lady of the town, the first lady of the town.</span> <span id="s575">And being he wore always dark glasses, so we couldn't see him, but he could see us.</span> <span id="s576">So we called him, that he had four eyes, two eyes, and two with the glasses.</span> <span id="s577">We called, he had a nickname, Fier egel vigger [phonetic].</span> <span id="s578">See, we saw him coming, we didn't say Lischinsky's coming, he shouldn't hear his name mentioned.</span> <span id="s579">But we said the Fier egel vigger is coming.</span> <span id="s580">So everybody in town knew who was the Fier egel vigger.</span> <span id="s581">Fier means four eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">LH: Four eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">RH: Two of them glasses, and two of them his own eyes, the Fier egel vigger is coming.</span> <span id="s584">And they, then, through the Judenrat, through the committee that we had in our town established a kehi--established a government.</span> <span id="s585">Because we had to go to labor, to the work.</span> <span id="s586">They should, one person could go a lot, and one person could go a little.</span> <span id="s587">So the police would come and tell them, "Only five people here, or ten people there."</span> <span id="s588">And they would already pick according to the list who went to work, and who's next is next to go to work.</span> <span id="s589">So through them we arranged to make some kind of peace that he shouldn't pick on us, on our family, Lischinsky, the Fier egel vigger.</span> <span id="s590">So he wanted a gold watch, a pocket watch.</span> <span id="s591">And we didn't have.</span> <span id="s592">So we tried to search in town from the rich families who had a gold watch.</span> <span id="s593">And then we paid with gold to buy from this lady a gold watch.</span> <span id="s594">Because her, by then she was poor herself, and she was rich before the war.</span> <span id="s595">Her husband was in Siberia, sent through the, through the Communists, through the Russians.</span> <span id="s596">He was sent to Siberia.</span> <span id="s597">But she had this gold watch.</span> <span id="s598">So we bought the watch from her, the gold, [unclear] gold.</span> <span id="s599">And invited this Lischinsky to our house.</span> <span id="s600">We put on schnapps to make peace, and we presented him the watch that he should, should be nice to us.</span> <span id="s601">We bribed him.</span> <span id="s602">But I want to tell you a little interesting story.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">LH: Please.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s605">Being Lischinsky was the Kommandant of the town, and he was always coming with a whip, and always hitting people, or hitting people, across the street from us was a very nice house.</span> <span id="s606">Actually it was my aunt's sister-in-law and mother-in-law lived in that house.</span> <span id="s607">And all of a sudden, I come from work, from someplace else--whatever work I did that day, I don't know--and they tell me that a Kommandant from a different town, from a bigger city, moved in here to that house.</span> <span id="s608">And my mama tried to get me I should work there.</span> <span id="s609">Number one, I could hear news, and tell the others what's going on.</span> <span id="s610">Number two, in case there's an execution, maybe I could hide myself in that house, in the Kommandant's house, so I could survive.</span> <span id="s611">By then, it was shortly before Pesach, which was March that year.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">LH: And had there been executions already?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s614">They were taking like groups of people, groups of people, four people, five people, tell them dig their own groves, and then shot them and, and execute them.</span> <span id="s615">From prominent family usually.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">LH: [sneezes]</span></p> <p><span id="s617">RH: Bless you.</span> <span id="s618">But what I want to tell you, that this Kommandant moved in, and because my mother's main aim was that I should work there.</span> <span id="s619">I could hide under a bed, in a closet, in a barn, in a cellar, and I could survive.</span> <span id="s620">Because we heard from on Purim at night was a big execution in a town called Vilayka, which is about 38 kilometers from us.</span> <span id="s621">And people were executed there.</span> <span id="s622">Until then we didn't hear, we just heard of groups, a few people here, a few people there, the shochet, the rov [rabbi], ten best of baal habatim [prominent townspeople].</span> <span id="s623">But not as a whole town.</span> <span id="s624">And this is the first time we heard as a whole town.</span> <span id="s625">This is Vilayka.</span> <span id="s626">This is a big city.</span> <span id="s627">But by then already they had taken out some people, which we didn't know where to.</span> <span id="s628">My cousins were taken out.</span> <span id="s629">They lived in that town.</span> <span id="s630">Two young boys.</span> <span id="s631">They were taken out.</span> <span id="s632">My aunt's husband, my uncle, went there.</span> <span id="s633">And this is my grandmother's sister.</span> <span id="s634">And she was the last one to be perished.</span> <span id="s635">After the Megillah [Book read on Purim], the people went to sleep, and in the middle of the night they woke them up and took them in the back of the town, and they shot them.</span> <span id="s636">My grandmother's sister's name was Taybeh.</span> <span id="s637">And nobody survived from her family.</span> <span id="s638">Her husband was killed, her two sons, and herself.</span> <span id="s639">So when I had a little girl, I named her Taybeh, after her.</span> <span id="s640">There was just nobody in the family who could name her, and I named my daughter Taybeh, which we call her Taybeleh.</span> <span id="s641">This is my grandmother's sister.</span> <span id="s642">Her all, she was all wiped out.</span> <span id="s643">Herself, her husband, and her sons.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">LH: When did you go into hiding, Rachel?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">RH: Oh, this is what I want to tell you where our hiding started.</span> <span id="s646">So we knew about Vilayka that there was an execution.</span> <span id="s647">Now this Kommandant moved in.</span> <span id="s648">So my mother wanted me to work in this place, so I could hide myself there.</span> <span id="s649">And when the Kommandant unpacked, I came in to help him unpack his belongings.</span> <span id="s650">He came in with twelve wagons.</span> <span id="s651">And there were lots of silver with Jewish inscriptions, which were given as gifts to, to, as wedding gifts, some kind of an object, a sugar dish, or bread box, or whatever.</span> <span id="s652">I can't remember all that.</span> <span id="s653">But I remember the Hebrew or the Jewish letterings, as wedding gifts to the families, or gifts given.</span> <span id="s654">Because he came in from a big city, and there were maybe people more financially to do, better.</span> <span id="s655">And the wife was expecting a baby.</span> <span id="s656">And being I was a young girl, and I spoke a nice Russian, very good Russian, very good White Russian, good Polish, somehow they liked me.</span> <span id="s657">So I helped the wife.</span> <span id="s658">The Kommandant's wife had a young sister about 16.</span> <span id="s659">So, being the Kommandant's wife had a baby, so the 16-year-old was in the kitchen preparing meals, so I helped her in the kitchen with the meals.</span> <span id="s660">On a Sunday, they send me to call the midwife, to tell the midwife that the Kommandant's wife is whatever.</span> <span id="s661">I had to tell her that she should, that the midwife should come.</span> <span id="s662">I was, someone should come.</span> <span id="s663">The next morning, Monday morning, I came, and the Kommandant's wife had a baby girl.</span> <span id="s664">And by then were Jewish girls, older in age then I was, doing laundry, washing dishes, which were in blood, or whatever, dirty from the delivery.</span> <span id="s665">But I still worked in the kitchen helping them.</span> <span id="s666">The Kommandant spoke a very well Russian.</span> <span id="s667">And somehow, whenever he spoke about the Jews, he did not use the word Zhid, which was, he used the word Ivrei.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">LH: Oh this was a Russian Kommandant?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">RH: Well, he was a local, Russian, you see, we had nationalities like we have in New York--Puerto Ricans, and Irish, and Italians.</span> <span id="s670">So our town was Polish [unclear] and White Russians, and Russians.</span> <span id="s671">Because, originally from the First War, this part of Poland...</span></p> <p><span id="s672">LH: Right, it had gone back to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">RH: Belonged to Russia.</span> <span id="s674">In the 1800's or 1920, no, 1918 or 1920, whenever the wars were over, the First World War, and Polish borders were established, we became Poland.</span> <span id="s675">We became Poland.</span> <span id="s676">But before that, in the First War, this was Russia, I suppose.</span> <span id="s677">So, for us to speak Russian in our town was common, accepted.</span> <span id="s678">Russian and White Russian and Polish.</span> <span id="s679">So this Kommandant, he spoke a very good Russian.</span> <span id="s680">And being I went to school, I also spoke Russian.</span> <span id="s681">I was a good student.</span> <span id="s682">I had good marks, excellent marks.</span> <span id="s683">And this was Monday, these girls are doing laundry.</span> <span id="s684">And this, the next day was Tuesday.</span> <span id="s685">And the Kommandant came to eat lunch.</span> <span id="s686">And he brought along with him Lischinsky, who was also in the police, a big shot.</span> <span id="s687">I don't know what was his title.</span> <span id="s688">But he was Kommandant, and then this Kommandant who came in had a different post, even higher.</span> <span id="s689">And then there was one, a deputy Kommandant.</span> <span id="s690">His name was Seemashkevitz [phonetic].</span> <span id="s691">There, Seemashkevitz and Lischinsky were local people.</span> <span id="s692">Seemashkevitz was from a farm a few, maybe two miles from Krevitz, and Lischinsky was in Krevitz, and the Kommandant came from a different town.</span> <span id="s693">So the three of them came, they had dinner and they drank.</span> <span id="s694">They drank schnapps, vodka.</span> <span id="s695">And the Kommandant came into the kitchen for some reason, and I went out from the kitchen to the pantry to bring in some, some kind of food or something.</span> <span id="s696">And he followed me.</span> <span id="s697">A little bit I was scared that he followed me.</span> <span id="s698">But all of a sudden he said to me in Russian, if I may repeat in Russian, and then I can translate to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">LH: Oh, certainly, very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">RH: He said to me, "(in Russian)."</span> <span id="s701">Which means, we are going on a short, on a small war, on a war.</span> <span id="s702">I knew from the politics that the war, the front is very far.</span> <span id="s703">He's not going to war to fight the Russians.</span> <span id="s704">A war, it means, to round up the Jews.</span> <span id="s705">I asked him, "Hudah [phonetic]?"</span> <span id="s706">Which means, where?</span> <span id="s707">He told me, "Karotki, karotki voi [phonetic]."</span> <span id="s708">Means the short war.</span> <span id="s709">And I asked him, "Where?"</span> <span id="s710">Then he frightened.</span> <span id="s711">I asked him, "Where?"</span> <span id="s712">He told me, "Dolginevah [phonetic]," what means in Dolhinow, a town, which is 15 kilometers from Krevitz.</span> <span id="s713">The highway was good, because the Jews clean the snow every day.</span> <span id="s714">And there were a motorized army with trucks and cars and buses, or whatever else they had.</span> <span id="s715">We knew in 15, 20 minutes they're here.</span> <span id="s716">And he continued telling me.</span> <span id="s717">So I asked him what happened.</span> <span id="s718">Or I maybe didn't have the nerve to ask him what happened.</span> <span id="s719">It's like [unclear], he could speak to the president here, but he could not speak 40 years like this to the president in Poland.</span> <span id="s720">I don't remember how I asked him.</span> <span id="s721">But what he explained to me in Russian, the S.S. viscar, means army, the S.S. came to Dolhinow," [unclear] Ivreis [unclear]."</span> <span id="s722">"And all the Jews started running away.</span> <span id="s723">So they called us to come to help."</span> <span id="s724">So I knew what help it was, to round them up.</span> <span id="s725">I, like to keep some kind of a face.</span> <span id="s726">I didn't know what to say.</span> <span id="s727">I'm Jewish.</span> <span id="s728">My mother always asked me, or hinted me that I should try, maybe I could mention something to hide by them.</span> <span id="s729">But I was too scared to ask.</span> <span id="s730">Because this is very risky.</span> <span id="s731">If he knows I'm hiding there, he can, could take me out himself like Mengele took out the Gypsy boy, pushed him himself in the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s732">And if I would go to [unclear] fetch water in the well, somebody was always in the window in my house, watching for me, and come and help me.</span> <span id="s733">And if I could tell them any news.</span> <span id="s734">I mean, I was in the Kommandant's house.</span> <span id="s735">Maybe I eavesdropped something.</span> <span id="s736">I quickly got through with the pail of water I had.</span> <span id="s737">A little water here, a little water there, into food, into this, into that.</span> <span id="s738">And I caught the pail and went over.</span> <span id="s739">"I'm going to get water."</span> <span id="s740">He said, "Fine."</span> <span id="s741">They looked in the window.</span> <span id="s742">I wink them.</span> <span id="s743">My mother went to help me fetch the water.</span> <span id="s744">I tell her, "Mommy!</span> <span id="s745">Guess it’s tsores [trouble]!”</span> <span id="s746">She says, "Nicht gut?"</span> <span id="s747">Which means, "It's bad?</span> <span id="s748">It's not good?"</span> <span id="s749">That, and I told her word by word what happened--my conversation with the Kommandant, that he is going to Dolhinow, for the execution in Dolhinow.</span> <span id="s750">We had relatives there.</span> <span id="s751">My father's family, brothers, cousins.</span> <span id="s752">And besides, it was a big city, much bigger than Krevitz.</span> <span id="s753">Were about 3,000 people in Dolhinow.</span> <span id="s754">So it mean’s there’s an execution.</span> <span id="s755">We didn't know how.</span> <span id="s756">We didn't know what to do ourselves.</span> <span id="s757">We were panicking.</span> <span id="s758">I told my mother.</span> <span id="s759">Later on, I went back to the work out.</span> <span id="s760">Later on I went again for water to see what's happening.</span> <span id="s761">And my mother again came out to tell me that her, as I mentioned earlier, or I don't remember if I did mention, in our town we had three faiths.</span> <span id="s762">Was the Jewish faith, the Polish belonged to Roman Catholics, and the White Russians and Russians belonged to Greek Orthodox.</span> <span id="s763">The Roman Catholic is a priest, but he's unmarried.</span> <span id="s764">He was a older person.</span> <span id="s765">He had a housekeeper.</span> <span id="s766">But the Greek Orthodox, he is married, and he has children.</span> <span id="s767">And they were friends of ours, especially his daughters.</span> <span id="s768">He had a couple daughters.</span> <span id="s769">He is called "the Pope".</span> <span id="s770">He usually wears long hair, a beard, he wears long robes, and the big white sleeves.</span> <span id="s771">One of his daughters was married to a person, his name was Dubovik [phonetic].</span> <span id="s772">Dubovik went to University of L'vov.</span> <span id="s773">And he was something like Mayor of the town, or something.</span> <span id="s774">He had a prominent position.</span> <span id="s775">So one of the daughters from the Pope, I think maybe it's Dubovik's wife, either, his sister-in-law, the wife's sister, came running to tell us that in Dolhinow is bad.</span> <span id="s776">And we all knew if Dolhinow is bad, it's very shortly going to be bad in Krevitz, because of the highway.</span> <span id="s777">The distance, the highway is good, they are motorized, and it's the nearest town.</span> <span id="s778">That we should be prepared.</span> <span id="s779">So she came to run to tell us.</span> <span id="s780">"I want to tell you!"</span> <span id="s781">She came to tell us, to warn us, that Dolhinow is bad, that we should do something about it.</span> <span id="s782">It's going to be bad in Krevitz also.</span> <span id="s783">So, my uncle and a little boy went away earlier, like four o’clock in the afternoon, went away to leave town.</span> <span id="s784">One aunt and her two children were on a farm.</span> <span id="s785">The only people who were left in town, from my family, was my mother, my mother's younger sister, and me.</span> <span id="s786">Everybody else sort of left town earlier, a couple days earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">LH: Where was your father now?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">RH: By then my father was killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">LH: How did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">RH: They shot him.</span> <span id="s791">They shot him.</span> <span id="s792">And we were going to leave town, but we waited.</span> <span id="s793">I couldn't leave my job.</span> <span id="s794">If I would disappear they'd be looking for me.</span> <span id="s795">But I finished my work at whatever time it was, in the afternoon, finished my work.</span> <span id="s796">I asked them, "Can I go now?"</span> <span id="s797">They said, "Yes.</span> <span id="s798">There is nothing else.</span> <span id="s799">I washed the dishes, did my housework."</span> <span id="s800">It's already getting toward evening.</span> <span id="s801">I could go.</span> <span id="s802">I came home.</span> <span id="s803">We put on a few dresses, on top of each other, and a few undershirts.</span> <span id="s804">Because we always see if we run away, we may never come back to our hometown.</span> <span id="s805">So we should be prepared.</span> <span id="s806">My mother sewed some money into my clothing.</span> <span id="s807">If, in case we split up, in case it's being shot after us, in case we run in different directions, that we should be prepared.</span> <span id="s808">So, as we were leaving town, in the back of our house, in the big garden, land, plot that we would farm things, potatoes, carrots, beets, cucumbers, vegetables, a vegetable garden, a little one.</span> <span id="s809">And as we started leaving our house, going through that garden, not to go by the streets, but go through the field, and [unclear], and from there we'll be running away.</span> <span id="s810">All of a sudden I heard saying, "Halt!</span> <span id="s811">Halt!</span> <span id="s812">Jude, halt!"</span> <span id="s813">Which means, "Stop!</span> <span id="s814">Stop!</span> <span id="s815">Jews, stop!"</span> <span id="s816">We thought that the Germans are chasing us already.</span> <span id="s817">We turn around, and there are a few little boys, maybe 12, 13-year-old boys, neighbors' children.</span> <span id="s818">They knew the word Jude, which means Jew.</span> <span id="s819">And they knew the word halt, which means stop.</span> <span id="s820">They just had fun.</span> <span id="s821">They really didn't mean anything.</span> <span id="s822">They just had fun.</span> <span id="s823">But, since they saw us, we were very afraid to take the chance of running, because they could go with the street to the police quarters, and tell them.</span> <span id="s824">They were on bicycles.</span> <span id="s825">By the end they reach the end of town on bicycles, they'll be ahead of us and waiting for us there.</span> <span id="s826">So we saw we can't run away.</span> <span id="s827">We can't go.</span> <span id="s828">So what do we do?</span> <span id="s829">So we decided, across the street from us was a drug store, a druggist.</span> <span id="s830">The original people who had the drug store, when the Russians came--her name was Shemenshek [phonetic] - she was a widow.</span> <span id="s831">And she and her children were taken to Siberia.</span> <span id="s832">They were [unclear] to Siberia.</span> <span id="s833">So, but the Russians, they put in somebody else to be a druggist, because in those days they didn't have so many educated people, pharmacists, who could do the prescriptions.</span> <span id="s834">You needed somebody knowledgeable.</span> <span id="s835">You just can't put anybody to mix up medicine.</span> <span id="s836">You needed a pharmacist.</span> <span id="s837">Then, and when the Germans came, the person who was running the drug store, he went to his hometown.</span> <span id="s838">But it was a Jewish man from a different town.</span> <span id="s839">He ran away from Ilja [phonetic].</span> <span id="s840">His na--the town is Ilja, and his name was Klukt [phonetic].</span> <span id="s841">He came running from Ilja, with a wife and three children, to our town.</span> <span id="s842">Because, being afraid that there were executions there, and being he was a pharmacist, he ran the drug store.</span> <span id="s843">Everybody needed him, because when this, not only Jews, but the goyim, the Gentiles, cause he was the, this is the only drug store for the, our town, plus all the surrounding villages around, if anybody got sick.</span> <span id="s844">So we decided we'll sit in his house.</span> <span id="s845">We'll sit through the night in his house.</span> <span id="s846">They're not gonna come to take him to shot.</span> <span id="s847">Because if they shoot him, who's gonna make medicines for them?</span> <span id="s848">So we sat through the night, and in the morning, we left town.</span> <span id="s849">Also we had in our town curfew.</span> <span id="s850">We had curfew, so, beyond eight o’clock nobody should be seen in the streets, I think till seven in the morning or whatever time.</span> <span id="s851">So we sat through the night there.</span> <span id="s852">And in the morning we left his house to go to a village.</span> <span id="s853">Somehow the night went through quiet.</span> <span id="s854">The Germans did not arrive yet to our town.</span> <span id="s855">But we didn't know what was going on in Dolhinow.</span> <span id="s856">Because nobody came out to tell what's going on.</span> <span id="s857">It's night time.</span> <span id="s858">Those who ran away didn't reach our town yet.</span> <span id="s859">And we left in the morning the town.</span> <span id="s860">We wore our yellow star, because, in case if somebody sees us through the streets.</span> <span id="s861">But as soon as we left town, we took off the star.</span> <span id="s862">So if we meet people in the stree--in, in the, in, on the road, they'll think we are Gentiles.</span> <span id="s863">They wouldn't know who we are.</span> <span id="s864">We left town and we went fast to find where my uncle was, and my cousin.</span> <span id="s865">My uncle's name is Moshe Drayzen [phonetic].</span> <span id="s866">He is now in Providence.</span> <span id="s867">He's an older aged person now.</span> <span id="s868">He had, he was a rabbi, in Providence.</span> <span id="s869">Also was a shochet in younger years.</span> <span id="s870">Now they're older people, close to their 80's.</span> <span id="s871">Their son Shabsi [phonetic] is married.</span> <span id="s872">He lives in California.</span> <span id="s873">And he's a shochet there.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">LH: And so you were going along the road...</span></p> <p><span id="s875">RH: Along the road, and we found the place where he was hiding.</span> <span id="s876">And the family didn't like, didn't want to keep them there.</span> <span id="s877">It was very cold.</span> <span id="s878">So the only place they let us stay was in the sauna, which was far from the house.</span> <span id="s879">And there it was very cold.</span> <span id="s880">And if you make a wood to warm up, a smoke would come out of the chimney.</span> <span id="s881">And the farmers usually would make sauna.</span> <span id="s882">It's like a bath house.</span> <span id="s883">Each farmer had it.</span> <span id="s884">It was, oh, like a couple boards and some wood and water.</span> <span id="s885">And they usually did it on Saturdays.</span> <span id="s886">And this was the middle of the week.</span> <span id="s887">So this was not proper to have a bath.</span> <span id="s888">It was very cold.</span> <span id="s889">So we went, asked the family if they could take us to the house.</span> <span id="s890">He said no, he's too scared.</span> <span id="s891">He's too scared.</span> <span id="s892">He says, "Yes, you should go to a different farmer."</span> <span id="s893">And [unclear] had to go.</span> <span id="s894">So my mother and my aunt went to a different farmer, and to ask if we could come.</span> <span id="s895">And she said, yes, we could come.</span> <span id="s896">So my mother and my aunt came back to call us.</span> <span id="s897">And we went.</span> <span id="s898">I must tell you, this was a very cold day, and we were going through the fields, through snow, not with the road.</span> <span id="s899">We were afraid in case somebody will see us.</span> <span id="s900">And on the snow we didn't have footsteps.</span> <span id="s901">On the snow, the snow was frozen.</span> <span id="s902">So, on the snow we didn't have to put, some places the foot would go free, go through.</span> <span id="s903">Otherwise we were walking in [unclear] footstep, if somebody would follow us.</span> <span id="s904">Maybe someplace would find it, the foot would go through.</span> <span id="s905">And we reached this house, and we stayed there.</span> <span id="s906">We asked him to stay for a day or so, just for a couple days to stay.</span> <span id="s907">And it was very cold.</span> <span id="s908">And this was Pesach already.</span> <span id="s909">They left matzahs hanging in a pillow case, which they baked matzahs hanging from a beam, under the ceiling.</span> <span id="s910">And we were hungry.</span> <span id="s911">My mother asked the farmer to buy some eggs.</span> <span id="s912">And it was from a, from her eggs, and my mother took out some coal to bake the eggs.</span> <span id="s913">Because it's Pesach.</span> <span id="s914">We didn't want to use the farmer's pot.</span> <span id="s915">We were observant.</span> <span id="s916">We are observant still.</span> <span id="s917">So the farmer offered us a cup to cool the egg, and I says no.</span> <span id="s918">Now she thought we didn't know how to cook eggs, so she explained to us that eggs are being cooked, not baked.</span> <span id="s919">Potatoes can be baked, but not eggs.</span> <span id="s920">My mother said, yes, she knows, but we are baking them, because, for kashrus [observance of kosher laws] We didn't want to use her pot.</span> <span id="s921">My uncle made kiddish [prayer over the wine] and [unclear].</span> <span id="s922">Then, it was very cold to sit in the cellar in the house, so she gave us a long coat made out of sheepskin, so we could all huddle ourselves and cover ourselves.</span> <span id="s923">We were five people by then--my aunt and uncle, my mother and I, oh yes, and my little cousin, my uncle's son.</span> <span id="s924">And we were there.</span> <span id="s925">My uncle urged us a few times we should go to town to see if we could come back.</span> <span id="s926">So my mother and my aunt, [unclear] to go.</span> <span id="s927">He's too weak to go, he's a man.</span> <span id="s928">He would be recognized.</span> <span id="s929">He had a beard.</span> <span id="s930">So my mother and my aunt, they are women, so they could be taken as farmer women.</span> <span id="s931">They could go.</span> <span id="s932">And I was too small to go.</span> <span id="s933">So they went.</span> <span id="s934">They tried to reach town, and they heard somebody on the road, people coming.</span> <span id="s935">So they hide behind bushes, and they were frightened.</span> <span id="s936">And they ran back.</span> <span id="s937">They made a second attempt at different, the sec--a different night to come back to town.</span> <span id="s938">And they went into, I think to the first house, of the suburbs of the town.</span> <span id="s939">And they heard dogs barking.</span> <span id="s940">They got frightened and ran away.</span> <span id="s941">They thought maybe the police or something.</span> <span id="s942">And they ran away.</span> <span id="s943">So then they decided that they knew there is a farm where Jewish people come to work.</span> <span id="s944">Maybe they'll go there and talk to the Jewish people, and find out what's happening in town, if we could come back.</span> <span id="s945">This had been a couple days.</span> <span id="s946">We are hungry.</span> <span id="s947">We are cold, and uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s948">We went to this farm.</span> <span id="s949">And, we knew the Jewish people are working there, but we didn't know exactly which field, or which area they are at work, where.</span> <span id="s950">Because it's a big farm, and we didn't know where they are.</span> <span id="s951">So they sent a girl from that house.</span> <span id="s952">"Ask her, do me a favor, and call the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s953">Maybe you know who is at work today, which people."</span> <span id="s954">And she said whom she saw.</span> <span id="s955">She mentioned Jewish names.</span> <span id="s956">My mother picked the one name.</span> <span id="s957">And his name was Mendel Rabinovitz.</span> <span id="s958">Call me Mendel.”</span> <span id="s959">He was known, because he was the, selling a lot of farmer's supplies.</span> <span id="s960">So all the farmers knew him.</span> <span id="s961">He was dealing mostly with farm supplies, hardware.</span> <span id="s962">In the meantime, there was an old grandma rocking in a cradle a baby.</span> <span id="s963">And the grandmother was, asked my mother and my aunt, "Who are you?"</span> <span id="s964">So they gave a different name, and said they're from a different town.</span> <span id="s965">She said, "I don't know.</span> <span id="s966">I am blind.</span> <span id="s967">I can't see you.</span> <span id="s968">But according to voice, you sound like you would be the shochet Yudi’s kinder."</span> <span id="s969">The shochet that has children, or the shochet; see, my grandmother had a name, Szacherzingc, because my grandfather was a shochet, which in Polish would be Szachnikowa.</span> <span id="s970">Or in Russian would be Rayznichika [phonetic], Rayznik [phonetic] my grandfather was.</span> <span id="s971">So, this is how they titled my grandmother: Panish Szachnikova [phonetic], or Rayznichika [phonetic] because my...</span></p> <p><span id="s972">LH: So, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">RH: So the meantime, my mother and, tried to deny who she was, but asked her, "What's doing in Krevitz?</span> <span id="s974">What's doing in the town?"</span> <span id="s975">"Ah, you don't ask what a tragedy befell your town.</span> <span id="s976">They killed the rabbi and his wife and his children.</span> <span id="s977">And the rebbitzen [rabbi’s wife] had a single sister.</span> <span id="s978">And they killed her."</span> <span id="s979">And the rebbitzen a married sister, from the one who we bought the watch, the gold watch, earlier in the story.</span> <span id="s980">And her husband was in Siberia.</span> <span id="s981">They killed her, and her four children--the two sons and the two daughters--because they did not want to have a trace.</span> <span id="s982">And they were looking for the shochet's children, which means they were looking for us.</span> <span id="s983">They came to our house.</span> <span id="s984">They were looking for us.</span> <span id="s985">The Germans knew that in the Jewish community, the rov and the shochet are the leaders of the community.</span> <span id="s986">And the people will follow what the rov and the shochet will say.</span> <span id="s987">So this means they killed the rov of our town.</span> <span id="s988">They wanted to kill the shochet of our town, because we were the leaders.</span> <span id="s989">And they looked for us.</span> <span id="s990">By then my mother didn't want to wait anymore for Mendel, to tell us what's doing in the town.</span> <span id="s991">So we tried to leave, but by then he arrived.</span> <span id="s992">He came from wherever he was working.</span> <span id="s993">And he told us, "Don't come back to town.</span> <span id="s994">They're looking for you."</span> <span id="s995">So as, earlier, see, my mother and my aunt had obstacles.</span> <span id="s996">They could not go into town.</span> <span id="s997">The dogs were barking, or they heard noises, or voices.</span> <span id="s998">Each time they turned back, they said it was a mazel [good luck], because, never knowing whom they could step into.</span> <span id="s999">And they would catch them and being executed, because they were looking for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">LH: So where did you go from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">RH: So after that, we did not return to town.</span> <span id="s1002">We asked the lady where we stayed if we could stay with her more.</span> <span id="s1003">We stayed with her a little bit longer.</span> <span id="s1004">This Mendel suggested that there are still some towns which they didn't have executions yet.</span> <span id="s1005">Maybe we could go to those towns, and be there with the other Jewish people in the ghettos.</span> <span id="s1006">He suggested some towns, some names.</span> <span id="s1007">Our town wasn't executed yet.</span> <span id="s1008">Only the rabbi's family was taken, which was actually the rabbi’s family, the rebbitzen's sister and children, and the single sister.</span> <span id="s1009">It was three families taken.</span> <span id="s1010">And they were looking for us.</span> <span id="s1011">But not, it wasn't the mass execution yet.</span> <span id="s1012">It was only like single families.</span> <span id="s1013">So we asked our farmer if we could stay with him a little bit longer.</span> <span id="s1014">We didn't tell them exactly what happened, because they might be frightened to keep us.</span> <span id="s1015">Being that there was hunger in land, because when the Germans arrived, and they were going through the fields, they spoiled the crops, and also they burned the crops.</span> <span id="s1016">So people did not have any wheat or potatoes, because they ruined the crops.</span> <span id="s1017">They arrived on, in the summer time, in '41.</span> <span id="s1018">And they were going with their tanks through the fields.</span> <span id="s1019">So they ruined the crops before the crops could be harvested.</span> <span id="s1020">So by the end of the winter, was hunger.</span> <span id="s1021">The people had no food.</span> <span id="s1022">Being we had money with us, we had gold, gold rubles, we gave her money, a five ruble, a ten ruble, and we sent her to, which, we knew in the area who are rich farmers, that maybe still have supplies, that she could buy from them.</span> <span id="s1023">So being we helped her with food, she kept us.</span> <span id="s1024">Maybe she didn't know the consequences, what was gonna come to her, if we were discovered.</span> <span id="s1025">In fact she thought maybe nobody knew that we are there.</span> <span id="s1026">So this was, we came to her about March 30th.</span> <span id="s1027">By then it’s already April, beginning of April, '42.</span> <span id="s1028">And a few weeks later, like, not, was gonna be the yahrzeit [anniversary of disaster] for my town, Iyar 11th.</span> <span id="s1029">I don't remember what date it was as far as regular, the secular calendar.</span> <span id="s1030">But I remember one afternoon we saw a big fire through the window, from the farmer's house where we stayed.</span> <span id="s1031">And each of us tried to guess the location, where the fire was burning.</span> <span id="s1032">Each one going through the air, looking, having the [unclear], next to the church, or a meal, or whatever we could see from far, because it was, we were about five or six kilometers from town.</span> <span id="s1033">But we saw the flames.</span> <span id="s1034">So we could take guesses what it is.</span> <span id="s1035">My guess was that this is the public school.</span> <span id="s1036">The way my orientation was, I said, "This is the public school."</span> <span id="s1037">Other people in the family, including the farmer, looking at the fire, "Look, there's a fire!"</span> <span id="s1038">Everybody tried to guess something else.</span> <span id="s1039">We tried to send the farmer, the man from the house where we stayed, he should go and find out what it was.</span> <span id="s1040">Just they were executed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">LH: It was the what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">RH: The execution.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">LH: It was the execution.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">RH: It was the execution.</span> <span id="s1045">So we tried to send the lady--she was more [unclear] to town, to find out what happened.</span> <span id="s1046">She went to town to find out.</span> <span id="s1047">And when she came back, she came down to us to the cellar where we were hiding under the foundation of the house.</span> <span id="s1048">She hugged us and she kissed us.</span> <span id="s1049">And she said, "I'm not even gonna let you go.</span> <span id="s1050">You stay with me.</span> <span id="s1051">Whatever's gonna happen to you, is gonna happen to me, or to me or to you."</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">LH: What was this lady's name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">RH: The lady's name is Anna Kobinska.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">LH: Anna Kobinska.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">RH: Kobinska.</span> <span id="s1056">She lives now in Krakow.</span> <span id="s1057">She is in Krakow.</span> <span id="s1058">She lives now in Krakow.</span> <span id="s1059">We have a correspondence.</span> <span id="s1060">I send her Christmas gifts.</span> <span id="s1061">We exchange pictures.</span> <span id="s1062">She asks me many times to come to visit.</span> <span id="s1063">And every time I make the plans to come, my husband cannot make it for one reason or another.</span> <span id="s1064">Because I want very much to go to see her.</span> <span id="s1065">She asked me, "While I'm still alive.</span> <span id="s1066">I'm getting older.</span> <span id="s1067">I want to see you."</span> <span id="s1068">And every year I make the plans to go on vacation, and every time somehow my husband does not get a vacation.</span> <span id="s1069">He can't go.</span> <span id="s1070">And, she told us about the tragedy, what happened.</span> <span id="s1071">She cried, and we cried, and we cried, and she cried.</span> <span id="s1072">And she said all the stories.</span> <span id="s1073">Later on she went again to town on a Sunday to church.</span> <span id="s1074">And there were stories talking, which people were taken, a baby, one mother, a young mother tried to put a baby in the crib and put some blankets and people found her with the baby.</span> <span id="s1075">They heard the baby cry.</span> <span id="s1076">They shot the baby, and she had to carry the dead baby, the blood running, to the execution spot.</span> <span id="s1077">One mother carrying the baby, from crying, was biting the baby.</span> <span id="s1078">Some people told there were screams when the Jewish people were rounded up and going through the streets.</span> <span id="s1079">They heard screams.</span> <span id="s1080">They couldn't listen to the screams.</span> <span id="s1081">In the houses, they put the blankets on the windows.</span> <span id="s1082">They put pillows over their heads.</span> <span id="s1083">From the Gentiles, they couldn't take the screams of the people.</span> <span id="s1084">The Jewish people were rounded up, and taken.</span> <span id="s1085">We had a big church.</span> <span id="s1086">That [unclear], the Roman Catholic Church, and there was a big fence made out of big brick or stone, a very tall fence, about ten foot tall.</span> <span id="s1087">They put the people there, between the church and the fence.</span> <span id="s1088">And they had to give out their money, or jewelry, whatever was sewn in their clothing.</span> <span id="s1089">They told them they're gonna let them free.</span> <span id="s1090">They did, but they didn't.</span> <span id="s1091">I was right about the location about the public school.</span> <span id="s1092">It wasn't the public school, but across the street from the public school there was a big warehouse, where the Russians lived when they occupied our town between '39 and '41.</span> <span id="s1093">They built a big warehouse.</span> <span id="s1094">And that's where they put in all the Jewish people, in the warehouse.</span> <span id="s1095">They went through a few times with a machine gun.</span> <span id="s1096">They put gasoline, and they burned them.</span> <span id="s1097">Many were half alive, wounded, and many were alive.</span> <span id="s1098">A little girl, I think her name is Chaya Sora.</span> <span id="s1099">Her mother's name was Reesha, so we used to call her Chaya Sora Reesha.</span> <span id="s1100">She was about 12, but small in height, short in height, not very a tall girl, a small girl.</span> <span id="s1101">Her parents were shot.</span> <span id="s1102">She ran out, and the one man - I forgot his name - he caught, a man from the local people, he was Lischinsky's brother-in-law, from the unterveltnikkes [the lowest element] of the town.</span> <span id="s1103">You know what it is, unterveltnik?</span> <span id="s1104">He grabbed this little girl, and threw her into the fire.</span> <span id="s1105">She ran out, frightened, and he chased her.</span> <span id="s1106">She was little.</span> <span id="s1107">Her steps were small.</span> <span id="s1108">She was running.</span> <span id="s1109">He chased her.</span> <span id="s1110">He grabbed her.</span> <span id="s1111">He carried her, threw her in again a second time.</span> <span id="s1112">And she ran out.</span> <span id="s1113">By then, by the second time she ran out, her clothes were burning, because he could throw her- Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">RH: Where do I start?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">LH: Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">RH: O.K., I'll start because it shut off.</span> <span id="s1117">When the Jewish people of my town, when the Jewish people of my town, Krevitz, were rounded up to be executed, there was one very beautiful girl.</span> <span id="s1118">There were lots of beautiful girls.</span> <span id="s1119">But I know the story of one girl, that was told to us.</span> <span id="s1120">I don't know who witnessed it, probably not Jewish people were able to witness it, because anybody who was there did not survive.</span> <span id="s1121">Maybe from the local militia, from the local police, who were the boys from our town that helped the Germans.</span> <span id="s1122">Maybe they saw it, and they told this to their families, and that's how it became knowledgeable to us.</span> <span id="s1123">Her name was Merka.</span> <span id="s1124">They call her Merka.</span> <span id="s1125">Maybe it was Miriam, but they called her Merka.</span> <span id="s1126">Her father's name was Shmuelka.</span> <span id="s1127">Shmuelka was a katsov, he was a butcher.</span> <span id="s1128">Merka was a very beautiful girl.</span> <span id="s1129">She was in her early twenties.</span> <span id="s1130">They told the people, all of them, or just her, I don't know, to get undressed, and she was undressed.</span> <span id="s1131">And a German touched her body.</span> <span id="s1132">She was very beautiful, had a beautiful figure.</span> <span id="s1133">In revenge, she slapped the German.</span> <span id="s1134">After that, not only they shoot her, they punish her father.</span> <span id="s1135">They ask which one is her father, and somebody pointed out to her father, but, it was, I guess, a mistake, and they took the father's brother, which his name was Shinsel.</span> <span id="s1136">They were neighbors.</span> <span id="s1137">They were tall, good-looking men.</span> <span id="s1138">And they poked out Shinsel's eyes before they executed him.</span> <span id="s1139">From this family survived one son.</span> <span id="s1140">His name was Micha.</span> <span id="s1141">He must, oh, have been 19, 20, 21.</span> <span id="s1142">I don't remember now how old he was then.</span> <span id="s1143">And somehow he reached the partisans.</span> <span id="s1144">And he was in partisans.</span> <span id="s1145">And there was a fight between the partisans and the Germans.</span> <span id="s1146">And he had either a rifle or a machine gun, and he was shooting.</span> <span id="s1147">He was very excited that he could shoot a German.</span> <span id="s1148">Whether he killed him or not, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1149">I don't remember from the stories they told me.</span> <span id="s1150">But each time I know that when he shoots, he said that this is in revenge for my mother, for my father, for my sister, for my brother, and he mentioned every time the names of his family.</span> <span id="s1151">I remember he had one sister whose name was Beylka.</span> <span id="s1152">[Unclear] in the family.</span> <span id="s1153">And the commandeer told him, from the resistance, he should get down, because he was standing.</span> <span id="s1154">He was very excited about it that he could take revenge.</span> <span id="s1155">And he was shot.</span> <span id="s1156">People who were in the resistance, in the partisans with him, told us what happened to Micha.</span> <span id="s1157">It was after the war, when we survived, and we met other people in our town.</span> <span id="s1158">And, of course, we inquired about each and every one in the family, if they know whereabouts, where they are, and who survived.</span> <span id="s1159">And that's when they told us what happened to Micha.</span> <span id="s1160">And Micha got killed in the partisans that time in [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">LH: Did you hear from your farmers, did you hear much about what was going on with the resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">RH: From the farmers we could hear about the resistance, because at night the resistance would come to us for food from the farm, and also maybe for some information.</span> <span id="s1163">We had a railroad not far from our town, and also not far from our hiding place.</span> <span id="s1164">We would see during the day trains, long trains, going to the front, to the Leningrad front, to the Vitebsk front, to the Russian front, going for ammunition.</span> <span id="s1165">And every night partisans came, and they put mines under the railroad.</span> <span id="s1166">So the Germans became smart.</span> <span id="s1167">And the first two cars would be sent before the engine would be sent, so they were stepping on the mines, so that only the sand would get splashed, and the train would be survived, the ammunition and all.</span> <span id="s1168">So the partisans learned to make time bombs that the first two cars and the engine would go by, and in the middle it would get exploded.</span> <span id="s1169">So then the Germans [unclear] and they put on guard local farmers to guard the railroad.</span> <span id="s1170">They were afraid to put there Germans.</span> <span id="s1171">They put local farmers to guard the railroad.</span> <span id="s1172">So the partisans would not destroy the railroad, because this was a connection with the front, with the Leningrad front.</span> <span id="s1173">So the partisans would come, and tie up the people, and still do, and still do, put bombs or mines under the railroad, because the local people by then cooperated with the partisans.</span> <span id="s1174">Besides they had no choice.</span> <span id="s1175">The partisans would come with guns.</span> <span id="s1176">And besides, the people didn't like the Germans anymore, because from the First World War the Germans were the good Germans with Kaiser Wilhelm.</span> <span id="s1177">The people prospered.</span> <span id="s1178">I remember my grandmother telling stories from the First World War, because I asked her once, "Whom did the people like better - the Germans or the Russians?</span> <span id="s1179">Like the Czar, or the Germans?"</span> <span id="s1180">[Unclear] she says, no, they preferred, because the Czar’s army didn't come, or the Cossacks would come and they would persecute the Jews.</span> <span id="s1181">But the Wilhelm army, they were good Germans.</span> <span id="s1182">They, somehow, I don't know, they were different people, polite, whatever.</span> <span id="s1183">They would come.</span> <span id="s1184">So here, by this time, they already heard of the trouble the Germans were doing.</span> <span id="s1185">They were scared of them too, because one doesn't know what's gonna happen.</span> <span id="s1186">So then they gave out a law to cut out all the trees near the railroad, because we had lots of woods – forests - growing.</span> <span id="s1187">Now, lots of forests.</span> <span id="s1188">So the partisans come to the forests, and come to the railroad.</span> <span id="s1189">And then they go on their stomach.</span> <span id="s1190">So they cut out all the trees, I don't know how many feet from the railroad, cut out all the trees.</span> <span id="s1191">But somehow the partisans always managed.</span> <span id="s1192">The partisans are people, were patriots, and doing underground work.</span> <span id="s1193">This is not bought for money like a, or anything.</span> <span id="s1194">They did because they wanted it.</span> <span id="s1195">They are volunteers.</span> <span id="s1196">It's not that people are being drafted and they're forced to do.</span> <span id="s1197">They are volunteers.</span> <span id="s1198">They do whatever they, because they want to do.</span> <span id="s1199">So, a lot of people, the young Jewish boys by then were in partisans, and, of course, they were very involved, and very active in the partisans.</span> <span id="s1200">But we were hidden in the farmer's house.</span> <span id="s1201">We didn't know where the partisans are.</span> <span id="s1202">We wanted to join them, but we didn't know where they are.</span> <span id="s1203">We could not get connections.</span> <span id="s1204">But after being maybe a year-and-a-half, maybe twenty months in the farmer's house, they burned down her house, because it was a big house, and not far from the railroad.</span> <span id="s1205">And the partisans were afraid that the Germans might make a base, might make a base there.</span> <span id="s1206">And they needed a, they didn't want the Germans should make a base there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">LH: Oh, so the partisans burned down the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">RH: Yes, but they told, came and they told her and she could take out her things, whatever she could, she could take out her things.</span> <span id="s1209">They gave her time.</span> <span id="s1210">But by then we were gone from there.</span> <span id="s1211">We were gone.</span> <span id="s1212">The farm lady what we stayed, she had a man, it's called a parobek [Polish farmer], that he worked the land for her.</span> <span id="s1213">And they had 50-50 arrangement.</span> <span id="s1214">It's her land and his labor, and they divided the crops.</span> <span id="s1215">And they were a young couple.</span> <span id="s1216">They were young.</span> <span id="s1217">They could do.</span> <span id="s1218">But she couldn't do the work on the farm.</span> <span id="s1219">She was a woman.</span> <span id="s1220">In fact, either he noticed us, he heard noises.</span> <span id="s1221">But every Saturday night he would go home to his village.</span> <span id="s1222">And the one time he saw so [unclear] partisans and they found us there.</span> <span id="s1223">So being he knew, the parobek knew--his name was Ignatz--that we are there, we were afraid to stay with him.</span> <span id="s1224">Being there, we were exposed, that the Jews are hiding on this farm.</span> <span id="s1225">So we were afraid to be there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">LH: So what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">RH: So what did you do?</span> <span id="s1228">So first of all, we had to decide quickly what to do.</span> <span id="s1229">So right away after the partisans left the house and they exposed us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">LH: You didn't trust the partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">RH: No.</span> <span id="s1232">No.</span> <span id="s1233">And we didn't trust Ignatz either.</span> <span id="s1234">What I do, Ignatz and his wife they know, and maybe he'll tell.</span> <span id="s1235">[Unclear] they could be drunk one Saturday night and tell somebody else that she's hiding Jews.</span> <span id="s1236">By then our town was executed completely.</span> <span id="s1237">No Jews.</span> <span id="s1238">From the fifth execution, some people ran away.</span> <span id="s1239">Either they were at work during the day.</span> <span id="s1240">Either they were, if they have a chance to run away, a few people ran away.</span> <span id="s1241">They survived.</span> <span id="s1242">Then they lived in the one house.</span> <span id="s1243">It was a, the, a woman her name was Sora Meira.</span> <span id="s1244">She had a big house.</span> <span id="s1245">Everybody lived in Sora Meira's house.</span> <span id="s1246">And this, a bomb was thrown into that house a few weeks later.</span> <span id="s1247">A bomb was thrown into that house.</span> <span id="s1248">So whoever was still there, they got killed by the bomb.</span> <span id="s1249">But somehow the few people survived that, I don't know how.</span> <span id="s1250">So once Ignatz knew that we are there, we didn't trust him.</span> <span id="s1251">So what did we do?</span> <span id="s1252">So my mother and I went right after the partisans of [unclear].</span> <span id="s1253">And Ignatz was with them.</span> <span id="s1254">He didn’t even come himself, maybe he would let it go.</span> <span id="s1255">But Ignatz came with them.</span> <span id="s1256">We're looking like into Ignatz' window, telling Ignatz, "You must take us in.</span> <span id="s1257">She's throwing us out."</span> <span id="s1258">But, we called her the pani, because in Polish, like here you say Mrs. or Miss.</span> <span id="s1259">In Polish you use, you say pani, or pan.</span> <span id="s1260">Pan for Mr. and Pani for Mrs. So we called her pani.</span> <span id="s1261">Instead of calling her Mrs. we called her pani.</span> <span id="s1262">We didn't call her the first name.</span> <span id="s1263">When [unclear] we call her Pani Anna.</span> <span id="s1264">But then with ourselves, we just, the pani, the pani, like the Mrs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">LH: How many of there were you?</span> <span id="s1266">Were there still five?</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">RH: At one time, we were by the pani - eight.</span> <span id="s1268">My uncle, Laber Kafla, was shot on the farm.</span> <span id="s1269">So my aunt Frieda - who had two children - came to us.</span> <span id="s1270">We were, oh yeah, I forgot to tell earlier, we made contact.</span> <span id="s1271">My mother made contact with her sister, who was on a farm at that time, because a few weeks earlier, we sent her to the farm because her husband, head of Smolarnia [Polish pitch factory], is a, a factory, that they made out of woods of certain trees.</span> <span id="s1272">I think sosna- [Polish for pine] I don't know which tree.</span> <span id="s1273">Trees like you use for Christmas trees, that had a lot of tar in them.</span> <span id="s1274">So he had a factory to produce tar, before the war.</span> <span id="s1275">He was a rich man.</span> <span id="s1276">He owned twelve factories like this.</span> <span id="s1277">You put in a big kettle the roots of the trees, and you hit them, and the tar leaks out.</span> <span id="s1278">And this is being gathered into barrels, and the barrels are being sold to businessmen who are involved in shipping industry.</span> <span id="s1279">They were going to Gdynia and to Gdansk, to the Polish ports.</span> <span id="s1280">And this was very necessary to smear the boats, because this is waterproof, with this tar, to prevent them from leakage.</span> <span id="s1281">Because in those days boats were made out of wood, not out of metal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">LH: So how many of there were you at the time this happened with Ignatz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">RH: Well, at the time of Ignatz, I don't remember, but I remember that my mother and I went to Ignatz.</span> <span id="s1284">We knocked on his window, and we told him, "You must take, you must take us in."</span> <span id="s1285">He didn't want to.</span> <span id="s1286">I said, "Ignatz!</span> <span id="s1287">You are gonna have on your con science - where can we go now in the middle of the night!?</span> <span id="s1288">You're a Christian!</span> <span id="s1289">You're gonna have on your conscience not to take us in now!</span> <span id="s1290">She's throwing us out.</span> <span id="s1291">She will not take us back.</span> <span id="s1292">And where do you expect us to go now?"</span> <span id="s1293">My mother says, "I am a widow.</span> <span id="s1294">I have a child.</span> <span id="s1295">You're a Christian, and you're supposed to help me.</span> <span id="s1296">So at this point you must keep me."</span> <span id="s1297">He said, "I'm scared."</span> <span id="s1298">I said, "I'm not gonna go in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s1299">You have to take us in."</span> <span id="s1300">All we wanted that Ignatz should feel guilty if he's hiding Jews just the same, so by then he will not go and report that the pani was holding us.</span> <span id="s1301">We stayed with him at his house for two days, in the cellar.</span> <span id="s1302">In the daytime they went to work.</span> <span id="s1303">They would give us a little bit food to eat, bread, whatever they gave us.</span> <span id="s1304">They gave us, whatever they gave us, food to eat.</span> <span id="s1305">And then, he says, "Look, you can't stay here."</span> <span id="s1306">So we asked him, "Where can we go?</span> <span id="s1307">Where are partisans?"</span> <span id="s1308">And he told us.</span> <span id="s1309">But we pretended that we went.</span> <span id="s1310">But we went back to the pani.</span> <span id="s1311">But we wanted to shut up Ignatz, that he should not be able to call Germans to tell that pani's holding Jews, that he should be just involved, even for two days.</span> <span id="s1312">But now he was holding Jews.</span> <span id="s1313">He already was branded that he held the Jews.</span> <span id="s1314">He couldn't go to tell the Germans.</span> <span id="s1315">If he told the Germans that she was, that the pani was holding Jews, then she could say that, "Ignatz, you were holding Jews too."</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">LH: Hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">RH: Making Ignatz feel guilty.</span> <span id="s1318">This was our aim, that we can get Ignatz to keep us here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">LH: So you stayed with the pani then for the rest of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">RH: Not for the rest of the war.</span> <span id="s1321">We felt it's too dangerous to stay there.</span> <span id="s1322">The partisans know.</span> <span id="s1323">The partisans are gonna come.</span> <span id="s1324">They're gonna burn the house, because Ignatz came one time.</span> <span id="s1325">He said, "The partisans are talking of burning down your house."</span> <span id="s1326">And this was in the fall, so this is in like fall.</span> <span id="s1327">I don't know how long we stayed more, but we went from there.</span> <span id="s1328">See, my aunt, the one who, Frieda Kafla, being her husband was shot, and she was in the village, and the villagers felt sorry for her because they saw with their own eyes when he was shot.</span> <span id="s1329">And she happened to be away from there, factory, from this smolarnia.</span> <span id="s1330">Every day she would go with her children to different farmers [unclear], go to visit them, in case a, because the Germans knew there’s a Jew on this smolarnia, running the business, running the smo--even for them, she was afraid they might come.</span> <span id="s1331">When they round up the Jews in the town, they come to round up here.</span> <span id="s1332">He is a one man, he could run away.</span> <span id="s1333">But she was with small children.</span> <span id="s1334">What's she gonna do?</span> <span id="s1335">So every day she would, for the day she would go out, and at night she would come back.</span> <span id="s1336">But the farmers knew her, and being he was buying from them this, the woods, the roots of the wood, he was giving them a living.</span> <span id="s1337">So somehow she would come there and ask for food, and they were giving some bread or a bottle of milk or a couple of eggs.</span> <span id="s1338">And somehow she got contact for us.</span> <span id="s1339">And now we felt there was danger there with the pani.</span> <span id="s1340">I don't remember exactly what, but we felt danger there.</span> <span id="s1341">So we went away to different people.</span> <span id="s1342">And then we tried, and then again she would go to the villages and find out, and they told her, "Oh, Jews were here, yesterday, Jews were here, Saturday.</span> <span id="s1343">'Where are they?</span> <span id="s1344">Find me!</span> <span id="s1345">Connect me!'"</span> <span id="s1346">We contacted, you see, there were the partisans.</span> <span id="s1347">In our area were islands, but not islands from water, but islands surrounded with, with, how can I say, with swamps.</span> <span id="s1348">Swamps.</span> <span id="s1349">So the area was swampy.</span> <span id="s1350">But a little bit further, with their little, like a little hill, which is dry, and there are trees.</span> <span id="s1351">But how do you reach the little hill?</span> <span id="s1352">You had to go through the swamps.</span> <span id="s1353">And the swamps could go as far as your knee, or even as far as your chest.</span> <span id="s1354">So winter time the swamps would be frozen, but in summer time they were swamps.</span> <span id="s1355">So the partisans could not go there.</span> <span id="s1356">Now, in a bigger area, there were already a strong base from partisans, and they already took in people who would do supplies for them, like tailors and shoemakers, so they could, and blacksmiths, so they could do their horses the horseshoes.</span> <span id="s1357">And the tailors could sew clothing for them, or whatever they ever they needed.</span> <span id="s1358">And the women could bake bread for them and make food.</span> <span id="s1359">And there was like a base established.</span> <span id="s1360">I was never there, but it was, the families of the partisans were provided, or protected in other words.</span> <span id="s1361">So people told us, "There is a base of partisans."</span> <span id="s1362">Now they didn't take in everybody.</span> <span id="s1363">They only took selected people, either strong people, people who are young, and people who could fight.</span> <span id="s1364">So the women and children they didn't need.</span> <span id="s1365">So, on the other areas, on those islands, families were hiding and having to make bunkers in the woods.</span> <span id="s1366">But by then it was already '4--end of '43, the winter of '43, like, the winter starts like maybe like October, November, December, '43, going into '44.</span> <span id="s1367">So we were in one of the swamps, and it was very cold.</span> <span id="s1368">And it was raining.</span> <span id="s1369">And they made a shed out of leaves, and some twigs.</span> <span id="s1370">And the wind blew and it blew all apart.</span> <span id="s1371">And it was cold, and no food.</span> <span id="s1372">So, from the farmers, and we, by then they already made trouble for the villagers, too, took away Jews to go to camps.</span> <span id="s1373">They did not go to concentration camp, it was working labor camps.</span> <span id="s1374">I believe there were not concentration camps, because, the only paper you could get was a German paper - printed in Russian or in White Russian – but German use.</span> <span id="s1375">So they wanted to show in the paper their victories in Russia, there on to Moscow, the victories in Leningrad.</span> <span id="s1376">But they did show the mapoleh [disastrous defeat] in Stalingrad, because they were wearing like arm bands.</span> <span id="s1377">But mostly there was white, it's victory, victory, in Africa, victory in England, victories in the other, in Italy, wherever they had a victory.</span> <span id="s1378">But wherever they had tsuris [trouble], they didn't show it.</span> <span id="s1379">And, but a farmer would get news from the partisans.</span> <span id="s1380">They had underground radios, in contact with the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1381">And they might get news.</span> <span id="s1382">So, from the farmer we'd get news of bombings of anything.</span> <span id="s1383">We were very eager to hear anything, hear if the war is getting near.</span> <span id="s1384">But even if it's not getting near, at least, so the Russian army is standing near us, that we could be freed from the, from the Germans.</span> <span id="s1385">But remember, I am near the Russian border.</span> <span id="s1386">We waited for the Russian army.</span> <span id="s1387">I'm not in France there, waiting for the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">LH: Well, Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">RH: For the Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">LH: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">RH: I am too far from there.</span> <span id="s1392">If the Americans would have reached me, I could be dead ten times.</span> <span id="s1393">So, my mother went, and my aunt, Aunt Frieda, went to a farmer.</span> <span id="s1394">This farmer was a rich farmer.</span> <span id="s1395">He was [unclear].</span> <span id="s1396">He had lots of land.</span> <span id="s1397">He also was a, he was a farmer.</span> <span id="s1398">He was a smith, a blacksmith.</span> <span id="s1399">And the partisans would come to him to fix the horses, the horseshoes for the horses, because they were riding on horseback, to make it faster to get to their destination.</span> <span id="s1400">Also fixing their guns or something fixing for them.</span> <span id="s1401">So they would get spoiled.</span> <span id="s1402">So we figured he's involved with the partisans, so maybe he wouldn't be afraid to meet with us.</span> <span id="s1403">My mother went to him.</span> <span id="s1404">And she begged him, and offered to pay him in gold, he should build us a bunker.</span> <span id="s1405">We were undernourished.</span> <span id="s1406">We were very skinny.</span> <span id="s1407">I tell you as a matter of fact, we lost the menstruation.</span> <span id="s1408">From being undernourished, my mother and my aunt, they were young women, and I was a young teen, we lost the menstruation.</span> <span id="s1409">We didn't get any menstruation, because we were undernourished, no food.</span> <span id="s1410">It made me stunt my growth.</span> <span id="s1411">Maybe I would have been taller.</span> <span id="s1412">Because no food in the growing years, in the years when I had to grow.</span> <span id="s1413">He said he would ask his wife if he should do it.</span> <span id="s1414">By then, that was, this was in Pilcaschidna [phonetic], Pilcaschidna, Pilcaschidna.</span> <span id="s1415">My mother had to cross a river, and the bridge was burnt.</span> <span id="s1416">So there was a lot of wood, to cross on that log.</span> <span id="s1417">The log was frozen with lots of ice.</span> <span id="s1418">She couldn't walk on the log.</span> <span id="s1419">The log was all ice, my mother and my aunt.</span> <span id="s1420">By this time, my mother’s different sister, Frieda, her younger sister, was going with my mother, to, to cross the river.</span> <span id="s1421">And this is almost a little bit more safe, because German tanks could not cross the area.</span> <span id="s1422">There were no bridges, unless they, they crossed there, the army, which put up portable bridges.</span> <span id="s1423">But otherwise, and this takes time.</span> <span id="s1424">Otherwise, the bridges were burned by partisans.</span> <span id="s1425">The local people would cross either on the ice, or on the log.</span> <span id="s1426">So, now when they came to cross the river, my mother and my aunt were debating who should go first.</span> <span id="s1427">My mother being the older, so she says, "I'll go first.</span> <span id="s1428">And you see me, if I cross safely, then you follow me.</span> <span id="s1429">Don’t be afraid.</span> <span id="s1430">You follow me.”</span> <span id="s1431">And Frieda kept saying, "No!</span> <span id="s1432">I will go first, because if something happens to you, we are all lost.</span> <span id="s1433">Me and my children, including your child.</span> <span id="s1434">But if I go first, and I drown, and you survive, and you do not go across because you see it's dangerous, and, at least you'll be a mother to my children."</span> <span id="s1435">So the two sisters were arguing who should cross first the river.</span> <span id="s1436">Each one tried to spare each other's life, not to save their own life.</span> <span id="s1437">My mother wanted to go first.</span> <span id="s1438">In case she drown, so Frieda could be alive, could survive, and not cross the river any more.</span> <span id="s1439">On this log, which was round, and icy.</span> <span id="s1440">It was very slippery.</span> <span id="s1441">And Frieda kept saying, "No Fanya.</span> <span id="s1442">Let me go first.</span> <span id="s1443">Because if I drown, and you survive, at least you'll be able to be a mother for your child and my children."</span> <span id="s1444">They were both widows.</span> <span id="s1445">The two sisters are widows by now.</span> <span id="s1446">Because Frieda felt my mama is more energetic, older, and Frieda was very depressed.</span> <span id="s1447">She used to be very rich.</span> <span id="s1448">Her husband was killed.</span> <span id="s1449">She was sick.</span> <span id="s1450">She had from the cold, she had no warm clothing to wear.</span> <span id="s1451">She was dressed very poorly, in shmatas, in rags.</span> <span id="s1452">Her feet were [unclear].</span> <span id="s1453">She wore, she had a robe, so she was in this.</span> <span id="s1454">This was her only clothing.</span> <span id="s1455">No coat.</span> <span id="s1456">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1457">So she got sick.</span> <span id="s1458">Her blood was like it put a cold in her blood or something like that.</span> <span id="s1459">So she had cysts all over her body.</span> <span id="s1460">We had no medication to heal it, so people would give a little bit flour, corn meal or something.</span> <span id="s1461">She would put it, it should dry.</span> <span id="s1462">This was itching, in her head.</span> <span id="s1463">Especially on her behind.</span> <span id="s1464">She would sit on her back, on her arms.</span> <span id="s1465">So the two sisters were arguing who should go first.</span> <span id="s1466">Each one tried to spare each other's life.</span> <span id="s1467">Finally when they crossed the river and reached the farmer's house, he received them very nicely.</span> <span id="s1468">He knew who we were, from the family, that we are from a prominent family from our town.</span> <span id="s1469">He gave them food.</span> <span id="s1470">He gave them lodging, slept over the night.</span> <span id="s1471">And she begged him, and he said he would ask his wife.</span> <span id="s1472">And the wife was too scared.</span> <span id="s1473">So she begged him that he and his brother who was, his bro--this was Yosef, and his brother's name was something else.</span> <span id="s1474">But the brother already suffered from the Germans.</span> <span id="s1475">The whole village where Yosef's brother lived, was burned down.</span> <span id="s1476">They had no places to live any more.</span> <span id="s1477">The whole village was burned down.</span> <span id="s1478">Probably because they helped partisans.</span> <span id="s1479">Or they were accused of helping partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">LH: So did he build the bunker for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">RH: Yes he did, for 20 ruble gold.</span> <span id="s1482">He built the bunker for us.</span> <span id="s1483">And my mother and my aunt came back to us, and they told us good news.</span> <span id="s1484">Promised by Saturday the bunker will be ready.</span> <span id="s1485">And we had to endure, suffer through the few more days from the cold in this shack that we built from twigs and leaves.</span> <span id="s1486">And we came to this bunker.</span> <span id="s1487">But when we came into the bunker, it looked like a palace, like a mansion, to us.</span> <span id="s1488">First of all, it was warm, made out of logs, in the ground.</span> <span id="s1489">And to disguise it was sand and grass and twigs put over it.</span> <span id="s1490">He built us a little window so we could see, so we had light, at least see what's doing outside.</span> <span id="s1491">He built it from rocks a little stove.</span> <span id="s1492">And in the woods we could chop wood, and we could boil a little water.</span> <span id="s1493">And out of logs he made a table for us.</span> <span id="s1494">Out of logs.</span> <span id="s1495">He also made something like a deck.</span> <span id="s1496">And he brought us fresh straw.</span> <span id="s1497">So we slept on it.</span> <span id="s1498">So one deck was small, for three people.</span> <span id="s1499">So it slept my aunt Bushka and her husband Moishe and Shevi, their child, for three people.</span> <span id="s1500">And the one side was longer, so I slept with my mother.</span> <span id="s1501">And then Frieda slept with her two children, Sam and Annie, Shamma and Hannah.</span> <span id="s1502">And then later on my aunt found her brother-in-law--her husband's sister's husband--that she was killed, with this one child Sorah.</span> <span id="s1503">And Shmuli and Sorah and Labele they were killed in this execution in Krevitz.</span> <span id="s1504">I don't know if it was in [unclear], I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1505">But her husband Label and one daughter Sonya, they survived the execution, because they also were on the farm, in this smolarnia.</span> <span id="s1506">They survived.</span> <span id="s1507">So she found him and brought him to us, that he could be with us.</span> <span id="s1508">Sonya is now in Israel.</span> <span id="s1509">Label also lived in Israel, but he died of natural causes about ten or fifteen years ago.</span> <span id="s1510">As of age, natural causes, but Sonya lives in Haifa.</span> <span id="s1511">She's a teacher.</span> <span id="s1512">Her husband is a scientist.</span> <span id="s1513">They have two children, and grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">LH: So you were in the bunker and, was that where you...</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">RH: So now we are in the bunker.</span> <span id="s1516">The bunker was like a mansion compared to where we were there.</span> <span id="s1517">At one time later we were someplace in a village and we found a man all alone, from Dolhinow.</span> <span id="s1518">He was a blacksmith.</span> <span id="s1519">He survived.</span> <span id="s1520">So we found him.</span> <span id="s1521">He didn't know where to go.</span> <span id="s1522">So we brought him along with us.</span> <span id="s1523">And we lived there, and we made food.</span> <span id="s1524">And we lived there.</span> <span id="s1525">So this was the winter '43 and '44.</span> <span id="s1526">And by spring of '44 we heard like shatterings, from very far away, like shatterings.</span> <span id="s1527">And I said, "It sounds to me that this is bombings.</span> <span id="s1528">Maybe the front is coming near us."</span> <span id="s1529">This isn't a joke.</span> <span id="s1530">Because this was impossible.</span> <span id="s1531">This isn't a joke.</span> <span id="s1532">And one day, Label, he used to go to the farmer.</span> <span id="s1533">He was well liked with the peop--local people.</span> <span id="s1534">He was a joker, a likeable person.</span> <span id="s1535">He liked [unclear], he was well liked by the farmers, by their local people.</span> <span id="s1536">And, but this is in the villages, far away from our town.</span> <span id="s1537">We are in the woods.</span> <span id="s1538">This, the bunker is built in the woods.</span> <span id="s1539">So you’d think all this, all this banging that we hear, this is the front.</span> <span id="s1540">But it must be very far away.</span> <span id="s1541">At night, when it's very quiet, we could hear boom, boom, boom, boom.</span> <span id="s1542">And I figured by air you could hear very far.</span> <span id="s1543">Maybe it's the front coming nearer.</span> <span id="s1544">Then one time we heard the good news that the Americans had [unclear] in Normandy.</span> <span id="s1545">We didn't exactly knew where it was, or who or how, but the Americans came out to war.</span> <span id="s1546">So we were happy about it.</span> <span id="s1547">And then all of a sudden the bombing, the boom, boom came nearer and nearer, and running into the village, they said, "The front is coming nearer, that this is it!"</span> <span id="s1548">But we had to be very careful, because the German army is breaking away, and the soldiers are running where they can.</span> <span id="s1549">They're not going together as an army.</span> <span id="s1550">Each one for their own lives.</span> <span id="s1551">And if they come to the woods and find us, they could shoot us.</span> <span id="s1552">So we have to be very careful.</span> <span id="s1553">Also, by that spring, we were growing up.</span> <span id="s1554">Me, I was the oldest from my cousins, I tried to teach them, because you have to.</span> <span id="s1555">So we didn't have paper or pencils.</span> <span id="s1556">So on the ground, on the sand, we made it level, and take a stick, and teach.</span> <span id="s1557">My younger cousin, Hannah, which, and, she lives now in Canada, teach her one plus one.</span> <span id="s1558">Teach her the ABC, Russian ABC, teach her a little bit arithmetic.</span> <span id="s1559">I had to teach her.</span> <span id="s1560">We were at time four children: me, the oldest, Rachel; then my cousin Sam, Shein; and then my cousin Shevi, she is now in California; and my cousin Hannah, Henny, she is now in Canada.</span> <span id="s1561">Sam died in Canada not too long after, with a heart attack.</span> <span id="s1562">He was overweight, and he died about fifteen years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">LH: So when did the front come to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">RH: Actually, we did not see a front.</span> <span id="s1565">It was a Blitzkrieg.</span> <span id="s1566">The Russians learned from the German strategy.</span> <span id="s1567">And they did not stop fighting.</span> <span id="s1568">The partisans helped in the back, and there was a Blitzkrieg.</span> <span id="s1569">And every day later, when somebody else would go to the village, talk to the, to the local people, hear what's going on.</span> <span id="s1570">And they told us this, it was the front Hastrevitz, so a little further.</span> <span id="s1571">So one day Label went to Krevitz to find out what's doing, if any Jews are there.</span> <span id="s1572">He went with somebody, or probably the Shmied [phonetic], Yankele Shmied from Dolhinow.</span> <span id="s1573">Alone he wouldn't go, but he maybe went with Yankele Shmied from Dolhinow, went to Krevitz to find out.</span> <span id="s1574">Yes, there's already a government, a Russian government, local, from local people.</span> <span id="s1575">And the front is already far away.</span> <span id="s1576">And we decided that we are gonna come to town.</span> <span id="s1577">A week later, a couple weeks, because in the woods was dangerous.</span> <span id="s1578">Because it is broken up the army, two, three, four, five German soldiers, and they had ammunition.</span> <span id="s1579">They could kill us.</span> <span id="s1580">So one day we decided that all the people from this area who survived from my town, plus people from the next town, that were near us, they should all come with us to Krevitz.</span> <span id="s1581">We should come in as a group, not as individuals.</span> <span id="s1582">We should come in as a group.</span> <span id="s1583">So we hired a wagon, a horse and wagon, this is for the children to ride.</span> <span id="s1584">And adults walked.</span> <span id="s1585">We walked the whole night.</span> <span id="s1586">Because, let's say, "our" family, a few miles away at a different island, and a different few families, from a different town, from Yargov, we took them with us.</span> <span id="s1587">Then from a different island, other families from our town, we took them.</span> <span id="s1588">And we took them in.</span> <span id="s1589">We came in to the town, on a Sunday morning.</span> <span id="s1590">We walked the whole night.</span> <span id="s1591">And as we came, we saw how they, the trees that were chopped by the railroad, they were growing like little bushes.</span> <span id="s1592">So we knew what was happening.</span> <span id="s1593">And we came to the town, and people were living in our house.</span> <span id="s1594">So my mother went to the local authorities to tell them that we are back, and we'd like to, we suffered enough, wherever we were hiding, and we would like to have our house.</span> <span id="s1595">So they told them, the people who occupied our house that they should move out.</span> <span id="s1596">And, it was our furnishings.</span> <span id="s1597">Misery because everything was robbed, taken.</span> <span id="s1598">So we went to our house, and all the people that came along with us, our friends, moved into our house.</span> <span id="s1599">I mean the local people in my town, from Krevitz, maybe they could get their houses, too, but they were too scared to be a one person in their own house.</span> <span id="s1600">They'd rather sleep on the floor, but as a group.</span> <span id="s1601">We still didn't trust the local people either.</span> <span id="s1602">And the local people came running to see that we survived.</span> <span id="s1603">And some people would say, "We thought you were in America, you're, because you were so rich, that maybe hi--you chartered a plane and went to America or to England."</span> <span id="s1604">Some came with eggs and milk, butter with bread.</span> <span id="s1605">"We're happy you survived.</span> <span id="s1606">Thanks God you survived.</span> <span id="s1607">It was terrible for you.</span> <span id="s1608">It was terrible for us."</span> <span id="s1609">And people came to greet us, with presents, presents of food.</span> <span id="s1610">Because they were happy that we are here.</span> <span id="s1611">Then a little girl was playing there.</span> <span id="s1612">But she looked like a shiksehle [little Gentile girl].</span> <span id="s1613">So my mother says to me that, this is a shikseh girl.</span> <span id="s1614">Whose child is this?</span> <span id="s1615">Is she like from which neighbor?</span> <span id="s1616">Because none, she says, "Ich nicht a shiksehle.</span> <span id="s1617">Ich a Yiddishe.”</span> <span id="s1618">[I am not a little Gentile girl, I am a Jew.]</span> <span id="s1619">I say, "Oh yeah, who are you?</span> <span id="s1620">, wu bist du?”</span> <span id="s1621">She tells us, “Ich bin fun Miagov” [I am from Miagov.]</span> <span id="s1622">“Wer bist du fun Miagov?”</span> <span id="s1623">[Where are you from Miagov?”]</span> <span id="s1624">And she told her, Miagov was a town, I don't know how many kilometers from us.</span> <span id="s1625">But we heard of this town, Miagov.</span> <span id="s1626">And I heard when the Germans came in to us in '41, it's from Miagov they took the zwenzig beste baalebatim, the twenty prominent people - the rabbi, the rov, the shochet, the business people, and they tortured them.</span> <span id="s1627">And how did they torture them?</span> <span id="s1628">They put boiling water over them.</span> <span id="s1629">And the rabbi's beard they pulled.</span> <span id="s1630">They put vicious dogs, that the dogs should bite them, and pull them apart.</span> <span id="s1631">But they were very tortured.</span> <span id="s1632">Before they were shot they were tortured.</span> <span id="s1633">And among these twenty balebatim was this girl's father.</span> <span id="s1634">My mother prayed to God being I was an only child, that He should spare my life, that I should not be killed during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Tape two, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">RH: That he spares my life.</span> <span id="s1637">She felt it's gonna be a lot of orphans after the war, boys or girls, that she's gonna take a orphan, and raise it as her child.</span> <span id="s1638">So my mother wanted to take this little girl and raise her as her child.</span> <span id="s1639">But she was with a different family.</span> <span id="s1640">Her parents were, her father was killed in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1641">Then, she had a uncle or a cousin in Dolhinow, who was involved in partisans.</span> <span id="s1642">And he arranged to take out the Jews from that town one night.</span> <span id="s1643">There were prepared horses and wagons to take out the women and the children, take them out from the town.</span> <span id="s1644">And they did.</span> <span id="s1645">And they were hidden in woods.</span> <span id="s1646">And one day, the local people came to tell the Germans, that this is not an army, and no partisans, but women and children.</span> <span id="s1647">And the Germans came, and they made a, they rounded them up.</span> <span id="s1648">They were shooting them.</span> <span id="s1649">They rounded up and they were running away.</span> <span id="s1650">So this little girl, her name is Chayala.</span> <span id="s1651">Her name is Chayala, was Chayala Gordon.</span> <span id="s1652">Now she's married.</span> <span id="s1653">She lives in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s1654">She has four children of her own.</span> <span id="s1655">So Chayala was holding her mother's hand.</span> <span id="s1656">Her little brother, who was older than she, he fell.</span> <span id="s1657">And she was [unclear] her mother, and her mother fell.</span> <span id="s1658">She saw her mother trip over a wood, or a bush.</span> <span id="s1659">She let go of her mother's hand, and she was running, falling, running.</span> <span id="s1660">When it quieted down, she found a uncle, and she was with her uncle.</span> <span id="s1661">And by the end of the war, the uncle knocked on somebody's window in the middle of the night, asking for shelter or for food, and German people were in that village, and they shoot him.</span> <span id="s1662">Because she was little, standing next to him, they didn't notice her.</span> <span id="s1663">And he was of natural height.</span> <span id="s1664">And she was a child, maybe five years old.</span> <span id="s1665">So they didn't shoot her.</span> <span id="s1666">That’s what she was telling us.</span> <span id="s1667">And she ran away, and she found this, joined different people, and she went with people.</span> <span id="s1668">And then my mother took this little girl Chayala from this family.</span> <span id="s1669">My mother raised her.</span> <span id="s1670">And she was with us in our town.</span> <span id="s1671">When the time came for us to leave our town to go to Poland, we took her along.</span> <span id="s1672">When we came to Poland, you see, Poland was not a Polish government.</span> <span id="s1673">Maybe they speak Polish, but it was under Russia, under the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1674">We did not wish to remain there, because we wanted to go more to a western.</span> <span id="s1675">Our aim was to reach Israel or America, the United States.</span> <span id="s1676">By then my mother had a sister in Canada, and a brother in the United States, and another sister in the United States.</span> <span id="s1677">So we did not wish to remain in Europe.</span> <span id="s1678">We could not stand walking on the sidewalk, which were blood shed on the street, and seeing our shul, which was historic.</span> <span id="s1679">When the Germans first came in, they burned the Sefer Torahs [Torah scrolls], and all the stores in our town.</span> <span id="s1680">They made a big fire.</span> <span id="s1681">And they took out the Sefer Torahs, put them up like logs of wood.</span> <span id="s1682">And they burned them.</span> <span id="s1683">Even the local people felt that this was a shame to do, because they knew that for our people, the Torah is very holy.</span> <span id="s1684">So one of the, maybe a few of the local people helped schlep the Sefer Torahs to be burned.</span> <span id="s1685">Later on this guy, somehow, for whatever reason, the Germans shoot him.</span> <span id="s1686">And when the people, the local people went to his funeral, and he was displayed in his coffin, they said that his right arm was hanging, like it was shot.</span> <span id="s1687">And they felt, the local people, because he helped to carry the Jews' Torah to be burned.</span> <span id="s1688">Even he was shot by the Germans.</span> <span id="s1689">He was punished.</span> <span id="s1690">The local people were very Christian, very religious, at that time.</span> <span id="s1691">Maybe now they're modernized and maybe they're not so.</span> <span id="s1692">But at that time they were very Christian, and very religious, and believers in the Almighty.</span> <span id="s1693">So they felt that to a Jew this is a very holy thing, the Torah.</span> <span id="s1694">And because he helped the Germans burn it, he was punished for it.</span> <span id="s1695">He was shot by the Germans, and his right arm was sort of, to the shooting, cut, or, was hanging down.</span> <span id="s1696">It’s funny.</span> <span id="s1697">His name was Stavitsky.</span> <span id="s1698">I forgot his first name.</span> <span id="s1699">But I remember his face.</span> <span id="s1700">I forgot his first name.</span> <span id="s1701">My mother raised Chayala when we came to Germany to the displaced persons camp.</span> <span id="s1702">We came to Foehrenwald.</span> <span id="s1703">She came along with us.</span> <span id="s1704">She was always with us.</span> <span id="s1705">She was a little girl.</span> <span id="s1706">She used to go to school.</span> <span id="s1707">She was a blonde.</span> <span id="s1708">She was beautiful.</span> <span id="s1709">She was cute.</span> <span id="s1710">And she did come to the United States.</span> <span id="s1711">Actually, we sent her.</span> <span id="s1712">Because, my mother registered in the Committee of, all our names.</span> <span id="s1713">And our relatives here saw the names in the Jewish newspaper.</span> <span id="s1714">So they started making papers for us.</span> <span id="s1715">Maybe they saw Chayala's name also, but they didn't know that she belonged to us.</span> <span id="s1716">We registered her name as Chayala Gordon.</span> <span id="s1717">Maybe some of the family would see her from Yardov.</span> <span id="s1718">But they didn't know that we were raising her.</span> <span id="s1719">We had no communication by mail with them.</span> <span id="s1720">No communication with mail.</span> <span id="s1721">So they didn't know.</span> <span id="s1722">So for her we didn't have any papers.</span> <span id="s1723">So that time they were taking children, orphans, and bringing them to the States.</span> <span id="s1724">They signed them orphans.</span> <span id="s1725">And my mother registered her, to send her to the States, to our relatives here.</span> <span id="s1726">And when we will come, she is going to come to live with us.</span> <span id="s1727">So when she arrived to the States, my uncle, my mother's brother, his name is Rabbi Mendel, Al, Nachum Mendel Altari [phonetic].</span> <span id="s1728">At that time he was in Worchester.</span> <span id="s1729">And a social worker contacted him.</span> <span id="s1730">And he took her, and he raised her.</span> <span id="s1731">And he married her off.</span> <span id="s1732">He wrote, my mother also had a sister, Tolador, Telagor [phonetic], in Worchester.</span> <span id="s1733">She also wanted Chayala, to raise her.</span> <span id="s1734">But Mendel wanted to raise her because Mendel was rabbi.</span> <span id="s1735">The others were modern.</span> <span id="s1736">He wanted to raise her in a religious way, that she should know that she is Jewish and why her parents perished, because of being Jewish.</span> <span id="s1737">Now she's living a religious life.</span> <span id="s1738">She married a Lubavicher.</span> <span id="s1739">My uncle was a Lubavich, a Lubavicher.</span> <span id="s1740">Her husband is a rabbi.</span> <span id="s1741">He went, he made through college in his spare time, and he became a math teacher.</span> <span id="s1742">For he, he, as, to earn a living he was a Hebrew teacher in a yeshivah.</span> <span id="s1743">But in odd hours he would go to college and he became a math teacher.</span> <span id="s1744">He was teaching high school math.</span> <span id="s1745">And he works in computers in Manhattan.</span> <span id="s1746">They have four children.</span> <span id="s1747">Two daughters are married.</span> <span id="s1748">A son is engaged.</span> <span id="s1749">All went to yeshivahs.</span> <span id="s1750">All very fine family.</span> <span id="s1751">We are very proud of her, that she grew up on her own.</span> <span id="s1752">I mean, with our help, of course.</span> <span id="s1753">Chayala's children call me Tante Rocheleh.</span> <span id="s1754">My name is Rachel, and they consider me as an aunt, as being an older sister to Chayala.</span> <span id="s1755">They call me Tante Rocheleh and my husband is Uncle Moishe.</span> <span id="s1756">And we treat her children as our own, and whenever there is a simchah [joyful occasion], with nice gifts, and we love them.</span> <span id="s1757">Chayala already has two grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1758">Her two daughters who are married: one is married to a doctor who is Lubavich.</span> <span id="s1759">And the one daughter is married to a Lakewood student.</span> <span id="s1760">And he is still keeping and studying Torah in Lakewood yeshivah.</span> <span id="s1761">The son also went to Lubavich yeshivah.</span> <span id="s1762">The youngest son, her daughter is named Hannah for her mother.</span> <span id="s1763">And the son is named Michel [Michael], for her father, the two other children for different relatives, perhaps her husband's family.</span> <span id="s1764">Well, she still has one son engaged now, and one son is about 16 or 17, went to the Longbeach Yeshivah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">LH: Just let me ask you something about, you said you were in a camp, a DP camp at the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">RH: Well, this is a displaced persons' camp...</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">LH: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">RH: This is after the war.</span> <span id="s1769">In the displaced persons' camp, we were in '45 till the end of '47, actually beginning of '48 we left the camp to go, to come to North America, which we arrived to Canada.</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">LH: What was life like in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">RH: In camp?</span> <span id="s1772">Well, remember, the camp life was after the war.</span> <span id="s1773">It’s normal times.</span> <span id="s1774">We were supported by the Joint [American Joint Distribution Committee].</span> <span id="s1775">Right away we were organized . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">LH: By the Joint.</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">RH: By the Joint.</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">LH: What's the Joint?</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">RH: In other, the Joint is some kind of American organization, HIAS or something, or Joint, or Jewish philanthropies or something like that.</span> <span id="s1780">This is after the war.</span> <span id="s1781">This is displaced persons' camp.</span> <span id="s1782">They organized right away a school.</span> <span id="s1783">Schoolchildren went to school.</span> <span id="s1784">We taught them Hebrew and other subjects.</span> <span id="s1785">They opened up an ORT [Organization for Rehabilitation and Training] school.</span> <span id="s1786">I went to the ORT school.</span> <span id="s1787">I learned sewing.</span> <span id="s1788">Which I made beautiful gowns and beautiful dressed that I sewed.</span> <span id="s1789">I work with it.</span> <span id="s1790">I earn my, when I arrived to Canada I worked in a factory to sew, because I learned sewing in this ORT school.</span> <span id="s1791">There was also knitting.</span> <span id="s1792">I was working in a knitting school.</span> <span id="s1793">Or the knitting, I was already professional, while being hidden at the farm.</span> <span id="s1794">The farm there also had a name, the agrono, because he was an agricultural engineer.</span> <span id="s1795">Another one who was hiding us, actually, the original people who owned this farm, his name was Kuchevsky [phonetic].</span> <span id="s1796">He was a Polish officer.</span> <span id="s1797">And his wife was a teacher.</span> <span id="s1798">Her maiden name was Kobinska.</span> <span id="s1799">Now, to Kobinska came her sister Anna, for summer vacation.</span> <span id="s1800">and to Kuchevsky had his brother, who was a [unclear] a little bit near [unclear].</span> <span id="s1801">Also, his father, who was a president of the bank in Lublin, came on vacation, and the war broke out, and they couldn't go back.</span> <span id="s1802">Now, Kobinska, actually her name is not Kuchevska because she married the officer Kuchevsky and had two little girls--Marinka and Anushka.</span> <span id="s1803">Anushka lives in California.</span> <span id="s1804">Marinka is in Poland.</span> <span id="s1805">Then Mrs. Kuchevska was arrested, and she was sent to Siberia.</span> <span id="s1806">And Kuchevsky was arrested, and he was put in jail.</span> <span id="s1807">And the father, through all this tsuris [calamities], he couldn't reach his family in Lublin - his wife and his other children - and the tsuris here.</span> <span id="s1808">He couldn't take it.</span> <span id="s1809">He hanged himself in a barn.</span> <span id="s1810">Now, they left the two, they left the two, the two orphans - Marinka and Anushka, little children.</span> <span id="s1811">And Anna, which is their mother's sister, raised them, and her uncle, which is the father's brother, raised them.</span> <span id="s1812">And we stayed with them.</span> <span id="s1813">We stayed with them.</span> <span id="s1814">And that, when we arrived to this, to the, that we came to our, in the States, with Anna, that's the Kobinska, which I call her pani for my conversations, I call her pani because, between ourselves, we always say the pani, the pani.</span> <span id="s1815">We did not want to mention the name.</span> <span id="s1816">So, she survived with the children.</span> <span id="s1817">The uncle, he married and he died.</span> <span id="s1818">And she came to Poland with the two children.</span> <span id="s1819">Then their mother, Kuchevska, came from Siberia.</span> <span id="s1820">She survived the war.</span> <span id="s1821">And she came to Poland, to southern Poland.</span> <span id="s1822">Anna lives now in Krakow, and Kuchevska lives someplace not far from there.</span> <span id="s1823">I don't know exactly which village.</span> <span id="s1824">And Marinka went to college, and she married a dentist.</span> <span id="s1825">Anushka, my aunt Frieda helped bring to Canada, married her off, and she lives now in California.</span> <span id="s1826">She started going in Poland to medical school--Anushka--but she didn't finish, so she's a nurse assisting at operations, in surgery.</span> <span id="s1827">She's a nurse.</span> <span id="s1828">[tape off] Rachel Hochhauser was born in
