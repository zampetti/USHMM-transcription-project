And, of course, I just recently started school and everything was new and everything was rosy.</span> <span id="s32">I didn't know there was a worry in the world.</span> <span id="s33">Loved school, then went to, to learn how to dance and rhythm in Maccabee.</span> <span id="s34">Enjoyed life.</span> <span id="s35">Wintertime, skating; summertime, bicycle riding -- and that's how I remember home.</span> <span id="s36">The holidays were spent in my grandparents' house with all the children around and, and favorite dishes and favorite cups and very traditional, very traditional, and it was just great.</span> <span id="s37">It was just great.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">01:03:15</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Lovely.</span> <span id="s40">What happened when the war broke out?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Well, when the war broke out -- this was almost the beginning of a school year when the war broke out, and there was approximately three weeks of bombardment before the Germans entered Warsaw, and from the rubble I got injured but didn't feel bad.</span> <span id="s42">I was with my family and I didn't understand what was happening until, until I heard that Jewish males are, are running away towards the eastern border and two of my uncles and my father got ready to leave.</span> <span id="s43">My father then changed his mind and he stayed to take care of the family.</span> <span id="s44">They were going to leave, going towards the east, away from the Germans and that's when it dawned on me that something is wrong.</span> <span id="s45">But the Germans came in and immediate- immediately did not happen anything, like the same week, did not.</span> <span id="s46">But in a very short time, things started happening -- for the whole population and not only for Jews.</span> <span id="s47">It was very bad.</span> <span id="s48">Orders came out almost daily: “You mustn't do this, you mustn't do that.</span> <span id="s49">You have to give up your radios, your gold, your things.</span> <span id="s50">You're not allowed to go here or there.”</span> <span id="s51">Everyday something new, for the whole population, and it began being really bad for the Jews.</span> <span id="s52">They were singled out.</span> <span id="s53">We had to wear armbands, white armbands with a blue Star of David to identify ourselves.</span> <span id="s54">Jewish stores had to be identified.</span> <span id="s55">People who lived in Poland used to use their Jewish name in a, in a Polish version, and this was forbidden.</span> <span id="s56">You had to show your real Jewish name for easy identification and, therefore, persecution, beatings, and, and sending -- being sent out to, “To work,” so they said, and just beatings.</span> <span id="s57">And then Jews were not allowed to walk on the on the sidewalk, only in the middle of the streets.</span> <span id="s58">It became worse and worse daily.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">01:06:33</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: How did it affect you as a little girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: I was...I was all right as long as I was with my family because during this time my parents got in touch with a former teacher and they -- the teacher organized a little class of children to come to his house and study in exchange for almost anything like some food or clothing for his family.</span> <span id="s62">Of course, it was forbidden, and I enjoyed going there.</span> <span id="s63">We started off with 10 children, and little by little, the group got smaller as the children died from hunger or were caught and killed.</span> <span id="s64">I never knew what happened, just that they didn't show.</span> <span id="s65">But this happened: One day when I was on my way to, to the teacher, Professor Rózycki -- oh, we used to come separately so that the Germans or nobody would see that we're forming a group, so each one came within a few minutes of each other, and one day I was on my way and a few blocks away somebody stopped me and said, “Are you going to Professor Rózycki?”</span> <span id="s66">and I didn't answer.</span> <span id="s67">And they said, “Don't go there.”</span> <span id="s68">So I didn't go there, and I waited and it became clear that that very morning the Germans came, raided his house, killed all the males in the family.</span> <span id="s69">Even his father-in-law, who was in a wheelchair, was thrown out of the window.</span> <span id="s70">I don't remember how I got home, but I think that this was the, the time when my life, when I started realizing as a young girl what -- that something is happening.</span> <span id="s71">I looked around and people were on the street covered with papers, bodies, near bodies, were crying for bread.</span> <span id="s72">I was always fed, so I don't remember crying for food, although hunger was a constant companion.</span> <span id="s73">But the, the view of the bodies covered with paper, the swollen bodies, was bad.</span> <span id="s74">I had more time to look around and see it.</span> <span id="s75">When I was busy in school, I was busy.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">01:09:35 We had classes the whole day and then homework, and it kept us busy.</span> <span id="s77">But then when this was gone, I could see -- look around me, and I could see everything.</span> <span id="s78">I lost my friends to hunger.</span> <span id="s79">I, I saw people -- bodies -- being taken away in a little carriage, hand carriage, and there was nothing that I could do for anybody, nothing.</span> <span id="s80">There was a former teacher, Pani Kaminska, who was our music teacher in school and she tried to form a, a choir under those circumstances.</span> <span id="s81">It was unbelievable how our people tried to keep up the spirit, and how people know that when you're learning, when you're “doing,” you can, you can withstand hardship.</span> <span id="s82">May be easier or may be, may be harder, but it enables you to continue.</span> <span id="s83">You don't get necessarily wrapped up in yourself, in your hunger, in you- your being cold, or whatever.</span> <span id="s84">And we tried very hard, but it became impossible.</span> <span id="s85">It became impossible.</span> <span id="s86">Very soon thereafter we got orders to move: all Jews have to move into certain streets or rather remove themselves from certain streets in, in Warsaw, and there were some streets that were we were allowed to move to and we had to move.</span> <span id="s87">We were allowed to -- my parents had a store right across the street from our apartment, so in order to move fast like we were ordered many -- much of our belongings were put in the store and little by little we would carry to the new so-called apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">01:12:30 And one day before we knew it, we woke up and the gates of the ghetto were closed, everybody trapped.</span> <span id="s89">And I didn't realize it then but I did realize that there were so many people walking in.</span> <span id="s90">Now I know that it was because we were squeezed into a smaller area and also there were people brought in from other places into Warsaw ghetto, and therefore there were so many people and so many hungry and dead and cold people and there was nothing that anybody can do.</span> <span id="s91">Now the Germans daily would go out and catch people in the street, take them to what they called the Umschlagplatz, put them in trains and send them out.</span> <span id="s92">As a matter of fact, at the beginning, one of my aunts who had a husband and a son a year older than I was when they saw the advertising that the, the Germans put out that anybody who comes on his own to that Umschlagplatz will be treated well and sent to a camp for the duration of the war.</span> <span id="s93">My aunt packed for them their belongings and -- like bags -- and she got them there without knowing where they were going.</span> <span id="s94">Never saw them again and after a while we started hearing that that those people are not being sent to work.</span> <span id="s95">And you know, nobody wanted to believe.</span> <span id="s96">People were…started jumping off trains if they could.</span> <span id="s97">Whether they get shot or not, they tried.</span> <span id="s98">And more and more we started hearing that that people are being brought to camps and never heard from afterwards.</span> <span id="s99">To me, it was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s100">Nobody told me anything, but I could hear the adults talking among themselves.</span> <span id="s101">So it became worse and worse and then after they caught everybody in the streets, they started clearing out building by building.</span> <span id="s102">They made unannounced visits and called everybody to come down and be marched away.</span> <span id="s103">They also organized some factories.</span> <span id="s104">I remember I -- I was in one.</span> <span id="s105">I always looked older than I was and somehow my aunt, my aunt, my uncle, they took me along and I worked.</span> <span id="s106">This was after they took my parents away.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">01:16:00</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Back up a little bit and tell us what happened to your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Well, my parents...my parents perished separately.</span> <span id="s110">They -- when the Germans organized factories, everybody had to register and go to work, which they did, but then one day they marched off everybody from the factory and that's how my father got caught.</span> <span id="s111">He went to work, never came back.</span> <span id="s112">The whole group was marched to Umschlagplatz and sent away.</span> <span id="s113">My mom, she went out one morning to see if she could exchange some clothes for some food for the family and she got caught on the street and sent to Umschlagplatz.</span> <span id="s114">Never saw her again.</span> <span id="s115">Now, my older sister -- we, we then had to move again twice after, after that.</span> <span id="s116">And at that time, my older sister and I, we went with, with my grandmother, my aunt, and my aunt's little boy.</span> <span id="s117">We were living in Muranowska, and one day when the Germans came in to look for us, we had, we had hiding places.</span> <span id="s118">We had -- well, I have to go back and describe the hiding place.</span> <span id="s119">In this building, like in many buildings in Warsaw, the outside walls are very thick and there was no refrigeration at that time, so usually underneath a window there would be a little cabinet that served as a refrigerator.</span> <span id="s120">The buildings were made of stone and therefore keeping things cool and the walls are very wide.</span> <span id="s121">We were, we were in such a building and at the time my grandmother, my aunt and her little boy would sit right underneath in the, in the little cabinet underneath the window, and I put a chair in front of it so nobody notices there is a door.</span> <span id="s122">Then there was a folding bed that folded up to look like a table with a mattress inside and my sister went inside, and I folded the bed and I threw something over it so that she cannot be noticed.</span> <span id="s123">And I went -- I was supposed to go upstairs to the attic and hide in the attic, but by the time all that was done there was no time to go to the attic, so I went to the little bathroom which had a shelf.</span> <span id="s124">Where I sit now across was a shelf, up high, and on the wall that they had a ladder standing there for whatever reason.</span> <span id="s125">I jumped on top of the shelf in the bathroom and there was the bulb, the light.</span> <span id="s126">I quietly unscrewed the bulb and I made sure that my clothes don't show down and I sat there quietly.</span> <span id="s127">Well, the Germans came in and they found my sister….</span> <span id="s128">So that's how I lost my parents and my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">01:20:40</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: What did you do when the Germans left?</span> <span id="s131">They had taken your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s133">We, we heard some shots and, and, see, my aunt and my grandmother could see through a little ventilator that was in the wall, but they didn't tell me anything, but I heard from neighbors that they have shot my sister, but I don't know for sure.</span> <span id="s134">Over the years I've been trying to find her.</span> <span id="s135">You know, just, just the possibility...right?</span> <span id="s136">Nobody told me for sure.</span> <span id="s137">So that's how I lost them.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: What happened after that incident?</span> <span id="s139">Where did you go?</span> <span id="s140">What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Well, I had, I had, I have an uncle who was married and -- to a Polish lady, and she was with him in the ghetto all the time.</span> <span id="s142">They lost a son to, to illness and my other uncle together with his brother decided -- and my aunt -- they decided that something has to be done and we have to leave, so they went out and they found an apartment somewhere, very inexpensive with one bedroom and, first, her husband, my aunt's husband, my uncle, came out to live in that apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Excuse me -- you're saying they found an apartment outside the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Outside of the ghetto, oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">01:23:10</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: How -- can you explain how did they find it?</span> <span id="s147">They were not allowed to go out.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Well, they smuggled themselves out with a group of people that was going to work, to labor.</span> <span id="s149">There were factories -- there were places where, outside of the ghetto, where Jews were marched to every morning and brought back to the ghetto every night, and they worked there, and you could apparently -- I wouldn't know how, but apparently you could.</span> <span id="s150">I heard that you could sometimes find either a nice or a greedy soldier who was watching and for some money would let somebody out.</span> <span id="s151">I haven't witnessed it that but just heard.</span> <span id="s152">I know that my uncle would go out with a group of people.</span> <span id="s153">They were going to, to a factory that used to belong to a family person like a cousin or of, of the family's who had a factory of, of electric chandeliers, and the Germans took it over, and I think that they kept him as a manager or something, or as a foreman, and groups were coming in to work.</span> <span id="s154">They probably switched their chandeliers.</span> <span id="s155">They didn't do chandeliers, only did other things in there, but it was still something.</span> <span id="s156">So the groups were coming in and out and he could go out, smuggle himself out and then two brothers and one brother's wife.</span> <span id="s157">My uncle Janek with his wife Zosia; my uncle Mietek, who was single, and my Aunt Zosia had brothers there who apparently helped them find an apartment and it was all in Aunt Zosia's name.</span> <span id="s158">That's why it was a small apartment, and they made a double wall over there.</span> <span id="s159">In the little bedroom they made a double wall and that's where later on my grandmother went out this way into that apartment.</span> <span id="s160">My uncle came to pick them up, and then my aunt went, and...with a baby, little Jakov, who was born in May of '39 just before the war started.</span> <span id="s161">And little by little, whoever was left -- my grandmother, my aunt, my other aunt, two uncles, and I was left and my Aunt Tecia, the one who sent her husband and son on the on the trip, well, she was a nurse and a very good nurse, and my uncle came to take her out, and she refused to go.</span> <span id="s162">Apparently, she knew there were rumors, must have been rumors about the, the revol- the revolt, and as a nurse she wanted to be there and besides by that time she realized that her husband and son are dead, so she did not want to leave.</span> <span id="s163">Anyway, it was decided that I go out, so my uncle took me out.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">01:27:20</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Can you describe to me what Warsaw was like at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Oh, when, when I left the Warsaw ghetto, there were still some buildings there staying, standing.</span> <span id="s167">The, the ghetto was, was -- there was very few people -- not, not more people.</span> <span id="s168">Most people were either in the factories or gone from the factories, and on the street you didn't see anybody.</span> <span id="s169">You couldn't.</span> <span id="s170">When, when I left Warsaw a year later to go to camp, that's when Warsaw looked terrible, all burned out.</span> <span id="s171">But when I left ghetto it was still standing and the revolt started and after it was finished, I took a -- when I was outside I was able to, to ride in a tram, tramway around the walls and I saw it burning, and I saw the airplane coming and bombing it, and I saw it all burning, and I couldn't even shed a tear.</span> <span id="s172">You become so strong.</span> <span id="s173">I never thought about it, but you become so strong.</span> <span id="s174">The, the survival – the urge to survive becomes number one priority, and I just looked at it and my thought was that I mustn't cry because other people will see me.</span> <span id="s175">Unreal, but true.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Let us go back.</span> <span id="s177">Now you're still in the Warsaw ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Tell us about when you were smuggled out and describe it, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Oh...</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: What year and months are we in, about?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">01:29:35</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Ok, the approximate time I can know, because my birthday was in March and I remember when my uncle told me the story how it was decided that I come out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s184">It seems my uncle spoke to his wife, Zosia, and he told her that it's my birthday and I'm a young child and so on, and an invitation was issued for me to come out.</span> <span id="s185">So my other uncle, his brother, Uncle Mietek, he came back into the ghetto and he is the one who took me out.</span> <span id="s186">We went with a group of workers, night shift.</span> <span id="s187">And we marched, marched together and we were marched through the streets to that factory on....I think it was on Grzybowska Street...that factory that belonged to, to this relative of ours.</span> <span id="s188">I even remembered his name but I can't recall it on the spot -- Gruszkiewicz, Gruszkiewicz.</span> <span id="s189">Well, we -- finally, the whole group went in into the big door or gate and in front it was empty only you had to go through a -- well, it is like, like the building is all around and, and is…in the center is empty.</span> <span id="s190">So they had to go to the other side and the workers walked through this gate into the factory.</span> <span id="s191">My uncle and I went into the staircase on the side of the front which was empty, and I remember we sat there quietly the whole night.</span> <span id="s192">It was very cold.</span> <span id="s193">It was sometime in March.</span> <span id="s194">It was very cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">01:33:55 We sat there the whole night because of the curfew and in the morning we carefully, very carefully made our way to the apartment of my aunt and uncle.</span> <span id="s196">We were stopped on the way by somebody who wanted money who felt he recognized us.</span> <span id="s197">My uncle took care of it.</span> <span id="s198">I was just numb.</span> <span id="s199">I was just numb.</span> <span id="s200">But we finally reached the, the apartment there and I saw my grandmother and my aunt and at that time my little cousin was not there anymore because they found a place for him with a Polish woman whom, whom -- who was paid, and she was also very, very good.</span> <span id="s201">She took care of him.</span> <span id="s202">He was like three years old, three and a half.</span> <span id="s203">And it was quite, quite a risk to take a little boy of three and a half.</span> <span id="s204">And she took the risk so she, she took care of the little boy in her room.</span> <span id="s205">She only lived in one room.</span> <span id="s206">Everything together -- the kitchen, and was, was a little stove there.</span> <span id="s207">That's all.</span> <span id="s208">And she took care of him.</span> <span id="s209">And she was not rich.</span> <span id="s210">She was something.</span> <span id="s211">So when I got to that apartment, I saw my uncle, my two aunts, my grandmother, and I must say that that I felt kind of safe.</span> <span id="s212">Little did I know that...that we weren't safe at all, but that's how I felt.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">01:34:05</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: How did you live in that apartment for the next two weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Oh, we didn't, we didn't stay there too long.</span> <span id="s216">As I said I felt safe but it was not very safe because in a very little time, soon after we got there, after the curfew there was a knock on the door and some agents came in.</span> <span id="s217">They spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s218">They must have been German agents that knew Polish.</span> <span id="s219">You know, there were some people there they call themselves Volksdeutche, but they, they spoke Polish very well.</span> <span id="s220">I don't know who they were.</span> <span id="s221">They were civilians, but I remember they wore boots, high boots.</span> <span id="s222">They came in and they looked and they found a little trap door and they got us all out.</span> <span id="s223">Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s224">So, it wasn't that safe as I thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: What did they do with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Well, they wanted to take us to, to the authorities.</span> <span id="s227">My Aunt Zosia, she begged them and, and she did everything she could and they would talk only to her.</span> <span id="s228">They wouldn't talk to anybody else, and whatever possessions there were, they took it all in exchange for an agreement that in the morning right after curfew lets off, we'll all disperse, and they don't want to see us anymore.</span> <span id="s229">So that's what happened.</span> <span id="s230">We just had to leave.</span> <span id="s231">And from that time, each, each of us had a different story to tell.</span> <span id="s232">Well, Adolph (ph), my Aunt Zosia, and Uncle Janek -- they both survived.</span> <span id="s233">My uncle Janek lives in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s234">He’s marvelous, he’s marvelous.</span> <span id="s235">Aunt Zosia died two years ago, I think.</span> <span id="s236">I went to visit when she was still alive.</span> <span id="s237">My grandmother didn't survive.</span> <span id="s238">She committed suicide in a bathtub, in a public, in a public bath- bath house, after she heard that her son, Uncle Mietek was killed and that happened while I was watching.</span> <span id="s239">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s240">01:37:05</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: You -- excuse me.</span> <span id="s242">You were watching?</span> <span id="s243">Tell me what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Well, after we were all dispersed, we had some, we had to find some place to stay and Aunt Zosia took care of Aunt -- Janek, her husband.</span> <span id="s245">Uncle Mietek, he tried to take care of, of his sister Esther and the little boy who was with this lady, Olga, Olga her name, and -- and there was another young fellow whom my Uncle Mietek rescued.</span> <span id="s246">I forgot his name but he was 17 years old.</span> <span id="s247">And at that time he found through, through some acquaintances from before the war.</span> <span id="s248">They’re were some people that that knew us.</span> <span id="s249">Through them he found a lady with two daughters, grown daughters, and she – for, for payment, she decided to take us in.</span> <span id="s250">Her name was Jadwiga Rzempoluch.</span> <span id="s251">Can't remember the address, and she took me in.</span> <span id="s252">I was, I was there doing practically nothing, but one of the daughters had a baby, so I would play with the baby and the whole family smoked so I was making the, the cigarettes with the machine -- papierosnica -- they used to have.</span> <span id="s253">And then one day, then one day when it became a little warmer, they decided that it's going to be very good and safe to go to their summer place.</span> <span id="s254">They had a summer place in Struga which was on another narrow train line.</span> <span id="s255">There were regular trains and the ones, the short distance ones, and this was on the line of Radzymin, and there was a little place Struga where they had a, a place and they decided to go there and we went there.</span> <span id="s256">There was, besides Mrs. Rzempoluch and her two daughters, one of whom was blond and one of whom was dark haired and brown eyed.</span> <span id="s257">The blond young lady had a baby.</span> <span id="s258">The, the other one was single.</span> <span id="s259">Then my Uncle Mietek, the young 17 year old boy and I, we all went out to Struga for summer to enjoy the summer vacation.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">01:40:55 And it was beautiful.</span> <span id="s261">We had a nice evening, and we went to bed and early in the morning we were surrounded by Germans who knocked on the doors, woke us up and they demanded two Jew -- two Jewish men and a Jewish woman.</span> <span id="s262">Somebody must have told them, and at that time they took out the young fellow, the 17 year old boy...18.</span> <span id="s263">They beat him, they beat him.</span> <span id="s264">They, they broke all his limbs before they shot him dead.</span> <span id="s265">My Uncle Mietek, he had, he had some good documents, probably false, I don't know; something that was called good documents.</span> <span id="s266">They didn't beat him.</span> <span id="s267">They just told him to take a handkerchief and put in front of his face and walk away.</span> <span id="s268">And the Germans were target shooting to shoot out his brains through the handkerchief and they did.</span> <span id="s269">They did.</span> <span id="s270">So they couldn't find the woman because I was there.</span> <span id="s271">They thought, they thought it was the dark haired daughter of Pani Rzempoluch, but she worked for, for the chocolate firm Wedl and had very good documents and they checked on it and it wasn't her.</span> <span id="s272">They didn't know, they didn't question me.</span> <span id="s273">Finally they took me as a hostage to Radzymin to the police station to find out what happened to the Jewish woman or Jewish female or whatever.</span> <span id="s274">That's how my uncle died.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">01:43:45</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: What happened to you then?</span> <span id="s277">They...did the police let you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Well, I was there I think two days and they kept questioning me.</span> <span id="s279">I was, what, about 14?</span> <span id="s280">They kept questioning me, and I told them that I was from, from the eastern Poland where the Russians are so that nobody can check and then they came, came out with a map to show where, where it is.</span> <span id="s281">I said I don't know how to read a map.</span> <span id="s282">See --</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: You had false papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: I originally had but they were stolen out of my pocket one day and I didn't have -- so told them I don't know how to read a map.</span> <span id="s285">On the third day they took me across the street from the police station to a bar, two of them, Polish policemen, and they ordered vodka and I thought that -- I, I didn't tell them anything.</span> <span id="s286">Whatever they ask me, I said, “I don't know.”</span> <span id="s287">I didn't know anything.</span> <span id="s288">I was just there as a maid and I'm from the eastern part.</span> <span id="s289">I, I had a name for this little town, and that's all I know.</span> <span id="s290">Well, they ordered vodka.</span> <span id="s291">I, I had only one shot with them, and then afterwards when they drank and I tried to -- I spilled it all.</span> <span id="s292">I, I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s293">They asked again, but then I heard this little whistle of the train and Radzymin was the last stop of the train so it would only go back to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s294">It was running between Warsaw and Radzymin.</span> <span id="s295">I heard the whistle and I got up to see at the door of the bar, the was door, and the two policemen looked.</span> <span id="s296">I didn't say anything.</span> <span id="s297">I opened the door and I ran as quickly as I could and, and I jumped in into the train as it started moving, yeah.</span> <span id="s298">I don't know if I could have any guts to do that nowadays.</span> <span id="s299">I probably couldn't run either, but that's what happened and, and I had to hide out from the conductor because I had no money for ticket and the train arrived to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s300">Was close to curfew time, and I had no place to go, but, I got into a, a house and into a staircase and spent the night there, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">01:46:50</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: What happened the next morning?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Oh, the time -- the days were like nights and nights like days.</span> <span id="s304">It's really hard to, to say, “The next morning…” or “The next day…” or whatever, but what happened is that I went back to the area where my parents and I used to live and I tried to find some friends.</span> <span id="s305">My parents had a lot of friends and my grandparents, my grandmother, my uncles, aunts -- they were living there all their lives.</span> <span id="s306">They had a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s307">I went to a lady who was, who used to come and talk to my mother for hours and hours and I thought they were very good friends.</span> <span id="s308">Pani Adamowska, I went to her and she, she was afraid.</span> <span id="s309">She was glad to see me and she told me that she's happy that I'm alive, but she was really afraid.</span> <span id="s310">And I went to other places but couldn't find a place.</span> <span id="s311">Spent a couple of nights on, on staircases and, and I went to visit Pani Ola who had little Jakov, and she treated me so well.</span> <span id="s312">She did.</span> <span id="s313">What a person.</span> <span id="s314">I would feel that Pani Adamowska, who was educated and friend, that she would be the one.</span> <span id="s315">Instead Pani Ola who was really plain nice, nice person -- she did.</span> <span id="s316">She let me spend the night on the floor, she gave me something to eat, and she told me that there was a job open on this same line Otvosk, which I mentioned at the beginning that our family used to spend summers between Warsaw and Otvosk.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">01:49:20 On this same line in a little village somebody was looking for a maid and I went there and I got hired.</span> <span id="s318">Yeah.</span> <span id="s319">That that solved a lot of problems.</span> <span id="s320">And I worked there for a while and I was able to once a week bring some potatoes or bread to Pani Ola who had little Jakov, who, who was named then Jacek.</span> <span id="s321">Jacek is now an engineer at a doctorate from, from Haifa Technion.</span> <span id="s322">He's also -- how do you say?</span> <span id="s323">He teaches, let's put it this way.</span> <span id="s324">Occasionally gives lectures, that's what I wanted to say.</span> <span id="s325">He lectures occasionally and he has three beautiful daughters and one granddaughter, and that was my, that's my little cousin.</span> <span id="s326">So he spent the war with Pani Ola.</span> <span id="s327">His mother also had a story.</span> <span id="s328">My Aunt Esther, a story all by its --everybody has a story.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: What happened to you though?</span> <span id="s330">You were now working, staying with Pani Ola and working as a maid.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: I was working as a maid.</span> <span id="s332">I was on the horse (ph).</span> <span id="s333">I was able to, to bring somethings to Pani Ola, food.</span> <span id="s334">I would -- when I peeled potatoes, I was allowed to take the peels and I would go to Warsaw to a German kitchen, give them the peels and they would give me bread.</span> <span id="s335">And then I think that they fed the peels to, to some animals.</span> <span id="s336">So anyway I was bringing some potatoes, bread, milk, I was looking after the, the goats.</span> <span id="s337">I was able to do that, and then while be -- while I was with, with, at Ola's, spending a few nights, I met a person who from that day on played a big role in my life.</span> <span id="s338">She came from, from Lvov.</span> <span id="s339">She lost a husband and a child.</span> <span id="s340">Actually she lost a child.</span> <span id="s341">She didn't know where her husband was.</span> <span id="s342">And she came to Warsaw and somebody told her to go to Pani Ola.</span> <span id="s343">I don't know how she got there, but I met her there.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">01:52:45</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Pepi.</span> <span id="s347">Her name was Pepi.</span> <span id="s348">But I didn't know that because at the time she had false papers and her name was Emilia Boszko.</span> <span id="s349">I met her at Ola's, and I had a job.</span> <span id="s350">And then in, in that small village near Miedzeszyn there was a nursery school, kindergarten and somebody told me that there was an opening there.</span> <span id="s351">And I told Pepi that there's an opening and she went and she got the job.</span> <span id="s352">It was very, very hard.</span> <span id="s353">She did everything but she had a place to, to sleep and she got the job.</span> <span id="s354">And then she read in the paper or she found out that in Warsaw, in a suburb of Warsaw, Zoliborz, was an opening for a cook in a restaurant and she went and she got the job as a cook.</span> <span id="s355">Meanwhile, where I was, was getting a little uncomfortable because when I went to the priest on Sunday, he, he looked at me funny.</span> <span id="s356">He gave me a, a pocketful of nuts and candy and he told me that there was one God for everybody.</span> <span id="s357">He was fantastic.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s359">I'm going to go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: And one day he sent a message to me that I should go to another town for a couple of hours, and there was a raid, so I knew he was a friend.</span> <span id="s361">Well, I probably will tell you just that I became a cook's helper in Warsaw in Zoliborz.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Ok, I want to pause, stop.</span> <span id="s363">We need to change tapes at this point and then we'll go back,</span></p> <p><span id="s364">01:55:20 End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s366">[Technical Conversation]</span></p> <p><span id="s367">02:00:25</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s369">We, you had mentioned a priest.</span> <span id="s370">Can you tell us how you came to know a priest?</span> <span id="s371">You were in Pruszkow still, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: No, Pruszkow --</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Where are you now?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: In Warsaw and around Warsaw, in Michalen, in Miedzeszyn, in Zoliborz.</span> <span id="s375">We were talking about that.</span> <span id="s376">When I first got to got to know and went to church, was there in Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: This is before you were smuggled out?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s379">After.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: This is after?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: After, right.</span> <span id="s382">I, I had originally -- my Uncle Mietek had arranged for false identification papers which I think I mentioned before they were stolen out of my pocket together with the rózaniec, which are the pray, the beads that you pray.</span> <span id="s383">And it was stolen out of my pocket in a tramway in Warsaw, and I had no documentation.</span> <span id="s384">I couldn't get a job anywhere because wherever I went they wanted documents and -- or my original false documents said that I came from a little village near the Russian border and I kept up with it, and my name was Krystyna Maria Kalnowska.</span> <span id="s385">And it continued to be that way, but when my documents were stolen and I couldn't get a job, I went to the authorities -- oh, yes.</span> <span id="s386">I went to the authorities and they were in front.</span> <span id="s387">There were Polish policemen and there were Germans all over the place and although I studied German I did not tell anybody I knew, but I came up to a Polish policeman and I told him that I don't have any documents.</span> <span id="s388">I can't get a job because everybody thinks I'm Jewish without papers.</span> <span id="s389">I need some documents, at which point the policeman brought me to an office and they asked me for a few zloty to pay for the document, and I said I had no money.</span> <span id="s390">A few policemen got them together and paid I think six zloty or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">02:03:00 I didn't have any money and I needed the documents and, and I got a real good document so I could get a job with it and that's how I got it.</span> <span id="s392">Oh, I met a lot of good people.</span> <span id="s393">I have trust in people.</span> <span id="s394">You see, when we're talking about the Nazi era, that's one thing.</span> <span id="s395">But when we're talking about people, now that's another thing.</span> <span id="s396">People are good.</span> <span id="s397">And I found lots of goodness in people, everywhere I went.</span> <span id="s398">It doesn't – it, it made no difference whether they were, what their religion was, their nationality, I find good people.</span> <span id="s399">Maybe I'm lucky but that's what I see.</span> <span id="s400">Like the documents.</span> <span id="s401">And I felt that at one point that religion is religion, and we play pray to God and at the same time it's also safe to go Sunday to church, and I thought to myself that I'm gonna to pray to God.</span> <span id="s402">I don't have to name God.</span> <span id="s403">Whatever it is, I'm gonna to pray, and I went to church.</span> <span id="s404">This was -- the only thing I had were churches.</span> <span id="s405">I went to church and I prayed.</span> <span id="s406">I didn't know how.</span> <span id="s407">I picked up a book and I read and I did what other people did, and pretty soon I was pretty good.</span> <span id="s408">And this priest I mentioned before in that little town, as I said, I used to go Sunday to church and then in a little town you stop and talk and he talked to me, and I was not very convincing.</span> <span id="s409">I didn't try to be convincing.</span> <span id="s410">I was talking to a priest.</span> <span id="s411">I was more open than, than with anybody on the street except I didn't give myself away willingly.</span> <span id="s412">I didn't state who I was, but he figured out and he also put some nuts in my pocket for Sunday, and candy.</span> <span id="s413">But he told me that I could get a better job or whatever and I didn't pay attention.</span> <span id="s414">I needed that one.</span> <span id="s415">But one day I got really sick, very sick.</span> <span id="s416">I broke out in, in skin rashes and that's because I was taking care of a pig and of a goat, billy goat, and cleaning out all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">02:06:05 I only owned one flannel yellow shirt which at daytime I put a piece of string around, was a dress, and at night it was a nightgown.</span> <span id="s418">And once when I wanted to wash it, I froze.</span> <span id="s419">I didn't have it.</span> <span id="s420">And my bed was in the kitchen and, on this side of the wall.</span> <span id="s421">The other side of the wall was the pig sty.</span> <span id="s422">And from this I got all kinds of rashes.</span> <span id="s423">I didn't go to the doctor of course, but I told the priest.</span> <span id="s424">I think that gave me away.</span> <span id="s425">He said, “Did you grow up on a farm?”</span> <span id="s426">And I said [nodding head “yes”].</span> <span id="s427">“Well,” he says, “you belong -- you, you don't belong on a farm.”</span> <span id="s428">And, and he told me to go to the pharmacy and buy calamine lotion or whatever it was, and I did.</span> <span id="s429">And this is the same priest who one day sent word that I ought to go to another town for a while.</span> <span id="s430">And I knew that he, he knows that somebody must have said something or suspect and if there was a suspicion they would come and check it out.</span> <span id="s431">So I walked to Warsaw, stayed at Ola's for the night and everything went ok, but I couldn't stay there much longer.</span> <span id="s432">Also my friend Pepi was in Warsaw, in Zoliborz, and -- where I went to visit with her, she told me there is an opening for an assistant cook, but there was no place to, to stay.</span> <span id="s433">She had a bed in the in the room behind the kitchen.</span> <span id="s434">She's willing to share it with me, and I did that.</span> <span id="s435">I went to, to her in Zoliborz and helped her in the kitchen of a restaurant.</span> <span id="s436">We were there, oh, couple of months when the Polish revolt started in '44, and I remember that day.</span> <span id="s437">That was a tough day.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">02:09:00 It is all, it is all together, comes together with my aunt and her son Jacek, who was with Ola.</span> <span id="s439">It happened to be my day off, and I went to my aunt and she was at that time on the other side of River Vistula.</span> <span id="s440">They call it now Vistula but it's Wisla, really, on -- in Praga.</span> <span id="s441">It's not Prague, Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s442">It's the part of Warsaw that's called Praga.</span> <span id="s443">She was there as a maid and I helped her arrange it.</span> <span id="s444">And another good soul, another gorgeous person did it for me.</span> <span id="s445">It cost money, yes.</span> <span id="s446">Whatever I earned in the restaurant as that helper's cook and Pepi's salary went for it be --</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Went for what?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: He, a friend of my parents' who was working as a tram driver, conductor on the tram.</span> <span id="s449">I met him on the street one day and he wanted to help me.</span> <span id="s450">And I told him that I need a place for my aunt to stay, and some documents, and he arranged it.</span> <span id="s451">His name I never forget because I was looking for him for many years.</span> <span id="s452">I wanted to thank him.</span> <span id="s453">I don't know if he's alive.</span> <span id="s454">Stefan Mningoc, Stefan Mningoc.</span> <span id="s455">I get goose bumps when I think about it.</span> <span id="s456">He had a sister who lived in Praga with a husband and some children, I don't remember how many.</span> <span id="s457">And the husband declared himself Volksdeutche.</span> <span id="s458">Means that he gets all the privileges, and of course with the privileges becomes the possibility to hire a maid.</span> <span id="s459">Now this Stefan went to his sister after he arranged for my aunt a document saying that she's Natalia, forgot the last name.</span> <span id="s460">I'll remember it probably.</span> <span id="s461">Natalia, he arranged for her the documents.</span> <span id="s462">He went to his sister and he told her a story.</span> <span id="s463">He told her that Natalia is a widow of a fellow officer in the Polish army and she willing to be the governess for the children and whatever because she is now a widow.</span> <span id="s464">He told his own sister that and he knew that people were, were, were killed if they tried to help Jews and yet he did that for my aunt.</span> <span id="s465">He told me it was for my parents and for my sister that he's doing that.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">02:12:40 And she wo- she worked there as a maid and on that day when, when the Polish revolt started.</span> <span id="s467">I had a day off, and I went to visit her across, walked across the bridge and she had given me a sweater which she knitted for her son, little Jakov -- little Jacek -- and she -- and I -- said “Yes, I'm going there.”</span> <span id="s468">She says, “Would you take it to my son?”</span> <span id="s469">And I took the sweater and I visited with her first and I took the sweater, and I went back to the bridge to visit Ola with my little cousin and brought the sweater.</span> <span id="s470">And then I went back to Zoliborz to the restaurant where I was, and as I came back the shots started.</span> <span id="s471">And the, the Polish revolt started.</span> <span id="s472">It was '44.</span> <span id="s473">I think October 1, if I'm not mistaken.</span> <span id="s474">I hadn't seen them until after the war because --</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: By “them,” you mean your aunt --</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: My aunt or my cousin, her son.</span> <span id="s477">You wanted to know how about my grandmother, I think you asked.</span> <span id="s478">Oh, no.</span> <span id="s479">I did say -- I did tell you that she committed suicide when she found out that my Uncle Miatek was killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: I'd like to go back now.</span> <span id="s481">You're talking about the beginning of the Polish revolt in 1944.</span> <span id="s482">Can you tell me what that day was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Well, I can tell you what it was for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">02:14:50</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: It was a day that I had the time off and I went to visit my aunt and my cousin and came back in quite a good mood because I saw them.</span> <span id="s487">They were safe.</span> <span id="s488">They were alive.</span> <span id="s489">I gave them, each one of them, regards so I was kind of a contact.</span> <span id="s490">They were not seeing each other.</span> <span id="s491">So the mood was elated and I came back to Zoliborz, to the restaurant and I told Pepi all about it.</span> <span id="s492">Of course, we had to communicate very discreetly because the owners of the restaurant couldn't find out that we know each other from before or who we are.</span> <span id="s493">So the -- that day was good.</span> <span id="s494">When the shots started, I didn't know what it was all about but this Stefan who arranged for my aunt to stay with his sister, he came in that day to the restaurant, and he said that there is a revolt going and he's in it and he won't see me for a while.</span> <span id="s495">I never saw him since.</span> <span id="s496">Never again.</span> <span id="s497">And the first day was, was pretty good for me.</span> <span id="s498">But then of course the shooting started.</span> <span id="s499">I have to explain that when you are with other people and they are shooting buildings with the Krajowa from across the river, you're scared, but you feel that you're in the same co-- position with all other people and that there is a war going on.</span> <span id="s500">One never suggests that that when there is a political war that somebody wants to hurt civilians.</span> <span id="s501">But, sure, civilians do get hurt, so it was not bad -- especially when we heard after a while that the Russians are in Praga, across the river, and we thought any minute they'll come in.</span> <span id="s502">Somebody will come in to stop the shooting.</span> <span id="s503">Somebody would free so that we don't have the shooting and, and nobody dies.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">02:17:40 Well, it didn't happen that way because the Russians stopped there.</span> <span id="s505">They didn't cross the river.</span> <span id="s506">The, the revolt took two months and then we were all captured and led through the city of Warsaw to the train that took us to Pruszkow, and at the time the city of Warsaw was very, very bad.</span> <span id="s507">We could smell the smoldering the, the, the fires but they were almost burned out.</span> <span id="s508">Mainly, we saw skeletons of homes, of houses.</span> <span id="s509">We walked in the middle of the road because there was a lot of debris and we were walked to the train and at that time from Warsaw to Pruszkow.</span> <span id="s510">We went in cattle trains, but locked not closed.</span> <span id="s511">They were halfway open.</span> <span id="s512">Nobody thought of jumping or, or running away.</span> <span id="s513">Pepi and I, we looked at each other: “Are we going or are we not?”</span> <span id="s514">I -- she said, “Let's wait a while and see what happens.”</span> <span id="s515">Little did I know that she had, she had poison that she carried with her and she kept it for the last minute, if necessary.</span> <span id="s516">I found that out when we got to Ravensbruek and we stayed in line to go into the bath house and she asked me while we were staying in line if, if I think that, is it time or not yet?</span> <span id="s517">And I said, “Oh, let's wait and see,” and by the time we got in and we were ordered to strip and give everything away, she didn't have it anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">02:20:00</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Could you tell me about the arrival in Ravensbruek, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: And could you repeat the word “Ravensbruek” so it’s on the tape?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Yeah, well, in Pruszkow we were put on trains, and these were cattle trains, all closed, locked with tiny little window and we were taken -- I don't know if it was 10 days, two weeks, 12 days -- it was day after day after day and night after night.</span> <span id="s523">We were taken and we stopped on the railroad, on side roads.</span> <span id="s524">Many times there was an air attack and the train had to stop.</span> <span id="s525">We had reached one camp near, near Berlin.</span> <span id="s526">I forgot the name of the camp.</span> <span id="s527">that rumors were we were going to stay there and then we didn't stay there and again with the train until we reached Ravensbruek, yeah.</span> <span id="s528">Of course, the conditions were terrible, you know.</span> <span id="s529">Hardly anything, but we made it, and in Ravensbruek we stayed in line.</span> <span id="s530">We were political prisoners.</span> <span id="s531">We were not Jews.</span> <span id="s532">We were political prisoners and we were standing in line registering our names and given out numbers.</span> <span id="s533">We were asked age and, of course, they looked us over and I said that I was 18.</span> <span id="s534">I was lying about my name so I was also lying about my age.</span> <span id="s535">I wanted to be with Pepi.</span> <span id="s536">Pepi I think was in her 30s.</span> <span id="s537">So I got a number and there was a red triangle made of cloth with the letter “P” on it for political prisoner.</span> <span id="s538">The red was for political prisoner and on a white cloth was my number, 74073.</span> <span id="s539">And she was 704 -- 4074.</span> <span id="s540">I don't remember whether it was, she was first or I was first.</span> <span id="s541">I think I was first, and we got consecutive numbers and from then on we had no names, just numbers, and then we went to the bath house.</span> <span id="s542">We -- as I said they took away our clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">02:23:05 We had to strip.</span> <span id="s544">Everybody was shaved.</span> <span id="s545">I don't know by what miracle Pepi and I were not shaved.</span> <span id="s546">Until today I have no answer.</span> <span id="s547">Somebody told me that the majority of people had lice.</span> <span id="s548">I don't believe it because this is not why you were shaved but they did not shave her.</span> <span id="s549">They did not shave me.</span> <span id="s550">They left my long hair and when we went to the baths, we really expected to die.</span> <span id="s551">We really did, and we said, “Well, we could have taken the poison but it's gone and it probably won't take longer with being gassed.”</span> <span id="s552">Well, we were very surprised when water came.</span> <span id="s553">And we, we really got a shower.</span> <span id="s554">There was even this gray soap that looked like pumice stone but a little softer.</span> <span id="s555">But it was not gas, so we took the showers and we went out on the other end of the building and we were given the striped uniforms and then I understood why we wanted to take the poison before we went in because each group that went in ahead of us, we never saw them coming out.</span> <span id="s556">We didn't recognize them.</span> <span id="s557">They were shaved and wearing stripes.</span> <span id="s558">So then when we got stripes and were getting sizes that are impossible, a big person would get a tiny dress, a tiny, tiny person would get a big dress, but we came out alive and we had our numbers and a triangle and we were assigned to barracks.</span> <span id="s559">When we came into the barracks, we saw on the wall Jewish writing, names, messages, many of it in Yiddish which I couldn't read, but Pepi could and she told me they were names.</span> <span id="s560">She read them to me and I, I could understand.</span> <span id="s561">I just couldn't read or write, and she told me there were messages, very, very heartbreaking messages and names of the people: “We…we were here.</span> <span id="s562">We’re the last.</span> <span id="s563">Tell others to remember us.”</span> <span id="s564">It, it was very sad, but we were ushered to those barracks and we were not killed.</span> <span id="s565">We, we had these straw mattresses, three in a row high and we stayed there until they sent us to another camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">02:26:15</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Ravens- how long were you in Ravensbruek?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Well, I have to figure it out.</span> <span id="s569">We went to Ravensbruek at the last day of the Polish revolt which was October, November, and in Ravensbruek we must have been, December, December, January, and then we were, we were sent to a camp in a forest Wildbou near Brandenburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Let's stay in, in Ravensbruek.</span> <span id="s571">You were there for more than a few days, which is the only thing --</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Yes, but a short time and then I was staying longer in the other camp, in the in the forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: Can you tell me a little more about what Ravensbruek was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: Ravensbruek was a very huge camp and there were inmates from many, many nations.</span> <span id="s575">In the short stay I could notice truck-fulls of bodies -- how skinny, just bones and skin, bodies, dead bodies.</span> <span id="s576">They had, they had a place where they hung people.</span> <span id="s577">I did not witness any, any hangings but they, they had a place and I could see the trucks going back and forth with bodies here and bodies there.</span> <span id="s578">We did not do much over there.</span> <span id="s579">We were then transported to another camp.</span> <span id="s580">And that was in a forest and it was a smaller camp, and we were building this railroad tracks for, for a narrow or a short distance train.</span> <span id="s581">It was very cold.</span> <span id="s582">We were marched every morning, after what we call Apell time.</span> <span id="s583">We were marched to work.</span> <span id="s584">Were putting the, the railroad tracks and the ties and while we were doing that, while we were marching, we were guarded by SS people, men and women with dogs and when we got there they would, we would make a fire so they could stay and keep warm while we were working and worked.</span> <span id="s585">Towards the evenings, we were coming back and we would get watery soup, or water, whatever.</span> <span id="s586">In that camp was really bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">02:29:30 The, the, the SS men and the SS women, they were beating everybody they could see and the, the terrain was wet.</span> <span id="s588">They would put people face down and, and just stomp on them and beat them.</span> <span id="s589">I saw once thing like that.</span> <span id="s590">After this railroad thing, one day I was transferred to another barr- to a barrack where they had a factory and they told me they are parts for airplanes, but all I saw was little screws or little small items that you had to punch holes in and they told us how to do it, so I immediately asked if my mother could come, too.</span> <span id="s591">It was really not safe to do that, but I did and they said, “Yes,” so Pepi and I were brought, worked in that factory and she was working there testing.</span> <span id="s592">You have to test if they are good or bad, and most of them were bad, really, but we had to, we had to produce something because the foreman tried to be nice to, to us, not to beat us or anything, and we all tried to back him up and he had some quota to fulfill.</span> <span id="s593">If there is so and so much bad output, then he would be punished, so I remember Pepi was telling me that she was checking and she was saying, “Make good ones, make bad ones, whatever.”</span> <span id="s594">And we worked there 12 hours a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: You said you had convinced the guards to let you bring your mother.</span> <span id="s596">You were pretending --</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Not the guards, the, the, the managers of it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: You pretended that Pepi was your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">02:32:00</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s601">It so happened that during all this time that I met Pepi, she tried to protect me and I tried to protect her.</span> <span id="s602">She lost her own child and apparently she felt she wanted to help.</span> <span id="s603">She, she was an outstanding person.</span> <span id="s604">To describe her, I probably couldn't.</span> <span id="s605">That's how good she was, and for everybody to everybody -- to humanity.</span> <span id="s606">On my side, she, she had dark hair, brown eyes, and she looked Jewish.</span> <span id="s607">I don't know what it means to look Jewish but that's what the stereotype is, look Jewish.</span> <span id="s608">On the other hand, I didn't very much.</span> <span id="s609">And I felt that in this respect if I say she's my mother, she will gain from it.</span> <span id="s610">I could have made a mistake.</span> <span id="s611">I don't know.</span> <span id="s612">I think this was behind my thinking and it worked somehow.</span> <span id="s613">So we were there, and, and being together with somebody you care for was excellent.</span> <span id="s614">At the evening, Pepi would teach me history, math, and she would talk to me about her husband, who might be alive.</span> <span id="s615">By the way, she found him after the war.</span> <span id="s616">He survived, yes.</span> <span id="s617">And Pepi was teaching me a lot.</span> <span id="s618">We, we didn't have a piece of paper or a pencil, but she would teach me a French song or geography, explaining things.</span> <span id="s619">It helped a lot.</span> <span id="s620">It helped a lot.</span> <span id="s621">I, I felt real good, and when you when you feel good, you're with somebody, you care for somebody, it makes you feel good; and Pepi cared for everybody, Pepi cared for everybody.</span> <span id="s622">One day I saw Pepi doesn't eat her portion of bread and I said, “What you -- ?”</span> <span id="s623">She says, “I was hungry.</span> <span id="s624">I ate already.”</span> <span id="s625">No she didn't.</span> <span id="s626">There was a Pani Arova who was very, very sick.</span> <span id="s627">A wife of a Polish major who we knew from Zoliborz, where we worked in the restaurant.</span> <span id="s628">I think she lived in the same apart- building.</span> <span id="s629">Pepi found her and since she was elderly, Pepi gave her her portion of bread, but she wouldn't tell me about it, and sure enough when I found out I said, “Then we'll share mine,” and she said “No, you're a young child.</span> <span id="s630">You have to survive.”</span> <span id="s631">I mean, I had problems with, with this that she would give away everything to everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">02:35:35 She was just fantastic.</span> <span id="s633">What a human being.</span> <span id="s634">I'm not the only one who, who gained by her being around, who gained so much of everything, of understanding, of love, of helping others.</span> <span id="s635">She was just fantastic.</span> <span id="s636">So then we were in the camp and we heard some rumors that the war is coming closer.</span> <span id="s637">But we didn't know anything.</span> <span id="s638">This foreman apparently he also felt that Pepi was a nice and a good person, a worthwhile.</span> <span id="s639">He somehow let her know that things are going better for us.</span> <span id="s640">In other words, things are not going so good for the Germans, and at one time he gave her a piece of paper and a pencil so that she could teach me something.</span> <span id="s641">She wanted to teach me something to write and, and he, he did that, but we had to give it back right away, so we knew that something is, is happening, but we didn't know what.</span> <span id="s642">And, and the hope was really making us imagine better things, so one day -- it must have been again in March or April, in March, I think, March of '45 -- they put us in trains and they sent us to so-called “Free work.”</span> <span id="s643">Each one was assigned to some deserving German family or on a farm to work and this, Pepi and I we were assigned to two villages not far from each other in the northern part of Germany near Rostock.</span> <span id="s644">I was in Külingsborn, and she was in Bornhagen.</span> <span id="s645">And we were there until May, I think, 5.</span> <span id="s646">We were liberated by the Russians, who didn't believe that we did not cooperate with the Germans.</span> <span id="s647">It, it was hard for them to understand because we were working here on, for a family or for a farmer so they, they just didn't believe that about a month or six weeks ago we were taken out of, of concentration camps and, and put there for whatever reason, I don't know.</span> <span id="s648">And that's where we, we were liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">02:38:45</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: What did you do?</span> <span id="s651">What happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Well, Pepi made out.</span> <span id="s653">Pepi made out little, called a little -- a travel document, in Russian, and she put some stamps, different colors rubber stamps that mean nothing in German or whatever, whatever she could find in the farmer's, in the farmer's place and the, the Russian that occupied the farm that she was, they stayed there.</span> <span id="s654">They made it a headquarters, and in a couple of days I came running to her because where I was, was terrible, so I stayed with her and she made out those papers and she told the Russians that we want to go back home.</span> <span id="s655">One of them, quite an intelligent fellow, he says, “Well, why don't you go to Russia.</span> <span id="s656">Your daughter will go to school and, and you'll be fine and I'll write to my commandant to, to arrange for you.”</span> <span id="s657">So Pepi asked me, “Do you want to go to Russia?”</span> <span id="s658">I said, “No.</span> <span id="s659">I, I want to go home and see if I can find somebody alive.”</span> <span id="s660">So she, she said, “We'll have to think about it, want to see who is alive.”</span> <span id="s661">And they said “Oh, you can find out from there, too.</span> <span id="s662">Just go to Russia.”</span> <span id="s663">Anyway, Pepi got some kind of a carriage that took us, horse and buggy, that took us out and with those papers that she prepared, we got ourselves to Berlin.</span> <span id="s664">And when we got to Berlin there was a a Jewish office on Rikostrasse (ph), a Jewish office where there were DPs, and we went there to register to, to say that, “We're alive, we're here, and what next?”</span> <span id="s665">And the funniest thing happened: when I when I was interviewed by the interviewer on Rikostrasse in Berlin, he didn't want to believe that that I was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">02:41:20 I had problems convincing him, but I could prove it.</span> <span id="s667">I could prove it with the names and, and what little I knew.</span> <span id="s668">It was, the names of my family and, and we had a conversa- a lengthy conversation ‘til, ‘til he believed me.</span> <span id="s669">And we stayed in Berlin for a while.</span> <span id="s670">That was another chapter that was very heartbreaking, however, nobody was getting killed and that was the good part.</span> <span id="s671">And the Allies brought some food and some clothing and people were looking for each other.</span> <span id="s672">It was just like drunk with freedom.</span> <span id="s673">Everybody was drunk with freedom but looking, “Who…who is alive?</span> <span id="s674">What do we do?”</span> <span id="s675">But this was the good part of it.</span> <span id="s676">The bad part of it is that I didn't find anybody when I tried to go back.</span> <span id="s677">Tried to go back and, and didn't find anybody.</span> <span id="s678">That was bad.</span> <span id="s679">Later on I found my father's brother in England with his family.</span> <span id="s680">I found my youngest uncle in Israel who went there before the war as a khalutz, and then I found that my Aunt Esther and her husband who was in Russia survived, and then they found little Jacek, and they came to Israel as a family.</span> <span id="s681">And that was something out of this world.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: So when you -- can we come back to you now?</span> <span id="s683">What did you do?</span> <span id="s684">Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">02:43:45</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: I, I was in Berlin, as I said, with Pepi, and we met there.</span> <span id="s687">Actually Pepi, she saw all kinds of people from, from the Jewish community and they were also American Jews, English Jews, French and Russian -- in all the armies.</span> <span id="s688">That was before Berlin was, was divided by a wall; it was all open.</span> <span id="s689">And Pepi, as usual, decided to, to help out others, so she had me do things to help out others and people who came let's say from Russia or from a camp, needed to stay over or go somewhere or get some clothes, being sent being sent wherever they wanted to.</span> <span id="s690">So the majority wanted to go to, to the west.</span> <span id="s691">Pepi was there to help.</span> <span id="s692">Oh, yeah, Pepi was there to help, and being with her you couldn't help but help others.</span> <span id="s693">It was great to be able to do something that you wanted to do, to be able to say, “Yes, you can go.</span> <span id="s694">You're free.</span> <span id="s695">Where do you want to go?</span> <span id="s696">You can go.</span> <span id="s697">You're hungry, here’s food,” you know?</span> <span id="s698">There was a Jewish holiday where they had in Berlin.</span> <span id="s699">I'll never forget that.</span> <span id="s700">Pepi invited all the Jewish people from all the armies.</span> <span id="s701">She says, “I don't care if they are the French Army, the Russian Army, the American -- it's a Jewish holiday.”</span></p> <p><span id="s702">02:45:25 They all came together and what a meal.</span> <span id="s703">I think each one brought something with them because we didn't have much and we had candles and they prayed, and it was a holiday.</span> <span id="s704">I mean, that was after all the, the things that we went through, there was a real Jewish holiday which was celebrated.</span> <span id="s705">I couldn't communicate with most of them.</span> <span id="s706">Learned a little Russian in concentration camp, but Pepi knew languages, but it didn't matter.</span> <span id="s707">You could communicate.</span> <span id="s708">And you could help.</span> <span id="s709">And that was great.</span> <span id="s710">It was great.</span> <span id="s711">It was like ecstasy.</span> <span id="s712">It's just later on that everything comes out, when you find out that you don't have anybody anymore and it settles in.</span> <span id="s713">I find that we all carry with us, the survivors I mean, we carry with us a certain something.</span> <span id="s714">I can't put my finger on a certain part in our brain that is different from everybody else in the world who did not go through what we did.</span> <span id="s715">I think that I can recognize a survivor probably from across the street, or at least when we exchange a few words.</span> <span id="s716">There is something about us that I don't find in any other people; maybe the, the sad look in their eyes or maybe some expressions.</span> <span id="s717">I don't know what it is.</span> <span id="s718">And we all carry that and many times our children do that, too.</span> <span id="s719">they, although they didn't go through the things we did, they're a part of it.</span> <span id="s720">They suffer from not having uncles and aunts and cousins.</span> <span id="s721">They suffer because their parents are overly protective.</span> <span id="s722">They suffer from it.</span> <span id="s723">They do it.</span> <span id="s724">I get a phone call from my kids every week, whether I need it or not, because I can't live otherwise.</span> <span id="s725">This is, this is the leftover from, from knowing where they are, knowing that they are all right.</span> <span id="s726">I wish I could change, but I can't.</span> <span id="s727">They have to understand that that's what I need.</span> <span id="s728">They do understand it but it's, it's an imposition on people.</span> <span id="s729">People shouldn't have to do that.</span> <span id="s730">So, my generation and our children, they carry the burden.</span> <span id="s731">Hopefully, we won’t have that thing happen again and, and the grandchildren will not need to, to carry the burden.</span> <span id="s732">They, they can learn from history what happened so, so they can prevent it in the future, but they shouldn't need to carry a burden.</span> <span id="s733">Nobody should.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">02:48:50</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: I’d like -- indeed -- I'd like to come back to know how you got to Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Oh, well, I got to Bergen-Belsen after the war finished.</span> <span id="s737">We start off in Berlin where Pepi and I stayed and helped.</span> <span id="s738">And, of course, there were for Pepi, helped in a in a orphanage and tried, at that time there were, the British wanted to take the orphans out to the British zone.</span> <span id="s739">They started making the zones, French zone, British zone, you know, and Pepi registered me in the orphanage, and I went to the orphanage so that one day the British came with a truck and they told us to sit down in the truck and they took us out.</span> <span id="s740">What I didn't know then which I found out later was that some authority got -- found out that Pepi's helping many DPs and even some soldiers from, from a different army who did not allow their people to, to move, but they wanted to, to go.</span> <span id="s741">And she was helping and somehow they found out and they came looking for her at night and she ran away.</span> <span id="s742">She knew that she was being hunted at that time, so she sent me away.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: Ok, Let’s take -- I need to go back in the truck, you are now loaded into a truck.</span> <span id="s744">Where are you taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: Oh, we were taken first, first we were taken, I think we stopped at Hanover.</span> <span id="s746">We stopped at Hanover, and then we were taken to Bergen-Belsen, or was it the other way around?</span> <span id="s747">I can't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: Can you tell us what was Bergen-Belsen like at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">02:51:10</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: Bergen-Belsen was another orphanage, and I was just talking to -- it was Block RB-6 was the orphanage where there were some orphans and they brought us in to together so that they could care for us.</span> <span id="s751">And, of course, many people were ecstatic, they found each other but I couldn't find anybody I knew.</span> <span id="s752">I didn't know too many people before the war started and so I couldn't find many people and they cared for us very well in Bergen-Belsen, but it was all after the war.</span> <span id="s753">It, it was -- the burden was already there.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: Is this where you met Hadassah?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s756">That's where I met Hadassah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: Can you tell me what she was doing?</span> <span id="s758">Could you repeat her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Hadassah Rosensaft.</span> <span id="s760">Well, at that time, when I was in Bergen-Belsen, her name was Dr. Bimko, and there was a gentleman by the name of Yasala (ph) Rosensaft, and they were caring for the DPs, the displaced persons.</span> <span id="s761">I know that much, and I remember they got married.</span> <span id="s762">However, I did not -- I wasn't there apparently when their son was born.</span> <span id="s763">I found that out much later.</span> <span id="s764">And we kept in touch throughout the years but not very close and not very often.</span> <span id="s765">Her ways were, were different from mine although we lived also in Manhattan afterwards.</span> <span id="s766">I had two children to raise.</span> <span id="s767">I had a job and our ways are not the same but whenever there was something going on where survivors meet, she was there and I was there and somehow, even if we didn't talk or we just acknowledged, we were there.</span> <span id="s768">It's funny.</span> <span id="s769">We were there --</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s771">I'm going to have to interrupt you because of time.</span> <span id="s772">Can you tell me when you came to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">02:53:55</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: I came to the United States in November of 1955.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: Who came with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: My dear husband, Ike.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Oh, wait, wait, wait.</span> <span id="s778">Back up.</span> <span id="s779">Where did you meet Ike at?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: We have to be short here.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: Ok, well, from Bergen-Belsen a short, short trip, we’re sent to Blankenese, which is another place for the orphans.</span> <span id="s783">From Blankenese, we went to Marseilles where we boarded a ship, Champolion, that brought us to Egypt.</span> <span id="s784">Now Hadassah was on it.</span> <span id="s785">I didn't know that because my Pepi was putting in on Champoulyan.</span> <span id="s786">Pepi was adding people who didn't have any papers.</span> <span id="s787">Approximately 10 before us went up, went on board before I was allowed to board it, so many, many illegal -- but we, we got there, and it was impossible to see each other on the, on the ship.</span> <span id="s788">Many people and overloaded and all that, but we made the trip and we got there.</span> <span id="s789">And as Hadassah explained, we were divided into three groups.</span> <span id="s790">Each one went to a different kibbutz.</span> <span id="s791">We were studying.</span> <span id="s792">We were working and we were also semi-drafted, ala cub scouts, except we were trained with rifles and, and grenades and night, night exercise, combat exercise.</span> <span id="s793">then of course we had the War of Independence.</span> <span id="s794">After the War of Independence, I went to England to see my uncle, my father's brother, and he wanted to adopt me but I wanted to go back to Israel.</span> <span id="s795">And when I came back from Israel, I met Ike whom I married two years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: Then you came to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: We came to the United States with Ike and with a little 18-month old son, and Ike's parents were here in New York.</span> <span id="s798">We lived with them and then with another little boy born in New York City in Mt. Sinai Hospital, right.</span> <span id="s799">And that's the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Quite a story.</span> <span id="s801">Doris, can you tell me what you think the effect of the Holocaust has been on you, of going through all that?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">02:57:15</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: Never thought about it, what the effect is on me.</span> <span id="s804">My children and my husband, they tell me that I'm a strong lady and I think that if it is true, then this would be one result.</span> <span id="s805">The effect is that I am probably overly sensitive to people's opinions, to people's behavior, and I'm constantly on the watch about safety, about wars, about slanderous talking.</span> <span id="s806">I'm more sensitive to that, I think, as a result.</span> <span id="s807">I also find that telling your story and telling what you feel towards people, which is mainly good stuff, love, people are good if they know it but if they are fed different information and they don't know any better, they can't behave any better.</span> <span id="s808">I, I feel that that I can, that I can explain or like people more than I could before the war.</span> <span id="s809">I'm closer to, to everybody, to the whole world because of it.</span> <span id="s810">I'm also watchful.</span> <span id="s811">I think all this is, is the result from, from what I went through my life.</span> <span id="s812">We're all, we're all products of our past, and I think that's what the past did to me.</span> <span id="s813">Good, bad, indifferent, I don't know.</span> <span id="s814">That’s just me.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: I thank you, Doris.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: I wish I didn’t have to –</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Yes, ok, that’s it.</span> <span id="s818">We’ve got a couple of pictures.</span> <span id="s819">Doris, thank you very, very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">02:59:20</span></p> <p><span id="s821">[Discussion of Photographs]</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Conclusion of Interview The interviewee notes that this name is spelled “Fox” by her relatives living in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Mrs. (Polish).</span></p> <p><span id="s824">The deportation area that separated the ghetto from surrounding Poland (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Ethnic Germans (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s826">The interviewee later noted that the man’s name was Kutner.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Cigarette case (Polish).</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Rosary (Polish).</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Armia Krajowa [Home Army] (Polish).</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Roll call (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Pioneer (Hebrew).</span></p> <p><span id="s832">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0086 PAGE 24</span></p> <p><span id="s833">PAGE 1</span></p></body></html>
