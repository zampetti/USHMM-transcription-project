took him, and then my mother got a letter or message that he was killed.</span> <span id="s89">So I don't remember very good his face.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s91">Do you have any early early memories from being a little girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: My mother was very protective me.</span> <span id="s93">She didn't let me go by myself, be by myself -- or whatever.</span> <span id="s94">I don't remember I went to a nursery or kindergarten, because the war started.</span> <span id="s95">And my mother took me and my little brother -- he was younger maybe -- a year and a half from me.</span> <span id="s96">And then we went to her mother.</span> <span id="s97">She lived also in Kamenets-Podolsk there.</span> <span id="s98">And we went there to be together, because she didn't want to be by herself, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Did you remember going there?</span> <span id="s100">Do you have a memory of going to your grandmother's house?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: I know she rushed us to come and we went there.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Do you have a memory of your grandmother?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: I

<span id="s106">And then the older sister -- my mother had two sisters -- and the older sisters, she was also two girls, and I and my brother.</span> <span id="s107">And the youngest sister, she wasn't married yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s109">But you remember this -- you remember being there in that house?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Yeah, I remember and the names my mother used to tell me about them, you know?</span> <span id="s111">My grandmother from my mother, her name was Soshe.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Sosha.</span> <span

Reider.</span> <span id="s117">How long did you stay in your grandmother's house?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: I don't know time, but it wasn't seem very long because then we left.</span> <span id="s119">I don't know where my mother used to tell me always that, when she took us both and run out, there was bombs.</span> <span id="s120">They started to throw bombs, the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: And she run fast.</span> <span id="s123">And there were some bombs that didn't exploded.</span> <span id="s124">And there were some places that they were bombing, they exploded, and people were killed.</span> <span id="s125">It was a terrible thing.</span> <span id="s126">My mother was wounded from a piece of -- I think steel or something that flew but -- and she went to grab a piece of white linen, put on the hand.</span> <span id="s127">And some people rushed her and said, "Take it off, because you are seen by the planes -- whatever.</span> <span id="s128">Take it off."</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: So they would see it.</span> <span id="s130">They said the planes would see her hand?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s132">Somehow we run away.</span> <span id="s133">And I don't know who took us there, or whatever, but we ended up at that time in Chelyabinsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Chelyabinsk --</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Chelyabinsk -- that's Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: That's far away.</span> <span id="s137">So, from Kamenets-Podolsk, you end up in Chelyabinsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Chelyabinsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Do you remember how you got there?</span> <span id="s140">Was it by train, or was it by truck, or?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: It's -- it's like a dream.</span> <span id="s142">Very clouded.</span> <span id="s143">Very clouded.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: But I know that in Chelyabinsk, my mother worked in a factory of ammunition.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: And she looked -- she used to leave me and my brother with her younger sister when she wasn't working.</span> <span id="s148">When she was working, she was working as a telephonist operator in a station -- a telephone station.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s150">So that meant that -- that was the younger sister who wasn't married.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Wasn't married.</span> <span id="s152">Her name was Hannah.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Hannah.</span> <span id="s154">And what was your grandmother?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: My grandmother was Soshe.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: No, but where was she -- was she with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: No.</span> <span id="s158">I think she died, because she didn't run with us.</span> <span id="s159">She died.</span> <span id="s160">She was killed or something.</span> <span id="s161">And then all the aunt -- all the -- which was Feige, her name -- my mother's sister Feige.</span> <span id="s162">I always heard -- my mother used to tell me -- that she had two girls, but one girl was killed when a bomb fell in or exploded nearby or something.</span> <span id="s163">So she was left with one daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: That's you.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: No, no -- not me.</span> <span id="s166">My mother's sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Oh, your mother's sister -- excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s169">She had two daughters, but one was killed right away.</span> <span id="s170">You know, my mother used to tell me, but we were a kid and this.</span> <span id="s171">My -- I was born thinking, "Where am I going to play?"</span> <span id="s172">You know?</span> <span id="s173">But anyway, in Chelyabinsk, we were live there, how long I don't remember, but I know that was a lot of snow.</span> <span id="s174">And I don't remember that I started school.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: It's too early.</span> <span id="s177">And then from there -- I heard somebody say "it's fire, it's war."</span> <span id="s178">We wanted to Uzbekistan.</span> <span id="s179">And my mother brought in a farm.</span> <span id="s180">She was collecting tomatoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Harvesting tomatoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s183">But I remember it was a frightening experience, because you know at that time was already -- right before this my brother got sick before we went to Uzbekistan.</span> <span id="s184">He got sick -- I don't remember she had a chance to take him to the hospital, no?</span> <span id="s185">Maybe she took him to the hospital, but he stayed there for a very short time.</span> <span id="s186">He died.</span> <span id="s187">After he died, I got rheumatic fever.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: You got rheumatic fever?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s190">They took me to the hospital.</span> <span id="s191">When I was the last one, they put me in.</span> <span id="s192">It secluded -- seclusion, because it was very contagious, and they didn't give us antibiotic.</span> <span id="s193">They didn't have at that time.</span> <span id="s194">So they put me on the second, third floor where they were.</span> <span id="s195">They didn't let in my mother to go in.</span> <span id="s196">And I was standing on the steps to talking down from the window and talking sign language with my mother.</span> <span id="s197">One thing I remember something was my mother -- the nurses came in and gave me a plate with a beautiful tangerines -- mandarinos or something -- which in Russia, it was very unusual -- the war, winter especially -- they said, "That's from your mother -- you eat it."</span> <span id="s198">So this I remember was long time, over 40 days that I stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Fourteen?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Forty -- four, zero.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: So over a month.</span> <span id="s202">Over a month you were in this hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s204">Yeah.</span> <span id="s205">She used to say to me that she's so sorry she couldn't see me, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: That they don't let her in.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: They don't let her in -- yeah.</span> <span id="s208">This was in Siberia in the Chelyabinsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: What language did you speak with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: You spoke Yiddish with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s213">And then, after my brother died, we decided to go to Uzbekistan.</span> <span id="s214">We went to Uzbekistan.</span> <span id="s215">She was working for an Uzbek.</span> <span id="s216">His whole head was bald, but the only thing that I remember is a beautiful braid -- a long, long braid.</span> <span id="s217">And he had a very big mustache, but the head was bald.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: So a bald head with a braid.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Yeah -- one braid -- a long braid from the center.</span> <span id="s220">And he had a mustache, you know?</span> <span id="s221">He had -- so she was working in the field, and I was running around.</span> <span id="s222">And [laughing] it was -- I did a mischief.</span> <span id="s223">I came over.</span> <span id="s224">I grabbed a beautiful tomato, and I bite the end.</span> <span id="s225">And that guy, Uzbek, came with a piece of wood, and he warned me, if I do it again, he will beat me up.</span> <span id="s226">He scared me.</span> <span id="s227">This face -- his face I remember.</span> <span id="s228">That I remember.</span> <span id="s229">So we stay about -- and then we went back to Chelyabinsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Oh, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Yeah, we were in Chelyabinsk.</span> <span id="s232">And my -- at that time, it was war, but somehow, which was now my stepfather, they came from Polish Ukraine, from Sdolbuno, Rovno.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: From Rovno.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: I don't know they -- they get -- they passed the borders.</span> <span id="s235">I don't know how they did it.</span> <span id="s236">He and his brother.</span> <span id="s237">His name was Moishe.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Your stepfather's name.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Yeah -- yeah.</span> <span id="s240">And I think it was two years after my mother knew that my father's dead, whatever.</span> <span id="s241">So he met my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: In Chelyabinsk?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: In Chelyabinsk.</span> <span id="s244">And my -- he came with a brother.</span> <span id="s245">His name was Israel.</span> <span id="s246">Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s249">His name was Moishe.</span> <span id="s250">And he met my mother.</span> <span id="s251">My mother's sister -- the youngest sister -- yeah.</span> <span id="s252">And then my mother got married.</span> <span id="s253">One day -- where I don't know, but I remember she got married two years after my father died.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: And my aunts, that she was the youngest -- yes -- she married for his brother, Israel -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: So Moishe married your mother, --</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: -- and Israel married your aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Hannah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: What was your stepfather's last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Lumdan [?]</span> <span id="s262">.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Lumdan.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s265">He was from a little town in Polish -- in Ukraine, Poland -- Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: And they were family of -- Lumdan in Hebrew is 'learner'.</span> <span id="s268">And they were from a family of learners and rabbis, and -- very, you know, in the Jewish religion very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: So they were religious people.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s271">Lumdan is the name.</span> <span id="s272">And he married her.</span> <span id="s273">I became, instead of Sonya Grechko, I became Sonya Lumdan.</span> <span id="s274">And we continued to live in the same barrack -- we lived in barracks.</span> <span id="s275">Every people, they shared barracks with -- you know what's a barrack; it's a little hou -- a little building built from wood.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: It's like when you see in the pictures or something -- like, if you see little buildings that -- little -- like, you build for children in the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Like a little shed.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Shed -- there was a shed.</span> <span id="s282">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: And why was it that you lived in such places?</span> <span id="s284">In such a place?</span> <span id="s285">Was there no other room anywhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: No -- there was no room.</span> <span id="s287">We were lucky that we had room.</span> <span id="s288">And my mother back to the board, and my aunt Hannah, she also got back there.</span> <span id="s289">I think we lived in the same barrack, you know?</span> <span id="s290">Part of the barrack was ours.</span> <span id="s291">Part was half.</span> <span id="s292">Every few families in the barrack was divided.</span> <span id="s293">And we lived there.</span> <span id="s294">The most that I remember was the snow was so high.</span> <span id="s295">A lot of snow.</span> <span id="s296">My mother used to walk me -- snow come up to here.</span> <span id="s297">It's very very cold and very snow there.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Was there enough to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: I know that my mother used to bring some, but it was not regular food.</span> <span id="s300">You know, she -- they gave her for work, you know?</span> <span id="s301">So she brought for me, because my brother died earlier.</span> <span id="s302">And he survived me.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: How long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: I know in 1945 they say that the Polish citizens are allowed to leave Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: So it was until '45 that you were in Chelyabinsk?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s307">So my stepfather was allowed to leave, and he took me and my mother, and we left.</span> <span id="s308">And also his brother took my mother's sister, and she left children there.</span> <span id="s309">Yeah.</span> <span id="s310">But I forgot to tell this -- my mother had a younger brother.</span> <span id="s311">And I think he was -- he was sent to the army when he was 17.</span> <span id="s312">And then my mother, when I was Chelyabinsk, that he survived, but he's wounded.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: And they told her -- my aunt -- that he's in one of the hospitals.</span> <span id="s315">So they went and walked from hospital to hospital, and they found him.</span> <span id="s316">He lost his right hand.</span> <span id="s317">They let him go.</span> <span id="s318">It was still war, but they let him go.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: And then he came.</span> <span id="s321">He stayed with us for a while.</span> <span id="s322">And then, when he was still in Chelyabinsk.</span> <span id="s323">Then he -- he met a Polish woman.</span> <span id="s324">She was a widow, but she had a boy.</span> <span id="s325">She had a boy -- she had a boy two years younger than I was -- I was two or three years older.</span> <span id="s326">And he got married with her.</span> <span id="s327">So that's the family that I knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: And so they -- you all left to go back to Poland; is that it?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: So yes, my father -- my stepfather was a Polish citizen, and the wife of my uncle, Mishal, was also Polish citizen.</span> <span id="s330">And then that's the way we could leave Russia.</span> <span id="s331">So we left Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: By train?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: I think it was train.</span> <span id="s334">And we went to Bratslav in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: And this is after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: After the war.</span> <span id="s337">And they let out the Russian -- the army let.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Do you remember anything about that trip, or about what Bratslav looked like?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: It was buildings there.</span> <span id="s340">And they were -- some of they were injured.</span> <span id="s341">They were, I think, bombs or something -- I don't know it was what.</span> <span id="s342">Anyway, we settled there for awhile.</span> <span id="s343">So my uncle Mishal (indecipherable).</span> <span id="s344">And then -- and he had a boy from his wife, you know?</span> <span id="s345">Settled there.</span> <span id="s346">And we stayed there for a while.</span> <span id="s347">And we had to decide what we're going to do.</span> <span id="s348">So we were really seeking to go to Palestine, because nobody wanted to stay --</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: -- in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: -- in Poland, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: So your stepfather went back to Rovno.</span> <span id="s352">Did he ever go back there to see what it was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: No.</span> <span id="s354">He didn't go back.</span> <span id="s355">He went to Bratslav.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Okay -- Bratslav.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s358">And they said that there are camps for people -- what they called the DP camps --</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: DP camps --</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: -- in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: And what are DP camps mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: People that were -- what's it called?</span> <span id="s363">Dispensed from their houses, from their place, from their -- from the (indecipherable) born or whatever.</span> <span id="s364">And they went there, because they heard that from there, it's easier to go to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: So you were in such a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: So we left Poland, and we went to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: And we were ended up in Pocking, which I was told is -- the biggest camp was there.</span> <span id="s369">The biggest camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Can you tell me the name again?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: Pocking.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Pocking?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s374">Pocking.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: P-O-C-K-I-N-G.</span> <span id="s377">It's a big camp -- was a big camp.</span> <span id="s378">So I and my stepfather and my mother, they lived there.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: And we also -- also they -- my aunt Hannah, she left later than we left.</span> <span id="s381">We left first.</span> <span id="s382">The Pocking.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: So you were at that point seven years old or eight years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Did you ever go to school when you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Yeah, in Pocking I started to go.</span> <span id="s387">They established -- it was a camp -- established some Hebrew schools.</span> <span id="s388">And my stepfather, he was a learned -- he knew Hebrew.</span> <span id="s389">He knew -- he was teaching Hebrew, when he was even in Poland before he came to Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: Was a learned man.</span> <span id="s392">And he tried to teach me Hebrew.</span> <span id="s393">I know he want to teach me Hebrew, so I'll understand and learn Hebrew.</span> <span id="s394">So yeah, they sent me.</span> <span id="s395">I remember I learned something from there.</span> <span id="s396">And then -- yeah, and my uncle that was wounded in the right hand, --</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: -- he also joined when he came to Poland.</span> <span id="s399">So we decided to go to Germany, and we stayed in Pocking.</span> <span id="s400">But my aunt, Hannah -- she stayed.</span> <span id="s401">She was left in Poland for a while.</span> <span id="s402">I don't know what was the reason.</span> <span id="s403">I think her husband started the war there or something.</span> <span id="s404">So she said, "You go.</span> <span id="s405">I will join you later."</span> <span id="s406">So we were in Pocking.</span> <span id="s407">And I know their desire was, because every Friday they used to get together and were singing and dancing.</span> <span id="s408">So my mother and father heard that there is a group that came from Palestine.</span> <span id="s409">And they are trying to arrange a group of people that they want to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s410">So we -- we joined the group.</span> <span id="s411">We signed up.</span> <span id="s412">Not everybody was accepted.</span> <span id="s413">But they were making a big, big group of people to form the ship to show the world against whom are the British fighting?</span> <span id="s414">Because the British didn't let the Jewish people to come to Palestine.</span> <span id="s415">And they were supporting the Arabs.</span> <span id="s416">They tried to prevent the Jewish people to come, but they didn't want to let them take over the land.</span> <span id="s417">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: And where -- if you were in a DP camp in Germany, how do you get to a boat?</span> <span id="s419">How did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: I don't know who took us -- the train or something -- but I heard, they say that in Marseille is going to get together the people that they decided to go to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: And we applied.</span> <span id="s423">And at that time my mother was pregnant.</span> <span id="s424">So we applied.</span> <span id="s425">And they accepted us.</span> <span id="s426">And then my uncle, he was wounded.</span> <span id="s427">He applied also.</span> <span id="s428">He was accepted.</span> <span id="s429">So we decided we went to Marseille.</span> <span id="s430">How we went, I really don't remember.</span> <span id="s431">But I know I think that -- my mother told me that we were lucky that we were accepted.</span> <span id="s432">So he went to Marseille.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Do you have any memories of what Marseille looked like?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: I think we came at night that time and they told us that we had to -- at night in the evening we had to one day go to the boat and -- what I remember is the boat was staying not far from the beach in Marseille.</span> <span id="s435">And they made like -- like, like a rub.</span> <span id="s436">How to say?</span> <span id="s437">We put holes.</span> <span id="s438">It was a wooden --</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: A plank?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: A plank with a rope?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: And they say that everybody has to walk on this in order to get to the ship.</span> <span id="s445">It was a big ship there I saw, but we have to walk.</span> <span id="s446">And my cousin -- my uncle that she married -- and the woman, she had a boy.</span> <span id="s447">So he walked -- I mean, my mother walked.</span> <span id="s448">My father walked.</span> <span id="s449">My uncle walked.</span> <span id="s450">And we walked the first, I think.</span> <span id="s451">And the boy, his name is also Moishe.</span> <span id="s452">He walked before me.</span> <span id="s453">And he showed that he was courageous, because I was afraid to walk on there.</span> <span id="s454">And he walked.</span> <span id="s455">And I was look -- he told me not to look down to the ocean, not to look to the sides.</span> <span id="s456">Just to look at the person -- follow my eyes the person that walking.</span> <span id="s457">So I was looking at my cousin.</span> <span id="s458">He was walk straight.</span> <span id="s459">And so, he showed himself, you know, courageous.</span> <span id="s460">So I -- walked after him.</span> <span id="s461">It looked like -- it passed like a whole month -- you know, because it was very scary.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: When you're little and there's water on both sides.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Not to look down, just to look sides.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: And so, you got on the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s466">But I forgot to tell that my sister -- step-sister -- was born in Bratslav.</span> <span id="s467">And she was little that time I think -- two years or something.</span> <span id="s468">So he was walking, and he had a bag, you know?</span> <span id="s469">Bag with stripes.</span> <span id="s470">And this was tied potty for a child, you know?</span> <span id="s471">[laughing] It's my cousin -- his name is Moishe.</span> <span id="s472">He used to call "Moishe with the little potty."</span> <span id="s473">That's the name that was till he was the adult.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s475">Oh, he must have hated that name.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: The funny thing is I was watching him walking with this.</span> <span id="s477">I used to laugh to myself.</span> <span id="s478">That is my memory of this.</span> <span id="s479">And I walked.</span> <span id="s480">I finally got to the ship.</span> <span id="s481">The ship was so big and crowded -- very crowded.</span> <span id="s482">And they put like shelves -- shelves, this, no more place.</span> <span id="s483">Everybody said, "Go in the shelf and lay down."</span> <span id="s484">You know there was room.</span> <span id="s485">Many people, they have to squeeze in.</span> <span id="s486">But my mother had belly so big, she couldn't go in.</span> <span id="s487">She didn't have room to slide in.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: So they let us sit on the floor near where you have to step off to the shelves.</span> <span id="s490">So I went -- entered the ship and we went there.</span> <span id="s491">Whoever was lucky could have slide in -- could have laid down -- but we were sitting there.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: And they started to give out chocolate mint for the children, big pots.</span> <span id="s494">And every time that they went near us thus far -- I mean, not every time, but it happened many times that they slide or something and all chocolate fell --</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Spills.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Funny things that I remember.</span> <span id="s497">I think I don't want to remember the bad things what happens.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s499">What was the name of the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: The ship was Exodus.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: So it was the Exodus ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: I didn't know that it was such an important name, but anyway, we were on the ship I remember.</span> <span id="s505">They accepted special families that there were pregnant women.</span> <span id="s506">A lot of pregnant women.</span> <span id="s507">A lot of orphans, they survived the war, and they were -- their parents and everybody was killed.</span> <span id="s508">So there was a woman, she gave birth on the ship, but something got wrong.</span> <span id="s509">I don't know exactly what happened, but what I remember is a big piece of wood, and they put it near the edges of the ship.</span> <span id="s510">And she was laying on this.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: She died?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: She died.</span> <span id="s513">And they slide her down.</span> <span id="s514">And I said, "Oh my God -- my mother is also pregnant."</span> <span id="s515">Since then, I had a horrible feeling that my mother is going to die also, and they will slide her down.</span> <span id="s516">Thank God when the ship arrived -- but then they didn't let us in.</span> <span id="s517">The British -- the British.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: They didn't?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: The British surrounded the ship the minute she left the port of Marseille, and they followed her.</span> <span id="s520">And that was the biggest ship that was supposed to (indecipherable), you know?</span> <span id="s521">But they attacked the ship and corner of the ship was broken down, but they got the ship inside.</span> <span id="s522">It was a big strong ship.</span> <span id="s523">And it was almost four and a half thousand people -- something like this.</span> <span id="s524">But anyway.</span> <span id="s525">The ship did not drown.</span> <span id="s526">The ship didn't drown.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: It didn't sink.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: Didn't sink.</span> <span id="s529">And we came in.</span> <span id="s530">There was few wounded.</span> <span id="s531">There were young people that they were fighting in the building.</span> <span id="s532">They were throwing fish or -- different cans of this.</span> <span id="s533">And they were fighting the British.</span> <span id="s534">And the British were throwing tear gas and using tear gas, smoke, and smoke -- yes -- and different things.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: On to the ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s537">On the ship -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: Did they realize that these were just people there -- regular civilians?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: Yeah, but they didn't want to let us in.</span> <span id="s540">They didn't want to enlarge the population of Jewish in Palestine.</span> <span id="s541">And I remember they brought -- what they call it when you lay down a sick person?</span> <span id="s542">The stretcher?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: That's right.</span> <span id="s544">They brought a stretcher?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: So my mother was on the stretcher.</span> <span id="s546">And my father was walking near the stretcher.</span> <span id="s547">And I couldn't walk there, because there was a lot of water in the ship.</span> <span id="s548">Ship started to get water.</span> <span id="s549">It went up here, here, here, here.</span> <span id="s550">And [chuckling].</span> <span id="s551">For me it was too deep, because I could have drowned.</span> <span id="s552">So I remember two people with uniforms.</span> <span id="s553">I think it was the British people -- soldiers -- one of them took me on his arm, holding me.</span> <span id="s554">We were in Germany.</span> <span id="s555">They gave us portions, and they gave also cigarettes.</span> <span id="s556">And my mother told me she had -- cigarettes is a good thing to bring to Palestine, because she can sell it and make some money.</span> <span id="s557">I have very good coat.</span> <span id="s558">Nice coat.</span> <span id="s559">And I had a lot of pockets.</span> <span id="s560">And my pockets were full of cigarettes she put.</span> <span id="s561">So she said because the suitcases -- whatever we have -- they say to throw over the ship, and they will be picked up from other ships and will be taken to Cypress.</span> <span id="s562">But she said, "They won't throw me in the ocean -- on the port on the ground."</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: When one of the soldiers picked me up somehow a pack of cigarettes start to fall down and then another one.</span> <span id="s565">And they were joking saying, "Look at this girl."</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: All the cigarettes.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: She may sell cigarettes or something.</span> <span id="s568">It was a funny moment, although I saw my mother's legs, she was in labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: She was in very bad pain crying.</span> <span id="s571">It was the time.</span> <span id="s572">And also the smoke that was on the ship and the noise, this caused her maybe earlier -- the beginning of the ninth month or something.</span> <span id="s573">So it was scary, and it was funny, because I didn't know that my mother putted pockets in the lining --</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: -- to be able to --</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: -- have some cigarettes.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: But tell me, how did the British soldiers end up on the ship?</span> <span id="s579">Did they -- did they attack and board it?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: They boarded to the ship -- yeah.</span> <span id="s581">They boarded the ship.</span> <span id="s582">They boarded to prevent every single --</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: Person.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: -- yeah to get to the ground of Haifa.</span> <span id="s585">Because they were on the way, and they will settle there.</span> <span id="s586">They didn't want to let them in in Palestine.</span> <span id="s587">They made up their minds.</span> <span id="s588">But there were cases they had to, because some youngsters were wounded so bad that they gave immediate help.</span> <span id="s589">And my mother was this.</span> <span id="s590">She was in labor.</span> <span id="s591">And she was sinking in the water.</span> <span id="s592">I assume that the lower floors were full of water.</span> <span id="s593">Because I know they took me -- I didn't want it, but they lift me up in the arm and they took me to take me out.</span> <span id="s594">So yes.</span> <span id="s595">So they brought us to the Rambam Hospital.</span> <span id="s596">Rambam Hospital -- I believe I know it's a nice big hospital.</span> <span id="s597">But.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: And it was where?</span> <span id="s599">Where is the --</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: In Haifa.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: In Haifa.</span> <span id="s602">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: They let us in at Haifa, because they couldn't take us right away back to --</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: -- Marseille.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s606">And they left us, and left a few -- tens of youngsters.</span> <span id="s607">They were wounded.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: I know some were dead later on I heard.</span> <span id="s610">But -- and they brought us to the hospital -- Rambam Hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: And did your mother give birth there?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: She gave birth.</span> <span id="s613">It was a boy.</span> <span id="s614">And he survived maybe one day or two and he died.</span> <span id="s615">He was poisoned with the smoke and all the gases that they said they -- they put gas I heard it.</span> <span id="s616">In Germany, the concentration camp, they took people to the gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: I thought that my mother -- she was horrible.</span> <span id="s619">I was afraid that they would throw her in the ocean like the other woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: She was in labor.</span> <span id="s622">But, you know, good thing that she survived.</span> <span id="s623">But there were other women that they gave birth on the ship and was fine.</span> <span id="s624">So we were in the Rambam Hospital a while.</span> <span id="s625">And she gave birth, but the baby died.</span> <span id="s626">At the time that my mother was in the ship.</span> <span id="s627">And we were in the ship.</span> <span id="s628">And they let us out, but they put us in the camp in Atlit.</span> <span id="s629">It was a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: And, when I was visiting Atlit, I saw it was like a prisoner's camp with high tile that you cannot go out.</span> <span id="s632">So we are prisoners.</span> <span id="s633">They put our fingers, and they took pictures left, right, profiles and everything.</span> <span id="s634">And they sent us in Atlit.</span> <span id="s635">In Atlit, we were -- I don't know -- a few months, whatever.</span> <span id="s636">But, being in Atlit, we were listening to the radio.</span> <span id="s637">And they announce that they decided to establish a Jewish state.</span> <span id="s638">But when I was in Atlit -- we were in Atlit -- I saw many people started to dance and clap and everything.</span> <span id="s639">And it was a happy occasion.</span> <span id="s640">And, you know, the people were unbelievable.</span> <span id="s641">That was the same year that we arrived.</span> <span id="s642">I don't know -- we arrived, I think, in the summer.</span> <span id="s643">You know, it was summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: 194 -- ?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: Seven.</span> <span id="s646">It was called the Exodus.</span> <span id="s647">And in Hebrew, it was the Sea of Teropa[?]</span> <span id="s648">, leaving Europe like sea of Mizraim where the people left Egypt.</span> <span id="s649">Therefore they called it Exodus.</span> <span id="s650">So anyway, they were dancing there in the camp.</span> <span id="s651">It was such a happy occasion when they went.</span> <span id="s652">And we stayed there -- and, I don't know -- it was the end of -- the end of --</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s654">Sorry for the interruption.</span> <span id="s655">So you were dancing in the streets because -- ?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Yeah, I walked out, see everybody's

America stay.</span> <span id="s962">If you live here, you'll feel better -- this and that."</span> <span id="s963">Although my husband told to me, he was very active in fighting for Israel.</span> <span id="s964">He was in Palma, this and that.</span> <span id="s965">He said, "Okay.</span> <span id="s966">I gave enough of myself.</span> <span id="s967">Maybe I'll do it."</span> <span id="s968">And he convinced me to go to America.</span> <span id="s969">Which it was difficult for me, because I didn't want to leave my parents.</span> <span id="s970">But then he said, "Don't worry -- we'll come and be established here."</span> <span id="s971">So we agreed.</span> <span id="s972">And that what happened.</span> <span id="s973">We came to America.</span> <span id="s974">First to

Seder.</span> <span id="s981">And my house, it was so many people -- friends and neighbors -- and they really had a wonderful time.</span> <span id="s982">My father chose in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s983">I remember I bought a huge table, many chairs and everything, to be able to celebrate the Passover.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: So my parents came, and they stayed with us.</span> <span id="s986">And then.</span> <span id="s987">Somehow I don't know what happened.</span> <span id="s988">I think they were -- they had an apartment, and they left everything.</span> <span id="s989">They came to visit.</span> <span id="s990">Then they said they want to go and give it up and do whatever.</span> <span id="s991">And they went back to Israel to give it up.</span> <span id="s992">And I remember that time my daughter Hessy was in Israel.</span> <span id="s993">She convinced them to come back to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: You brought them there back.</span> <span id="s996">"You brought them back."</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: She brought them back after a few months.</span> <span id="s999">Then they stayed here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: Did you and your husband ever return to Europe to visit those places where you grew up and he grew up, or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: He went back with a friend from Israel.</span> <span id="s1002">My children were little when he went, --</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: -- so I couldn't leave them.</span> <span id="s1005">So he went.</span> <span id="s1006">I'm still planning to go.</span> <span id="s1007">We'll see.</span> <span id="s1008">That time the kids were little; now my husband says he's too old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: [laughing] Never the right time.</span> <span id="s1010">That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: There's no happy medium, you know, between this and this.</span> <span id="s1012">My kids grew up, and then the grandchildren came.</span> <span id="s1013">And I always said to him, "I will go if you want to come."</span> <span id="s1014">He says he will not remember it.</span> <span id="s1015">But you know what?</span> <span id="s1016">He told me that this little town didn't change much.</span> <span id="s1017">Never did told me.</span> <span id="s1018">Now, I didn't see my town that I was born.</span> <span id="s1019">That I would like to see it -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: When it quiets down there a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1022">Anyway, that's the funny thing that we always plan -- not always it comes out.</span> <span id="s1023">Anyway, my parents stay with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: And my mother died in 1998, which was -- she was 80 years old when she died.</span> <span id="s1026">She got Parkinson's, and she started to be in bad shape, so she died.</span> <span id="s1027">And my father lived till 2005 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: -- seven years later than her.</span> <span id="s1030">Beside that he was older than her at least 10, 12 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: So he was almost 100 years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: Yes -- he was 97.5.</span> <span id="s1033">But it's funny.</span> <span id="s1034">His voice was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1035">He had a wonderful voice.</span> <span id="s1036">And wherever there was a chance, he used to sing.</span> <span id="s1037">(indecipherable).</span> <span id="s1038">But that was such a happy occasion.</span> <span id="s1039">He used to sing, and everybody started to dance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: People long in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s1042">Survivors group.</span> <span id="s1043">It's called the New American Holocaust Survivors -- yes.</span> <span id="s1044">(indecipherable).</span> <span id="s1045">Somebody was invited a few times there and whatever and was occasionally started to sing and everybody clapped.</span> <span id="s1046">He was a happy person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: When I was talking with your husband, --</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: -- it was clear that he didn't speak about what he went through for many, many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: He didn't want to tell me and all the children.</span> <span id="s1051">He couldn't talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: And so, he didn't tell you details of what it's like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: Lately he started to say "When I was in the forest."</span> <span id="s1054">It's not like -- like a history thing that you tell this and this year -- a progressive.</span> <span id="s1055">He remembers somebody told you that they decided to talk now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: Well, not just now -- before -- a little bit earlier.</span> <span id="s1057">But it had took many years.</span> <span id="s1058">It was not something that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1060">They couldn't talk.</span> <span id="s1061">They could not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: What about you?</span> <span id="s1063">Did you tell your kids what your life was like until you got --</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: I told them I was in the Exodus and that's it.</span> <span id="s1065">I didn't talk much about it.</span> <span id="s1066">But Exodus -- I mean, Exodus was well-known ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1068">And there are, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: And I -- I start to tell them I was in Exodus.</span> <span id="s1070">And then they throw that woman that was pregnant.</span> <span id="s1071">She gave birth to a baby.</span> <span id="s1072">She died.</span> <span id="s1073">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: And you saw them bury her at sea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: Yeah, it was scary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: It was scary -- sad and scary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: Is there some --</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: My mother tells me that the people, some people that were from the Exodus and there were some women that they -- after they left the Exodus that they gave birth, and this.</span> <span id="s1080">So, when they saw this, they say to her, "So how are you doing after you have such a trauma?"</span> <span id="s1081">She said, "I'm trying to survive."</span> <span id="s1082">Because they had their children with them.</span> <span id="s1083">They gave birth after.</span> <span id="s1084">She was -- my mother started in nine month.</span> <span id="s1085">Never happened with her.</span> <span id="s1086">Anyway, that is the story of Exodus.</span> <span id="s1087">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1088">I don't know how much in new museum.</span> <span id="s1089">Did they have really -- did they have really places that they took pictures from the boat or something?</span> <span id="s1090">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1091">I wanted to see that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: I don't know.</span> <span id="s1093">There might be.</span> <span id="s1094">But the post-war part of the story -- the post-war part of events is something that is not the main focus.</span> <span id="s1095">The main focus is, of course, what happens during the war and the Holocaust during the war.</span> <span id="s1096">Is there anything you'd like to add today that I didn't ask you about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: What I want to add is that now I understand that the -- that the ship that was very crowded and my parents, I mean, they're very uncomfortable sitting on the floor for the whole trip.</span> <span id="s1098">I mean, you couldn't stretch -- whatever -- it was there.</span> <span id="s1099">But, after she came to Palestine, then we came Israel.</span> <span id="s1100">She became a symbol of fighting the British government.</span> <span id="s1101">Although above her declaration was to give a state to the Jewish people, but it seems that the British ignored it.</span> <span id="s1102">It's funny, because (indecipherable) was the first that came out, now the Jewish people have to have a state of their own.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1104">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: And didn't -- didn't -- there's a lot to -- that the ship would be drowned.</span> <span id="s1106">I know it was in water.</span> <span id="s1107">When I came down the ship, they carried me out.</span> <span id="s1108">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1109">But that's the politics.</span> <span id="s1110">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: What would you want -- what would you want your grandkids and their kids and future generations to understand about your life, about the people of Israel who survived -- many who were survivors and who had come from World War II -- what would you want them to understand about their lives?</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: Nothing comes easy.</span> <span id="s1113">Life is a battle, you know?</span> <span id="s1114">It's a struggle.</span> <span id="s1115">When you succeeded this -- you succeed like they prove the whole world that the Jewish people are very stubborn and won't give up.</span> <span id="s1116">Although, the British are very bad.</span> <span id="s1117">I know that we lived there -- my mother said that that was attack from the Arabs.</span> <span id="s1118">Was fiery I think -- something.</span> <span id="s1119">And they -- there was an action -- something.</span> <span id="s1120">And that was the time the Jewish people --</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: Stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1123">And also there were a lot of crimes, a lot of -- that the people suffered a lot also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: Fight for the freedom.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: Yeah, oh -- the fight for the freedom, everything, yes.</span> <span id="s1126">I remember that we came -- we came and we lived at Haifa among the -- in the houses that the Arabs left; they run away.</span> <span id="s1127">But at nighttime, although the Arabs -- they had leaders -- and at nighttime they started to dissel [?]</span> <span id="s1128">, and they got together and tried to do different things to harm the Jewish settlers.</span> <span id="s1129">It wasn't easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: So there wasn't security even there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: No, there wasn't security.</span> <span id="s1132">It was -- every day was a struggle --</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: -- but you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: But you had three children --</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: -- who had their own children.</span> <span id="s1138">So now you have a family that survived and thrived, it sounds like, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: My poor mother -- she lost two boys.</span> <span id="s1140">One younger than me a little bit and one, he was a baby.</span> <span id="s1141">She paid a lot.</span> <span id="s1142">She used to call me, "You are my only eye in my head."</span> <span id="s1143">I said, "Why?</span> <span id="s1144">You have two eyes."</span> <span id="s1145">And she said, "No."</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: It's a shame.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">Q: Well, she did pay a price.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1150">She did pay a price.</span> <span id="s1151">But she -- she died in 1998.</span> <span id="s1152">So Justin, you were already how old?</span> <span id="s1153">Six.</span> <span id="s1154">&gt;&gt; Justin: Grandmother made it to my bar mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: And how was he?</span> <span id="s1156">How was it; do you remember?</span> <span id="s1157">Huh?</span> <span id="s1158">Perfect.</span> <span id="s1159">He was such a happy person.</span> <span id="s1160">He was the center of a party -- always.</span> <span id="s1161">That's what I remember.</span> <span id="s1162">And my mother also had beautiful voice -- soprano -- which I remember.</span> <span id="s1163">And then our Seder was very nice.</span> <span id="s1164">Our getting together and everything.</span> <span id="s1165">I have a good memory from that.</span> <span id="s1166">That's what it is.</span> <span id="s1167">Thank God -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: Broken?</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1170">And although I have no brothers and sisters, but we had a nice life.</span> <span id="s1171">And now we have a nice life -- the children and their children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: Well, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: I hope they will not have to struggle like me, you know?</span> <span id="s1174">They will have their lives easy-going.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: Well, without such -- without such challenges and threats.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: Yeah -- oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: My husband also I told you about, he had a lot.</span> <span id="s1179">He started as young boy and a long time to struggle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: I hope peace will be in the world.</span> <span id="s1182">That will be the most thing that we can accomplish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1184">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1188">You know, I didn't want to talk, because I didn't see that I have all the picture straight, you know?</span> <span id="s1189">It was for me a little bit there, a little here, but it came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: It came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: It came to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: Thank you very much for what you shared.</span> <span id="s1193">I mean, and it came well.</span> <span id="s1194">We got a sense, and we
