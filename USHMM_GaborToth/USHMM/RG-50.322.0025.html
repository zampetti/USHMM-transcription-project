is the first interview with Mrs. May.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Mrs. May would you tell me how old you are?</span></p> <p><span id="s5">A: Ninety-one.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Q: And what was your birth date?</span></p> <p><span id="s7">A: Frankfurt- on- Mein, Germany, September, 1886.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Q: What is the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A: Sixth of September.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Q: My birthday is on the seventh; we’re almost twins.</span> <span id="s11">What a coincidence!</span> <span id="s12">And you were born in Frankfurt-on-Mein?</span> <span id="s13">Did you spend your life in Frankfurt or did you live in other places?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: We were three years in Zurich, Switzerland before the first World War.</span> <span id="s15">My husband was in the army before and had in his passport, if war breaks out he has to return right away to Germany.</span> <span id="s16">And the good patriot he was, he went the first day.</span> <span id="s17">My daughter and I stayed there but I had my mother in Germany, too.</span> <span id="s18">They wrote and wrote for me to come back; you have to come back to your Fatherland.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: So you spent all your life in Frankfurt except for the three years in Zurich.</span> <span id="s20">Had your parents and your grandparents lived in Frankfurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: No, not in Frankfurt, they were born in Reinhessen.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q; And when did your family come to Frankfurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: When my mother married, maybe in 1884.</span> <span id="s24">My father was not from Frankfurt and my mother was not, but they married in Frankfurt and used to live in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s25">My father was only 47 years old when he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: And how old were you at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Maybe 18 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: What was your maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Mayer.</span> <span id="s30">MAYER.</span> <span id="s31">In German, I don’t know if you understand it, mayer is a man, so she said he and we said mayer, so I always made a joke, if somebody asked my name.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Did you come from a large family; did you have brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: No, I was the only child and I have only one child.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: What was your father’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: Morris Mayer.</span> <span id="s36">My husband’s name was May.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: And what did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: He was a butcher and he had two butcher stores with men working for him.</span> <span id="s39">They had a very good business but my mother sold it right away.</span> <span id="s40">For a woman, it was not good to be in a butcher store.</span> <span id="s41">It was cold in winter and there was just a little room in the back.</span> <span id="s42">So then we were alone.</span> <span id="s43">So I got to know my husband and we were married very young because my mother was spoiled by my father.</span> <span id="s44">He did everything for her so I thought it was necessary to have a man.</span> <span id="s45">When I married, I took my mother with me.</span> <span id="s46">And our maid.</span> <span id="s47">We had our maid over 20 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Was your father a butcher before he came to Frankfurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: He had to learn.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: But his first butcher shop was in Frankfurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: And what was your mother’s maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Mann.</span> <span id="s54">MANN.</span> <span id="s55">We all have “M’s.”</span> <span id="s56">Three generations with “M”.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: And then when your father died, and your mother sold the butcher shop, how did your mother and you derive your income?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: I had some money and we saved money and my father said that what you have in your head nobody can take away from you.</span> <span id="s59">I learned business, I learned bookkeeping.</span> <span id="s60">I learned what you have to do in the home: needlework and such things like that…I did it all, everything I had to learn.</span> <span id="s61">I went to schools and I can do everything, like my daughter.</span> <span id="s62">She learned everything, too.</span> <span id="s63">And she’s very handy with her hands.</span> <span id="s64">This picture, here.</span> <span id="s65">My husband was very talented.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Did your parents have a formal education?</span> <span id="s67">And do you know how much education they had?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: I’m sure they had, but I don’t know what they learned before I was born.</span> <span id="s69">They both came from a little village.</span> <span id="s70">My mother from Reinhessen.</span> <span id="s71">My father from close to Frankfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: What sort of religious life did you have in the home?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: We were Jews, but not overly.</span> <span id="s74">We went to the synagogue when the holiday was.</span> <span id="s75">We belonged to the Conservative as we do here, too.</span> <span id="s76">We went on Saturdays, sometimes on Friday nights, the holidays especially.</span> <span id="s77">We would close our store, too, on the holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: And did you keep kosher?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Yes, my father learned in the kosher store.</span> <span id="s80">But he said he didn’t want it.</span> <span id="s81">In the store they made sausage and everything and he did not keep a kosher store.</span> <span id="s82">He made the sausage we ate himself but he had other meat, like you buy here.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: What languages did your family speak?</span> <span id="s84">German, of course, and?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: I learned French at school and I learned English.</span> <span id="s86">We didn’t speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s87">I can’t speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s88">I can’t understand it.</span> <span id="s89">Sometimes there is a little German word in it and when I came into the grocery store here, they started to speak German to me.</span> <span id="s90">I said, “I’m sorry, I want to learn English.”</span> <span id="s91">I knew English and you have to talk English to me.</span> <span id="s92">Do you know that many stores in New York are owned by Jews and they speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s93">But we never learned it.</span> <span id="s94">We spoke German.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Did your mother or father speak French, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: No, my father sent me to a very good school.</span> <span id="s97">We took it in school already and we learned French and German.</span> <span id="s98">You learned English easier, do you know that?</span> <span id="s99">There are many words the same, the spelling is different, but they write it the same.</span> <span id="s100">When I came to New York, I went to evening school to keep up with English but it confused me.</span> <span id="s101">I knew what English was, but New York was a little different, you know, the language.</span> <span id="s102">It’s very mixed in New York but here it is much better.</span> <span id="s103">So they confused me, so I took my radio when I was cleaning and looked up the words I heard in the dictionary.</span> <span id="s104">So I learned the English much better.</span> <span id="s105">I could write and could read.</span> <span id="s106">I even had English books from school very much as you do here in high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Did you travel very much as a child on vacations?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Yes, as a child.</span> <span id="s109">My mother had two sisters and a brother.</span> <span id="s110">One lived in Wiesbaden.</span> <span id="s111">I went there.</span> <span id="s112">The other sister and brother lived in Reinhessen and the brother was 94 years old.</span> <span id="s113">The Nazis killed him.</span> <span id="s114">He lived in the same place where he was born and he was working for the government there.</span> <span id="s115">They sent men from the other cities.</span> <span id="s116">They killed him.</span> <span id="s117">He would have lived much longer.</span> <span id="s118">His son now lives in California.</span> <span id="s119">He’s the only one who is left.</span> <span id="s120">He had four daughters, three daughters my age.</span> <span id="s121">Two killed themselves in Wiesbaden when they heard the Nazis go around and take the Jews out of the houses.</span> <span id="s122">They killed themselves.</span> <span id="s123">And one was married to a gentile in Mainz, a city in Reinhessen also.</span> <span id="s124">She was living and her husband died and her daughter is married and here in the States.</span> <span id="s125">I don’t know where exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: So you would visit family?</span> <span id="s127">Cousins and aunts and uncles on vacation?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Yes, we were a close family.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Before you went to Switzerland to live had you traveled outside of Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Yes, we went on vacations in the mountains.</span> <span id="s131">Frankfurt is not far from mountains.</span> <span id="s132">We could go by bus and then we walked up the highest mountains, my husband, my daughter and I. My parents, too, before.</span> <span id="s133">But my father died too early.</span> <span id="s134">There were some things they couldn’t heal in Germany.</span> <span id="s135">Now, they can heal it here.</span> <span id="s136">He had kidney trouble.</span> <span id="s137">I have a friend here who has it and she is all right.</span> <span id="s138">But they had nothing to help.</span> <span id="s139">We had a nurse and a doctor, couldn’t help.</span> <span id="s140">Now everything is more advanced, here.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Did you think of yourself and your family as a member of the middle class, the working class?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Middle class.</span> <span id="s143">My parents were both working in the store and I took turns.</span> <span id="s144">We had the stores open all day and when they rested in the afternoon I relieved them sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Mrs. May, did you have much contact with the gentile community?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s147">Many friends.</span> <span id="s148">We used to say later, when the Nazis came, everyone had a Jewish friend.</span> <span id="s149">My husband had friends and they came (it was 1923) and they told him there is a group in the Odenwald that is a mountain, actually in Koenig, the city.</span> <span id="s150">They started already to go against the Jews.</span> <span id="s151">Nobody took them seriously at that time.</span> <span id="s152">You know they started like here and it was 1933 when they really worked against us.</span> <span id="s153">In 1933 they started to take the men out of the houses, march through the streets and singing, “The blood of the Jews shall flow by the knife.”</span> <span id="s154">(Renate Frydman).</span> <span id="s155">Through the city there were already many in the brown uniforms.</span> <span id="s156">Then we were shocked.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: That was in Frankfurt in 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: In 1933 they started to walk through the streets singing, maybe a few hundred already at that time.</span> <span id="s159">That was the Horst Wessel song, that was one of the first, but what could we do?</span> <span id="s160">We couldn’t go out, you had to have an affidavit.</span> <span id="s161">My husband got it in ’36 and went alone to New York and had to let us come in two years.</span> <span id="s162">She went out, you know the story about her (obviously meaning Renate Frydman, Lydia’s granddaughter).</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Yes, a little bit of it, not all of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Somebody threw a stone on her buggy.</span> <span id="s165">She was a baby, she was a few months old.</span> <span id="s166">He wanted to kill her.</span> <span id="s167">Our maid was standing there with the buggy, waiting for us to come down.</span> <span id="s168">We were going to the park in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s169">And my husband said, “Now I have to go.”</span> <span id="s170">And he had an affidavit for only him alone.</span> <span id="s171">So he didn’t know anything about the family and we didn’t know that family, too.</span> <span id="s172">Just accidentally we got the name.</span> <span id="s173">It was from his father, a brother in New York.</span> <span id="s174">And he died in the meantime.</span> <span id="s175">And when my husband came here, the aunt died.</span> <span id="s176">Only cousins were there.</span> <span id="s177">In Frankfurt lived an aunt who was a widow and she had four sons, five sons she had.</span> <span id="s178">Two were living in New York, very well off.</span> <span id="s179">One had a jewelry store in the Waldorf Astoria.</span> <span id="s180">The other one, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s181">And three were still in Germany and we tried to get an affidavit from them but they said we have to take care of our brothers first.</span> <span id="s182">One of the brothers was on the boat they never could land somewhere, remember that story?</span> <span id="s183">He was killed this way.</span> <span id="s184">They started to go in port somewhere, a beautiful handsome blond man he was.</span> <span id="s185">May, his name was May, too.</span> <span id="s186">I don’t know the first name.</span> <span id="s187">The twins were Otto and Richard.</span> <span id="s188">I forget the names.</span> <span id="s189">OK and slowly the two other brothers came here, too, to the States.</span> <span id="s190">So, my husband was working in the studio.</span> <span id="s191">First he was working making pictures.</span> <span id="s192">I think I told this story.</span> <span id="s193">When he got a job in the studio where they had trays.</span> <span id="s194">He was handy with carpentry work.</span> <span id="s195">And this lady and her husband, they gave every day work for us because Renate was a baby.</span> <span id="s196">They wanted more.</span> <span id="s197">And they gave for my son-in-law, my daughter and me and for her an affidavit.</span> <span id="s198">But not for my mother.</span> <span id="s199">So my mother was killed in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s200">When we sent the affidavit it was too late because they gave numbers and she didn’t know it.</span> <span id="s201">She had too high a number.</span> <span id="s202">They took her to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s203">And an aunt of mine, too.</span> <span id="s204">She was 80, over 80.</span> <span id="s205">Nobody thought she was that age, she never looked it.</span> <span id="s206">There’s a picture of your great-grandmother, that little one there.</span> <span id="s207">That’s a passport picture, she already had her passport.</span> <span id="s208">The whole old aged homes they took, two the same day.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: I’d like to go into more detail about that later on.</span> <span id="s210">About your leaving and the affidavits, and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: I’ll tell you something, they took the men out of the houses.</span> <span id="s212">And we went to the American consulate in Germany to get our passports.</span> <span id="s213">My daughter, and we took her, and one Nazi was after us, we were in a taxi, after us with a bike.</span> <span id="s214">And we went to the American Consulate.</span> <span id="s215">“English,’ he said, “English,” so that he could do something.</span> <span id="s216">We were standing there waiting to get our passport for England because the boat was going later.</span> <span id="s217">It was the SS Washington that we took, the American steamer, no?</span> <span id="s218">And my husband had a brother, he had an affidavit from someone else.</span> <span id="s219">We went to London and he went to France with his family.</span> <span id="s220">And when we came to Calais, that’s France, across the straight of Dover from England, the port, he was on the same boat with the family.</span> <span id="s221">And that was a wonder that we met them there.</span> <span id="s222">He had a son and a daughter.</span> <span id="s223">The daughter was here already.</span> <span id="s224">She sent him the affidavit.</span> <span id="s225">And his wife.</span> <span id="s226">That’s what I can say, we had to have an affidavit, everybody else can come in.</span> <span id="s227">Isn’t that so?</span> <span id="s228">From every country, without.</span> <span id="s229">Do you realize that?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Yes, I knew that.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Hungary, Vietnam, Korea, many more.</span> <span id="s232">Everybody could come but we from Germany had to have an affidavit at that time.</span> <span id="s233">(As long as the immigration laws of 1921/1927 were on the books, everyone needed an affidavit of support before being admitted for a number according to the yearly quota set up by nationality of origin.</span> <span id="s234">Note that there was not national quota for people of Asiatic origin -- they could only come as visitors or be native-born.</span> <span id="s235">RF).</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Let me go back and ask some more about your earlier background.</span> <span id="s237">Was the maid that your family had gentile or Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Ach, the maid.</span> <span id="s239">The maid was from Bavaria.</span> <span id="s240">She was Catholic and we had many Catholic friends, too.</span> <span id="s241">They started to help us and we had people who came in the night and put some food in the door.</span> <span id="s242">Neighbors and so.</span> <span id="s243">They were working for the radio next door from us, where the office was.</span> <span id="s244">One day, Goebbels (the Nazi propaganda minister) was there.</span> <span id="s245">We could see.</span> <span id="s246">They had a big yard and he was walking around there, talking on the radio.</span> <span id="s247">And these people were working for the radio.</span> <span id="s248">They were gentile people who brought us food.</span> <span id="s249">The food was rationed for us.</span> <span id="s250">We could go in the store, we had to bring our ration card.</span> <span id="s251">We didn’t get enough.</span> <span id="s252">But we had some friends.</span> <span id="s253">When I went to a special store for butter and eggs and cheese, and he always gave me something extra.</span> <span id="s254">There was a special store for everything.</span> <span id="s255">Not like here the way the stores are now.</span> <span id="s256">Maybe they have it now, too.</span> <span id="s257">My family from Reinhessen sent us potatoes.</span> <span id="s258">When somebody got married somewhere and took the train, they gave them a sack full of potatoes for us.</span> <span id="s259">Some friends helped us.</span> <span id="s260">That is something, this rationing.</span> <span id="s261">If I hadn’t had gentile friends, I don’t know what we would have done.</span> <span id="s262">My husband was in the army at that time.</span> <span id="s263">And they chased him out, too.</span> <span id="s264">The first Jews they took, the man made them walk through the city with a big sign, “WE ARE JEWS.”</span> <span id="s265">And the women came and they put them together and the wives came and wanted to get them out but they chased them away.</span> <span id="s266">Put the men in the concentration camp and everybody was against them.</span> <span id="s267">Who is not for us is against us!</span> <span id="s268">They had big signs in the city that said, “JEWS ARE OUR MISFORTUNE.”</span> <span id="s269">Big signs.</span> <span id="s270">In every store was a sign like That, “JEWS ARE NOT WANTED.”</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Do you remember approximately when that began, those signs were put up?</span> <span id="s272">Was it in 1933, 1934?</span> <span id="s273">What year were those signs put up and the men had to march through the streets, was that early, right after Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: That was 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: As soon as Hitler came to power?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: No, it was later.</span> <span id="s277">It was ’35 or ’36 because we had shutters on the windows and we closed them.</span> <span id="s278">The same day we left Germany, that was the last train before the war.</span> <span id="s279">And we had our luggage and we were sitting in the main train station and people were standing around us, the Nazis, until the train came.</span> <span id="s280">When we left, some family was living in the house and later came to New York, too.</span> <span id="s281">They told us they were looking for my son-in-law, for your father.</span> <span id="s282">He was just out the same day.</span> <span id="s283">They wanted to take him, too.</span> <span id="s284">You don’t know what that is, you can’t imagine.</span> <span id="s285">They wanted to take him to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s286">The last day they said no train was coming anymore, at least for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: What sort of associations did your family belong to in the synagogue or the cultural life of the city?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Conservative and B’nai Brith.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: What about political party affiliations; was your family very political?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: No, we were Democrat, we were Democrat.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Was your father an active member of the Democratic Party?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: No, first he was working, then he died too early.</span> <span id="s293">We were not active in any party, no.</span> <span id="s294">They could have said something against us in that case.</span> <span id="s295">But we were Jews!</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Did you attend the theater and concerts?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Yah, from the opera we had season cards and there were theaters where dramas were played and other theaters, we went there too.</span> <span id="s298">The circus was there and so went everywhere before (Hitler came).</span> <span id="s299">Then everything was forbidden.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: What year were you married?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: 1905.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: How old were you when you got married?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: It was 1886, maybe ’04, I was 18, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Then after you got married did you continue to live at home with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: No, my mother and our maid went with me and we were living in Worms-am Rhein and I didn’t like it there.</span> <span id="s306">So we went back to Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s307">The maid was with us, too.</span> <span id="s308">She was with us until her mother died and her father was blind so she had to go home.</span> <span id="s309">She died two years ago.</span> <span id="s310">She was 90 years old.</span> <span id="s311">We always were in touch with each other.</span> <span id="s312">We wrote each other.</span> <span id="s313">Now we have one friend in Germany, a Catholic lady, to whom I write.</span> <span id="s314">And I have one school friend still in Zurich.</span> <span id="s315">We write each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Pardon me, let me turn this tape over.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Begin Side Two.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: July 11, 1978 and I am in the home of Mrs. Lydia May for a series of interviews.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">For example, do you remember when your husband was born?</span> <span id="s320">What his birth date was?</span> <span id="s321">Where and when?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: 1888, not directly in Worms-am Rhein, but in a little village.</span> <span id="s323">But he could walk to school.</span> <span id="s324">He had one brother and one sister.</span> <span id="s325">The sister is still living, she is in Atlantic City.</span> <span id="s326">She was 90 last January.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: So your husband was two years younger than you.</span> <span id="s328">You were born in 1886.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: No, he was six years older.</span> <span id="s330">He died already 19 years ago, now.</span> <span id="s331">And we were here in Dayton for 30 years.</span> <span id="s332">He came to New York and could not speak English very well.</span> <span id="s333">He came in that business (the studio) where they were talking German, they wanted to improve their German.</span> <span id="s334">They came from Austria.</span> <span id="s335">They spoke German there.</span> <span id="s336">He never learned to write English and speak English well.</span> <span id="s337">So he couldn’t make friends here.</span> <span id="s338">I could.</span> <span id="s339">I went into the organizations and I made friends.</span> <span id="s340">I was working for the organizations.</span> <span id="s341">He was very handy in carpenter work.</span> <span id="s342">He never had learned that.</span> <span id="s343">He was a picture painter.</span> <span id="s344">That is what he was doing in New York with that picture painter, that helped him in New York, that he had that talent, so he could make a living.</span> <span id="s345">I told you that he was alone here for two years?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s347">Now, what was his occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: He started with a leather business.</span> <span id="s349">They started in that little city and were living in Worms when we were just married, and I didn’t like it in Worms-am-Rhein.</span> <span id="s350">It is a little city.</span> <span id="s351">When you were walking through the streets they were looking out their windows.</span> <span id="s352">I didn’t like that.</span> <span id="s353">You see, I came from a big city so we moved to Frankfurt and he went in the furniture business for barbers and for beauty shops and he sold that in a store until we had to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Did he own the store?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Yes, he did.</span> <span id="s356">He went out of town also.</span> <span id="s357">He had a driver from Berlin, but he could drive also.</span> <span id="s358">So he went out of town.</span> <span id="s359">But he always came back in the evening, he never stayed away longer.</span> <span id="s360">He never stayed away overnight for the business.</span> <span id="s361">I didn’t know too much about the business but he was very active in it.</span> <span id="s362">His brother used to live in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s363">He had an import and export business.</span> <span id="s364">He spoke every language and he took his son in the business and he has now a business in Boston.</span> <span id="s365">He died three years ago and his wife is so active in that business, she goes into every country.</span> <span id="s366">You would be surprised.</span> <span id="s367">She was here a few months ago and I asked her, “How are you doing that?”</span> <span id="s368">She says, “They all speak English and I can do that.”</span> <span id="s369">She has a son-in-law who studied to be a doctor.</span> <span id="s370">She took him into that business and they travel around and have a very good business.</span> <span id="s371">I think that she has 20 or 30 employees.</span> <span id="s372">His father brought him in that business and he took his son-in-law into it, and his wife also.</span> <span id="s373">My sister-in-law was in Atlantic City but they won’t let me go anymore.</span> <span id="s374">My son-in-law won’t let me go out of town anymore, or someone has to go with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: They keep close watch on you.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: I don’t like Atlantic City so much.</span> <span id="s377">You know, I got a sunburn all over -- sun poisoning was better word.</span> <span id="s378">I had to eat up everything and when I was in Florida I didn’t get that.</span> <span id="s379">What is it?</span> <span id="s380">The same ocean?</span> <span id="s381">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: I don’t know either.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s384">I was asked myself always.</span> <span id="s385">I didn’t get it in Florida.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: I also don’t know your husband’s first name.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Max.</span> <span id="s388">Maximilian!</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Maximilian May, and you mentioned during our last interview that he was in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A; Yes, he was in the army like all the soldiers are.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: What year did he join the army, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: He was in it.</span> <span id="s393">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Had World War I already started?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: No, in World War I he was out already.</span> <span id="s396">It said in his passport that he had to come back.</span> <span id="s397">I told you that we were in Zurich when the war broke out?</span> <span id="s398">He was a good patriot and he went back and we were alone.</span> <span id="s399">My daughter was a little girl, and my mother was living in Germany, also in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s400">They wrote all the time that you have to come back to your fatherland in such a time.</span> <span id="s401">We were there (Zurich) until 1915.</span> <span id="s402">What could we do?</span> <span id="s403">We went back but I would have stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: So when he went back he did enter the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Sure, they took him right away.</span> <span id="s406">He was in the artillery.</span> <span id="s407">They were shooting at the planes from the other countries.</span> <span id="s408">They always called up when they heard on the frontier that the planes are coming.</span> <span id="s409">Then he called us up so that we would go to the basement.</span> <span id="s410">We were in front of the basement, we had a good basement there.</span> <span id="s411">The French planes came like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Was Frankfurt bombed during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s414">The French bombed us.</span> <span id="s415">They bombed Germany during the first year.</span> <span id="s416">I told you that we had a maid from Bavaria.</span> <span id="s417">She went downstairs into the basement, my daughter was a little girl -- it was funny what she took down.</span> <span id="s418">I believe that she was only three or four years old then.</span> <span id="s419">I never forgot what she took with her.</span> <span id="s420">We heard them when they dropped the bombs, and when they were done we went up again.</span> <span id="s421">He was first stationed in Frankfurt and then they took him to Ostende on the ocean.</span> <span id="s422">He was a sergeant.</span> <span id="s423">I also have pictures of him.</span> <span id="s424">Sometimes they were sick, but they didn’t send them home.</span> <span id="s425">When he came home, thanks God, he was alright.</span> <span id="s426">Nothing happened (to him).</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: So he was in for the duration of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Yes, all of WWI, 1914 until 1918, four years!</span> <span id="s429">And then came the bad times -- the inflation when we had nothing to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Yes, I wanted to ask you about that also.</span> <span id="s431">Would you mind recalling what Germany was like after the war with the inflation?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: We Jews got later rationing cards.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Just the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: First yes, and then the others also, but the others could go in the stores but they had the signs, “Jews are not wanted.”</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: After World War I?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: After World War I, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Oh?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: No, that was after the Nazis came.</span> <span id="s439">I am wrong here.</span> <span id="s440">Not the war!</span> <span id="s441">But the inflation was something else.</span> <span id="s442">We had money, but it was worth nothing!</span> <span id="s443">My daughter has still paper money -- my son-in-law was in a factory as a manager and they printed it.</span> <span id="s444">It was worth nothing!</span> <span id="s445">I mean thousands and thousands of marks which were worth nothing.</span> <span id="s446">That money she still has, has pictures on it and thousands of marks of value -- and other denominations also.</span> <span id="s447">Everything was worthless.</span> <span id="s448">What could we do then?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: When your husband returned from the war, did he go back into the business of selling (the furniture)?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">AL Yes, he started his business again.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Was business bad?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: It was good then, for a while until the inflation, because money was worth nothing.</span> <span id="s453">They gave rationing cards to everybody, the Germans.</span> <span id="s454">I wondered if they wanted to start here also, but they don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: How did you get by?</span> <span id="s456">How did you find food?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: I had my furniture in storage.</span> <span id="s458">All in one storage place.</span> <span id="s459">When I wanted my furniture I couldn’t get it since there was a war on.</span> <span id="s460">And later it was mixed up with other items -- half a bed, half of the good glasses which I had and of my silver flatware, and everything.</span> <span id="s461">They mixed it up.</span> <span id="s462">OK?</span> <span id="s463">I said what I don’t have I won’t use.</span> <span id="s464">But we had to start from scratch!</span> <span id="s465">It was hard to make money, etc.</span> <span id="s466">I started to work also a little bit in a hotel.</span> <span id="s467">I gave out the linen and everything for the kitchen.</span> <span id="s468">My mother was there and still the maid was with us.</span> <span id="s469">My daughter went to school in Zurich for the first year.</span> <span id="s470">She spoke “Switzerdeutch.”</span> <span id="s471">Did you ever hear of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: It was German as spoken in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s474">It is mixed language.</span> <span id="s475">The real Swiss people didn’t speak German.</span> <span id="s476">But Zurich was in the German speaking part of Switzerland.</span> <span id="s477">Switzerland had actual three (official) languages: German, French and Italian.</span> <span id="s478">And when we went on a bus or something like that and I had my daughter with me, they said, “Oh, what a pretty girl,” in dialect using some Italian.</span> <span id="s479">But you could readily go to Italy from there.</span> <span id="s480">Switzerland is a beautiful country.</span> <span id="s481">I get homesick when I see pictures.</span> <span id="s482">I never saw such a beautiful country.</span> <span id="s483">We went around it very much.</span> <span id="s484">Italy was very bad also, at that time.</span> <span id="s485">They didn’t take care.</span> <span id="s486">Switzerland is clean!</span> <span id="s487">The cleanest country is Holland.</span> <span id="s488">We were in Amsterdam and The Hague and every day they clean the rooms and they take everything out of the rooms and put it in other rooms.</span> <span id="s489">It is so clean and in Switzerland also.</span> <span id="s490">The women put the white laundry on top of the houses to dry it -- a thing which they do in New York also.</span> <span id="s491">We had an apartment there and the rooms had parquet flooring.</span> <span id="s492">The landlord said, “You have the nicest flooring in the house.”</span> <span id="s493">I was alone there, no one to help me.</span> <span id="s494">My husband was traveling around, on business.</span> <span id="s495">My brother-in-law let us come for three years, then we had to go back, because of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: When was your daughter born?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: In 1907.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Was she the only child?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: We never had any other children.</span> <span id="s500">It was a bad time, after and during the war, but we managed it.</span> <span id="s501">What could we do?</span> <span id="s502">And then when Hitler came it was a lot worse for us.</span> <span id="s503">We had hardly anything to eat.</span> <span id="s504">My husband was still in the army.</span> <span id="s505">He came to the States in 1936.</span> <span id="s506">We all went through that whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: Back in the 1920s when the inflation was so bad, there was growing anti-Semitism at that time.</span> <span id="s508">You told me about the incident in the Odenwald in 1923, were there other incidents?</span> <span id="s509">Was there anything happening in Frankfurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Not like that until Hitler came.</span> <span id="s511">You know they burned the synagogues in the whole country in one day?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: That was in March of 1933, wasn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Yah, it was not spontaneous, it was all prepared.</span> <span id="s514">They got the order and they did it and I remember, my mother came home.</span> <span id="s515">She had been shopping and she said the man where she was shopping said the synagogues were burning.</span> <span id="s516">We didn’t even know that.</span> <span id="s517">All the synagogues.</span> <span id="s518">We lived across the street from a Jewish study center and it was a big house, five or six floors.</span> <span id="s519">They went upstairs into every room and threw all the paper out.</span> <span id="s520">We saw that!</span> <span id="s521">Papers in the streets.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: This was in 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Yes, that was after, 1933, yes.</span> <span id="s524">And they took the men.</span> <span id="s525">They went into the houses, not in 1933, that was sometime later.</span> <span id="s526">The Jews were not allowed to get there and go here.</span> <span id="s527">Where we lived there was not the star, but my mother had it.</span> <span id="s528">Do you know that the King of Denmark wore it.</span> <span id="s529">He was very loyal to the Jews.</span> <span id="s530">What’s going on now, did you read that, in Scandinavia?</span> <span id="s531">The star too.</span> <span id="s532">Not the star, against the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: In Scandinavia?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Didn’t you read that?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: The paper wrote it.</span> <span id="s537">In Sweden -- Sweden was very good too, and I think in Norway.</span> <span id="s538">The young Jews, they don’t know what to do, they want to go out.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: I hadn’t read that.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: You know what Hitler did?</span> <span id="s541">He had the party.</span> <span id="s542">He took some men, “Strength Through Joy,” and they put them on the boats, on the train, put them up in other countries.</span> <span id="s543">They were part of the party.</span> <span id="s544">This way, he brought it everywhere, into every country.</span> <span id="s545">I used to live in New York in a big apartment house.</span> <span id="s546">There were elevator men, black ones.</span> <span id="s547">Once I came downstairs and a white man was standing with him.</span> <span id="s548">Later I said, “What did he want?”</span> <span id="s549">“Oh, he told us about the Nazis, that we should join.”</span> <span id="s550">They were working in every country.</span> <span id="s551">He didn’t join, but he said it.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Agents, Nazi agents?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: Yah, they brought them for vacation but they had to work for the party.</span> <span id="s554">Nobody knows what they did.</span> <span id="s555">We were afraid of everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Well, would you talk about that?</span> <span id="s557">What about your own feelings?</span> <span id="s558">What did you feel when you went out on the streets, when you went to shop for food?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: Like I said, I was suspicious of everybody.</span> <span id="s560">You know?</span> <span id="s561">I was afraid when they were marching through the streets, hundreds and hundreds, with that brown uniform and they looked for Jews.</span> <span id="s562">We don’t look exactly like many do.</span> <span id="s563">We were not so afraid, but anyhow, but they knew where the Jews lived.</span> <span id="s564">Some Jews were living in another city or another little village and they moved out but they found them in the other city, far away, they found them.</span> <span id="s565">They had everywhere their spies.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: I understand that it was rather common that Nazi party members would be stationed in every city block or every house.</span> <span id="s567">A big apartment house, there would be a Nazi there who would look out.</span> <span id="s568">Were you aware?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Yah, he watched the people, what they did.</span> <span id="s570">If they were a Jew or not a Jew.</span> <span id="s571">The others were in danger too.</span> <span id="s572">When someone was working in an office and said something like, ‘Do you know what they did about this man or so?”</span> <span id="s573">the neighbor went into the Nazis and told them.</span> <span id="s574">They got him.</span> <span id="s575">You couldn’t trust them, the gentiles couldn’t trust each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Were you aware of who these spies were in your neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Not for sure.</span> <span id="s578">I don’t know if I told you this before but when the food was very short some neighbors brought us food in the night and put it in front of our door.</span> <span id="s579">We know who it was because they called us and told us, but we had to be very careful.</span> <span id="s580">There was a lodge, a B’nai Brith lodge -- and that is a story, too.</span> <span id="s581">They took, one day, all the members into a large auditorium where the meetings and everything usually took place.</span> <span id="s582">The Nazis came to the house and they let the members enter the house and put them into the auditorium.</span> <span id="s583">They told them which seats to sit in.</span> <span id="s584">Nobody sat in the middle so that they couldn’t talk together and the Nazis were asking questions.</span> <span id="s585">I was there also because I was the secretary at that time.</span> <span id="s586">I wrote letters in English to the President here.</span> <span id="s587">They knew all of that.</span> <span id="s588">They were questioning us and we were afraid that they would take us.</span> <span id="s589">One day they made me come to the headquarters to ask me questions and, when I looked around, I saw a microphone behind me.</span> <span id="s590">A few times I had to go there to answer questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Why would they ask you to come to headquarters?</span> <span id="s592">Was it because you were secretary to the B’nai Brith lodge?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: Yes, they knew that!</span> <span id="s594">They knew that I was writing letters and such but here, also, for the Covenant House, or such, wherever it is I write letters.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: What kind of questions would they ask you?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: “What did you write?</span> <span id="s597">Why do you write?”</span> <span id="s598">And so on.</span> <span id="s599">“What do you want from them?”</span> <span id="s600">It is a simple thing, everybody could read the letters.</span> <span id="s601">Then one day they went into the office and took everything from the offices; there were three B’nai Brith lodges.</span> <span id="s602">First was the Frankfurt lodge, later on came Herman Kohn and Markus Salarus, three lodges.</span> <span id="s603">And all the offices were there, in that house.</span> <span id="s604">They came and took every book and everything.</span> <span id="s605">We had prayer books there, we had a library there.</span> <span id="s606">They only left us the prayer books -- and they burned it.</span> <span id="s607">You know the story.</span> <span id="s608">They came in our house; we had a big library -- a cupboard full of books -- they took it with them.</span> <span id="s609">Then before we left, there was a Nazi sitting in that room.</span> <span id="s610">He took every book out and shook it, upside down, to see if we had money in it.</span> <span id="s611">Then he took every book -- they came and picked it up -- which was from a Jewish author or with Jewish stories and burned it in the city.</span> <span id="s612">They burned all the books.</span> <span id="s613">I don’t know but some came out.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: But they actually came to your apartment, in your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: Yes, they came and they heard that we go out.</span> <span id="s616">We had the affidavit to go to the States.</span> <span id="s617">Every book!</span> <span id="s618">They went into the houses as if it was their apartment.</span> <span id="s619">I see this, as you are sitting there, it was terrible; a blond young man.</span> <span id="s620">He turned every book upside down.</span> <span id="s621">We were not allowed to take money.</span> <span id="s622">I think 100 mark, or something like that, what we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Did you have any warning that this was going to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: It just happened all of a sudden?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: No, they just came.</span> <span id="s627">“I want to see what books you have,” he said, and then he took it out -- “what you read!”</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: Did they talk to you while they were doing that or did they just go about their business?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: No, they said nothing.</span> <span id="s630">They came and walked in.</span> <span id="s631">The milkman came every day.</span> <span id="s632">He brought the milk in such big cans and asked how much milk you wanted, you know, a liter or more, and he asked us, “Are you Jewish?</span> <span id="s633">Go out, leave the city as fast as you can.”</span> <span id="s634">A gentile man.</span> <span id="s635">Some gentiles were nice but they were afraid.</span> <span id="s636">They couldn’t do anything since they (meaning the Nazis) took them right away to a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s637">My daughter had a friend and her husband, they were gentiles, and he had to join the Nazi party.</span> <span id="s638">They had the big flag on the car.</span> <span id="s639">They came to us to visit us with the flag, the Nazi flag.</span> <span id="s640">At that time, that was risky.</span> <span id="s641">They were lucky that they did not take them.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Mrs. May, as you look back can you recall any sort of increased activity like that?</span> <span id="s643">Did it start out on a very small scale and get more and more constant?</span> <span id="s644">All the intimidations, the books (burning), the fear of going out in the street; did it start out very gradually and then get worse?</span> <span id="s645">Did it build up?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: It built up.</span> <span id="s647">There were so many who had to join.</span> <span id="s648">You saw pictures, when he (Hitler) was speaking, how many people were there.</span> <span id="s649">In every store, in every factory, everywhere, they had to join.</span> <span id="s650">Who is not for us is against us, they said.</span> <span id="s651">On the street, I told you that there were signs which read, “The Jews are our misfortune.”</span> <span id="s652">They were big signs, from one side of the street to the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: You said that those signs were put up in 1933.</span> <span id="s654">What I am trying to determine is: was there a constant level of this kind of activity from 1933 to ’38, or did it start out very little and then build up?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Only they took the men from the houses and took them into the streets.</span> <span id="s656">We saw that.</span> <span id="s657">We were looking out the window and saw that.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Was your husband taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: My husband was not taken, but the day when we left they wanted to take my son-in-law.</span> <span id="s660">My husband was out (of Germany) already.</span> <span id="s661">In the evening they came and wanted to get my son-in-law.</span> <span id="s662">They knew every Jew, every Jew!</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Was your son-in-law there?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: He was with us, he went with the train, the last train.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: No, I mean, to be taken out of the house.</span> <span id="s666">Was your son-in-law there?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: No, they didn’t take him out.</span> <span id="s668">We closed the windows and everything and we went to the consul, the American, no, the English consul, to get a visa for England and for Holland.</span> <span id="s669">We were in Holland and England before we could go to the States because the boats didn’t leave when we left.</span> <span id="s670">My son-in-law had family in England and family in Holland.</span> <span id="s671">And he said to our friends, “Go away from here also, they will be coming here.”</span> <span id="s672">And they came into the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s673">But a few returned, they could leave, but not all.</span> <span id="s674">His parents, his father did not want to leave, he put money into Panama for them.</span> <span id="s675">Panama took the Jews if they had a few thousand dollars.</span> <span id="s676">He put money there so that his parents could go out, and he was waiting for his parents to get out of the camp.</span> <span id="s677">Some people were there (in Panama).</span> <span id="s678">I know people here who were in Panama during that time until they could go to the States.</span> <span id="s679">Panama was helpful, they could even work there.</span> <span id="s680">But there was enough money there (for my son-in-law’s parents) to see them through.</span> <span id="s681">We didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s682">But anyway, my husband went early, by himself, to the States.</span> <span id="s683">I think that I told you the story when we went for our visas?</span> <span id="s684">And when we came to the States, he had cousins there whom he had never known.</span> <span id="s685">They picked us up and put us in a room.</span> <span id="s686">“See how you do!”</span> <span id="s687">Did I ever tell you when my husband first went by subway, alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: You know the subway in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: You had to put five cents in.</span> <span id="s692">He put it in and when he went out he put another five cents in.</span> <span id="s693">It was hard for him at that time to make his living.</span> <span id="s694">It happened a few times until someone went wit him and saw that and told him.</span> <span id="s695">He was alone.</span> <span id="s696">His family didn’t care much.</span> <span id="s697">His aunt died and his uncle died and his cousins didn’t care much.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: This tape is about to run out, so I am stopping this one.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">This is a continuation of the second interview with Mrs. Lydia May on July 11, 1978.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: I was working, after the war, in a factory.</span> <span id="s701">You know I told you that my father had said that one has to learn everything, of a business.</span> <span id="s702">So I worked in a big factory.</span> <span id="s703">We were working there.</span> <span id="s704">One day they came in and said, “The Jews have to,” the owner was Jewish, “go out.”</span> <span id="s705">They put another one (an owner) in.</span> <span id="s706">My son-in-law had a business there in Frankfurt, the same as he has here, iron and metal (scrap).</span> <span id="s707">He had a good business there.</span> <span id="s708">One day they brought a Nazi in and, “Out!”</span> <span id="s709">They had to all go out.</span> <span id="s710">They put (the Nazi) in and he (the son-in-law) didn’t get a penny.</span> <span id="s711">But now he gets something.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Then how did you live, if you had to leave your job and your son-in-law was ousted from his business?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: And my husband was helping him then, with bookkeeping and such.</span> <span id="s714">His father was in it and his brother was in it and he also had employees.</span> <span id="s715">He had a good business.</span> <span id="s716">They just put somebody in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: What year was that, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: 1934 or ’35, it must have been.</span> <span id="s719">They threw all the Jews out of the stores and the factories and put their men in regardless of whether they knew the business or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: How did you live if your income was cut off?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: As I said, it was a very hard time for us.</span> <span id="s722">I tried to make some money, my daughter was working a little and we had some money which they didn’t take, but you couldn’t take it out (of the country).</span> <span id="s723">What we did was that we went to Switzerland during the Nazi (times), before we left.</span> <span id="s724">Oh, how I love Switzerland.</span> <span id="s725">There was somebody already from Frankfurt, he was a doctor, he was already there and we got money through him.</span> <span id="s726">Later on they sent us some.</span> <span id="s727">When we first went out we couldn’t take any.</span> <span id="s728">We just could pay for our trip.</span> <span id="s729">What I said he (the son-in-law) had family in London, an uncle and an aunt and (some family) in Amsterdam and in The Hague, so we could live there for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: Was there any particular incident that made you decide to leave?</span> <span id="s731">Was there any one thing that happened that made you say to yourself, “It is time to leave!”</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: I think that I told you (about the incident) with my granddaughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: Throwing the rock at her?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: My husband left.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: No, I am talking about, was there any one thing which made your husband decide that it was time to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: That one thing I told you about.</span> <span id="s737">They threw the stone at the carriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: But your husband had already gone at that time, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: My husband was gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s741">What I am asking is, when your husband left, was there something that made him decide, at that moment, that it was the right time to leave, rather than to stay on and see what would happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: I told you the story about the maid, not the one we used to have (during WWI), it was an older one.</span> <span id="s743">Only older ones could come (to work for Jews).</span> <span id="s744">She went downstairs with the baby in the carriage.</span> <span id="s745">She was waiting for us in front of the house -- we wanted to go to the park -- and someone threw a stone at that carriage!</span> <span id="s746">So he said, “I have to go.</span> <span id="s747">I don’t want to live in a place where they will kill my granddaughter.”</span> <span id="s748">She was lucky that she was not killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Was that Renate?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: Yes, Renate.</span> <span id="s751">She was a baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: I thought that happened after your husband had already come to the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: No!</span> <span id="s754">That was the reason why he left before us.</span> <span id="s755">He had only an affidavit for himself and he said, “Right away, I go!”</span> <span id="s756">It was hard for him in New York.</span> <span id="s757">He was in his fifties, I think something like 57 (years old).</span> <span id="s758">It was good that he had that talent that he could paint and then talent to make shelves and to make everything they needed for the studio.</span> <span id="s759">You know they paid $12?</span> <span id="s760">The greenhorns, they said.</span> <span id="s761">You know that?</span> <span id="s762">Twelve dollars a week!</span> <span id="s763">And with the overtime he could let us come.</span> <span id="s764">They helped him.</span> <span id="s765">They made out affidavits for us.</span> <span id="s766">Because there were four of us, that was a lot.</span> <span id="s767">Especially for the kid who had to go to school and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: Now, who gave your husband the affidavit?</span> <span id="s769">Who signed for him?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: An uncle, who died.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: In New York City?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Yes, he never knew him.</span> <span id="s773">No, he never knew him.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: That was arranged by letter?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A; Yes, by letters.</span> <span id="s776">Accidentally someone said, “There is a man,” I forgot the name, “living in New York.</span> <span id="s777">Maybe you write to him.”</span> <span id="s778">And he wrote to him, maybe he did not understand fully, but he sent an affidavit for him only.</span> <span id="s779">He (this uncle) died and when he came (to the States) the aunt died.</span> <span id="s780">And then there were only cousins left and they didn’t care much.</span> <span id="s781">They picked him up at the boat and put him in a room to see how he would do.</span> <span id="s782">He had to pay everything.</span> <span id="s783">So it was good that he could pay, that he had enough money.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: How did he find a job?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: He went into the town.</span> <span id="s786">They told him to go around and show what he could do.</span> <span id="s787">He made a few pictures to show them, and they ordered, every week, so and so many pictures.</span> <span id="s788">Day and night he was painting, and when he came there (the store where he had been selling his pictures) one day, it was closed, the store.</span> <span id="s789">He lost a few hundred dollars.</span> <span id="s790">Then somebody, in that same apartment (where he had a room) was working in that studio.</span> <span id="s791">She said, “Maybe we go there and maybe they have a job.”</span> <span id="s792">He got that job.</span> <span id="s793">That was OK for him alone, and with that overtime he could work (for us to come).</span> <span id="s794">He didn’t have an apartment at first, he just had a room with a German family.</span> <span id="s795">And that is where it happened with that elevator man.</span> <span id="s796">It was a house with an elevator.</span> <span id="s797">And he told him that he wanted him to join the Nazi party.</span> <span id="s798">That is, the elevator man.</span> <span id="s799">Can you imagine how that was?</span> <span id="s800">Everything they thought about?</span> <span id="s801">I think that they saw some old stories.</span> <span id="s802">What they did in earlier years against each other!</span> <span id="s803">I think in that book here, “Are We Nazis?”</span> <span id="s804">Did you read it?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: No, you showed it last time.</span> <span id="s806">Yes, I do want to read it.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: It is very interesting what is in that book.</span> <span id="s808">How the characters act and everything, which it describes there.</span> <span id="s809">Everybody says that he is nothing, that he did nothing, that he acted only on orders, orders from higher up.</span> <span id="s810">Well, they couldn’t (simply) say, “No, we won’t do that.”</span> <span id="s811">They would kill them.</span> <span id="s812">And children, children, they went to school and they heard something the parents said, and they went to the teacher.</span> <span id="s813">They told the teacher, and the teacher reported it to the (Nazi) party.</span> <span id="s814">First they told them that and if they don’t stop that, you have what would happen!</span> <span id="s815">They acted that way not against Jews alone, but, of course, specifically to Jews.</span> <span id="s816">The brother of my son-in-law was in a camp, in Buchenwald, of which I am certain you have heard.</span> <span id="s817">And my mother was in Auschwitz, Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s818">I didn’t say it last time.</span> <span id="s819">I recalled it later.</span> <span id="s820">There a lot of them died.</span> <span id="s821">I didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s822">The rabbi came back and said, “This is from our home town.”</span> <span id="s823">He saw my mother and it was the same with my aunt.</span> <span id="s824">It is horrible when you read that, what they did.</span> <span id="s825">It is impossible!</span> <span id="s826">How can men do such things to other human beings?</span> <span id="s827">They can have no character, no scruples, nothing!</span> <span id="s828">They must be sadists, or I don’t know what the name is for them.</span> <span id="s829">That Hitler, how he forced people to come to his side.</span> <span id="s830">Well, he had associates, too, such as Goebbels and Goering and Hess.</span> <span id="s831">Hess is still living.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: Did you ever see Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: He went through Frankfurt with all the hands raised.</span> <span id="s836">And we didn’t do that, when he went through the streets in the cars.</span> <span id="s837">I saw him and I saw Goebbels also, next door to us, as I told you.</span> <span id="s838">His foot was not OK.</span> <span id="s839">I think that they were both terrible and Goering, too.</span> <span id="s840">Goering had a brother in Frankfurt who was a dentist.</span> <span id="s841">You would think that he could do something.</span> <span id="s842">They were afraid.</span> <span id="s843">Every Nazi said that he had a Jewish friend.</span> <span id="s844">You know that they didn’t want to let me go out?</span> <span id="s845">Did I ever tell you that?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: No.</span> <span id="s847">Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s848">Who signed your affidavit?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: The people where my husband was working.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: For you and your son-in-law and daughter and granddaughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: The baby.</span> <span id="s852">They didn’t want to let me out.</span> <span id="s853">I had to go to the Gestapo or something like that.</span> <span id="s854">Those were the fellows in the black uniforms, and the brown were the Nazis.</span> <span id="s855">(Actually, the black uniforms were for the “elite” Schutz Staffel, i.e. the “protective staff” and the brown were the “run of the mill” SA or Schutz Abteilung, i.e. the “protective divisions.”)</span> <span id="s856">They made me come to the headquarters and they asked me question.</span> <span id="s857">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s858">I don’t remember anymore what they asked.</span> <span id="s859">They didn’t let me out and my son-in-law had a friend, a Nazi friend.</span> <span id="s860">He destroyed the papers from my story so that they would let me out.</span> <span id="s861">They didn’t know what I did so they let me go -- we had to pay him.</span> <span id="s862">Still, they exchanged letters.</span> <span id="s863">Every year at Christmas he sent something very nice -- and books and articles and food and things.</span> <span id="s864">And my daughter sent him some also.</span> <span id="s865">Still.</span> <span id="s866">And I have one friend left, a Catholic friend, a lady.</span> <span id="s867">We write to each other.</span> <span id="s868">The Catholics were better to us, but they were under pressure.</span> <span id="s869">They couldn’t do what they wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: What city did you sail from?</span> <span id="s871">You said that you first went into Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: First to Holland.</span> <span id="s873">We were in Holland for a few weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: With your aunt and uncle?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: No, with my son-in-law’s aunt and uncle.</span> <span id="s876">I had no one in Holland and no one in England.</span> <span id="s877">We were a small family.</span> <span id="s878">I told you that my mother’s brother was killed in Germany and the others, daughter, son-in-law and another daughter took their lives.</span> <span id="s879">My doctor was living across the street from them.</span> <span id="s880">He sent his family to London and he killed himself.</span> <span id="s881">They took all his patients away -- they weren’t allowed any longer to go to him And it was all the same.</span> <span id="s882">The affidavits were for the family but not for him.</span> <span id="s883">He killed himself.</span> <span id="s884">Many did that!</span> <span id="s885">Rather than fall into the hands of that killer, or whatever you want to call him.</span> <span id="s886">My family did that!</span> <span id="s887">I had a couple in Wiesbaden -- did you hear about that?</span> <span id="s888">That is a very nice resort, hot springs, for rheumatism and such diseases.</span> <span id="s889">It was very good.</span> <span id="s890">Close to Frankfurt there was another such cure place, Bad Nauheim.</span> <span id="s891">Frankfurt was nice, but now it is so dirty.</span> <span id="s892">Friends of ours went there.</span> <span id="s893">I never would go -- I couldn’t stomach it, I tell you.</span> <span id="s894">My daughter was there once, my son-in-law didn’t go there.</span> <span id="s895">We didn’t want to see the people there.</span> <span id="s896">To think that everybody says, ‘Oh, here are the Jews.”</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: You never have been back to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: You don’t want to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A; No.</span> <span id="s901">Once we went to Switzerland, once we went to Italy and here, in the States, we make many trips.</span> <span id="s902">But, no, I honestly don’t want to see them.</span> <span id="s903">You never know what they think.</span> <span id="s904">And that maid which we had, we wrote to each other, also.</span> <span id="s905">She was no Nazi.</span> <span id="s906">I am sure that she was not.</span> <span id="s907">But they forced the people to join the party.</span> <span id="s908">The children were happy with the uniforms, and going around and singing, they didn’t understand.</span> <span id="s909">They went with them.</span> <span id="s910">A uniform is something which the children like.</span> <span id="s911">It was hard for us to start in New York.</span> <span id="s912">I made homework (needlework).</span> <span id="s913">You know what they pay, a piece of homework?</span> <span id="s914">They pay little.</span> <span id="s915">Every time that you think, and I am very handy also, embroidery and sweaters.</span> <span id="s916">My daughter also.</span> <span id="s917">My daughter went into a factory.</span> <span id="s918">She learned to make hats with straw and such.</span> <span id="s919">We worked together, little things which they wanted, lapels and such.</span> <span id="s920">We went into different factories and we got work to do.</span> <span id="s921">But they paid terrible.</span> <span id="s922">Once it was in the summer, it was hot, I was working at home, the water was running.</span> <span id="s923">We had no air conditioning so the people left the doors open so that they circulation of air.</span> <span id="s924">But you can’t do that now.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Well not any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: But I remember, in Germany, in Baden.</span> <span id="s927">My sister-in-law and family were living there.</span> <span id="s928">We went there visiting and they had the doors open also.</span> <span id="s929">That was before Hitler.</span> <span id="s930">They wouldn’t dare to do that today.</span> <span id="s931">People were much better, I think, until Hitler came and brought those ideas to the people.</span> <span id="s932">We had anti-Semitism before, also, under the Kaiser, too.</span> <span id="s933">You know that we used to say that we wished we had our old anti-Semitism, when Hitler was there.</span> <span id="s934">It was much better.</span> <span id="s935">They were against (the Jews) inside, but they didn’t show it so much.</span> <span id="s936">They didn’t do anything to us.</span> <span id="s937">I remember the Kaiser, he was in Frankfurt, too.</span> <span id="s938">I saw him.</span> <span id="s939">Wilhelm.</span> <span id="s940">But that Hitler, what he did, that is impossible.</span> <span id="s941">But I think that that was all in the old books, in the old history.</span> <span id="s942">People who were not educated, not conscience and so on.</span> <span id="s943">They did what was done in earlier years to the people.</span> <span id="s944">Don’t you really think so?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: I think so, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: They pressed it into the people.</span> <span id="s947">Everybody was afraid and when you went into a store, a store which had that sign (about not wanting Jews to enter).</span> <span id="s948">When we were in the train, that was the last train, when we left Germany for a while and we sat in a compartment and one came in, a blond young man, and started to talk to us.</span> <span id="s949">“Isn’t it awful, what happened in Dusseldorf?</span> <span id="s950">They destroyed all the stores and in Frankfurt.”</span> <span id="s951">You know, they went into every store owned by the Jews and threw the merchandise out.</span> <span id="s952">You know, glasses like here at Elder-Beerman, such stores.</span> <span id="s953">They threw everything out.</span> <span id="s954">We did not answer.</span> <span id="s955">If we had answered he would have taken us.</span> <span id="s956">We didn’t say a word.</span> <span id="s957">He wanted us to say something.</span> <span id="s958">He went with us to the frontier.</span> <span id="s959">There is a no-man’s land between Holland and Germany and when we went out of the train, he was there.</span> <span id="s960">By the way, at the border they took my son-in-law out.</span> <span id="s961">They were looking in the compartment, under the seats and everything.</span> <span id="s962">Both of us had a fur coat, my daughter and I.</span> <span id="s963">The agent who was checking asked, “What do you do with two fur coats?”</span> <span id="s964">I said, “we are two ladies, we need it.”</span> <span id="s965">They took my son-in-law out and he had to take everything off.</span> <span id="s966">They were looking to see if he had anything on him.</span> <span id="s967">He hardly came back, we were afraid (that he would miss it), the train was almost going when he came back.</span> <span id="s968">And when we went out of the train in that no-man’s land, the young man was standing there, looking at us.</span> <span id="s969">The same man!</span> <span id="s970">In every train they had somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: You went to Amsterdam?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: We went to Amsterdam and then The Hague.</span> <span id="s973">The Hague is beautiful.</span> <span id="s974">The tulips!</span> <span id="s975">Fields full of tulips!</span> <span id="s976">And the windmills -- that looks beautiful.</span> <span id="s977">And clean.</span> <span id="s978">The canals, that is where the water is, the windmills go into the water.</span> <span id="s979">The people.</span> <span id="s980">Every house, every apartment, has a special door from outside, not like here where you have two doors.</span> <span id="s981">Then they have their beautiful garden houses.</span> <span id="s982">They had the windows open so that you can see, even in the evening, through the whole house.</span> <span id="s983">They had that in Germany also, with greenhouses, but it is beautiful in Holland.</span> <span id="s984">Holland is very dangerous now, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: Then from The Hague you went to London?</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: And how long were you in London?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: About two weeks, something like that.</span> <span id="s989">Then from Southampton we went to the boat.</span> <span id="s990">I think that I told you that my brother-in-law came from Calais on the same boat.</span> <span id="s991">We hadn’t known that.</span> <span id="s992">My son-in-law was seasick from the beginning to the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: How many days did it take to cross?</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: I think almost one week.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q; Was it an American ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: Yes, an American one.</span> <span id="s997">I believe that the name was Washington.</span> <span id="s998">We were booked for it and we had to wait until it came to Southampton.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: Were there a lot of German Jews on this ship making their escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: Yes, there were lots of them.</span> <span id="s1001">Some came from Calais and some came from England.</span> <span id="s1002">(It is believed that the French harbor which was used was Le Havre rather than Calais since the harbor at Calais is very small, only being used by ferries, etc. and is hard to reach from Paris).</span> <span id="s1003">It was very nice.</span> <span id="s1004">It worked very well.</span> <span id="s1005">The boat was beautiful and we had our luggage downstairs.</span> <span id="s1006">Everybody was seasick except me and the little girl.</span> <span id="s1007">I took her with me and then she got sick downstairs because of the rough water.</span> <span id="s1008">I had my troubles, that I wouldn’t also become sick, but I made it.</span> <span id="s1009">And my son-in-law was laying down on the chair on deck all the time.</span> <span id="s1010">I was lucky that I could take care of the little girl.</span> <span id="s1011">That was something.</span> <span id="s1012">We had something to talk about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: It is now 20 minutes to 4:00.</span> <span id="s1014">Let us stop and I will come back next week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: Next week?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: Third interview with Mrs. May.</span> <span id="s1018">I am in her apartment on Daytona Parkway on Tuesday afternoon, July 18, 1978.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Mrs. May, you indicated in one of the other interviews that you did not have to wear the star.</span> <span id="s1020">At least that is what I recall, that before you left Germany you did not have to wear the yellow star.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: No, that came later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: That did not come until later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: My mother had to wear it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: After you had already left?</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: Yes, we had left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: Had the decree been issued that all men had to sign their names as Abraham and all women had to sign as Sarah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: We had already left before that came.</span> <span id="s1028">I know people here now, they came from there, and they had the Judah or whatever names they had been given.</span> <span id="s1029">I didn’t remember that women were to be called Sarah.</span> <span id="s1030">No, that did not come while we were there.</span> <span id="s1031">We left earlier, but we left just in the last minute, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: I am not clear about this.</span> <span id="s1033">Did you intend to bring your mother to the States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: Sure, we tried.</span> <span id="s1035">We sent an affidavit.</span> <span id="s1036">My husband used the people he was working with.</span> <span id="s1037">They gave him the affidavit and we sent it to her.</span> <span id="s1038">Then they didn’t let them out unless they had a low number and she did not know and she had a high number, when she heard about it, so that she couldn’t make it.</span> <span id="s1039">Some people could make it, but not many!</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: Was she living with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: She was living with me until we left.</span> <span id="s1042">I called a cousin somewhere else, close by.</span> <span id="s1043">Her husband was a doctor, the chief doctor of a hospital there.</span> <span id="s1044">The name was Niedermendick.</span> <span id="s1045">And she had no children.</span> <span id="s1046">She was a cousin, the daughter of the sister of my mother.</span> <span id="s1047">We told her to come and to stay with my mother.</span> <span id="s1048">She came and she said that in the same night they had wanted to arrest my son-in-law.</span> <span id="s1049">Just when we left.</span> <span id="s1050">We knew that that would come.</span> <span id="s1051">She was there (with my mother) until she was to go to a home, a Jewish home.</span> <span id="s1052">There were two new Jewish homes and she was in one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: In Frankfurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: In Frankfurt, yes, and her sister-in-law, my aunt, was in the other one, on the same street.</span> <span id="s1055">One thing I must say, we had a maid who went to visit her and we had some family who were still there who went to visit her.</span> <span id="s1056">Suddenly they took the whole home -- all of them -- to the camp.</span> <span id="s1057">I think to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1058">It was, or possibly Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1059">My family never told me exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s1060">They heard it from a rabbi who came back to Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s1061">The rabbi then came to New York City.</span> <span id="s1062">They heard from him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: After the war, or during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: When they took the people to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: No, what I am asking is, you did not receive the news from the rabbi until after the war.</span> <span id="s1066">Or was it before that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s1068">I think it was after the war.</span> <span id="s1069">He came to New York City and they knew that he was from Frankfurt and they asked him.</span> <span id="s1070">They called him up.</span> <span id="s1071">He told them what happened to my mother.</span> <span id="s1072">He came out.</span> <span id="s1073">My family didn’t tell me.</span> <span id="s1074">I never asked.</span> <span id="s1075">Now, I know what happened when they came to the camps.</span> <span id="s1076">She was over 80.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: Another question I neglected to ask is, in the 1930’s when you were in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s1078">Is Frankfurt a predominately Catholic or Protestant area?</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: Mostly Protestant, but many Catholics also.</span> <span id="s1080">We had friends -- I am still corresponding with a gentile friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: Among your gentile friends, were most of them Catholics or Protestant?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A; Most of them Catholic but some Protestant also.</span> <span id="s1083">I even had two friends who were Evangelical.</span> <span id="s1084">There is one family to whom we still write.</span> <span id="s1085">She is still living and there are children.</span> <span id="s1086">Her youngest child was the age of my granddaughter.</span> <span id="s1087">They were really friends of the Jews.</span> <span id="s1088">Now she is also in a Catholic home.</span> <span id="s1089">We write to each other.</span> <span id="s1090">I had a letter last weekend from her.</span> <span id="s1091">We send her many packages of food and dresses.</span> <span id="s1092">She says that she has four daughters and one son.</span> <span id="s1093">It was very rare that they could find something.</span> <span id="s1094">She always signs herself as “Your thankful Maria Bertoldt.”</span> <span id="s1095">That is her name.</span> <span id="s1096">Suddenly then, after a few years, she wrote that now they can have everything and we shouldn’t send any more.</span> <span id="s1097">So we send her still on Christmas, money.</span> <span id="s1098">Her children, I think that they are well off.</span> <span id="s1099">One is a teacher, a principal in a school close to Frankfurt, and the girls are married also and have children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Tape two begins here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">In the home (where she now resides) there are only 20 people.</span> <span id="s1102">She was a very good Catholic lady, always.</span> <span id="s1103">But our maid was Catholic, and she was as if she belonged to the family.</span> <span id="s1104">She died two years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: Did you think that the Catholics were kinder, more generous, than the Protestants, or could you make no such differentiation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: The Catholics were more friendly to the Jews, that is for sure.</span> <span id="s1107">With the other, you always felt that it is not so genuine.</span> <span id="s1108">The Catholic people were much better and still I think that they are.</span> <span id="s1109">The Pope also did something, but it still is no help with such questions as Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: Some sort of official position or statement from the top is what you missed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A; He is a little bit for Israel in the fact that he says that Israel has to exist, or something like that -- he doesn’t say anything against it.</span> <span id="s1112">I cannot understand that because I was thinking very highly of the Catholic people.</span> <span id="s1113">Even our maid took me once in a while to the cathedral.</span> <span id="s1114">She went every Sunday, every holiday and sometimes in the morning for services.</span> <span id="s1115">So I saw what is going on.</span> <span id="s1116">I can’t understand the Pope.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: During the 1930’s did you attend, from the time Hitler came to power -- he came to power in 1933 -- until you left in 1938, the synagogue regularly?</span> <span id="s1118">On the Sabbath?</span> <span id="s1119">Or did you become too frightened to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: Yes, too frightened.</span> <span id="s1121">We couldn’t go out much.</span> <span id="s1122">They knew everybody.</span> <span id="s1123">They went into every house and they knew the Jews.</span> <span id="s1124">That was something really extraordinary.</span> <span id="s1125">Some Jews went to live in different cities and they found them also.</span> <span id="s1126">They thought that they could hide but they couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1127">We didn’t leave Frankfurt but we knew that they knew us and they were watching us to see what we were doing and everything.</span> <span id="s1128">They were watching and they had so many people who told them things.</span> <span id="s1129">How they got them all, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1130">I think that they were frightened!</span> <span id="s1131">They were frightened because if they didn’t do what they wanted them to do, they put them into the camp or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: Another question I wanted to ask was about the disposal of property.</span> <span id="s1133">When you left your home, I know that you said that, for example, your son-in-law’s business was taken over and that your husband lost his business.</span> <span id="s1134">What happened to your home when you left in 1938?</span> <span id="s1135">Did you just lock up and walk out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: We just walked out.</span> <span id="s1137">What we could take along we took, such as dresses and wardrobes.</span> <span id="s1138">We couldn’t take most things.</span> <span id="s1139">They even came in for the jewelry.</span> <span id="s1140">My mother had to give the jewelry up.</span> <span id="s1141">They gave her a few pennies for it.</span> <span id="s1142">They took everything.</span> <span id="s1143">I told you that they took the books and burned them.</span> <span id="s1144">They took the paintings.</span> <span id="s1145">They took everything which was valuable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: When you walked out of your apartment or home, did you lock the door?</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: My mother was still there.</span> <span id="s1148">I told you that we called my cousin who stayed a few days with her until she could go to that home.</span> <span id="s1149">She was still there.</span> <span id="s1150">We couldn’t take her because we didn’t have enough affidavits.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: And then do you know what happened to your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A; No, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1153">She couldn’t write.</span> <span id="s1154">You couldn’t write anymore.</span> <span id="s1155">They opened every letter.</span> <span id="s1156">When we got a letter from her it was opened.</span> <span id="s1157">And it was also when we wrote to her.</span> <span id="s1158">You couldn’t write anything what you had in your mind and you wanted to ask.</span> <span id="s1159">We did not want to endanger her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: After Hitler came to power, he very quickly established concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: Yes, as I told you, they picked up the men, they brought them in a big hall and from there they were sent somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: So you were aware of those concentration camps in the 1930’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: Sure, sure we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: When did you become aware of the death camps?</span> <span id="s1165">After the war, or did you receive news during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: That they killed the people?</span> <span id="s1167">We knew it, but they always said no, no.</span> <span id="s1168">We don’t do that.</span> <span id="s1169">We just want them to be together there and to be taken care of, if they were taken sick.</span> <span id="s1170">We didn’t know what happened!</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: But you suspected that they were being killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: We suspected nothing good.</span> <span id="s1173">That is for sure.</span> <span id="s1174">Because we were afraid that my son-in-law would be arrested, as I told you.</span> <span id="s1175">In the night when they came to get him, he was out.</span> <span id="s1176">People told us that.</span> <span id="s1177">So no man was there.</span> <span id="s1178">Later on they took the women.</span> <span id="s1179">I told you that they took them out of the old age home and there were only women there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: And after you got to New York, then all ties with Germany were cut?</span> <span id="s1181">There was no way that you kept up with relatives or friends?</span> <span id="s1182">For example, refugees coming into New York, let us say in 1939 and 1940, before the United States was in the war.</span> <span id="s1183">Did you contact them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: No, when we saw someone in the street we talked to them, especially in Manhattan.</span> <span id="s1185">Most of them were in Manhattan.</span> <span id="s1186">Sometimes we would go to Broadway.</span> <span id="s1187">We went to the park next to the river there.</span> <span id="s1188">They were talking German and we talked a little to them.</span> <span id="s1189">They came from other places, not just from Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s1190">I remember that we had a house in the suburbs but we could walk from there.</span> <span id="s1191">Across the street was a family with 20 children.</span> <span id="s1192">Two wives were sisters.</span> <span id="s1193">One died and the other sister, I met in the street.</span> <span id="s1194">I said, “How do you come with all the children?”</span> <span id="s1195">But I didn’t meet them anymore.</span> <span id="s1196">Sometimes there were people from other cities in Germany.</span> <span id="s1197">Later on, after one or two years, we met other people, Germans.</span> <span id="s1198">Women came together.</span> <span id="s1199">Husbands were working.</span> <span id="s1200">They couldn’t do much.</span> <span id="s1201">We came together during the week.</span> <span id="s1202">Everybody was worried about their families there, what happened to them.</span> <span id="s1203">Anyhow, we couldn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s1204">I said that they opened the letters.</span> <span id="s1205">Every letter which we got had been opened and every letter my mother got, also.</span> <span id="s1206">When we send a package we tried to send such things as food sometimes.</span> <span id="s1207">Food was very scarce at that time.</span> <span id="s1208">You never know whether she would get it or not.</span> <span id="s1209">They had nothing and that is why they took everything from the Jews.</span> <span id="s1210">I think that was one of the reasons.</span> <span id="s1211">After the last war, 1918, my husband was in the war.</span> <span id="s1212">During World War II, he was here.</span> <span id="s1213">It was hard for us to get settled in New York.</span> <span id="s1214">First my husband had a room and I was in a room with him.</span> <span id="s1215">And my daughter and her husband and the child, they had a little apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: In the same building?</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: Not in the same building but we were very close; we could walk to each other’s places.</span> <span id="s1218">My son-in-law started with Fuller Brush.</span> <span id="s1219">Then he said to me that he met some friend from Germany who worked in his line.</span> <span id="s1220">And they had a convention there and this friend said to him, “I know somebody who is looking for a refugee.</span> <span id="s1221">I recommend you.”</span> <span id="s1222">He did that and so my son-in-law came to Dayton and he got that job.</span> <span id="s1223">I don’t remember what year that was.</span> <span id="s1224">They were here a few years before us.</span> <span id="s1225">And then he said, “I can do that for myself.”</span> <span id="s1226">He started his own business.</span> <span id="s1227">They (his old firm) got an new owner so he decided to start for himself.</span> <span id="s1228">And it started very slowly and he made a go of it.</span> <span id="s1229">The iron and metal, as he learned in New York, is different from what it is in Germany.</span> <span id="s1230">He was working here to learn it.</span> <span id="s1231">Fuller Brush was not just (his line) .</span> <span id="s1232">We were not idle either.</span> <span id="s1233">My daughter and I did do homework.</span> <span id="s1234">And my husband earned the most.</span> <span id="s1235">With the overtime he worked he earned $12.00 I think I told you that.</span> <span id="s1236">And when my daughter moved to Dayton we visited each other once in a while.</span> <span id="s1237">But after a few years, I think they were here already for eight years, she wrote, ‘Why don’t you come to Dayton?”</span> <span id="s1238">She started in an apartment here also.</span> <span id="s1239">No one was helping her.</span> <span id="s1240">That was something, too.</span> <span id="s1241">She was a stranger here.</span> <span id="s1242">My son-in-law had been a stranger here also.</span> <span id="s1243">He had a room until they found an apartment and until the furniture came.</span> <span id="s1244">They (my daughter and granddaughter) came here later.</span> <span id="s1245">When she saw that no one was helping her, she went to the (Jewish) community here and said, “If someone is coming and I can help, I will help them.”</span> <span id="s1246">And she went to the train when they called her that this one or that one is coming.</span> <span id="s1247">She went to the train, she was looking for a room, a job for these people.</span> <span id="s1248">Some were tailors, some were electricians.</span> <span id="s1249">And there is a family here, you have no idea how much she helped them.</span> <span id="s1250">They didn’t know a word of English.</span> <span id="s1251">I think that they came from the Polish frontier, the one with Germany.</span> <span id="s1252">They are now very well off.</span> <span id="s1253">He is a skilled worker.</span> <span id="s1254">He works here for the Muelers.</span> <span id="s1255">Do you know the Muelers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: Still, she went with him when he was ordered somewhere to work to translate what he has to do.</span> <span id="s1258">She said, ‘because I had no help.</span> <span id="s1259">I want to help others.”</span> <span id="s1260">She does that still.</span> <span id="s1261">She is working so much and sometimes I worry about it.</span> <span id="s1262">This morning she was already in the synagogue helping.</span> <span id="s1263">She is in organizations to help, not only for Jewish people -- we have an organization which helps the hospitals.</span> <span id="s1264">Did I tell you that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: The Order of True Sisters -- that includes some gentiles in it.</span> <span id="s1267">Last week they had a meeting, a board meeting.</span> <span id="s1268">They said that there are two children here who are very sick.</span> <span id="s1269">The parents are on welfare.</span> <span id="s1270">The children cannot walk anymore.</span> <span id="s1271">One is three and one is five, from different parents.</span> <span id="s1272">They need wheelchairs.</span> <span id="s1273">Do you know how much a wheelchair is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: No, but I think it would be very expensive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: $800,00!</span> <span id="s1276">One for each child!</span> <span id="s1277">What did they do?</span> <span id="s1278">They did buy the two wheelchairs, that organization.</span> <span id="s1279">People who were there said, “I give $70.00, $100.00” and so on to get the wheelchairs.</span> <span id="s1280">This is not for Jewish people who get the chairs.</span> <span id="s1281">They give machines to hospitals and everything.</span> <span id="s1282">It is a wonderful organization.</span> <span id="s1283">I think that I have here something.</span> <span id="s1284">They made a trip beginning of August to Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s1285">They meet the organization from Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s1286">They go by bus.</span> <span id="s1287">I may go, but I am not so certain.</span> <span id="s1288">It is long from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p. m.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: I think that they will stay in a hotel and have something like a convention.</span> <span id="s1291">My daughter wrote a skit for that, with singing.</span> <span id="s1292">And they have some ladies who sing and speak about this organization.</span> <span id="s1293">It is something like a jubilee.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">Q: You say that gentiles are members of this organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: Some, yes, and some are converted.</span> <span id="s1296">We had a president who is converted.</span> <span id="s1297">She was terrific, terrific.</span> <span id="s1298">They have a thrift shop on Salem Avenue from the True Sisters.</span> <span id="s1299">She started it and they made money and give the money to the hospitals.</span> <span id="s1300">They give all the checks.</span> <span id="s1301">Sometimes the doctors come or the nurses or such and give the checks to them for the hospitals.</span> <span id="s1302">They gave a check to the rescue squad.</span> <span id="s1303">The meeting will be in a motel.</span> <span id="s1304">We have a new president now, since May.</span> <span id="s1305">I don’t think that I will go since I didn’t make my reservations yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: Did Mrs. Appel speak very good English when she arrived in the States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: She speaks very good English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: No, I don’t mean now.</span> <span id="s1309">I mean when she arrived in the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: She did too.</span> <span id="s1311">We took it, both of us.</span> <span id="s1312">She took lessons also, in Germany already.</span> <span id="s1313">They had an English teacher, she and her husband.</span> <span id="s1314">Any my husband had a teacher who was not too good.</span> <span id="s1315">He never spoke very well.</span> <span id="s1316">I don’t speak very well either, by the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: You do fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: I have an accent.</span> <span id="s1319">An accent of which I cannot get rid.</span> <span id="s1320">Some people have even worse.</span> <span id="s1321">But my granddaughter, she was born over there but she came here as a baby.</span> <span id="s1322">Does she also have an accent?</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: Not at all.</span> <span id="s1324">How long was it from the time you got off the boat in New York before you began to work?</span> <span id="s1325">Making the sewing at home, which you told me you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: Yes, we heard from other people (that was a way to earn money) so we went to the factories downtown and asked if they had some work.</span> <span id="s1327">They gave us the material.</span> <span id="s1328">We had to carry it home.</span> <span id="s1329">We had to work very hard on it.</span> <span id="s1330">I don’t know how many pennies we got for piece work.</span> <span id="s1331">I don’t know anymore but it was not much.</span> <span id="s1332">We did some of anything you can think of since we were all very handy in needlework and such.</span> <span id="s1333">My daughter, anyhow, she inherited it from my husband.</span> <span id="s1334">He was very handy.</span> <span id="s1335">I also made very may things.</span> <span id="s1336">Sometimes we were sitting and knitting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: Approximately how many years did you work in New York doing the sewing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: I came there in 1938 and I am here 30 years now.</span> <span id="s1339">I was 10 years in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: But how long did you work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: During the last years I didn’t work anymore.</span> <span id="s1342">My husband made better money.</span> <span id="s1343">We was even working here.</span> <span id="s1344">Do you know Sucher (Meat Packing House), Beerman was the owner.</span> <span id="s1345">He did a lot for the refugees, here.</span> <span id="s1346">And they had a meat slaughterhouse and a meat- packinghouse.</span> <span id="s1347">It was on Riverview somewhere.</span> <span id="s1348">My husband was a watchman there.</span> <span id="s1349">And when they came with the bulls that was not so easy.</span> <span id="s1350">He was working sometimes in the night.</span> <span id="s1351">That was dangerous.</span> <span id="s1352">What he went through here!</span> <span id="s1353">Then he was working part-time.</span> <span id="s1354">Then he was retired.</span> <span id="s1355">When my son-in-law started his own business, that was good then.</span> <span id="s1356">He said that he had to learn first.</span> <span id="s1357">He went here to Duberstein.</span> <span id="s1358">Duberstein was the one who hired him to work there.</span> <span id="s1359">So he learned it anew and after several years, I don’t know how many, he opened his own yard.</span> <span id="s1360">He has this business for a very long time already.</span> <span id="s1361">Then he took his son-in-law in the business and his son is in it also.</span> <span id="s1362">My grandson was studying to be a dentist, here.</span> <span id="s1363">And when it came to go to dental school they didn’t take him.</span> <span id="s1364">That too was restricted.</span> <span id="s1365">So many took Jews and so many didn’t.</span> <span id="s1366">So he stopped and started ion his father’s business.</span> <span id="s1367">What could he do?</span> <span id="s1368">He liked it.</span> <span id="s1369">He was in Ohio State and he was in Cincinnati and then he had to go to a special school and they didn’t take him.</span> <span id="s1370">It is different now.</span> <span id="s1371">Renate, my granddaughter’s (children), the oldest is going to take his bar (examination) next year but he was already in court as an assistant lawyer.</span> <span id="s1372">This is different now, they can’t do that (discriminate) anymore.</span> <span id="s1373">When you want to enter somewhere you have to write down your religion and all, you don’t have that anymore, in the applications.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: You said, in the beginning, that you considered yourself German and that you weren’t aware of much anti-Semitism before the 1930’s</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">A: No, not much.</span> <span id="s1376">What we said was that the Kaiser was a little bit, but it was not directed mainly against us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: Are you aware of very much anti-Semitism in the United States?</span> <span id="s1378">What I am asking you to do is to compare the United States with Germany.</span> <span id="s1379">The Germany before Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A: No, absolutely not here!</span> <span id="s1381">No.</span> <span id="s1382">Nobody is that here.</span> <span id="s1383">Only I was suspicious.</span> <span id="s1384">What I heard, I told you, with the elevator man of that house, when that Nazi was there and wanted to turn them in.</span> <span id="s1385">But they told me that -- that he is working for the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1386">I (personally) did not find that here, not in New York either.</span> <span id="s1387">I told you that I have friends here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">Q: But do you have this suspicion of all gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q: I have heard other Jews say that they always have a feeling that they are always on their guard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">A: Yes, a little bit.</span> <span id="s1392">As long, as I said, the government is not against (the Jews) I am not suspicious.</span> <span id="s1393">But anyhow, sometimes when I see somebody (who acts) I think, “Do they like us or don’t they?</span> <span id="s1394">Do they know I am a Jew, or don’t they?”</span> <span id="s1395">I will say it when they ask me.</span> <span id="s1396">I don’t know if I told you about my neighbor.</span> <span id="s1397">She move in two years ago and we were talking, when she had been here long.</span> <span id="s1398">She was sitting here and I was sitting here.</span> <span id="s1399">She asked me, “To which church do you belong?”</span> <span id="s1400">I said that I don’t belong to a church, I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s1401">I belong to a synagogue.</span> <span id="s1402">Something is in them, I think.</span> <span id="s1403">Why did she ask me what church I belong?</span> <span id="s1404">Somebody told me that she wants to convert me.</span> <span id="s1405">The same happened in New York.</span> <span id="s1406">A lady who I got to know, she had a grandchild like my granddaughter, the same age.</span> <span id="s1407">We started talking.</span> <span id="s1408">We were out for a walk.</span> <span id="s1409">She was the widow of a Presbyterian minister.</span> <span id="s1410">We were talking about everything.</span> <span id="s1411">She said, “You know, one day I take you to the Presbyterian church.”</span> <span id="s1412">And her son-in-law was a Presbyterian minister, too.</span> <span id="s1413">They moved from New York to a little town, not far from New York, and she invited me sometimes there.</span> <span id="s1414">She wanted to take me to the Presbyterian Church always.</span> <span id="s1415">She said, “You know that we have a few people who used to be Jewish and who converted.’</span> <span id="s1416">That was a wonderful lady.</span> <span id="s1417">We wrote letters to each other later on, until she died.</span> <span id="s1418">You know I had always something else to do.</span> <span id="s1419">When you talk to each other, it suddenly comes out.</span> <span id="s1420">She wanted me to be a Presbyterian because she thought that the others are already converted.</span> <span id="s1421">She took me to the church, she took me to the Baptist church, but she couldn’t convert me.</span> <span id="s1422">That is something it varies from being a lovely lady.</span> <span id="s1423">What I said was that the other’s husband was too (a minister).</span> <span id="s1424">I was there visiting.</span> <span id="s1425">She invited me and everything when we came together.</span> <span id="s1426">That just makes me suspicious, when I talk to somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: Yes, I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: When you hear that…</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Q: This tape is running out.</span> <span id="s1430">I am going to stop it and put in a new one.</span> <span id="s1431">Did you want to ask me why I converted?</span> <span id="s1432">I am not a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: No, I know that you are a Protestant.</span> <span id="s1434">What was your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: My father was a Disciples of Christ minister, a Protestant.</span> <span id="s1436">And I converted to Catholicism.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">A: Yes, why did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: Oh, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1439">I think that there were a lot factors.</span> <span id="s1440">For one thing, the Protestant denomination that I was a member of had a liberal wing and a conservative wing.</span> <span id="s1441">They couldn’t agree and I got rather disturbed at one time about the divisiveness within that denomination and I began to study Catholicism and it sounded very logical to me and logically right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A: There is something in common with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">Q: Oh, there is a great deal in common, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">A: I always thought that, when I came to the church and so on.</span> <span id="s1445">Sure we don’t kneel, but anyhow they cover the head, don’t they?</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: They use to, but not any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: Yes, and your wife is Catholic also?</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1449">She grew up an Episcopalian and she converted to Catholicism about the time we got married.</span> <span id="s1450">But our prayer form is much the same.</span> <span id="s1451">We pay a lot of attention to the Old Testament and Psalms and the Prophets.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">A: That is it.</span> <span id="s1453">I think Catholicism is better than the others.</span> <span id="s1454">They have the Old Testament also?</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: Not only the New one.</span> <span id="s1457">They study that also.</span> <span id="s1458">That is what I think, whether I am right or not.</span> <span id="s1459">I tell my friend here that the Jews never talk about religion.</span> <span id="s1460">Sometimes they tempt me.</span> <span id="s1461">I was invited to a Jewish wedding one time and they had Jewish friends, some of whom converted.</span> <span id="s1462">They were studying and found a Jewish wife and she converted.</span> <span id="s1463">She studied to be a minister and she converted to the other religion.</span> <span id="s1464">That happens like that.</span> <span id="s1465">I think that they converted to the Jewish faith when they married.</span> <span id="s1466">But I don’t know if that’s so right.</span> <span id="s1467">We can’t say anything.</span> <span id="s1468">We can say, “As long as you have unmarried children you don’t know what they will bring home.”</span> <span id="s1469">What can we do?</span> <span id="s1470">If they are happy, then good!</span> <span id="s1471">It is the right wife, O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">Q: Do you, in comparing life in the United States with life in Germany prior to the coming to power of Hitler, would you say that there is more advancement here for Jews, more opportunities?</span> <span id="s1473">What I am driving at, what lurks behind this question is, do you think that the European culture and the European society offered more to a person or do you think that the United States offers more?</span> <span id="s1474">It is frequently said that the United States is the land of golden opportunity.</span> <span id="s1475">Do you believe that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">A: When we came to New York we were surprised.</span> <span id="s1477">Everything was longer and everything was bigger.</span> <span id="s1478">Yes, it was different, much different.</span> <span id="s1479">Everything; it is the thinking of the people and the acting of the people -- the life.</span> <span id="s1480">When you talk to someone who was born here and so on.</span> <span id="s1481">Where I come from, we said that the people are stiff.</span> <span id="s1482">When they were in a Coffee Restaurant, which you don’t have here, maybe there were 50 tables.</span> <span id="s1483">Everybody was sitting at separate tables.</span> <span id="s1484">Here they come to you to have a seat, or something.</span> <span id="s1485">That was not (the case) where I come from.</span> <span id="s1486">Not because we were Jews.</span> <span id="s1487">When they came in they didn’t know who you are.</span> <span id="s1488">But they were a little isolated, especially where I come from.</span> <span id="s1489">Elsewhere it was, at times, better.</span> <span id="s1490">In the Rhineland, they are much better.</span> <span id="s1491">We came together, like here also, in the Rhineland.</span> <span id="s1492">But mainly here we came together with other people from Germany, until we got acquainted.</span> <span id="s1493">Especially here where there are not so many people from Germany.</span> <span id="s1494">I had German friends, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">Q: As far as associations are concerned, sisterhoods and religious associations and civic associations and organizations, would you say that there are more here in the United States than, let us say, in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">A: Yes, I am much more active with these things than other people.</span> <span id="s1497">For instance we helped the people when the pogroms took place in Poland.</span> <span id="s1498">We sent packages and boxes, big boxes and everything.</span> <span id="s1499">I didn’t do so much.</span> <span id="s1500">They had their organizations, so they were helping each other.</span> <span id="s1501">But you didn’t help other people so much as they do here.</span> <span id="s1502">If you saw in the paper that someone is very much in need then they write what this one sent and this one also.</span> <span id="s1503">That never happened in Germany.</span> <span id="s1504">I think that here they are much more good hearted.</span> <span id="s1505">They didn’t care as much as they do here.</span> <span id="s1506">That is something which puzzles me.</span> <span id="s1507">It is wonderful when you read that somebody is very needy, that fire broke out and he has nothing, they take him in with his family.</span> <span id="s1508">They didn’t do that in Germany, they didn’t care.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">Q: Do you think very much of your former life before the war?</span> <span id="s1510">Or do you not think very much about it?</span> <span id="s1511">I know that you are thinking about it now because I am asking you questions and I have been for three weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: Yes, it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1513">Frankfurt is a wonderful city.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">Q: Do you remember it?</span> <span id="s1515">Do you think about it a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: No, not much.</span> <span id="s1517">I don’t want to.</span> <span id="s1518">I want to take it out.</span> <span id="s1519">Sometimes it comes to me but in the main I don’t like it.</span> <span id="s1520">I don’t want to see the people anymore.</span> <span id="s1521">I wonder that people can go.</span> <span id="s1522">I told you that somebody was there in Frankfurt and found it so dirty.</span> <span id="s1523">It used to be such a clean city.</span> <span id="s1524">It used to be beautiful.</span> <span id="s1525">There used to be little parks all around the city, all around, but now they are built up.</span> <span id="s1526">You could go from one park into another park.</span> <span id="s1527">You could sit there and could enjoy yourself.</span> <span id="s1528">Have coffee or no coffee, whatever you wanted to do.</span> <span id="s1529">The children had playgrounds.</span> <span id="s1530">They have it in New York, too, by the way.</span> <span id="s1531">I went often with my granddaughter to the playground, when she was a little girl.</span> <span id="s1532">I went with her once to the park on the East side, where the blacks were living.</span> <span id="s1533">Nobody was there.</span> <span id="s1534">I went with her alone.</span> <span id="s1535">She was two or three years old.</span> <span id="s1536">We could walk in that park and enjoy it.</span> <span id="s1537">They had plenty of benches and on the playground she was playing with everybody.</span> <span id="s1538">That is what we didn’t have in Germany.</span> <span id="s1539">That is wonderful that they take care of that.</span> <span id="s1540">Swimming pools and so on we had no outside swimming pools.</span> <span id="s1541">There was some you could go inside, from the city.</span> <span id="s1542">I went there every day.</span> <span id="s1543">I went swimming every day.</span> <span id="s1544">I don’t do that anymore.</span> <span id="s1545">I loved it.</span> <span id="s1546">I did it in the beginning in New York, also.</span> <span id="s1547">In New York we went to the ocean, my husband and I. Every weekend we went there when the weather was good.</span> <span id="s1548">We walked up Broadway, 50 blocks or more.</span> <span id="s1549">I always say that Main Street here is as long as Broadway.</span> <span id="s1550">What is the song?</span> <span id="s1551">The wide Broadway?</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">Q: The great white way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1554">And you could find your way so easily.</span> <span id="s1555">I was in New York for one week when I took the subway downtown.</span> <span id="s1556">I went to Brooklyn and I had two sister-in-laws there.</span> <span id="s1557">They never went alone, they always had to go with someone, they were afraid.</span> <span id="s1558">I found my way so easily because the left is East and right is West and when you went with the subway it brought you everywhere.</span> <span id="s1559">You could read that it goes here and goes there and where to change.</span> <span id="s1560">It was so easy for me.</span> <span id="s1561">Maybe I was there for a week when I went to the store.</span> <span id="s1562">I think I told you that when I went to the store and they started speaking German to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Q: Yes, and you told them to speak English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">Q: Of all your experiences in your long life and the wisdom that comes to you with your many years -- this is a tough question -- what would you choose to pass on to future generations?</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">A: To my family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">Q: Yes, to your family, that us, to future generations of your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">A: Do things exactly as they are here.</span> <span id="s1569">As I said, in Germany before Hitler, it was not such an open society.</span> <span id="s1570">I mean that you had friends, but other people were isolated.</span> <span id="s1571">When you had friends, you had gentile friends.</span> <span id="s1572">My husband and a couple, they had one son the age of my daughter.</span> <span id="s1573">They were gentile friends and every Sunday we were together, They lived in kind of a suburb but you could go, like here, on the bus.</span> <span id="s1574">We did everything every week together.</span> <span id="s1575">We were very good friends!</span> <span id="s1576">We could talk everything over.</span> <span id="s1577">Hitler forbade that.</span> <span id="s1578">Everything was forbidden, yes.</span> <span id="s1579">They couldn’t come anymore to see us.</span> <span id="s1580">So my daughter had friends also who came, but it was a risk.</span> <span id="s1581">It was a risk!</span> <span id="s1582">If someone would have seen it, or would have said it, they would have taken them away.</span> <span id="s1583">That was something, when they put signs in every store and every factory to throw the (Jewish) people out.</span> <span id="s1584">They knew everyone who was Jewish!</span> <span id="s1585">Whether the owner was Jewish or the people and the workers were, they were very well informed.</span> <span id="s1586">They knew everything!</span> <span id="s1587">They had us because they threatened, “If you don’t do that, we take you out, we take you away.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Q: Back in the 1930’s, after Hitler came to power, let us say in 1933, 34, 35, when he would make these speeches over the radio, when Hitler made his long and very famous radio speeches, would people talk to you about the speeches?</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s1590">Sometimes they did.</span> <span id="s1591">You know we had a radio and when he was speaking on the radio and after he was finished, they were playing something, a dance or something.</span> <span id="s1592">You know he put them in the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">Q: No, I never heard that story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">A: They put the people from the radio station in the camps.</span> <span id="s1595">They were not allowed to play music.</span> <span id="s1596">They had to talk about things like his speech.</span> <span id="s1597">I will never forget that.</span> <span id="s1598">They had all the radios and we were not allowed to have individual headsets (so you could hear what you wanted) so that they could hear what is going on.</span> <span id="s1599">You were not allowed to have a radio, or anything.</span> <span id="s1600">At that time they had no television.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">Q: But in the streets during the next day for example, Hitler would make a speech in the evening and the next day you go out on the street.</span> <span id="s1602">Would people comment to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: Oh sure.</span> <span id="s1604">Of course they did.</span> <span id="s1605">I told you that when the milkman came and said, “Are you Jewish then it would be better if you go out.”</span> <span id="s1606">My mother came and said that all the synagogues were burning.</span> <span id="s1607">They told us that.</span> <span id="s1608">They were afraid.</span> <span id="s1609">That is what it was.</span> <span id="s1610">They were afraid that somebody sees them or somebody hears them.</span> <span id="s1611">Then we had rationing cards and when we had no friends who had paper or something extra at that time, I lost a lot of weight because the food was for the (entire) family.</span> <span id="s1612">Sometimes I got something extra but not much.</span> <span id="s1613">It was not so easy to go into a store anyhow because of the signs, “Jews not wanted.’</span> <span id="s1614">Such signs!</span> <span id="s1615">Sometimes the people in the store damaged it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">Q: After you came to the United States and were living in New York I know life was very hard.</span> <span id="s1617">I know all of you were working but did you ever go through a period of not having, so to say, the bare necessities, enough to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Q: Were you ever hungry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">A: No, we always could but -- maybe we didn’t buy the best -- but anyway we had (enough) to eat.</span> <span id="s1621">Things were very cheap, everything.</span> <span id="s1622">We didn’t make much money but we helped each other.</span> <span id="s1623">I was in a family where we first had a room, in a German-Jewish family.</span> <span id="s1624">We helped each other.</span> <span id="s1625">You know exactly what we went through.</span> <span id="s1626">It was very hard for my husband.</span> <span id="s1627">When he came he hardly could speak English.</span> <span id="s1628">The teacher was not very good and her came from a little village where they didn’t learn it.</span> <span id="s1629">The schools were not like that (everywhere).</span> <span id="s1630">I was in a city where we had to learn it (English).</span> <span id="s1631">They made us.</span> <span id="s1632">We didn’t think that we were going to need it.</span> <span id="s1633">I think that I told you when my husband said that our daughter should go -- before Hitler -- she should go to the States because she had a girl friend there.</span> <span id="s1634">We didn’t let her, my mother and I.</span> <span id="s1635">We said why should we let that girl go alone?</span> <span id="s1636">I believe that it would have been better.</span> <span id="s1637">But then?</span> <span id="s1638">Many times we said if we don’t have money, we don’t go out!</span> <span id="s1639">They could have gone out.</span> <span id="s1640">They could have sent the men out and we could have stayed in Germany.</span> <span id="s1641">The Nazis took all the money and everything was gone, just like that.</span> <span id="s1642">It is unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1643">If we hadn’t gone through it, we wouldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1644">They knew everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">Q: Did your family, at first, believe that?</span> <span id="s1646">I have heard it said that a lot of Jewish families in Germany thought that surely this is going to end.</span> <span id="s1647">Surely it can’t get any worse.</span> <span id="s1648">And they kept putting a decision off, month after month, until finally it was too late.</span> <span id="s1649">Did your family, at first, say that surely this is going to pass?</span> <span id="s1650">Or were you certain, from the very beginning, that it was going to get worse?</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">A: No, not in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1652">I will tell you what gave us the idea, when we heard that they started to take the men.</span> <span id="s1653">Then my husband, as I said, he got that address from a brother.</span> <span id="s1654">The brother knew that (address of the uncle in New York) and he gave it to him and he asked for an affidavit, for him alone.</span> <span id="s1655">So he said, “I have to go, before they kill my granddaughter, I go.’</span> <span id="s1656">At that age, it was not so easy.</span> <span id="s1657">He had something here, under the arm.</span> <span id="s1658">It was nothing serious but they first didn’t want to let him out.</span> <span id="s1659">Strangely enough it started bleeding while he was on the ship.</span> <span id="s1660">Nobody was helping him on the boat.</span> <span id="s1661">Usually they have doctors there.</span> <span id="s1662">When he came to the States the cousins picked him up and put him in that room.</span> <span id="s1663">They didn’t care anymore!</span> <span id="s1664">And when I was there my husband’s brother-in-law, the sister’s husband, he had no affidavit and I went to them and said that they should give me one for my mother and for the uncle.</span> <span id="s1665">They said no, we have brothers so we can’t do that.</span> <span id="s1666">We have to bring them out first.</span> <span id="s1667">They were well enough off.</span> <span id="s1668">They had a jewelry store in the Waldorf Astoria.</span> <span id="s1669">What can you do when they have such ideas?</span> <span id="s1670">When I came to London I knew people from Frankfurt and I met them after I made an appointment and I asked them if they could help me bring my mother out, and my brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s1671">They said that they had family to bring out first.</span> <span id="s1672">You can’t blame them, can you?</span> <span id="s1673">They wanted too much money anyhow for the affidavits (RF: Affidavits did not cost more than the nominal fee to execute them and sign them before a Notary Public, but they were sworn statements that the recipient would not become a financial burden on the state or the Federal government and had to include a copy, at least a partial copy, of the previous year’s income tax, and that, often, was the rub.”</span> <span id="s1674">And especially for my little granddaughter at that time, because she needed an education.</span> <span id="s1675">She needed to go to school, etc. and she wasn’t going to earn any money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">Q: How much did you end up having to pay for affidavits, do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1678">Thousands of dollars.</span> <span id="s1679">I don’t know how much.</span> <span id="s1680">We didn’t pay, they paid.</span> <span id="s1681">They didn’t pay it, they wrote that they would come up with so much if something is happening.</span> <span id="s1682">That could amount to a lot but they didn’t have to come up with the money.</span> <span id="s1683">I know that my husband went to a relative he never knew on West End Avenue (in Manhattan) and the wife didn’t even let him talk to him.</span> <span id="s1684">She said oh, he is not able to let you in, or something like that.</span> <span id="s1685">No, it was very hard for him to obtain affidavits for us.</span> <span id="s1686">Finally his boss gave him the affidavit for my mother.</span> <span id="s1687">He didn’t make so much money which they owed.</span> <span id="s1688">You had to have so much money, you had to earn so and so a month.</span> <span id="s1689">I don’t know exactly how much was needed.</span> <span id="s1690">That was hard, it was very hard for us to get affidavits.</span> <span id="s1691">When you came to New York and you saw the stores, with the vegetables, the fruit and so on.</span> <span id="s1692">They had it outside the stores.</span> <span id="s1693">That was something we couldn’t believe.</span> <span id="s1694">We didn’t have that in the last years in Germany.</span> <span id="s1695">Food had become very scarce.</span> <span id="s1696">And, I will never forget, my daughter went downtown -- she had saved a little money -- and she bought a dress for my granddaughter for 25 cents.</span> <span id="s1697">My granddaughter with a dress for 25 cents!</span> <span id="s1698">You can’t imagine that.</span> <span id="s1699">She bought it in a big store in Manhattan, Klein’s on 14th Street.</span> <span id="s1700">You have to find that out when you are a stranger in the city.</span> <span id="s1701">I went out about these stores.</span> <span id="s1702">In Brooklyn, they had Abraham &amp; Strauss and in the Bronx, they had Alexander’s, a big department store, which is cheap.</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">Q: Now let me ask you another question that may be a little tough to answer.</span> <span id="s1704">Do you feel that your views toward religion have been changed at all by your experiences in Germany?</span> <span id="s1705">Do you feel that you are the same, that your beliefs are the same, that your religious practices are the same today as they were in the 1920’s?</span> <span id="s1706">Do you feel that you are less interested in religion or more?</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">A: Better.</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">Q: More?</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">A: More.</span> <span id="s1710">I don’t deny that we are Jews.</span> <span id="s1711">I tell it to anyone who is interested.</span> <span id="s1712">I go more often to the synagogue than ever.</span> <span id="s1713">My parents were working so they couldn’t go so often.</span> <span id="s1714">My father took my daughter often on Friday night and Saturday or holy days -- then I was helping my mother in the store.</span> <span id="s1715">After a few more years we had more time.</span> <span id="s1716">I think about it more anyhow and I like it in every synagogue.</span> <span id="s1717">I have been in every one (in Dayton).</span> <span id="s1718">I think our synagogue is all right.</span> <span id="s1719">We were Conservative in Germany also and so we are here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">Q: I am going to stop this tape, but there is one more thing on which I want your opinion.</span> <span id="s1721">If you could tell that there was any change in religious beliefs or practices since I have heard other people say that the Holocaust was such a terrible experience that God forgot them and they turned away from religion.</span> <span id="s1722">Did you at all ever feel that way because of your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">A: No.</span> <span id="s1724">No.</span> <span id="s1725">No.</span> <span id="s1726">We didn’t.</span> <span id="s1727">We know that it was forced on the people.</span> <span id="s1728">Many of them didn’t want to do it but they felt that they had to.</span> <span id="s1729">We didn’t have a claim against our religion for what happened.</span> <span id="s1730">It was done by man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">End of Interview.</span></p></body></html>
