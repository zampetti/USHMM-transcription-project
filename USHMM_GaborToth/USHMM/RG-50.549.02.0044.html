id="s19">It’s a little bit warm, so we have the windows open, in case you hear a little bit of traffic outside, or kids playing, or whatever.</span> <span id="s20">A lot of kids playing on the streets around here.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Sorry, couldn’t predict the weather.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: That’s okay, no problem.</span> <span id="s23">Let me just have you say your name, and where we are today.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: My name is Fela Warschau.</span> <span id="s25">I live in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, on 2407 North 12th Street, and the day is June 11th, 1999.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: A very sunny Friday.</span> <span id="s27">You’ve already done two very comprehensive, very eloquent, actually, interviews for the Holocaust Museum --</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: -- on -- on video.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Yes, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: So, in our interview today, we’re not going to go over as much of your wartime experiences, as you have in those videos, those are --</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: -- pretty complete.</span> <span id="s34">So -- But what we want to do today is talk about what’s been happening to you since the war.</span> <span id="s35">And I’m just trying to think of a good place to pick up.</span> <span id="s36">You’ve told the story of the day of liberation --</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: -- and you were in Bergen-Belsen --</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: -- concentration camp.</span> <span id="s41">And, you know, one question I had, which you didn’t talk about specifically in these interviews, is the final days of the war, the conditions in the camp were just deplorable.</span> <span id="s42">And you and your sister --</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: -- and two friends --</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: -- were keeping yourselves alive with one potato.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Yes, but we also came -- we came to Bergen-Belsen, having a li -- a portion of bread from Hamburg, from a -- from a so-called labor camp.</span> <span id="s48">But this labor camp was a sub-camp of Neuengamme.</span> <span id="s49">And it -- Neuengamme was an extermination camp, everybody knows that, but somehow we got transported to Bergen-Belsen, with this piece of bread yet.</span> <span id="s50">So we ate first this bread, and then this potato, but it was just impossible to -- you know, we were losing our strength, and could barely walk.</span> <span id="s51">So, it is true that we stayed alive with one potato, I don’t know by what miracle we did stay alive, but like I said, to the end, we couldn’t walk any more.</span> <span id="s52">Went in in the barrack to lay down, and to die.</span> <span id="s53">This is when liberation came.</span> <span id="s54">I was really also sick with typhoid fever, but I had sort of the walking around typhoid fever.</span> <span id="s55">I wasn’t that severe, my sister was.</span> <span id="s56">She had to be taken away to a hospital, and she was very, very ill.</span> <span id="s57">When -- When she got well, I could hardly recognize her.</span> <span id="s58">She looked worse than the people that were dead in the camp.</span> <span id="s59">But somehow, you see, we survived, and we didn’t find anyone of our family.</span> <span id="s60">It was very heartbreaking, and at this point it seems pointless to live.</span> <span id="s61">There was nothing to go on for.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: On the -- On the -- the actual day of liberation, as you talked about in your video interviews, you had actually, I guess, gone into the barracks, and y-you --</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Gave up.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: You were going to die?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s66">Yes, we did.</span> <span id="s67">And one of my friends, she -- she wanted to -- to just walk out, and sort of a last farewell look at the camp, and came back and told us that was funny things going on out there.</span> <span id="s68">I just said, “Forget it.</span> <span id="s69">You hallucinating,” you know.</span> <span id="s70">“Let me die in peace.”</span> <span id="s71">She kept on nudging, and my sister went out.</span> <span id="s72">I don’t know where my sister got the strength to come back and grab me by my arm, and tell me, “Get up, you have to see what -- what is out there.”</span> <span id="s73">It was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s74">I just didn’t think I was alive.</span> <span id="s75">No, it was impossible.</span> <span id="s76">I thought I died.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Did you think it was some sort of dream?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Yes, sort of like I was watching, you know, this isn’t really happening to me.</span> <span id="s79">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s80">But it was real enough, and we were liberated by the English army.</span> <span id="s81">It was heartbreaking though, that so many people, those living pe -- skeletons that couldn’t walk any more, you know, getting bread, and couldn’t make use of it any more, because that too late for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: You know?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: The -- The question I had about all this, because you have talked about this in -- at some length in your other interviews, is if the British hadn’t come right then, if an allied --</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: -- military force had not arrived somewhere in that period --</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: -- to liberate the camp, do you have any notion how much longer you might have lived?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Maybe a day or two.</span> <span id="s90">Because maybe I wouldn’t be starved to that point of dying, but I completely gave up, because I thought there was no other way.</span> <span id="s91">There’s nothing left.</span> <span id="s92">Sooner or later, we all will be dead.</span> <span id="s93">This is the end of it.</span> <span id="s94">So, just giving up on everything.</span> <span id="s95">No food, no water, nothing.</span> <span id="s96">Nowhere to turn.</span> <span id="s97">There -- There -- Outside the barbed wire, there was kohlrabi -- I probably mentioned that too, the piles kohlrabi that were decomposed, that people there still risking their lives to get one of those squash things, a smelly things to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: What are those?</span> <span id="s99">Kohlrabi, what -- what is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: It’s like -- What can I say?</span> <span id="s101">It’s a thing that you used to feed animals.</span> <span id="s102">And I know it was -- in Europe it’s called kohlrabi, I don’t know how to translate this into English, up to this day, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s103">But that’s supposed to have been the people’s food.</span> <span id="s104">It was warm in April, you know.</span> <span id="s105">The sun was beating down on that.</span> <span id="s106">The kohlrabi was decomposed.</span> <span id="s107">People were risking their lives, actually, trying to get one, and they were shot.</span> <span id="s108">They were shot to death, almost on the minute of liberation, because they were so desperate to get this.</span> <span id="s109">But I was never one of the brave, to go and risk like that.</span> <span id="s110">I was a very timid girl, and I -- I would say the honest truth, my sister was the organizer.</span> <span id="s111">If it wouldn’t be for her, maybe I wouldn’t be alive, because she worked in a different place, where she had more access to food.</span> <span id="s112">And she always used to smuggle into the camp, some of it for me, which was a great help.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: After all that you had been through for all those years --</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: -- and all that happened to you, why is it at this particular time -- you say you had given up?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Why do you think it was at this particular time that -- that you started to feel that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: You mean, after I was liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: No, just before.</span> <span id="s120">You said you had, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Because I could see that there was no hel -- no help coming from nowhere.</span> <span id="s122">Nothing.</span> <span id="s123">Where do we go?</span> <span id="s124">Surrounded by barbed wire and dead corpses.</span> <span id="s125">And you walked around, and -- and people were just dying right in front of you.</span> <span id="s126">What was waiting for us?</span> <span id="s127">The same thing, you know?</span> <span id="s128">So it’s just -- you might as well, sooner or later, because there’s no other way.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: But you had -- didn’t you have indications that the Germans were losing the war at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Oh yes, we know that.</span> <span id="s131">We know they were losing the war, especially when I was in Hamburg, then we were still working there on the streets, you know?</span> <span id="s132">Th-The fliers, the Allied fliers, they were coming three, four, five times a day, and we worked there.</span> <span id="s133">Like it says in my interview, next to a radar station, we could hear that radar turning and beeping, and the sirens going on.</span> <span id="s134">They were here.</span> <span id="s135">We could -- We could hear the bombs flying, and everything.</span> <span id="s136">And the city of Hamburg was one rubble on top of the other.</span> <span id="s137">That’s the way it looked.</span> <span id="s138">So we knew no -- no country in condition -- in condition like that could win a war.</span> <span id="s139">It was impossible for them.</span> <span id="s140">But the question was, are we -- are we -- will we be able to live -- to be -- survive this?</span> <span id="s141">That was the question.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Did you talk much with your sister or your other friends there about how the war was going, and -- and how long you thought it would be before it ended, before it was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: We really did not.</span> <span id="s144">It -- We were so absorbed in trying, first to survive from day to day.</span> <span id="s145">We did not see a tomorrow.</span> <span id="s146">That’s what it was, just trying to survive every day as it came.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: So things like what was happening in Hamburg with the bombings, and the --</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: -- other things you saw, they were sort of -- you would see them, but it was almost like that was kind of the -- the background --</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Yes, it --</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: -- to just staying alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: -- it wasn’t touching us, just this is it, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s154">This may sound like a silly question, but how long can four people make one potato last?</span> <span id="s155">You --</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Would you --</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: You talk about this one potato.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Would you believe that?</span> <span id="s159">We made it last almost three or four days, just eating -- you could look through that slice when we were eating.</span> <span id="s160">I don’t know w-what kept us going.</span> <span id="s161">I honestly don’t know.</span> <span id="s162">People say, oh, you were destined.</span> <span id="s163">God was watching over you, that you should survive and be able to tell that story.</span> <span id="s164">I really don’t know what forces kept us alive.</span> <span id="s165">It’s just impossible to tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Before you started eating it, how big was the potato?</span> <span id="s167">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Well, I would say it was quite a nice size, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: You’re showing about four or five inches there.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: I would say --</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: -- something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Oh, okay, so, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: How she found it, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s175">I say it was a miracle.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s177">It must have taken a lot of willpower not to eat more of it, at once.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Yes, it did, but it seems like we were always the ones that had this willpower.</span> <span id="s179">When we went to work, we got our portion of bread in the morning, some people ate it right away, they were so hungry.</span> <span id="s180">We were also the same way hungry, but my sister and I, my friends, we never ate the whole portion, we always divided it, because I wanted to have the reassurance that I have something to eat for later.</span> <span id="s181">We knew nothing else was coming.</span> <span id="s182">St -- On the -- On the bowshtella we -- we never got anything unless we worked -- one time -- you worked for a couple weeks in a village across the Elba.</span> <span id="s183">The village was called Kronst, and we were loading bricks on a boat.</span> <span id="s184">But that was also -- you had to be lucky to be picked for this.</span> <span id="s185">You see, we were fighting -- everybody was fighting to go to the village, because the local people brought food for us, and there was more to eat, so it was a great big fight in the morning to get first in line, to be picked for this place.</span> <span id="s186">We were always divided in different working groups.</span> <span id="s187">Most of the time, a majority of the time, I was in Hamburg, cleaning the streets.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Before liberation, at the end, you -- you talked about, in your video interview, how the -- there were, you know, still, of course, you know, German guards there, but they were wearing surrender armbands, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Tho-Those were not German guards any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Those were -- They’re volunteer militias from the Ukraine, Lithuane, and Hungary, and they -- they had white armbands, we could see that.</span> <span id="s192">And those people were still shooting at us, when the people tried to get those kohlrabi, you know?</span> <span id="s193">I can’t understand their logic, and their way of thinking.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: In those final days, were there still any sort of selections going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: That had stopped?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Chaos.</span> <span id="s198">It was nothing.</span> <span id="s199">Not where we were.</span> <span id="s200">You see, Bergen-Belsen, were like several camps together, divided.</span> <span id="s201">That much I know, because if -- we were with others, but not -- I didn’t even know that children survived there, in certain places.</span> <span id="s202">We di -- We didn’t know that, because we were not together with these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: So in the end it really wasn’t -- the killing that was going on in the camp was not the -- the organized systematic killing, but it --</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: -- but things were still happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: I-It -- Things were happening, and they didn’t have to do anything.</span> <span id="s207">People were just dying, because they didn’t feed -- s -- the people that were there previously, they probably weren’t fed for the longest time already.</span> <span id="s208">So, that was just like -- they were self-destructing, they didn’t have to do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: When the British came into the camp, and one of your friends came in and told you to take a look, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: -- you started to see these scenes, and you weren’t sure if you were dreaming, or if it was real, again you’ve talked about all that in your video interview.</span> <span id="s212">Do you remember your first contact with any of the -- the British soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Not -- Well, we -- they ge -- they handed out food.</span> <span id="s214">This is all I ru -- I remember, being close in contact.</span> <span id="s215">I also watched them later, right away film that liberation.</span> <span id="s216">They were putting it on film.</span> <span id="s217">And I know there is a video of it, it’s called liberation of Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s218">This is exactly what they did, right away.</span> <span id="s219">And next thing I know, when we were sort of already settled, and they came in -- I don’t know, they must have been Scotchmen, or whatever, they came in with their bagpipes and skirts, you know.</span> <span id="s220">And I was sitting on -- on the curb, and I looked up, and that’s the first time I’ve seen a man dressed like that, in a skirt, and I just laughed so hard, I could hardly catch my breath, cause I didn -- never saw anything like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Do you remember what you and your sister said to each other in the first moments, when you realized what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: We were just overwhelmed, and then my sister started feeling very sick, and we tried to get her in the hospital, but there was no hospitals there, there were just makeshift buildings, mattresses on the floors, and the people were laying just covered up with sheets.</span> <span id="s223">Not enough doctors, and do you know, the German population from around, they were forced to come into the camp and see all this.</span> <span id="s224">And the English needed help with the sick people, those nurses, the local nurses didn't even want to come in, they had to be brought in at gunpoint.</span> <span id="s225">They didn’t want to come and help the sick people.</span> <span id="s226">It took me a long time to find my sister in those buildings.</span> <span id="s227">I didn’t know where they took her.</span> <span id="s228">Finally I found her, and there she was on the floor laying and holding a -- a rag with cold water to her head, and she said, last night the doctor said to her -- he looked at her, and he said, “This woman has the crisis tonight.</span> <span id="s229">If she’s al -- If she survives, she’ll be alive tomorrow morning.”</span> <span id="s230">She said, “I didn’t sleep a whole night, I wanted to die with my eyes open.”</span> <span id="s231">Here I come in the morning, and thank God she was alive.</span> <span id="s232">Then they first started giving her medication.</span> <span id="s233">Medication was so scarce that they only gave it to people they thought would survive.</span> <span id="s234">That was the case of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: What was your sister’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Helen.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: And is she still alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Yeah, she lives in Milwaukee.</span> <span id="s239">Yeah, but she does not care to talk a lot about it.</span> <span id="s240">There’s certain people that don’t, my husband especially.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s242">Before we move on, maybe you could give us the names of your various family members --</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: My -- My --</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: -- and a little --</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: -- immediate?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Yeah, and you know, a little description of them, and just what -- what you know of what happened to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: You mean my i -- my -- like my mother and father?</span> <span id="s248">Well, my mother’s name in Yiddish was Matel.</span> <span id="s249">I don’t know how to translate it any other way, that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s250">My father’s name was Israel.</span> <span id="s251">I had two more brothers.</span> <span id="s252">One of them was called in Yiddish, Smaul Hirsch, and the other one, Yankel David.</span> <span id="s253">And we all came from the Lodz ghetto into Auschwitz, and this is what happened to them, they never got out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Out of the ghetto itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: They didn’t get out of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: No, we -- we all went with the transport from the ghetto, together we went to Auschwitz, but they never got out of there.</span> <span id="s258">They were -- My mother was with us when they were selecting the people, they just took her right to the left side.</span> <span id="s259">And my two brothers and my father, we didn’t know for sure, but then we met a gentleman that was in the ghetto, a neighbor, and he was behind them in line, and he told us that they went the wrong way, so there was no way we could find anybody any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: How about other relatives, members of your family?</span> <span id="s261">Their names, and what you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: You mean uncles and aunts?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Sure, [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: My father had one, two -- he had two brothers and two sisters.</span> <span id="s265">I don’t know exactly what happened to them, because they didn’t live in the same city, they lived in -- away from Lodz, in a small place called Alexandroff, in Pola -- in -- in Polish, and my mother had one brother, but my mother’s brother had about six or seven children, and from all of those children, two of them survived, a brother and a sister.</span> <span id="s266">But the brother died several years ago in New Jersey, he had cancer, and he died.</span> <span id="s267">His sister, I think, is still alive in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s268">I haven’t heard from her for a long time.</span> <span id="s269">And from my father’s side --</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: What -- What were their names?</span> <span id="s271">Before we go on, what -- their names were?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: My cousin’s name?</span> <span id="s273">My cousin’s name was Hill, and my cous -- her -- the lady’s name was Cela -- Celine.</span> <span id="s274">Those two survived, but there were more that did not survive.</span> <span id="s275">And from my father’s side, none of them survived, there was no sign of them.</span> <span id="s276">My grandparents -- My grandma -- My grandma was taken away, my mother’s mother, huh.</span> <span id="s277">She was really an old lady.</span> <span id="s278">It-It’s hard to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s280">You said your sister doesn’t like to speak of these things?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Not much, no.</span> <span id="s282">Mm-mm.</span> <span id="s283">She was asked several times by the generation after in -- in Milwaukee that organizes the survivors to speak in schools.</span> <span id="s284">She went a couple times, but she doesn’t care to do that, no.</span> <span id="s285">My husband wouldn’t do that, either.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: What about just privately, like when you and your sister talk, or when you see each other --</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Well, yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: -- if you talk on the phone, does it come up?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: -- we reminiscent -- reminiscent.</span> <span id="s290">I have one of my friends that we were together.</span> <span id="s291">She lives in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s292">The other one died, also several years of cancer.</span> <span id="s293">Otherwise, when I went -- you see, my two daughters, I have two daughters, they live in New York City, and when we used to go and visit in New York City, I used to get together with them, because it’s like family, you know, we were always together.</span> <span id="s294">One of them had died several years ago, she was sick.</span> <span id="s295">But this one is alive, and we are always in touch.</span> <span id="s296">As a matter of fact, we just talked on the phone about a week ago, and we always reminiscent about the old times, where we were.</span> <span id="s297">They were also in the Lodz ghetto.</span> <span id="s298">From different places, you know, he took people from all over Poland, dragging them into the -- certain ghettos from here and there, confusing us completely.</span> <span id="s299">And she was from a little town somewhere, but she spent time in the ghetto, and from there, also came to Auschwitz, so we have been in the same camp, afterwards.</span> <span id="s300">And liberated together, so we are always in touch.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: When you talk to your sister, what type of things come up?</span> <span id="s302">What -- What type of things do you talk about or remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Home.</span> <span id="s304">How it was before the war.</span> <span id="s305">About my father, my -- my brothers, what we all did.</span> <span id="s306">My mother, my grandmother.</span> <span id="s307">My grandmother had a little grocery store.</span> <span id="s308">In Europe it’s entirely different.</span> <span id="s309">It’s not like here, you know.</span> <span id="s310">I -- I don’t know how to describe, but everything was in canvas sacks, you know.</span> <span id="s311">You had a scale, and bags, and people came, and said, “Give me a half a pound.”</span> <span id="s312">So you took -- took a bag out, and took it out of the sack, and weigh it, and just give it to the people.</span> <span id="s313">But they got to get on in age, and th -- it was hard for them.</span> <span id="s314">You d -- had no people working for you, if you wanted to make a living, you had to do everything yourself.</span> <span id="s315">So they sold that little grocery store, and both came to live with us, grandpa and grandma.</span> <span id="s316">Grandpa died right before the war, about two or three years before the war, and grandma un -- when they came to live with us, she sort of took over the kitchen.</span> <span id="s317">She was used to always being busy, and my mom was very distressed about it, because my father’s workshop was sort of divided between the kitchen and his workshop.</span> <span id="s318">So she used to say, “Mom, what are you doing?</span> <span id="s319">People come up and they think I made a maid out of you.”</span> <span id="s320">And she used to say, “What am I supposed to do, sit down and die?</span> <span id="s321">Don’t be silly.”</span> <span id="s322">So my mom used to say, “Well, why don’t you let at least the girls help you with the dishes?”</span> <span id="s323">She said, “Och, let them go and play.</span> <span id="s324">When they get married, they’ll do plenty dishes.”</span> <span id="s325">So that was, you know?</span> <span id="s326">And then in wintry nights, we used to sit around in the evening, my grandpa used to tell stories about sages, and learned man, all these cert -- also certain fables, or we used to play -- of all the things we used to play in winter, Bingo, or cards we used to play, with the children, it was like a game.</span> <span id="s327">The s -- And neighbors used to come up, and have like a neighborhood klatch, you know?</span> <span id="s328">It was always -- our house was always full of company.</span> <span id="s329">People used to come, and even during the war, when they occupied, and we were still in our own apartment, my father was forced to -- to work for the Germans because he was about the only craftsman in our little place, and you had to do what they told you, you know, otherwise they shoot -- they come -- they come, my father had to repair their watches.</span> <span id="s330">They -- They brought gold pieces that they robbed all these big farm -- rich farms.</span> <span id="s331">My father had to melt them down and make bracelets, and rings, and whatnot, all that they send into Germany.</span> <span id="s332">And so we had -- we had to work for them.</span> <span id="s333">A lot of them were real bad, but there were -- there was a single one among them that would bring some bread, or whatever, which was very helpful in those times.</span> <span id="s334">But still, the neighbors -- and there was a lot of people that had no food any more, and whatever we had, people used to come up, and we had a big bench, and a table on the side, whatever we cooked, we always used to share with everybody.</span> <span id="s335">I-It’s not something that I’m trying to tell you because I won’t get a medal for it, but that’s the way it was in our house, we used to share everything we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s337">So it sounds like when you talk to your sister about the past, mostly what you talk about is your family life before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Yes, yes, a lot of times.</span> <span id="s339">Well, talking about the war brings a lot of bad memories, and a lot of heartache.</span> <span id="s340">Most of the time we try to avoid it, unless there’s something specific that comes up.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: What might that be?</span> <span id="s342">What -- What -- A certain anniversary, or something in the news?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: Oh, probably.</span> <span id="s344">Anniversary of liberation, or when we go to, in spring, you know, when they -- Yom HaShoah day comes, or whatever.</span> <span id="s345">So it’s just -- certain things come back, and reminisce -- then we reminisce in the -- those times.</span> <span id="s346">Remember when this happened, and we almost dead.</span> <span id="s347">Like I got blood poisoning working on -- on a -- they call it bowshtella, we had to dig ditches for foundations for the peop -- for homes for the people that were bombed out in Hamburg, when I was working on that place -- assigned to that job, and I hit a rusty nail, and I got blood poisoning in my hand, in my whole hand here.</span> <span id="s348">We had an infirmary, I went to this, there was a Czech woman, also prisoner.</span> <span id="s349">She just digged around and digged around and -- with nothing, and couldn’t find anything.</span> <span id="s350">At that time we had an Obersharführer who was crazy about us being healthy.</span> <span id="s351">He didn’t care about food or anything, just healthy.</span> <span id="s352">So at that time, three of us were sick, so he took the three of us, with a German SS woman, and there was one of -- always picked the altesta from our own people, and they took us into the city.</span> <span id="s353">Well, that camp was in Zazell, and they took us into the city of Hamburg.</span> <span id="s354">I -- The only thing I know, that we went into a prisoner of war camp.</span> <span id="s355">I don’t know to this day if it was French or Czech, or -- or Italian, or Czech, or whatever it was, I have no idea, because I couldn’t recognize the language.</span> <span id="s356">And this doctor, when my -- they had a doctor there, also prisoner.</span> <span id="s357">When my turn came, he looked at my finger, and he pointed, and then he pointed at the plain wooden table, pointed that I should lay down.</span> <span id="s358">Stretched out myself, and he poured from a bottle ether on my face -- just plain ether.</span> <span id="s359">I was choking, bells were ringing in my ears, and I thought I was dead.</span> <span id="s360">This is it, I’m dying, I gave up.</span> <span id="s361">But when I woke up, I was sitting already, and my finger was bandaged.</span> <span id="s362">And afterwards, they changed my bandages in camp, then I could see what it looked like, my finger was like separated in half.</span> <span id="s363">My whole nail was gone, and there was a piece, they cut off there a piece.</span> <span id="s364">But I healed ver -- very, very slowly.</span> <span id="s365">I had to go to work with all that.</span> <span id="s366">So, we had ups and downs in the camp, you know?</span> <span id="s367">There were some that cared, again, for food, but didn’t care for our welfare.</span> <span id="s368">These -- They called them the Obersharführer, that the camp, tha -- from the SS that administered the camp, and we had a few that were real vicious, too.</span> <span id="s369">We had SS women also, and they were even worse than the men.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: What -- If we could talk about what happened after liberation.</span> <span id="s371">You didn’t leave, as I understand it, you didn’t leave Bergen-Belsen immediately --</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: -- there was a period in which people stayed in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Well, you had to re-gain your strength a little bit, and because my friend found her brothers, they came to take her back to the American zone, they did talk us into going with them, thinking, oh maybe you still will find someone, you know?</span> <span id="s375">We did go.</span> <span id="s376">Of course, we had no money, no we traveled how we traveled.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Let me just ask you -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Fela Warschau.</span> <span id="s379">This is tape number one, side B. -- Bergen-Belsen immediately --</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: -- there was a period in which people stayed in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Well, you had to re-gain your strength a little bit, and because my friend found her brothers, they came to take her back to the American zone, they did talk us into going with them, thinking, oh maybe you still will find someone, you know?</span> <span id="s383">We did go.</span> <span id="s384">Of course, we had no money, no, we traveled how we traveled.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Let me just ask you, you -- you know, in the camp it was you and your sister, and -- and you mentioned these two friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Two friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Do you remember their names, and could you tell us a little bit more about --</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: -- them, and where they came from, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s391">The one that died is -- her name was Doba Finkelstein.</span> <span id="s392">The other one was -- name was Genia Stolsoft, and Genia came from a small place called Kovol, but Doba was a girl from Lodz, that much I know.</span> <span id="s393">She’s the one that died.</span> <span id="s394">And it was funny with her, because she was looking for a brother, or her cousin, and she found a man with the same last name as hers, thinking it’s a -- a relative, and to the end she married him, he wasn’t a relative.</span> <span id="s395">She didn’t even have to change her last name.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s397">And how did you all team up, how did you and your sister sort of team up with them, and become friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: How did you and your sister meet them, and how did you all become friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: We -- We met them while we were in Auschwitz standing in line, we were supposed to be forming lines of five, and we were sort of paired off with them, and from then on we kept on being together, until -- until we were going to the same camp, and by accident being put in the same barrack.</span> <span id="s401">Then we went to Zazell for work.</span> <span id="s402">So just all this -- did everything together, just supporting, looking out for one another.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: So then, one of them convinces you to go off with them.</span> <span id="s404">Where did you go, what happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: You mean, after I went to ber -- to Feldifing?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Yes, we did travel with them.</span> <span id="s408">I don’t know if it says there, on coal wagons, on freight trains we traveled, because we didn’t have any money, who get -- who gets money?</span> <span id="s409">Just they gave us some clothing, and food, of course, the English.</span> <span id="s410">We did arrive in Feldifing, it was -- the condition -- the conditions were much better there.</span> <span id="s411">I can’t say anything against the English except that the warmth wasn’t forthcoming.</span> <span id="s412">They -- A little compassion was less available for us.</span> <span id="s413">In the beginning they were shocked, you know, and very much overcome.</span> <span id="s414">But later on it seems like, you know -- but on the American zone, there was more the warmth of it.</span> <span id="s415">It was like -- you felt more that somebody cares.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: How did that -- How could you tell that difference?</span> <span id="s417">What -- What sort of incidents would happen, or things did you see that showed the difference between the two?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: They were more generous if you asked for something, or -- you could see the way they were interested, that there was more compassion forthcoming from them, where over there, it was like, very impersonal.</span> <span id="s419">That’s what it was.</span> <span id="s420">Th-They used -- the Americans MP’s used to come in into this place -- camp, because Feldifing had formed -- they told them to form their own police force, and administration, [indecipherable] infirmary, and all.</span> <span id="s421">A -- There was a vocational school there.</span> <span id="s422">So the MP’s used to come in with certain information, and they were very friendly towards everybody.</span> <span id="s423">It was -- It was really nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: In Feldifing?</span> <span id="s426">We came here in 1951.</span> <span id="s427">Actually, we started out in 1949, and never got -- first we ended up in Bremerhaven, at that time -- and by that time, I had a little baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Well let’s -- let’s sort of take this in order.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Cause again, this is stuff you haven’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Well, you’re asking me -- yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: I will.</span> <span id="s433">This is material that you haven’t talked about in your video interview.</span> <span id="s434">Let’s sort of just take it kind of chronologically.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: If you could tell us approximate, sort of were you moved, and -- and how many months you were in each place, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Well, I didn’t move, we -- we lived til 1949, in Feldifing.</span> <span id="s438">The reason we stayed there that long was because we didn’t want to go to Poland, and we didn’t want to stay in Germany, and we had no relatives any place, so we couldn’t go until organization started to sponsor survivors.</span> <span id="s439">Then we registered, okay?</span> <span id="s440">My sister came right away, and when I registered, and was ready to go, okay, we all ended up in Bremerhaven, but when it was time to go on the boat, my baby got sick.</span> <span id="s441">So they don’t let you on the boat with sick children, and because so many people were -- there was a camp in Bremerhaven -- now I forgot already where this place was called, but we stayed there.</span> <span id="s442">I’ll have to remember.</span> <span id="s443">Thinking.</span> <span id="s444">So, anyway, so many people together, and a lot of them had babies already, and a lot of children were sick with all these diseases that children get.</span> <span id="s445">And my child happened to get every disease that were possible to be there.</span> <span id="s446">I never could go on a boat.</span> <span id="s447">Every time I had to go on a boat, she was sick, you know?</span> <span id="s448">By the time I was able to, and then my visa run out, my luck was, that up to this point, the visas were renewed automatically.</span> <span id="s449">When my turn came, they said they don’t do that any more, you have to go back to the point where we came from, and this is why we ended up again being in Feldifing, going back to the whole rigamarong again, all over.</span> <span id="s450">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Before you did come over here, where did you meet your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: In Feldifing.</span> <span id="s453">Because we were also just walking around, looking for a relative, or a friend, and we didn’t find anyone.</span> <span id="s454">We didn’t find anyone, and he was also -- he was from a family of six children, he was the only one.</span> <span id="s455">So everyone looked for -- not finding a relative, everybody looked for companionship, for someone to lean on.</span> <span id="s456">It wasn’t a storybook romances, it was people needing one another, that’s what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: What was his name, and where was he from?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: My husband’s name is Antrul, and he comes from Lodz, he is originally from Lodz, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Do you remember in the camp, where you first encountered him, your first conversation, or -- how did you get to know each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Well, just meeting, just saying hi, where are you from?</span> <span id="s461">You know?</span> <span id="s462">And we lived in Feldifing, in a little room, it was down -- actually, it was called the basement.</span> <span id="s463">There were bunkbeds, and the four of us lived there.</span> <span id="s464">We were still together.</span> <span id="s465">So, my friend that was looking for Finkelstein, he used to come down there, and he used to bring some friends along, and this is where we met, there were also, like places -- you know, the Americans organized dance halls, they wanted people to have some fun.</span> <span id="s466">They also brought movies into the camp, and we had traveling survivor’s orchestras giving concerts.</span> <span id="s467">So there was like getting -- public getting together, and where are you from, asking where are you from, who are you, and this is the way people met.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: And how long was it before you and your eventual husband decided to get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: It wasn’t very long.</span> <span id="s470">Maybe several months.</span> <span id="s471">There were no long courtships at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: And you got married in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Yes, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: What kind of ceremony did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Well, first we registered with the shtandersump in Germany, in -- in th-this little place called Shtarenberg, and then we just had a religious ceren -- ceremony in a Hasidic rabbi’s study.</span> <span id="s476">We couldn’t afford anything, we had no money.</span> <span id="s477">We had witnesses, I have a ketuba, a religious one.</span> <span id="s478">I went according to -- I would be accepted in Israel now, because I went to all these ceremonies that were asked of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s480">And then, did you and your husband then get your own room in the camp, or how did that work?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: Well, that didn’t work that way, because there wasn’t enough room in the camps.</span> <span id="s482">It was like one big room, and somehow, they gave us some boards, and divide it into a wall, and on the other side another couple lived, and on this side, we lived.</span> <span id="s483">And this is the way it worked.</span> <span id="s484">You could hear every sneeze, and ya -- every word that was going on, but there was no other way, until we could figure out where we wanted to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Not much of a honeymoon, I guess, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: What -- So once you were mar -- what year did you get married in?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: ’46.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: What month, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: May.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: So May of ’46, so about a year after the war ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: And then once you were married, how long did it take you to figure out what to do next?</span> <span id="s494">What -- What discussions did you have about where you might go, and where you might pick up your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: We didn’t, because we didn’t, but my husband went and enlisted with this police force there, the displaced camp police force.</span> <span id="s496">And I went and registered into the vocational school, and I took a course in sewing.</span> <span id="s497">So, for the time being, me and my other friend, the one that died, we both took the course in sewing, and we both took on, later on, alterations for other people, for which we got -- used to get fruit, or money, or whatever, you know, to have something.</span> <span id="s498">And my husband, after awhile they used to get some German marks from the German government, like from the state where we were, Bavarian state, they used to get some German marks, because they sort of were on a pilung of a police department, or whatever they called it, after awhile.</span> <span id="s499">And in the beginning, there was no -- no talk of anything, because we still tried to figure out where are we, what do we supposed to be doing?</span> <span id="s500">Then later on, of course no one wanted to stay.</span> <span id="s501">People had relatives overseas, they sent papers for them, and this is what made us think what are -- what is going to be our future?</span> <span id="s502">What are we going to do?</span> <span id="s503">We did -- We didn’t see any way out.</span> <span id="s504">Finally, this came.</span> <span id="s505">It was just like a -- winning a lottery when we were told we could register to the united -- to go to the United States, or Canada, or Australia.</span> <span id="s506">I really thought that wasn’t true.</span> <span id="s507">I di -- I didn’t -- I always was the pessimist.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: You don’t seem pessimistic.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Ah, well.</span> <span id="s510">But I really was, in the beginning.</span> <span id="s511">My sister, she was always the first one.</span> <span id="s512">That’s why, she registered first, and she -- she just came first, right away.</span> <span id="s513">Even if I would have left in 1949, she left before me, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Did you and your husband ever talk about possibly going to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: We did in the beginning, but I don’t think I would have been very good material, because I wasn’t a strong person.</span> <span id="s516">I wanted to have a child, because everybody got killed, okay?</span> <span id="s517">So, after my daughter was born, I was three and a half months in the hospital.</span> <span id="s518">I was the one that they thought would never survive.</span> <span id="s519">I was deadly sick after she was born.</span> <span id="s520">And so, when I finally recovered, the doctor said to me, “No more children, cause you didn’t recover like other people.”</span> <span id="s521">I didn’t think I could s -- take the illegal journey, first it was Palestine, that I could take that.</span> <span id="s522">And now, finally that I got my life together, I wanted to live for something.</span> <span id="s523">And then I thought, let’s go first to the United States, where I can take a deep breath, relax, and maybe recover my strength.</span> <span id="s524">I can always go to Israel.</span> <span id="s525">But you know, once you are settled somewhere, and your children are here, it’s very hard to pick up and go again.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: What year was your first child born?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: What year was she born, your child?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: My older daughter was born in 1949, my younger daughter in 1955.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: And their names are?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: My older daughter’s name is Marta, and my younger daughter’s name is Sally.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: And you said you wanted to have children because so many people had died?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: Well, I still would want children, regardless.</span> <span id="s534">I would have had more, not only two, but I -- I even th -- with the second one, it was very hard here in the United States, and I just -- I didn’t think I would be able to do that.</span> <span id="s535">So, had to settle for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s537">But you did say earlier you wanted children --</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: -- because so many people had --</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: That’s true, too.</span> <span id="s541">That is true, too.</span> <span id="s542">But under normal circumstances, I would have want children anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s544">I understand that, I’m just curious what those thoughts were.</span> <span id="s545">What was your thinking abo -- on that subject?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: Well, Jewish thinking is always, you have to have a namesake, you have to have someone to remember.</span> <span id="s547">And children are always named after departed ones.</span> <span id="s548">So that’s -- My oldest daughter’s name, Marta’s actually Matel, it’s after my mother.</span> <span id="s549">And my Sally is after my grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: You said that when you had your children, especially your first one, it was very difficult --</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Very.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: -- you were very sick.</span> <span id="s553">I’m wondering what -- I mean, it’s always an incredibly emotional time when, you know, someone has a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: I’m wondering if there were a whole extra set of emotions because this was right after the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: So many Jews were dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: And if there were a lot of extra emotions, is -- can you describe what those were?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: They ver -- very sort of anxious emotions, because she was also sickly child, because I was not in perfect health, and I always watched her and carried her to the doctor, and I put her -- I didn’t have a bed, she slept in her buggy, or whatever.</span> <span id="s561">And I sat -- half the nights, I used to sit by that buggy and watch her, and when she moved her fingers, or moved her head, I considered, oh what a miracle, this is mine, you know, my own, no one can ever take this away from me.</span> <span id="s562">And it was -- most of the time when I looked at her, I cried.</span> <span id="s563">It was a miracle to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Did you see having children somehow, as you know, being a small part in, sort of, so many Jews had been taken from the earth, and sort of helping to bring them back?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Maybe, in a way, I would say that the Jewish people do not disappear completely, and well, just for myself, I wanted, as a parent, to have a child.</span> <span id="s566">And it was, for me, to love and to have, and we always had good -- a good relationship with our children, and still do.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: So, let’s go back to you were -- you were talking about the process of coming to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s569">So, we registered, and like I said, we were in Bremerhaven, and we had to go back.</span> <span id="s570">We had to go ba -- go -- go to the same commission.</span> <span id="s571">We had to go and have chest x-rays, and all that stuff done again, and we had to travel from Feldifing into Munich, and a place called the Funkazerner.</span> <span id="s572">Now, Funkazer-kazerner means soldier’s place, you know, where soldiers must have been housed at one time or another.</span> <span id="s573">This is where they had their -- all the in -- and we had to go -- would you believe, we all had to go through a very true screening.</span> <span id="s574">They had to make sure that we were who we were, and we were in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s575">Somehow they couldn’t find my husband’s background, so he had to travel in Germany, to this place called Arelson, and bring the papers from there, ca -- so they ma -- make sure that he is who he is.</span> <span id="s576">It was so ironical, now that I think of it, how many Nazis went through, that had no problems at all, and us, the survivors, they made so many problems, trying to -- and one time, the second time when we went for a hearing before the INS, they were called, he asked me where I worked, you know?</span> <span id="s577">I said, in ha -- all the questions where I di -- wa -- the most work.</span> <span id="s578">I said, “In Hamburg.”</span> <span id="s579">“Whereabouts in Hamburg?”</span> <span id="s580">See?</span> <span id="s581">And when I told him, he says, “Oh, yeah, I know the place, I was there.”</span> <span id="s582">He tried to catch me, if I’m saying something wrong.</span> <span id="s583">That really hurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: These were American officials?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s586">And my husband was held back quite a few times, because he was a policeman in the displaced camp, and at that time, the sentiment against the Communists were very strong, and there was organiz -- Jewish organization called the Bundt, which was more left, you know.</span> <span id="s587">And they had -- in May they had a May day parade, and because he has a -- was a policeman, they assumed he knows who these people were, and he should give them names of those Bundists.</span> <span id="s588">My husband said, “I don’t know anybody.”</span> <span id="s589">He came home and told me that, after he was through.</span> <span id="s590">I said, “Even if you knew, you shouldn’t give them any names, because who wants to have a person that squeals, one on another.</span> <span id="s591">He didn’t know.</span> <span id="s592">You know, they had 24 hour duty.</span> <span id="s593">After he came home from duty, he slept most of the time, because he was tired.</span> <span id="s594">He was not in any social integration there, no one was.</span> <span id="s595">We always tried to see where we -- what we wanted to do.</span> <span id="s596">So, he had no political interest, neither did I at that time.</span> <span id="s597">Of course, our sympathies were -- were with Israel, at that time Palestine, but none of us were inclined to be Communist, or left, or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s598">So it took several times he called them back, making him tell him who they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: What was it like when you would -- you mentioned your husband had to go to another German town to get papers, and -- what was it like when you would be sort of circulating now in Germany?</span> <span id="s600">What was the -- What was that like?</span> <span id="s601">What feelings did you have about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: You mean when I go back to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: No, I -- I mean at the time, back then, when you would --</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: You mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: -- go into German cities, or have contact with Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: Well, we didn’t have much contact with them, and the ones that tried to be in touch with us, of course, didn’t know anything about it, what -- what was happening, none of them ever did.</span> <span id="s607">They were already --</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: Yo-You’re smiling as you say this.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: -- very innocent, they were very innocent, none of them knew anything, so -- but they came in to the displaced camp, the women, and they tried to do our laundry, because there were no facilities, just for something to eat, because we used to get all these CARE packages.</span> <span id="s610">The Americans were very good to us, they gave us many CARE packages, but then every CARE package, there was so much of the same thing, that they couldn’t possibly consume this.</span> <span id="s611">So we always exchanged it for something else that we needed.</span> <span id="s612">And this is what happens.</span> <span id="s613">So you had no oth -- other choice but to deal with the local population on that level.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: And it sounds like it might have been kind of strained.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: It -- It -- It was, it was, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Well let’s -- let’s pick up this story again, where you’re -- you’re trying to get to United States, so you go through the application process --</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: -- and eventually you do get to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: Eventually, because when we came again to be interviewed, there was this lady, the secretary, and she was marry -- married to a Polish guy, to a real Polish guy, and I got to talk to her, and then I said to her, what was happening.</span> <span id="s620">And she got really upset.</span> <span id="s621">She went into this interviewer, and said to him, “It’s strange that these poor people are being held back, and you know they have nothing, they’re poor, and they’re survivors .</span> <span id="s622">All they want to do is get out of here, and you holding them back, and you let go any Tom, Dick and Harry which is not Jewish, you letting them go.”</span> <span id="s623">He sat there and thought about it, and then my husband came in, he did apologize to him, my husband told me.</span> <span id="s624">He said, “I’m sorry to cause you all this heartache.</span> <span id="s625">On the next transport you bil -- you’ll be the first one on the list,” and sure enough, you were, and this is where we went, to Bremerhaven.</span> <span id="s626">And you know what happened?</span> <span id="s627">The day we were going to go -- before the -- the date that we were going on the boat, they checked the children, agenamy -- again, and my daughter had a temperature.</span> <span id="s628">Could you believe that?</span> <span id="s629">I sat up all night and cried, and gave her aspirins, and in the morning they checked her again.</span> <span id="s630">Well, the temperature had gone, so they let me go on t-the boat.</span> <span id="s631">And let me tell you, all 10 days we traveled, on stormy seas, I thought I’d never survive that.</span> <span id="s632">I’m never going on another boat again.</span> <span id="s633">And then the -- finally pulled in, and New York harbor, it quiet down, you know?</span> <span id="s634">And then my husband -- of course we were not together, we traveled on a military boat, so the men were separate, and the women were separate, and because I had a small baby, I was privileged to have a cabin with another woman, separate, private.</span> <span id="s635">So, he came into the cabin, and if it wouldn’t be for him, I think my child would die of s-starvation, cause I couldn’t lift my head from that bunk.</span> <span id="s636">So he came in, and he said, “Oh, it’s so quiet now.”</span> <span id="s637">We have to come out on deck and see what was going on.</span> <span id="s638">If you -- I went out, and it was the most gorgeous sight I’ve seen.</span> <span id="s639">It was at dawn, you know, it’s still dark outside.</span> <span id="s640">I could see the lit up harbor, and the first thing, bright, and white lit up, was the Statue of Liberty.</span> <span id="s641">That was so gorgeous, I’ll never forget that.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: What month and year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: We came at the end of April, 1951.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s645">So you came into the harbor, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: Of New York.</span> <span id="s647">And then we were met by representative, either they were UNRRA, or Joint, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s648">This is what they call themself for short, I can’t really tell you exactly how to say the whole name of them.</span> <span id="s649">And they took us to a hotel, we stayed in the hotel for several days to rest up.</span> <span id="s650">Actually, they wanted to send us to Trenton, New Jersey, but my sister’s destination was in Sheboygan.</span> <span id="s651">So she wanted very much for us to be together, and asked the local people here to intervene, so they would send us here.</span> <span id="s652">So we came here.</span> <span id="s653">So they -- in New York they gave us tickets and put us on a train, and they put us on a passenger -- on a coach passenger train, you know, with a little baby, traveling all overnight, sitting on a bench.</span> <span id="s654">She -- I didn’t know where to lay her down, she cried all night.</span> <span id="s655">And people were sitting, and -- and I didn’t know a word of English, or -- or whatever, and I was still very much a timid person out of a camp, looking around, being afraid these people are going to scream at me because my child is crying.</span> <span id="s656">You know, I was very much afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: As someone who originally comes from New Jersey, I’d have to say I think you’re better off that you went to Wisconsin, but -- nobody from New Jersey wants to --</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: I have a friend, my friend that was in camp with me, she lives in Englewood.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Did they tell you why they wanted you to go to Trenton?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: No.</span> <span id="s663">There were certain cities that took so many people in, and I guess they decided I should go to Trenton, that was it.</span> <span id="s664">I don’t know, but maybe I would have had better opportunities.</span> <span id="s665">We didn’t have a lot of opportunities here.</span> <span id="s666">They have a small committee here, they welc-welcomed us, and because my sister was here, they didn’t even find us an apartment right away, we had to stay with my sister.</span> <span id="s667">They gave my husband a job, and as far as looking for a place, we had to do that ourselves.</span> <span id="s668">My husband job didn’t earn nothing, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: What was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: Just a factory job.</span> <span id="s671">Well, we had no education.</span> <span id="s672">There was no one here that said, “Well, we’ll -- we’ll see that you get an education and meanwhile see that you have something to live on.”</span> <span id="s673">Nobody did this here.</span> <span id="s674">So we had to right away go to work, and because his earnings weren’t enough, I had to go sometimes and help out.</span> <span id="s675">What could I do?</span> <span id="s676">There was nothing part time I could do in the evening, just babysit or clean somebody’s house, that was it.</span> <span id="s677">But then my children got bigger, and I went to work too, full-time, because they were both in school.</span> <span id="s678">So I went full-time to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: What were your -- What was it like being over here, you know, in a different country, different culture?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: It was very hard, because let me tell you, in those days, people did not provide you with social workers to get you adjusted, in a new country.</span> <span id="s681">We did all the adjusting all by ourselves.</span> <span id="s682">Soon as we got a job, nobody bothered with us.</span> <span id="s683">That was it, you got a job, you’re making money, you got to do it on your own.</span> <span id="s684">We had people that were very helpful in the places where we worked.</span> <span id="s685">They really -- People were kind, telling us how to do -- especially, I met very nice people that said to me, imi -- wa -- I couldn’t speak the English, and this a big German town, let me tell you.</span> <span id="s686">It helped though, in the beginning, that you could speak the language, you know, and communicate.</span> <span id="s687">But then we communicated and they said, “If you understand something in English, then say it.</span> <span id="s688">We’ll help you.”</span> <span id="s689">You know?</span> <span id="s690">We went for awhile to vocational school.</span> <span id="s691">It wasn’t a great big help, it wasn’t, because when you don’t know the language, and people start the grammar, and you don’t even know what is a vowel, or a noun, or whatever it is, what good is it to you?</span> <span id="s692">I had learned a lot from watching my neighbor’s TV, seeing the motions, and the repeat -- repeated words, and I also liked to read a lot.</span> <span id="s693">I started reading, I actually didn’t know what I was reading, because the pronunciations here are so different.</span> <span id="s694">But slowly I got it, and on my own, more on our own, we did it.</span> <span id="s695">That’s true.</span> <span id="s696">But we needed a vocational school because we could not apply for citizenship if we didn’t go to vocational school, and learn about the government, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s698">Did you and your husband feel like, okay, now we’re here, and we’re Americans, we want to be Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: Yes, we did.</span> <span id="s700">We applied right away.</span> <span id="s701">Soon as we got our first papers, we did register right away.</span> <span id="s702">We came in ’51, in 1957 we were citizens already.</span> <span id="s703">This is -- We wanted to belong, we loved the country, it’s wonderful.</span> <span id="s704">With all it’s faults, it’s the best place to be.</span> <span id="s705">All the freedoms a person has, no place to be found.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Do you feel like you have a sort of special perspective on what it’s like in this country, given where you came from, and what you lived through?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: You mean, what’s going on now, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Or just in general.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: Well, I would say I love the freedoms, but sometimes the people abuse the freedoms too much already.</span> <span id="s710">They use any excuse to say that you infringe on their freedom.</span> <span id="s711">And I think sometimes that people go too far in that respect.</span> <span id="s712">And another thing that nobody stops these people, because they say they’re entitled to these -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: -- ocaust Memorial Museum interview with Fela Warschau.</span> <span id="s714">This is tape number two, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: You mean, what’s going on now, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Or just in general.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: Well, I would say I love the freedoms, but sometimes the people abuse the freedoms too much already.</span> <span id="s718">They use any excuse to say that you infringe on their freedom.</span> <span id="s719">And I think sometimes that people go too far in that respect.</span> <span id="s720">And another thing that nobody stops these people, because they say they’re entitled to these freedoms.</span> <span id="s721">It’s like being helpless, you know?</span> <span id="s722">With all the freedoms, you’re still helpless to stop something evil that’s going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Are you thinking of specific things?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: All these hate groups.</span> <span id="s725">All these things that are -- insults being, or -- or going on public television, or on -- on the internet, online, and broadcasting their hate messages, and nothing can be done about it, you know?</span> <span id="s726">Poisoning young people’s -- children’s minds with such garbage?</span> <span id="s727">And children are vulnerable.</span> <span id="s728">They just don’t go and research, and try to find out what is the truth, they -- they really get taken with something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Does that type of thing remind you of things that happened in Europe before the war?</span> <span id="s730">Were you very conscious then of what was developing in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: Well, in Europe, most of the time the Jews had no rights.</span> <span id="s732">I would say we were called citizens, but we had no right, we were always second class citizens, as far as I remember.</span> <span id="s733">When I was a child, you could hear em -- being said, Jew, Jew, all the time, you know?</span> <span id="s734">And even my school, I was always good in languages, you know, always got the best grade in Polish language, so our teacher, an educated woman would say to the class, “Aren’t you ashamed that this Jew has the best mark in Polish language?”</span> <span id="s735">So we were always aware -- always made aware of it, that we were Jews.</span> <span id="s736">Ya -- In court, you were not believable, because you were a Jew.</span> <span id="s737">If anyone had something against you, you were lost, unless you could bribe the judge, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: So you were -- It’s now, I guess, the 50’s, you and your husband are both working, what kind of job did you get?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: Factory jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: That’s all we could do.</span> <span id="s742">That’s all we were able to do.</span> <span id="s743">I could not go work in a office, I didn’t have enough understanding of the office work, you see?</span> <span id="s744">And you needed the typing, which I didn’t have.</span> <span id="s745">So, wherever the money was coming from, this is where we went.</span> <span id="s746">I ended up working in a place that manufactured plastic things, and we were inspecting all the ready products, making them ready for shipment.</span> <span id="s747">So that’s what I did for 29 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: Yup.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: Same job?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: What about your husband, did he stay in the same factory, or did he move around some?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: No, he -- he changed, because thank God, that first factory we b-barely -- we chased the rainbow all the time, very poor hours, very poor pay, but then, thank the lord, they went on strike.</span> <span id="s754">That was the turning point.</span> <span id="s755">Nobody knew when this was going to end, so I urged him to go and look for a different job, and then he found another job, which was much better.</span> <span id="s756">If he had that job in the beginning, I could have gone to school and learned something, but then, by that time, we had children going to school.</span> <span id="s757">So we wanted them to go, we did, the both of them went to universities, we saw to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: What was the second job that your husband had?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: It was on a -- It’s f -- for them -- for a manufacturing machines to package things.</span> <span id="s760">You know, like packaging toilet paper, or packaging foodstuff, and all that.</span> <span id="s761">They were manufacturing those machines, that’s what they were doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: When -- Once you were here, and had sort of established your life, what sort of social contacts did you have?</span> <span id="s763">Did you get to know many Jewish families, how did that work?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s765">Most of the time we were just -- there were a couple of other survivors, we sort of circulated among ourselves, that was it.</span> <span id="s766">I was -- I would say I wasn’t even invited any place with the local people.</span> <span id="s767">I -- I don’t know about the others, I just know we weren’t.</span> <span id="s768">And most of the friends that we made, we were invited, were not even Jewish.</span> <span id="s769">We had a lot of Gentile friends right away in the beginning, helping us a lot.</span> <span id="s770">And like when we bought this house here, actually we hardly had any payment, and people helped us paint it, and remodel, and do everything, without anything, and those were not Jewish people that helped us.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: Why do you think that happened, was it just sort of accidental?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: I have no idea.</span> <span id="s773">I think the people here, themself, weren’t that well off before the war.</span> <span id="s774">The war gave them opportunities to better themself, and maybe they were busy themself, trying to get somewhere.</span> <span id="s775">They were just so absorbed in their trying to make it, that they had no time for anybody else.</span> <span id="s776">That’s the only way I can figure.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s778">I have a note here, this is from the museum that I -- I guess maybe you mentioned this in wa -- one of your other interviews that you had, most of your friends here were not Jewish, and it says that you said you think that’s the way it should be, and they want to know what do you mean by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: That’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: Do you remember that?</span> <span id="s781">Saying that?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: That’s the way it should be?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: I said that.</span> <span id="s785">Well, because I think we need to communicate with people other than Jewish people.</span> <span id="s786">I had a great need to understand about other religions, and about other places, because in Europe we were completely isolated from that.</span> <span id="s787">And I learned a great deal from my friends, they learned a great deal from me.</span> <span id="s788">And we you learn to respect one another, because of that, and it doesn’t matter what religion they are really, we are always good friends.</span> <span id="s789">We do --</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: With your friends, your non-Jewish friends --</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: -- during this period, did they ask you much about what happened to you during the war, did you talk about it much?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: Some of them did.</span> <span id="s794">And some of them said, “Don’t talk about it now, it hurts too much.</span> <span id="s795">Maybe later on.”</span> <span id="s796">And finally, I don’t know how -- it started with me talking.</span> <span id="s797">Do you want me to talk about that?</span> <span id="s798">I don’t know, do you?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s800">Sure, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: Well, there was a time when they were speculating about Dr. Mengele, because he was the one in Auschwitz, doing all the experiments, if he was still alive, and that was in 1985, where that was a big uproar all over the world, trying to figure out where he is, or what’s going on.</span> <span id="s802">And the local paper here, wanted to write a story tying in some one of the survivors with Mengele.</span> <span id="s803">The only one that was in Auschwitz here, was I.</span> <span id="s804">So someone directed a newspaper lady to me.</span> <span id="s805">She came and interviewed me, and we talked.</span> <span id="s806">I did tell her that Mengele met every transport, or, at that time, I wouldn’t know who he was.</span> <span id="s807">But I’m sure he was there.</span> <span id="s808">So she took my life story, she wrote a big article, and she said, “It’ll be in the paper.”</span> <span id="s809">Made headlines, you know, it made -- the next day it made headlines, and I started getting phone calls from schools.</span> <span id="s810">The first school was in Howard’s Grove here, that asked me to come and speak.</span> <span id="s811">The teacher -- And I said to her, “I don’t feel like coming.</span> <span id="s812">I have never spoken in public, and I really -- are you sure you want me to come?”</span> <span id="s813">So she said, “Of course.”</span> <span id="s814">You know, my first presentation was maybe 10 or 15 minutes.</span> <span id="s815">I was shaking in my boots.</span> <span id="s816">But from then on, apparently I did something right, because she keeps on asking me to come back every year.</span> <span id="s817">From then on I keep on going.</span> <span id="s818">And from then on, from word of mouth, other schools, and it gets to be more and more every year.</span> <span id="s819">So, that’s the way it happens with me going out and speaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: How often do you do it now?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: Soon as school starts, I get phone calls, and I would say in an average, about five times a month, for sure.</span> <span id="s822">But sometimes it’s even more.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: These are grammar schools, high schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: Universities, high schools, grammar schools, junior highs, everything.</span> <span id="s825">Also church groups, organizations, and civic clubs, all of them.</span> <span id="s826">I found many of those.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: Are there certain things that -- how do you do it?</span> <span id="s828">Do you go in and talk of -- make sure to talk about certain things, do you introduce yourself and take questions, how does -- how do you do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: I -- I -- I -- I do my presentation, mainly the story of my life.</span> <span id="s830">I start out just with a little introduction, and then I talk about myself, and through the liberation.</span> <span id="s831">And if it’s a school, then I talk to them about life here, and what they have here, how they should -- comparing my life, and how I view the United States when I came here, what we have here, and how appreciative they should be, and really appreciate the life and the schools, and everything they have.</span> <span id="s832">And point out all these hate groups to them, try to make them understand that before they commit themself to something like that, they should study, and check out the archives and documents, to make sure what is the truth.</span> <span id="s833">I always emphasize all these things to them.</span> <span id="s834">So, and then there’s always a period of questions, of look it up, this picture there, where all these children are?</span> <span id="s835">You see that?</span> <span id="s836">That was on a school where about 50 of them crowded around, wanted my autograph.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: You say make a p -- a presentation, what kinds of things do you tell them about?</span> <span id="s838">Do you tell them about being in the camps, and what you saw, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: -- I’m also curious how they react.</span> <span id="s841">Have -- Have they heard much of this before, or -- or are they sort of in the dark about this to start with?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: Well, some of them get -- take a unit in it beforehand, before I come, so they will be -- they have some background on it.</span> <span id="s843">Most of them do.</span> <span id="s844">And they prepare questions ahead of time, which I -- after I’m through, I do answer questions for those children, and they are -- I get tons of letters from them, and when I read those, I can see that they paid attention, because they quote me sometimes, and telling me how appreciative they are that now that they listened to my story, and that they will never say they’re hungry again, or they will never say that they’re underprivileged because they don’t have certain things, and how lucky they are to live in freedom.</span> <span id="s845">Thanking me for coming and telling my story and calling me a hero for surviving, and maybe that was my goal, that I would be able to come and tell people about this, so people finally realize that we -- we should not hate one another.</span> <span id="s846">This is the most important thing I tell them, that hate is a terrible thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: When you talk to them about what happened, do they seem very shocked?</span> <span id="s848">Do -- Do they ever have trouble believing that this type of thing actually happens, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: Some of them say, “Until you came, it was hard for me to believe, but you’re a living witness to it, so it must be true.”</span> <span id="s850">Because what reason, or what would I get out of it, coming here and telling a story like that?</span> <span id="s851">So they say, “We are very much convinced now.”</span> <span id="s852">Doubters, you know?</span> <span id="s853">And I think what makes me feel good is those responses, and what makes me more feel good is that after walking somewhere in the street, or walking into a store, when a person comes over and says, I heard you speak five years ago in this school, and she still can recognize my face, and remembers what I said, that’s the biggest reward a person can get.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: So do some of the students actually say to you, I did have doubts that the Holocaust happened, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Not very many.</span> <span id="s856">Very seldom someone will say that, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: How does it come up?</span> <span id="s858">Do they say that they looked into it and wondered if it happened, or -- I’m just curious where this sort of line of thought comes from.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: Some of them say, “I have a friend that says that’s not true, it never happened.</span> <span id="s860">But you’re here, you told me that.</span> <span id="s861">I can see it’s true.”</span> <span id="s862">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s864">Let’s go back to sort of your -- your family history again.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: You’re here, your husband is working, you’re working.</span> <span id="s867">Your kids are going to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: Eventually they went to college, where did they go?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: My older daughter went to the University of Madison, and my younger daughter went to Milwaukee.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: And where are they today?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: Both are in New York City.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: What do they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: Well, I tell you, my older daughter graduated in social work.</span> <span id="s875">She did that for a couple of years and decided it was too heartbreaking, and too hard.</span> <span id="s876">She did not want that.</span> <span id="s877">So she went back, took some classes, and went into insurance and investment, and she’s doing very good.</span> <span id="s878">My younger daughter works in a law firm.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: What -- What was it like when they were growing up, regarding the fact that you and your husband were Holocaust survivors?</span> <span id="s880">How much did you talk about it with your children, and how did you handle that whole situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: Well, I did not tell them a lot when they were much younger.</span> <span id="s882">The only thing that I always instilled in them, that we are all people, and it doesn’t matter who we are, everybody is a friend, if they’re nice people.</span> <span id="s883">And they were like that, they made easy friends with non-Gentiles, and gen -- and -- and Jewish people.</span> <span id="s884">My kids had tons of friends coming to this place.</span> <span id="s885">They had a bedroom, very little room, because this is what we could afford, and the room was small, it -- as a matter of fact, it had bunk beds, because I couldn’t fit in two beds.</span> <span id="s886">But they always had friends, and some of e-even slept over, in their place -- in that jammed place, because they liked to be with them.</span> <span id="s887">So it was always happy, and full of kids around here, when they were growing up.</span> <span id="s888">I wa -- I was happy, too, believe me.</span> <span id="s889">Once they left, it was very traumatic to get adjusted.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: What -- When did you start talking to them about what happened?</span> <span id="s891">How did you and your husband talk about it, about what happened to you during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: Well, we just tried to tell them that -- we had to tell them, you know, because they used to ask about grandparents, other relatives.</span> <span id="s893">So this is what came out.</span> <span id="s894">That’s what we had to tell them.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: They would ask where their relatives were, or why they didn’t have them?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s897">Why do -- Why don’t they have a grandma?</span> <span id="s898">Why don’t they have a-aunt -- more aunts, just one aunt, and one uncle, where other children they associate with have big families, and cousins a lot, and so you have to tell them.</span> <span id="s899">Not when they were real little, they wouldn’t understand that.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: Around what age did you start talking about?</span> <span id="s901">A: I would say by the time they were 10, or something like that.</span> <span id="s902">Still not everything.</span> <span id="s903">10 year old child still isn’t able to comprehend everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: As the years went on, and they got older, did they continue to be curious about it, did they ask you to tell them?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: They did, but when I sometimes expressed fear, they always said, “Oh Mom, you’re living in the United States, don’t worry about anything here.”</span> <span id="s906">They felt very secure here.</span> <span id="s907">First of all, my older daughter, she was a little baby when we came, and my other daughter was born here, so she never knew about, you know, being -- bu -- she -- the other one didn’t know either.</span> <span id="s908">She only said in the beginning, “Oh my God, I’m a German citizen, how terrible.”</span> <span id="s909">Because she was born there.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: What about you yourself, when it would come up?</span> <span id="s911">Did -- Would you prefer not to think about it, or not to be reminded of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: Well, in the beginning, none of us really wanted to talk a lot about it, because it brought a lot of heartache.</span> <span id="s913">It still does.</span> <span id="s914">It -- That will never go away, as long as we will live, never.</span> <span id="s915">Beca -- It’s hard to reconcile yourself that the war starts, and you’re a 13 year old girl, and the war ends, and you’re an adult on your own, and there’s no one to turn to for advice, what to do, how -- what to do with your life, or how to -- to associate with people, or whatever.</span> <span id="s916">So it’s very hard.</span> <span id="s917">My young years are gone, from childhood into adulthood.</span> <span id="s918">It’s -- It -- It is -- A lot of the people can’t understand that, what we missed out on.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: Do you ever have dreams about the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: Oh, yes, lot of them.</span> <span id="s921">Lot of dreams.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: Do you remember certain ones, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: Sometimes I dream I’m there.</span> <span id="s924">And it’s not like I’m in a camp, but I’m trying to hide.</span> <span id="s925">They’re coming, I’m trying to hide, and every time I’m hiding, I know they coming near to find me, and I’m running, trying to find a different hiding place.</span> <span id="s926">And I’m running that far, one time I was running so fast I woke up, my heart was beating so fast, I could hardly catch my breath.</span> <span id="s927">This is what woke me up.</span> <span id="s928">There’s many other dreams, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: Do you still have dreams today, about --</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: Once in awhile, yes.</span> <span id="s931">Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: Do you think that -- obviously, you know, in many ways it’s a good experience, do you think that it’s been a good thing that you’ve become a bit of a public speaker about the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s933">Has that helped you in any way, sort of sort things out, or deal with it?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: Well, I a -- I’m very gratified that I do something good, I think I’m doing something -- bringing a little understanding to children, and some adults.</span> <span id="s935">And believe me, some o -- some of the adults, which I’m very shocked, until I come, say they never heard of it.</span> <span id="s936">Would you believe that?</span> <span id="s937">I had one college girl come over and say she never heard of the Holocaust until I came and spoke there.</span> <span id="s938">This is gratifying, very much so, and another thing, I think is -- when you speak about it, it’s just like therapy, talking it out.</span> <span id="s939">At -- It feels like I’m talking my heartache out, and after that it makes me feel I’m a little more calm, because of that.</span> <span id="s940">It gives me a better feeling, trying to make people understand what was it like.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Do you read much about the Holocaust, and what about films, and documentaries, and that sort of thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: I have tons of books on that subject, and documentaries, I have several.</span> <span id="s943">Also, I went to see “Schindler’s List,” of course, and there’s a lando -- on PBS, there’s a lot of documentaries.</span> <span id="s944">I try to watch, but sometimes I don’t any more, because I get very bad dreams, and sometimes I can’t fall asleep any more.</span> <span id="s945">You know, the older you get, and because we are retired, our minds are more activated towards these happenings.</span> <span id="s946">And especially something like that, it triggers so much, that you can’t sleep, or when you fall asleep, there are many nightmares.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: Do you -- Do you feel that what you lived through, and what you saw, had any great affect on how -- you know, it’s a big question, I guess, maybe it’s too big, but how you see the world, or -- or how you see other human beings, or just humanity in general.</span> <span id="s948">Do you think that you saw things one way before the war, and it was drastically different afterward, or what -- what’s that been like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: Well, as a Jewish person, before the war, I knew -- like I said, I knew I wasn’t equal to the others, because I wasn’t treated that way, but I always felt I was, in myself.</span> <span id="s950">It wa -- It was instilled into me by my parents, that we are good people, and we did not do anything wrong, it’s just too bad that other people can’t recognize that.</span> <span id="s951">But when I came here, I rejoiced in all this freedom, I also look very cautiously on everything, because of the things that I went through.</span> <span id="s952">I’m always a little skeptical, and afraid.</span> <span id="s953">I’m still afraid, because of what’s happening with -- with this mushrooming groups of hate, what is going to happen?</span> <span id="s954">And if they wouldn’t someday prevail.</span> <span id="s955">This is what bothers me a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: I imagine you’ve returned to Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: I was, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: How often have you gone?</span> <span id="s959">Have you gone to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: I -- We went -- The first time I went back to Poland in 1978, and my hometown, there was one Jew there, of all the people.</span> <span id="s961">And there was no cemetery any more, just all the stones, just -- they were made on a sidewalk, you know?</span> <span id="s962">And after awhile, they were taken out.</span> <span id="s963">This Jew asked the Polish government after the war, so he went, and they just laid there, pilots of rubble, you don’t know where they belong.</span> <span id="s964">I wanted to go there because my grandpa was the only one that died natural death, and I wanted to see his grave, but I couldn’t see anything.</span> <span id="s965">And I did travel to Poland, I -- I went back to Auschwitz, I went back there.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: This was in 1978?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: Eight.</span> <span id="s968">It was -- It was very hard to do that, but that’s -- that’s from -- where I lef -- lost my whole family.</span> <span id="s969">I wanted to go and say a prayer for them, I wanted to do that.</span> <span id="s970">Yes, that’s what I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: What must have -- What was it like to walk into that camp again?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: Very bad, thinking that I’m back in it, you know?</span> <span id="s973">The first thought was, is it really -- am I really walking here as a free person?</span> <span id="s974">It was a eerie feeling, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Was your husband with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: No, not the first time, he didn’t want to go, mm-mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: When you went to your hometown in Poland, did you see any of the houses, or buildings you remember, places where your family --</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: Oh, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: -- used to live, that were still there?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s981">The marketplace there, the house where -- the place where we lived is there.</span> <span id="s982">I couldn’t get in, because the people that lived there were working, it was locked, you know.</span> <span id="s983">And later on, or even if they were, they were afraid to open the doors.</span> <span id="s984">They thought maybe I came for something.</span> <span id="s985">But it’s there, the building is there, I saw it.</span> <span id="s986">I walked around the streets, I walked around where my school was, in the neighborhood, all -- all of it, everything’s there, just like I left it.</span> <span id="s987">I always say, the little town of Ozercuv without the Jews, is just like a piece in the Twilight zone, for -- it’s teeming with life, you walk out a minute on the street, and come back, a-and it’s dead, nobody is there.</span> <span id="s988">And this is the way it’s -- did strike me, at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: So it actually had not changed much --</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: No --</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: Since the war, or it has?</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: I would say they improved a little bit, the -- the roads, the s -- the buildings, they renovated some of that.</span> <span id="s993">But otherwise, it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: That’s -- That’s fine.</span> <span id="s995">The cat is investigating.</span> <span id="s996">But you’re saying otherwise it’s what?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: Otherwise it’s the same, it’s exactly the same.</span> <span id="s998">Life goes on without the Jews, you know?</span> <span id="s999">It was teeming with Jewish people before the war.</span> <span id="s1000">There was a lot of industry.</span> <span id="s1001">The biggest factory of textiles was owned by a Jewish man, and several -- quite a few hundred people, Gentiles, all of them were working there and making a living of that.</span> <span id="s1002">Now the factory belongs to the government.</span> <span id="s1003">It’s still there, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: How do you feel about Poland and Germany, and Poles and Jews in general?</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: Well, I feel like that they say they suffered, it’s true.</span> <span id="s1006">Polish people were also exterminated, but they were not exterminated, some of them, for the same reason, not because they wanted to exterminate a race.</span> <span id="s1007">They did it because they were afraid of uprisings.</span> <span id="s1008">Th-They did it to political people, and whatever they -- like I always hear homosexuals, or whoever went, they’re going against them.</span> <span id="s1009">That’s why they did it to the Polish people, the intelligentsia, that they shouldn’t be sort of wising up the loc -- the population to revolts.</span> <span id="s1010">Those they exterminated.</span> <span id="s1011">But especially for the reason, just to wipe out a race, they didn’t do this to the Polish people like they did to the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1012">So, what I would have to say, that -- in the respect, they didn’t lose what we lost.</span> <span id="s1013">They still have a country, where we got to be people without homes, no place to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: What about Germany?</span> <span id="s1015">Other people I’ve interviewed, who went through the Holocaust, either avoid it all together, or if they are there, they -- they get out as quickly as they can.</span> <span id="s1016">They don’t -- you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: I wasn’t in Germany last time when I was there.</span> <span id="s1018">I felt that I didn’t want to go and see the country, because I always felt bitter about this big martial plan, where I said, we sat in the displaced camps, with nowhere to go, and here all these millions are being poured back in the perpetrator of all these atrocities, making them prosperous, where they sat home, in their own homes.</span> <span id="s1019">They lost people in the war, they lost homes, of course.</span> <span id="s1020">People got killed in the bombings, but they did it to themself, they have no one else to blame for it.</span> <span id="s1021">Still they had a country, they had homes, they had mothers, they had fathers.</span> <span id="s1022">And here we were helping them back, to get back to wealth, and here, we that lost everything.</span> <span id="s1023">And they shed our blood.</span> <span id="s1024">We are sitting in Germany, in displaced camps, with nowhere to go.</span> <span id="s1025">I felt very, very bitter about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: When -- You mentioned that your husband did go with you to Europe later on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: He -- Yes, he did, later on, he -- we went three years ago, we went.</span> <span id="s1028">And then that time I did go into Germany, because I wanted to see the displaced camp where we lived for so many years, after the war.</span> <span id="s1029">That’s the only reason I went in there.</span> <span id="s1030">Otherwise, I had no -- I have no business in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: So you and your husband went to the camp together -- went back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: We went back to the camp together, yes, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1033">And we traveled.</span> <span id="s1034">We did go back to Poland again.</span> <span id="s1035">He wanted to go back to Lodz, where he lived.</span> <span id="s1036">There was a little street, a little side street, in that big city, the whole street was demolished, there was nothing there but the empty lot.</span> <span id="s1037">He was just so traumatized when he saw that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Fela Warschau.</span> <span id="s1040">This is tape number two, side B. -- later on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: Yes, he did, later on, we -- we went three years ago, we went.</span> <span id="s1042">And then, that time, I did go into Germany, because I wanted to see the displaced camp where we lived for so many years, after the war.</span> <span id="s1043">That’s the only reason I went in there.</span> <span id="s1044">Otherwise, I had no -- I have no business in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: So you and your husband went to the camp together -- went back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: We went back to the camp together, yes, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1047">And we traveled.</span> <span id="s1048">We did go back to Poland again.</span> <span id="s1049">He wanted to go back to Lodz, where he lived.</span> <span id="s1050">There was a little street, a little side street, in that big city, the whole street was demolished, there was nothing there but the empty lot.</span> <span id="s1051">He was just so traumatized when he saw that.</span> <span id="s1052">And of course, we traveled -- since we were there, we went to law -- to Warsaw, we looked at the Warsaw ghetto buildings, and all the historical places.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: Sounds like it was a very emotional trip for both of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: It was.</span> <span id="s1055">I don’t intend to go back there again.</span> <span id="s1056">I don’t think I could take that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1058">I’m curious what your reaction is.</span> <span id="s1059">You know, we’re doing this interview, right now there is a supposed peace plan in Kosovo, but for the last, you know, few months especially --</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: The Albanians were driven out of Kosovo --</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: -- and there have been a lot of references back to what happened in World War Two, by commentators, and politicians, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1064">And when things like this happen in the world, or especially a story like that, in -- in -- in Europe, I’m curious how you’ve been feeling while this has been in the news, and what your reaction has been.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: Come on, anyone that compares this to a Holocaust doesn’t think straight, because Kosovo, those two factions, are people that have their land, and each one is fighting for possession and power.</span> <span id="s1066">They fighting each other, right, and it’s -- they’re shedding blood, which is unnecessary.</span> <span id="s1067">Things could have been resolved peacefully, but people are too hateful, okay.</span> <span id="s1068">I am very upset about children and people being killed, but don’t ever compare this to the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1069">The Jews had no country, we did not start a war with -- start a war with Hitler.</span> <span id="s1070">We were citizens of each country that we lived in, and this is -- we tried to live peacefully, we had nothing against anyone.</span> <span id="s1071">We were simply killed, and tried to be exterminated, because we were Jews, simply.</span> <span id="s1072">The goal -- Hitler’s goal was to exterminate the Jewish race.</span> <span id="s1073">We were not fighting for property, or for a country.</span> <span id="s1074">We did not have a country.</span> <span id="s1075">Kosovo, and the Serbs, they have countries, right?</span> <span id="s1076">They lived side by side each other, and each one wanted to dominate, and this is what started it.</span> <span id="s1077">They fought one another, okay?</span> <span id="s1078">And they -- Whatever happened there, it’s their own fault.</span> <span id="s1079">They brought it upon themself, I feel sorry for all the people, for the -- like I said, for the little children -- innocent children -- innocent people being killed.</span> <span id="s1080">When I see that, I get very upset, because it does remind me of World War Two, and of the killings, but you can never compare it to the Holocaust, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: What about the argument that some people have made that of course this isn’t like the Holocaust, but if countries had acted when whole populations were being persecuted in the past, then a lot could have be-been avoided.</span> <span id="s1082">And this whole notion that now, you know, something should be done, and it shouldn’t be permitted, do you -- what about that argument?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: I think that -- I-I’m all for helping, I’m all for helping, because I remember how helpless we were.</span> <span id="s1084">We looked towards England, and towards the United States, thinking any minute that they will come in, and it will be done swiftly, and that we would not have to suffer all this.</span> <span id="s1085">But you see, the problem was that Hitler was bluffing, and the world was afraid, and they let them get away with everything.</span> <span id="s1086">And he got so big and strong because -- and it was all the other countries’ fault that they let them get that far.</span> <span id="s1087">Everybody stood by and let them just do it.</span> <span id="s1088">Nobody interfered.</span> <span id="s1089">This is what I’m trying to say.</span> <span id="s1090">If they would interfere right away, so much bloodshed would not have happened.</span> <span id="s1091">That’s what I’m trying -- we have to see, we have to interfere.</span> <span id="s1092">Of course, I don’t go much for Americans being killed over there.</span> <span id="s1093">It’s a big tragedy.</span> <span id="s1094">But I think we have created the United Nations, all the countries together, should see to it that there should not be any wars, and any bloodshed.</span> <span id="s1095">They should interfere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1097">Does -- Were you very -- Before the war, were you and your family very religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: Yes, we were.</span> <span id="s1099">Very Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1101">And, are you still, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: I’m not, I’m more Conservative now, because there is no other way, especially here.</span> <span id="s1103">Well, I mean, I keep kosher in the house.</span> <span id="s1104">When we go out, there is no kosher restaurants here.</span> <span id="s1105">So we just try to eat whatever possible we can.</span> <span id="s1106">But as far as that, I try to observe the Sabbath.</span> <span id="s1107">We go to Temple, we belong to the Temple.</span> <span id="s1108">I also have been a member of the Sisterhood of the Hadassah.</span> <span id="s1109">I have been -- I have been the past five years the president of the Hadassah, also.</span> <span id="s1110">And I have been involved in my children’s -- I used to be a 4H leader once, for my younger daughter.</span> <span id="s1111">In -- And all the other things.</span> <span id="s1112">The Girl Scouts, and everything, whatever possibly I could.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: One thing I wonder about it, you know, given what you went through during the war, what you saw happen, what you experienced first-hand, did that -- how did that affect, or did it affect your notion of God?</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: Well, after I was liberated, didn’t affect me anything.</span> <span id="s1115">I just didn’t believe in anything.</span> <span id="s1116">I couldn’t figure out a merciful God looking down could let all of this happens.</span> <span id="s1117">And if He has a hand in all this, He’s the ruler, and make things happen, why did He let all this happen?</span> <span id="s1118">I couldn’t cons -- justify that, and I couldn’t understand.</span> <span id="s1119">And I -- My doubts were, is there a God?</span> <span id="s1120">If He was there, why did He let that happen?</span> <span id="s1121">Very much, I was very angry at God, let me tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: And then, what’s happened since then?</span> <span id="s1123">Do you still feel the same way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A: You sort of -- You have to have something to believe in, otherwise there’s -- there’s nothing to live for.</span> <span id="s1125">I -- I think you have to.</span> <span id="s1126">And it’s not that I justify what happened, but then you start thinking, and you think there have to be some powers above, that are still ruling this world, and why this happened, I will never know.</span> <span id="s1127">So there -- there’s so much mystery in this world, and a person has to believe in something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: So, do you feel like you stopped being angry at God?</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: Slowly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: But there’s no great answer.</span> <span id="s1131">I mean, I guess what I’m wondering, do you think, in what happened, was there some meaning in this, or it was just this incredible outburst of evil, and it doesn’t mean anything, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: I -- I still can’t figure out why it happened.</span> <span id="s1133">The rabbi’s explanation is that God created us with two wills, one good, and one bad, and it’s up to you which way we go, okay?</span> <span id="s1134">So, but why did the bad got the upper hand, I can’t figure that out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: Just to go back during, you know, all the years you -- you lived here, and you’re raising a family, --</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: -- and you know, solid citizen of Sheboygan, Wisconsin, and all that, any other -- any stories that you want to tell, or any incidents, or things you remember, or -- or stuff you felt at the time that somehow hasn’t come up in our conversation, that you think is worth mentioning?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: Incidents about what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: Anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: I -- I think most of the time, I encountered good people, and through my traveling, I met a lot of people that stick to me, and are friends.</span> <span id="s1141">We’re in touch, they come and visit me, they invite me to their homes.</span> <span id="s1142">And I’m very happy about that, most of them are schoolteachers, and all these other people that -- and when I say -- sometimes make comment that I’m amazed, you know, educated people like that, they really want to be my friends, and they answer me, in a ways, you are more educated than we are.</span> <span id="s1143">So, I feel very humble, you know, that -- when they tell me that.</span> <span id="s1144">And I -- The only regret may be living in a small town.</span> <span id="s1145">Right now, I don’t, because we retired, but when I was younger, I figured, if we would have been in a larger city, maybe we would have had a better opportunity to better ourselves financially, because in bigger cities, there were larger committees, and there were other ways the newcomers were treated.</span> <span id="s1146">So, I don’t know, maybe we would have been better off.</span> <span id="s1147">But then, you don’t know the language, and you don’t -- you don’t have money to move around, you just stay where you are.</span> <span id="s1148">And once you’re settled, it’s hard to move.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1150">I think in one of your video interviews, you mentioned that before you came here -- they have a little quote here, that you said that you had heard wonderful things about the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: And we’d like to know, what had you heard?</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: My mother used to tell about inventions, people discovered this, or that, or made some gadgets, you know how they work.</span> <span id="s1154">And my father was always busy working, because in Poland we had to work many hours to make a living, you know?</span> <span id="s1155">So he had no time to read the paper, and my mom used to sit next to him while he was working, and read the paper to him loud.</span> <span id="s1156">And then when she read about something like that, she should -- used to shake her head, and said, “Only in the United States, things like that could happen.</span> <span id="s1157">This must be some wonderful place.”</span> <span id="s1158">You know?</span> <span id="s1159">And lada -- some of the people that immigrated before the war had relatives sending back letters, and telling him all about the buildings here, and all the things, what was happening.</span> <span id="s1160">So she always thought it was a wonderful place to be, and I was very much impressed by it, and that was always in my mind, what she said.</span> <span id="s1161">When we had a choice of going places, I always wanted to come here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: So, partly because of what she had --</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: What my mother used to read, and there were all these positive things about what she had said.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1165">And then, when -- in the first few years you were here, do you think that the United States lived up to the advance billing, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: Oh, I would say very much so, because you know, we lived on a little place, where everything was primitive.</span> <span id="s1167">There wasn’t running water, there were no flush toilets, there was nothing.</span> <span id="s1168">And I came here, and saw all that you could have, you know, refrigerators, you know, and gas stoves.</span> <span id="s1169">There was never anything like that when I was a little girl.</span> <span id="s1170">Running water in the house, a -- a -- a bathroom, and bathtub in the house, where we had a big tub, you know, all the time.</span> <span id="s1171">So, I thought it was wonderful, oh.</span> <span id="s1172">And even now, when I sit in my dreams, such foolish things, I try to imagine I’m talking to my mother, that she’s sitting next to me, and I’m saying to her, “Look Mom, how wonderful.</span> <span id="s1173">All you have to do is press a button, and your clothes gets washed.</span> <span id="s1174">Can you see all these wonderful things that are here?”</span> <span id="s1175">It’s just my mind always thinks back, and I’m trying to carry on a conversation with her, in my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: What’s the cat’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: Sasha.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: She had something -- She -- She -- She wants to add something to the conversation, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: No, he -- he wants to go in there, I think my husband’s in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: Oh, okay.</span> <span id="s1181">Well, I think we’ll be done in a -- in a minute or two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: I think we’ll be done in a minute or two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: That’s fine, no problem.</span> <span id="s1185">He’s very nosy, he likes to investigate things.</span> <span id="s1186">See?</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1188">Now, he’s checking out my tape recorder.</span> <span id="s1189">So, you say you have dreams where you’re actually -- you’re showing things to your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: I’m carrying on a conversation with my mother, or even with my father, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1192">So, when you came here, you loved it, there were all these amazing sort of material things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: But was there -- was there anything you missed, is there stuff that -- or some aspect of life that -- that you had in Europe, that you feel is -- doesn’t exist so much here, or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: Well, I would say, in the beginning maybe not, because the closeness with the families was always there, even in -- and the other people’s lives here.</span> <span id="s1196">People were much closer in families than they are now.</span> <span id="s1197">Children and parents were together, things were done together, and I was always invited to people’s homes, and to dinners, and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s1198">Everybody sat down at the table, the children were there, our children were there.</span> <span id="s1199">And s -- s -- conversing afterwards.</span> <span id="s1200">So it was like ri -- somehow, the family that we didn’t have, it was compensating very much.</span> <span id="s1201">The only hard time was when it came to our holidays.</span> <span id="s1202">So, it was very hard to take, because you sat at the table, and you thought of the wonderful times you had at home, surrounded by everybody, and by all the tradition.</span> <span id="s1203">And all of a sudden, all of this is gone, and that’s what it is, hard facts of life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1205">Is there anything else that we haven’t talked about, that you’d like to talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: You know, off-hand, I can’t think of it, but probably by the time you’re gone, I would say I should have said this, or I should have said that, and that’s what probably will happen.</span> <span id="s1207">I just -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1208">I know one thing, when we get old, we survivors who think time is running too fast for us, we try to do so much more, to be -- that it should be left behind.</span> <span id="s1209">You -- You know, my two daughters never got married, I don’t have any grandchildren, it’s hard to take this.</span> <span id="s1210">They just elected to be career women.</span> <span id="s1211">Yeah, I would like to have some grandchildren, somebody left to remember everything, but then I compensate myself at the mind that all of this is recorded, and some people will know about it anyway.</span> <span id="s1212">So this -- I think this is a very good thing that is happening to me.</span> <span id="s1213">And many schools also tape me, and they have that on their files.</span> <span id="s1214">And I go, for the fourth time, I went to Milwaukee, to Marquette University.</span> <span id="s1215">And they always tape it, they considered this a lecture.</span> <span id="s1216">And every year, when I come, they make a tape of whatever I say, and they file in their files there, so that -- that’s something that I think is very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: You know, it -- it has been so many years, and the people who did the live through it, who are still alive, obviously are not going to be around forever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: You mentioned earlier when we were talking, that you’ve always still -- and your children used to try to reassure you about it, been a little apprehensive about what could happen, what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: -- you know, somehow something similar happening -- happening in the future.</span> <span id="s1222">I’m wondering if -- what your feelings are also about once all the people who actually lived through this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: -- are gone, and whether the memory will persist, or will it be forgotten?</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">A: I think maybe for awhile it will persist, but I’m afraid with time, it might just be something in the archives that now and then, someone will look it up for some reference.</span> <span id="s1226">This is the way it probably will be, sadly.</span> <span id="s1227">I say that very sadly.</span> <span id="s1228">In the beginning, maybe, the first several years after we are gone, it will be still carried on, but later on, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1229">That’s what I think will happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: Is that something you worry about, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: Yes, I think it’s very important it should be remembered, and I do worry about that, but I -- it’s beyond me, you know?</span> <span id="s1232">Once we gone, we gone, there’s nothing we can do about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1234">You know, it see -- just seems that in my own lifetime, that -- you know, I was born in the early 50’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: And it seems to me that it’s really been in the last, say 20 years or so, there has been much more talk, much more sort of public stuff, more movies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: That’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q: Things like the Holocaust Museum being established, and all that it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">A: Right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: -- that actually -- you know, as a kid, I learned about it in history class.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: And actually, you know, I was raised Catholic, but we discussed it in religion class.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: But other than that, you know, just in the general culture --</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: I would say until ab -- you know, roughly about 20 years ago, there wasn’t a tremendous amount about it, and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: That’s true.</span> <span id="s1248">That it very true.</span> <span id="s1249">I-I tell you why, because the initiative has no -- had not been taken by Jewish leaders here.</span> <span id="s1250">We, the survivors alone tried to organize these things.</span> <span id="s1251">You see, the survivors themself, organize the Yom HaShoah day.</span> <span id="s1252">It wasn’t national like it was now, but I remember from early days on, we used to go to Milwaukee, and all -- all of us survivors get together somewhere, and observe Yom HaShoah day, but later on, when it got to be more popular, then local officials joined, and it got to be on -- on a wider scale, and this is the way it happened.</span> <span id="s1253">But we, the survivors, started that ourselves.</span> <span id="s1254">Of course, we didn’t have all this power to get it on such a large scale.</span> <span id="s1255">The Holocaust Museum did a lot to -- too, you know, to make this happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1257">So really, it was the survivors here that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A: Yes, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1259">Locally here, we hardly did anything, if we the few survivors didn’t take the initiative to do something, but now, for two years, they are having like ca -- sending out letters to the schools here, and they should write a theme on why the Holocaust should be remembered, and they reward them with prizes, and a get together, and a little ceremony.</span> <span id="s1260">But this is only the second year that they’ve been doing it here locally.</span> <span id="s1261">Otherwise it never had been done.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: My husband and I always used to go to Milwaukee.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: Well, that’s about it for my questions.</span> <span id="s1265">Again, before --</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: That’s fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: -- we go, anything else you want to bring up or mention?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: I -- I’m a blank right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: Well, I -- I will just say again for the record, that you did two long interviews, video interviews --</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: -- with the museum, those are in the record there --</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: -- about -- you know, in -- in -- in great detail --</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: -- your -- your experiences actually during the war.</span> <span id="s1276">We’ve talked about mostly different things here today.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: But anyone who’s curious about any of that, the tapes are on file, and they can go back and listen, it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: -- some amazing, fascinating things on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: Were you -- Are you satisfied with what I have to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: Oh sure, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: Well, let me just -- let me just end our tape.</span> <span id="s1285">So anyway, if --</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: -- if there’s nothing more to add, then I’ll just thank you for taking the time to talk to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: Oh, you’re welcome.</span> <span id="s1289">It’s very nice of you to come and take your time, and I’m glad you came, and we had this nice talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: Well, I always knew there would be some reason I would go to Sheboygan, Wisconsin.</span> <span id="s1291">You turned out to be it, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: Oh, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1294">Well, we’ll turn off the machinery, we’ll let you actually open up your door, and put on the air conditioner, and do all that stuff that makes noise, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: That’s fine, no problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: So thanks again for taking the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: Oh, you’re welcome, very welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s1299">This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Fela Warschau.</span></p> <p><span
