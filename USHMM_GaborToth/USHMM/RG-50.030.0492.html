bit about your early life.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Answer: Oh, very good, yes.</span> <span id="s15">I was born in a -- first of all in a fairly large, I mean a locally very well known family, very big family and you know, m-my family has been in the sugar industry and so on, and -- and with connections in the Belgium industry and so on, but at the time I was totally immature and -- no I -- well, I -- I went through the -- the experience you are interested in, it was about 1920, and -- but very mentally immature.</span> <span id="s16">And for instance, we knew absolutely nothing about the suffering the Jewish people were -- underwent, but the war broke out in my n -- country, actually in May -- on May 10th, 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: And at that point, can you tell it -- back up a little bit, can we back up a little bit and -- and fill in the context somewhat.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: The -- th-th --</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: The town was what name, what was the name of the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: The name -- the town, it’s one of the oldest town in that part of the world, that was Torgny.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Torgny, and -- mm-hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: In Belgium, in Belgium, on the French border.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: And I studied, you know, I had a normal Catholic education, high school and so on, and then -- I studied then my --</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: What does --</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: -- university.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s30">What does normal Catholic education for a place like Torgny at that time mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Well at first I was in the so-called bourgeois, you know, level.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: And at that time, you know, the classes and so on were still quite, not segregated, but there was a -- a fact -- a separation -- factual separation, so I lived very much in that kind of a -- not privileged, but I would say self-contained world, mentally, values and so on.</span> <span id="s34">I don’t want to be critical, but you have to realize how --</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Was it an upper middle class family?</span> <span id="s36">Is that how you would say it?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: No -- yeah, upper middle class, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: And you said you had many children in your family.</span> <span id="s41">How many brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: No, not me, but m-my mother, my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Yes, about 12.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: 12?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Yes, unusual, not [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: That’s quite a lot.</span> <span id="s50">And where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: We always had servants and so on, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: No, it’s a kind of life, you know, you -- nobody has the experience [indecipherable] in the country and so on, and gardeners, and we had that kind of [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Can you tell me how much -- how many brothers an-and where you were in the -- in the brothers and sisters hierarchy?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s56">I -- I don’t know, I must have been seventh or something.</span> <span id="s57">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: And you were born in what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: I -- born, well that’s a very discreet question.</span> <span id="s60">I’m 20 -- 1921, at the end of 1921, so I’ll be 83, in other words, very shortly.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Okay, here in to -- in the year 2004.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: I [indecipherable] show respect to my age, mm?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Of course, of course, of course.</span> <span id="s64">So you say you were sort of in the middle of all of the large family of siblings, you were number seven, or -- or --</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: [indecipherable] yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: And wa -- did you -- were most of the children boys, or girls, or a mix, or -- did everybody go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: No, but -- I suppose there were more girls than -- I -- I’ve never asked myself that question.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: No, we were about six -- six boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Six boys?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: And were they mostly older than you or younger than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s76">I don’t know, really.</span> <span id="s77">No, I was in the middle as far as the boys were concerned, exactly in the middle.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s79">And you studied at a Catholic school?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Yes, yes</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: You went to Catholic high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Yes, when I -- when the -- the story, which I was involved in, I was studying at the -- a Jesuit I don’t whether you understand what it means, a school in Namur, N --</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: -- N-a-m-u-r.</span> <span id="s85">And that’s where I met that -- that priest, you know, and those --</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Was this after high school already, at university level?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: At university but on -- at the lower level, just the college, or even lower college, I would call it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: And what were your studies there?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: What were your studies there, in Namur?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Oh, nondescript program [indecipherable] it could -- it -- it was called philosophy and letters.</span> <span id="s94">You have nothing like this up [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: So i-it’s something which could have led, you know, to many different choices, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Were you alone from your family?</span> <span id="s98">Is Namur far from the town that you grew up in?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: No, it was close?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: They all -- they studied there.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s103">So you were not alone from your family when you were studying there, you --</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: I was alone in -- in that place, at the -- that college, but I’m not the first in the family to go to -- to college if that is -- is the meaning of your question.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s106">My question is, when the war brokes out -- broke out, were you alone, away from your family, studying --</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: I was alone --</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: -- when I was there, and so on, but of course, d-during the war condition we had, the traveling was not restr -- I mean, it was restricted, and not taken for granted, the normal times, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s111">Can you tell us a little bit more about your childhood, about the town that you grew up in?</span> <span id="s112">You mentioned something about the sugar industry.</span> <span id="s113">In what way was your family involved?</span> <span id="s114">What we’re trying to do is get a sense of the community and the values and the world that you grew up in, so whatever you could tell us about that child -- those childhood years --</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Well, that childhood was extremely happy, you see, I -- I never went to grammar school because I was too good to be sent to, you know, that country school.</span> <span id="s116">We were living in the country, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: -- well, I enjoyed -- I was very happy at the time, and just no -- we had no worries, and then came -- you see, the Great Depression, beca -- at that time, because a -- the family business was a sugar producing and also [indecipherable] owning lots of farms and so on and so we were very involved in the agricultural way.</span> <span id="s119">And then my grandfather was a very capable and creative businessman, but he did not train, you see, his children and so on and so they were a background also [indecipherable] and that sort of thing, because the economic situation in western Europe at that time was difficult, particularly in the area of agricultural production and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s121">And in the sugar business, is -- that was something your father himself was involved in?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: No, no, that’s the family business --</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: -- so he was the owner of one part, part general stockholder and so on, and -- and also manager, yes, yes, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: -- so that was entirely private thing, and just a -- but the times were th -- because the prices were going up and down and then the harvests, you know, were long and difficult and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: You --</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: I think there was a catastrophic year, I forgot when it was, 1935 or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: And you mentioned before that when the war occurred --</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: -- you were -- you see yourself as somebody who was totally unprepared --</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Unprepared.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: -- fo-for what had happened fo -- afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: And it happened very suddenly because, you know, the war was declared by France and England.</span> <span id="s135">I think it was on September -- on September first, Germany invaded Poland, right?</span> <span id="s136">And then there was a, I don’t know, an ultimatum or something, and the war between Germany and England and France started on -- I think on September third, and then there was a period, you know, a long period of neutrality and suspense and so on, and then on --</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: In Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: -- May the 10th --</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: In Belgium, you s --</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: -- [indecipherable] in Belgium, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: And on May the 10th, the German invaded Belgium and Holland if I am correct, and so on.</span> <span id="s143">Then th-that --</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: -- for me who was still a -- a teenager, was a child, it came very suddenly, because all -- in our y-younger years, you know, we heard stories about the atrocities and suffering during the first World War, which was still reasonably close at the time, so -- so we were frightened, but we didn’t know what we feared.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Do you have a memory of when the invasion occurred?</span> <span id="s147">Do you remember where you were at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Sure, sure, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Can you tell us about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Well, the -- I was already in Namur at the time, and then I think there was some bombing and so on, and then -- then we left for France and so on, so -- so there is a -- was a retreat -- I mean, a -- we left the house, and so on the -- and then the -- there were battle and so on, just -- but well, that’s -- that is not so clear in my memory, just that -- I just remember vaguely.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: How -- did you return to Namur at any time?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Yes, yes, of course --</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: -- we return, and then -- and then the -- I don’t know, I -- I -- I think the studies were interrupted, but it was -- no, I -- and I -- and wa -- 1941 I was back -- back to Namur, and so on.</span> <span id="s157">And then I -- I met that -- that priest, you know, who took care of those Jewish boys and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about how you met this priest, what his name was?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: I-I have no recollection of how I met them, but i -- it’s an entirely extraordinary story.</span> <span id="s160">If you want -- did you want me to go into what I know of his --</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: What was his name?</span> <span id="s162">What were the circumstances --</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: His name was Jose-Joseph -- you see, now I have a -- excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: I’m getting old.</span> <span id="s166">I never thought I would forget his name.</span> <span id="s167">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s168">Oh, that’s ridiculous.</span> <span id="s169">It will come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: That’s okay.</span> <span id="s171">It happens sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: Yes, it -- no, i-it was an extraord -- a very sensitive, young priest --</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: -- a parish priest, and then he was transferred someplace, seminary where he was teaching, and it was a very extraordinary, heroic kind of man, very sensitive, and at the same time he could be -- violently could get fits of anger and so on, but not at all, you know, resentments, so on, just because at times he was -- I mean, he was oversensitive.</span> <span id="s175">And then he was -- you are -- now are going to the substance of my --</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Yeah, I’d like to find out more how -- how it is that you got involved in this activity.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: That -- I have no memory of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Why, I just got involved.</span> <span id="s180">I suppose I met him, or somebody told me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: But the story is that there was a parish house in -- on a sort of [indecipherable] and so on, but that is very local, it’s not to be compared to the setting of Washington, it was very simple.</span> <span id="s183">And there was a parish house here, and then next to it, exactly next to it, the same wall, there was a big hotel before the war, which was occupied by the German Gestapo and various German services in that town.</span> <span id="s184">So we had a wall, and when I was sitting with the wall, I could hear the German officers on the outside.</span> <span id="s185">And then that priest, you know, slowly -- I -- I -- I suppose he was in touch -- no, later on he was in touch with the various Jewish idi -- organization.</span> <span id="s186">But we had as many as 20 boys in that house, you see, and on the first floor was a sort of a big room with a theater and so on, where the boys could at least take some exercise.</span> <span id="s187">And then, on the top there were his office and so on.</span> <span id="s188">And the boys actually lived in that house, you see, for -- they could not go out, right?</span> <span id="s189">And -- and that’s the reason why he got in touch with me, because we wanted to, you know, on Sunday -- on Saturdays and Sundays, well mostly on Sundays, I suppose, we gathered, you know, neighborhood boys and so on, right, and then the Jewish children joined them and so -- so they could get some exercise and fresh air.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: So, if I can understand this correctly, there was a house that belonged to the college --</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: To the parish, or to the --</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Uh-huh, to the parish in Namur.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: I shou -- in Namur, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s195">And the priest who lived in the house --</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: -- it was -- it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: It was a parish house for certain functions, I suppose the parish functions.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: And he was the one who started saving the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: And were these -- how old was the range, the age range of the children who were</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Oh, the children, I could not say, I would say about seven -- the -- we -- as far as I recall, we have no small children and so on, they were all, you know, beginning teenagers and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: So they were -- uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: And no more than 12, I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: And what was --</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: But then of course, they change.</span> <span id="s207">You see, there was --</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: -- a rotation.</span> <span id="s210">I -- I don’t know, I -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: How was -- what was your involvement in it?</span> <span id="s212">Was it that you were a group of other boys --</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: My involvement was pure, not charity.</span> <span id="s214">I was -- as I told you, I was immature, I didn’t know what I was doing.</span> <span id="s215">I was very happy to do it.</span> <span id="s216">I had a great, not love, but I mean I liked the boys, I seem to remember some of them.</span> <span id="s217">So -- and -- but my function, what I actually did was simply to take them out with other friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s219">And so you would take them out --</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: So I --</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: -- for playing and for exercise?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: -- to -- yeah, yeah, and exercise and play ball, and that sort of thing and so on.</span> <span id="s223">But -- and then, you see that -- so, we had the Gestapo next door --</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: -- right?</span> <span id="s226">And then, on the first floor, and then there was a roof, you see, on --</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: -- on the top of the house, without any heating, with mattresses on the floor.</span> <span id="s229">And at times I saw with my own eyes there’s something -- sometime 15 children and so on.</span> <span id="s230">A-And mostly -- most of them, if I am correct, I don’t -- came from Poland and Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Did you get -- did you have a common language that you --</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: I see, so you never --</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Well, of course the -- they knew su -- I don’t know -- know, really.</span> <span id="s237">Communication was rather poor in the sense -- because most of them had language problems, right, and actually the priest, after the -- after the -- I mean the liberation of the country, created si -- courses in -- in Hebrew for -- for the boys.</span> <span id="s238">And the most important part of my testimony as far as I’m concerned, that I believe, I don’t know that, but -- I don’t know how many, but certainly perhaps a thousand boys, over the years, you know, went through that system.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: So there -- about -- over a thousand boys were -- went through the school, through this house --</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: No, no, no, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: -- excuse me, this house that they were saving --</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: -- they were -- they just were --</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: -- they were sheltered there, they found a shelter.</span> <span id="s245">But you have to realize th-th-the that e-extraordinary, absolutely extraordinary to keep boys --</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Next to the --</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: -- and I never witness any -- you know, any lack of discipline or anything there.</span> <span id="s248">The boys, most of them were so conscious of their situation and -- and so disciplined and so on.</span> <span id="s249">But I want -- I wanted to say two things.</span> <span id="s250">The first thing is that as far as I know, only one boy who I changed his fate, you know, so [indecipherable] it was part of the system to protect the Jewish -- and also perhaps even more than the Jewish aspect, the -- the authority of the parents.</span> <span id="s251">And that was very beautiful, I never forgot that.</span> <span id="s252">Well, that’s one thing, and the second thing again, as far as I know, not one boy was caught and so he saved them, really save --</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: That was one of my questions, is the fate of these children, as far as you knew it, that these children did not fall into the hands of the Gestapo, who were right next --</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: They did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: They did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Th-Then one day, a father of one of our boys was shot to --</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Excuse me for a second -- [tape break] -- uh-huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: For a day and night.</span> <span id="s261">Cause that’s what I said, the Germans also heard, you see, voices, and I-I -- I -- I never understood how he could maintain, you know, that th -- type of discipline necessary for their safety, for their protection.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Did --</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: And in addition --</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: -- there was, of course, an enormous problem of feeding them.</span> <span id="s266">You see, every citizen received coupons or stamps and so on, and so we had to find food and nourishment for those boys.</span> <span id="s267">And -- and we ha -- had not only to prepare the meal, and then but al-also to feed them, and to avoid noises and so on.</span> <span id="s268">And quite frankly, I never understood how it was achieved, and sin -- and so on, because it --</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Were any of your friends involved in this as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: No, no, yeah, I-I myself only came, only on Sundays and Saturdays, so I -- I was not an outsider, but I was not involved in the actually daily routine of the -- of the shelter.</span> <span id="s271">And so i -- you have to -- also to understand that there was a network around that place, you see, providing food, nourishment and so on.</span> <span id="s272">There was an er -- a truly heroic nurse who was heading sort of an office -- sort of Red Cross offices, where the boys were treated and so on.</span> <span id="s273">Bu -- and all that was in -- achieving sec -- complete secrecy and so on.</span> <span id="s274">And that person, after having given herself to that work for three year -- three years, on the very last day, a few days before the liberation, she got -- she was killed in a bombing, and so on -- o-on the spot and her body was thrown on the wall [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s275">And it was a truly -- I mean, extraordinary person, extra -- a nurse [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Do you remember her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: No, her name I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: You don’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: I forgot, because you know I -- all these sad experiences has been extremely deep, I mean [indecipherable] really attached, but I did not follow it through.</span> <span id="s280">For -- for instance, if you had informed me that -- this interview, I would have gone to talk to people [indecipherable] but th --</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: -- no, it -- it’s not important, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: No, it -- it’s simply -- it’s n -- it’s helpful to have the name of the person you are talking about, if you remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Yes, yes, yes, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: And if not it’s -- it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: -- we can leave it by the side.</span> <span id="s288">Were there any of -- any other of your friends that you knew of, even if not directly, who in some way were involved in the sheltering?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Yes, of course, of course, there were a -- a number of -- why, as a matter of fact, I -- very recently I got in touch with a -- who is now al -- a priest also, but he was a boy at the time of those events, and he had known that Joseph Andre -- now the name comes --</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: See?</span> <span id="s291">Mr. Joseph Andre was the priest.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: The priest, the name --</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: -- of the priest.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: So I -- I was saying yes, I -- I know that yeah, tha -- h-he was a boy at the time and that priest came to his fath -- his parents had a little farm or something --</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: -- and so they got supply, I mean the -- the shelter got supplies from them, and so --</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Excuse me, can you repeat that?</span> <span id="s300">I didn’t fully understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: You didn’t understand, no?</span> <span id="s302">No, I just met recently --</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: -- the priest, who was younger than me, and when he was a child, his parents supplied potatoes and eggs and so on and so --</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: To the school -- to the boys, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Bu-But the main -- th-the one who worked most with the -- the priest and myself, died recently.</span> <span id="s307">So should I continue?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Oh yes, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: Yes, yes, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: So, if you want, I-I could tell you how this extraordinary experience ended, so -- becau -- ah yes, I was telling you that the father of one of our boys was shot by the Gestapo on the street, and then, that moment I was called by phone, and I really risked my existence on that date, because of course the shelter, it was at the back of the house in -- in the cellar, down cellar --</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: -- they had a door hidden by a piece of furniture and so on, and there -- so there was an escape on -- on another street.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: You see, on the other side.</span> <span id="s316">And so all the boys escaped, and I took charge of a group of five or six, with the Gestapo [indecipherable] but I-I was not aware that -- I -- I was -- it was not an heroic action, it was just a purely human, but in fact, it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Because -- and then the priest fled, disappeared.</span> <span id="s319">Hi-His brother was arrested, he was [indecipherable] and so on, and other people were -- are arrested, but none of the boys was captured.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Did the Gestapo know that they were in the house, and they came looking for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Ah yes, I -- at that time, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: At that time, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: And was that close to the end, or was th --</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: It was close to the end of the war, yes, of course, and -- and then the boys were [indecipherable] and I went to a marvelous -- well, she was a nun with a very strong character and so on and she was in charge of an orphanage and so on.</span> <span id="s326">And so I took my boys to her and that was the end as far as I was concerned, just to -- but then after that -- if -- should I continue?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: Yes, please, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s329">So the priest fled, the boys were -- disappeared, none of them was captured, well -- and in September, I think, the -- the place, or the town was liberated by the U.S. first army.</span> <span id="s330">And then that was a beautiful memory I have because the Jewish chaplain of the American unit invited me and the priest for the celebration of the Jewish New Year.</span> <span id="s331">I forgot the exact date, but I don’t know --</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: In September.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: It was in September, but I don’t recall whether it was the first and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: And after that I -- I joined the American first army as a volunteer.</span> <span id="s336">I-I didn’t accomplish anything.</span> <span id="s337">But then we crossed the Rhine, I think April first at Remagen, and then we raced through Germany -- not me, but the --</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: -- Patton, and so on, and -- and so finally we -- we arrived in the vicinity of Weimar.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Right?</span> <span id="s342">And then I wa -- I visited, must have been I don’t know how many days, let’s say 10, after the liberation of the camp, of the -- Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: And there -- if you want I could talk to you about that experience, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: Yes, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: I’ll have more questions about the ci --</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Why don’t you ask them now?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: No?</span> <span id="s353">Would you now?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Okay, then we can back up a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: When you were talking about when the Gestapo started to hunt for these boys --</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: -- that were in the house, you mentioned that one boy had his -- had his father shot --</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: -- close by.</span> <span id="s361">Can you tell us a little bit about those circumstances, and how is it the connection was established?</span> <span id="s362">How is it that the Gestapo knew that the father had a son there, or did they?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: No, because then we -- first of all, we knew, since the boy were -- a-as far as I recall, you say the fa -- the father of that boy was shot a few steps from the house, and so on.</span> <span id="s364">But you -- we knew that we were in danger, but how the alert was given, that I-I have no recollection of that.</span> <span id="s365">I just know that at a certain hour in the morning, I was called by a friend working with that priest and so on, that I had to come at once, and then I was put in charge of a group of boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Even more to step back, what were the circumstances of this man’s -- how is it that he came to be there, that he was --</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Who --</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: -- the -- the father who was shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: I -- I don’t know, I don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Oh, you don’t know.</span> <span id="s371">You just kn --</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: No, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Oh, you don’t know that.</span> <span id="s374">Okay, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: I just know that this happened, and from that moment of course we were all in mortal danger because --</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Because they could see the -- they could go and look for the boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: -- a-and the house must have been watch and so on, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s379">When --</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: But it ended in a very sudden way, that all the boys fled through the -- that escape door on the other si -- on another street, you see, on the other side of the building, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s382">Now, when you would go out and play with them on Saturdays and Sundays --</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: -- what kind of activities did you undertake with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: Normal, you know, boyish activities and so one, the --</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: What’s that?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Walking, first of all.</span> <span id="s388">They were happy to be out, which was not given, you know, very frequently.</span> <span id="s389">You must imagine what it is for a boy to be shut in a house and so on and then I suppose we played ball and that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s390">It lasted a -- the outing lasted about four hours or something of that sort.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Would it use --</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: In the afternoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s394">Would it use -- was it in the town, was it in, let’s say outside the town where -- did other people see you as you --</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Of course, sure, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: But they thought it was a church, normal church activity, you see, just --</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: I see, so did anybody ever look at these children and say they --</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: -- they don’t look like our children?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: No, no, as far as I know, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Okay, so there was never any --</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: A-A-Anyway, I have no i-idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: I see, I see.</span> <span id="s405">So your outings were not like in the woods where no one would see them, they were within the usual --</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: No, no, no, no, I mean, it was totally open and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: It was a normal parish activity, and -- but I -- as I say, tha-that priest was extremely sensitive to any proselyting and so on, and as far as I recall, those who -- the boys who had placed in that orphanage and so on, actually on Sundays [indecipherable] they went to church, but they were given instructions, you see to respect their own Jewish practices and liturgies.</span> <span id="s409">Although they physically participated, they were warned by that nun, or by the priests themselves, not to do anything.</span> <span id="s410">And that, I think is a very beautiful part of the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s412">I would a -- how -- can you tell me in total how long, how many years were you involved with -- with -- with taking care of these boys in that house?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: [indecipherable] that was very, very short, because he actually went into that house, you see, in ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: And then I-I -- I’m not clear, I do not know the -- the actually links he had with Jewish organizations.</span> <span id="s416">I don’t even know their name, but th-they were very active, for instance, they supplied food stamps, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: And so I suppose that the boys came to that Jewish -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: -- interview with Paul Peeters, conducted by Ina Navazelskis on Wednesday, December 22nd, 2004, in Washington, D.C..</span> <span id="s420">This is tape number one, side B. So, Mr. Peeters, we were talking about the length of time that the boys were in the -- in the house, say -- you know, sheltered by the priest -- his name was Joseph Andre, was that the n -- his name, yes?</span> <span id="s421">And you were saying it began in 1941, and lasted until almost the end of German occupation in Belgium --</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: -- in 1944, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: A-Actually, it was February 1944.</span> <span id="s425">That’s when the incident we recall --</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: -- took place.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: With the fa -- with the man being shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s431">So the --</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Well, that’s my recollection, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s434">And so then, it was soon after that that -- that the liberation came?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: In September.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: In September, yes.</span> <span id="s437">Well [indecipherable] yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: [indecipherable] the war lasted until May 8, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: And you were with the you -- the army, the United States Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Yes, I was, in Weimar.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s442">So tell me a little bit more about when you went to Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: And then, I don’t know how, I don -- I forgot how it took place, why it -- but it was a very short period I told you, aba -- af-after the liberation of the camp.</span> <span id="s444">What I would like to supply, because you know the -- the good Germans were asked to surrender their cameras and so on to the -- and so I got hold, I don’t know how, of a -- a very small photo ca --</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: Of a -- of a photo camera?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s447">And so I took pictures, and those pictures I will -- I have to look for them, but I would like to supply to you, because as far as I know, I’m the only one who took the picture bec -- well, that’s a -- I -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Tell us, tell us, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: No, I have to tell you the story, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: -- the first thing I -- we were greeted, the camp of Buchenwald was governed by Yugoslav communists.</span> <span id="s452">And so those communists were totally in control of the camp when we -- we came.</span> <span id="s453">And so when, I don’t know how, I -- I won’t call it a privilege, but yet it is something important for me.</span> <span id="s454">I was taken by a team of those com -- so it’s a first experience --</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: The for -- the communist -- former communist prisoners in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: That was first experience of communism, because th-there was such a contrast, you see, between those starving inmates and those, you know, powerful and -- Yugoslav communists.</span> <span id="s459">So anyway, I don’t know -- I don’t know how I managed, perhaps because I could still already speak some English, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s460">But I got an extraordinary experience, because there -- the man who guided me [indecipherable] took me really at the -- at the center where they -- they were exterminated.</span> <span id="s461">It was a barrack, right, and there was a little yard with a gallows, is that what you call it, right?</span> <span id="s462">Where they could hang about 15 people at a time, that -- so the barrack -- the barrack was here and then there was a doctor’s office where the shot, you know, were given to the inmates, and then there was a -- it’s horrible -- a place where the bodies were just piled, and so on, and then the cremation oven was nearby.</span> <span id="s463">So that man took me there, and of course that’s something [indecipherable] terrible, I mean not -- although, I mean I’m more impressed by it now than I was when I [indecipherable] Jews with that, you know, immature mentality I had.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Why do you say that, why do you think it?</span> <span id="s465">Why was it immature?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Because I said -- I proved it, I said, that I am more moved now by what I experienced then, than I was at the time.</span> <span id="s467">But I -- and -- and you have to -- i-it was an extraordinary experience, this -- as far as I recall, that the oven were still used in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Even -- even then?</span> <span id="s469">After --</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: E -- e -- a -- a -- th-that’s if -- that the -- the memory I have, but I admit it might be wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Did you still see -- were there still bodies when you went to see it?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: I’m not sure about what my memory is.</span> <span id="s473">My feeling is that they were still used.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Perhaps to dispose of -- because the people were still dying, you know, and -- and the good American soldiers gave them chocolate and so on, which was -- it was totally uncontrolled at that time.</span> <span id="s476">When I-I -- when I visited the camp where the [indecipherable] was --</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Was this in --</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Because the American ri -- you know, rush -- you have no idea how fast it went.</span> <span id="s479">Patton, you know, made a -- a breakthrough at Remagen, and so on, and in a matter of days we traveled hundreds of miles, and so on.</span> <span id="s480">And so there was no, as far as I’m -- as I can say, no effective, probably, medical -- Americans are very, very nice, very kind and so on, but it was something totally uncontrolled.</span> <span id="s481">And so the -- the in -- the prisoners died, scores of them died [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: How long were you there in that area?</span> <span id="s483">How long were you in this Weimer area?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: I don’t know [indecipherable] it was si -- oh yeah, and then I come to the point which I wanted to make.</span> <span id="s485">Wa -- I took a picture --</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: -- which I still have, of that gallows.</span> <span id="s488">And I’m not sure you have it, and so on --</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: We’d very much be honored.</span> <span id="s490">We’d be very honored, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: No, I tried -- I tried to -- it’s a very poor first shot, you know what I’m saying, but yet, I would be very happy to -- to send it here --</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: I thi -- the museum would be very honored.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: -- so it would not be lost, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s495">We will follow up with this.</span> <span id="s496">We can talk about it later, of how to -- how to help acquire the picture, what is the proper procedure for sending.</span> <span id="s497">We will -- we will help with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: [indecipherable] I would be glad --</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: -- because my children are simply -- know nothing about those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s502">So you say you were in -- in Buchenwald for a very, very short time, only --</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: No, I -- in the camp itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: In the camp itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Especially in that area.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: Which I -- I-I don’t think that it remained open for a long time after my --</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: The camera that you found, that you said you ha -- do you still have that camera?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: No, of course not.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: No, no.</span> <span id="s511">That’s long gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: One of the box cameras, you know, very -- the cheapest of the cheap.</span> <span id="s513">But yet, that picture came out, and as far as I know, I hope I’ll find it, but if I do find it, I -- I’ll send it to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: I’ll be very happy to do that -- to do so.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Was it that you were numb?</span> <span id="s517">When you saw this -- you say you appreciate it more now than then.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Many people were numb when they saw such things, they couldn’t imagine --</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: -- such horror.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: They were -- they were completely shocked.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: So, was that something that -- also that -- that you could s --</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: No, I don’t think I was shocked.</span> <span id="s527">First of all, because I could not -- you see, it took me years, so to speak, to realize the -- the vastness of this operation and so on.</span> <span id="s528">It’s not that I was not moved and so on, I was very sensitive, but -- but I was a real -- that I could testify, a real attachment to the-- to the boys and admiration to the way, you know, they acted and so on.</span> <span id="s529">I remember a little Polish boy, I don’t know how he did it, but he was reading phil-philosophical books, you know.</span> <span id="s530">He was reading Rousseau and that sort of thing and yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: Do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: And then --</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Mm-hm?</span> <span id="s534">Please?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: But you have to know that that priest, Joseph Andre, after the war was asked to testify and so on and to go to Israel, the -- the state of Israel was established if I am correct, in ’48 [indecipherable] is that what it is?</span> <span id="s536">So actually he went to -- to Israel, to Yad Vashem, you know, only in September 1967.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: And that’s whe-when he received that title, and planted a tree, and so on, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: The Righteous.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: The -- yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: And actually Yad Vashem send me a couple of interviews and so on which I could send you -- to you.</span> <span id="s543">In French, unfortunately.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s545">That will be fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: So y -- a-and you said Yad Vashem sent you interviews --</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: -- done with him, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: I don’t know, I -- that I could not tell, but the document will s -- will tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Will answer your question, but I too -- Yad Vashem send me two or three articles on Joseph Andre, after he received that title and so on, then he was received a -- you kn -- in Jerusalem, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Did you ever meet any of the boys again?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: No, I -- that’s another story which is very sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Because after that, in ’68, was the United Jewish Appeal had him come in America --</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: -- and then there was a reunion of -- of the boys, it’s funny, I don’t know how they learned about the reunion and that I missed, and I -- and that I don’t forgive myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s560">And did -- but did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: But perhaps you -- you may have a few names [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: It’s possible, it’s possible.</span> <span id="s563">We can look in -- in our archives to see in Namur what kind of activities were going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Oh, oh yes</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: So it’s -- I -- I would --</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: So you would have names, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Yeah, it’s possible, it’s possible.</span> <span id="s568">But you kept in touch with the priest after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: No, tha-that’s another mistake I made, why -- and actually it’s only very recently, it’s a few weeks ago, but I met that other priest who knew him.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: And if you had told me that you wanted to make that -- this interview, I would have been able --</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: -- to get more material, but -- but ac -- I-I -- what I never understood is that, you know, I -- how little Europeans, and the Belgians in particular did.</span> <span id="s574">Because, you know that priest?</span> <span id="s575">There’s not even one article of biography on him, nothing, although he is known i-in America, and in Israel, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: What do you ho --</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: There was no -- no official -- no -- no responsible ska -- written -- carefully written biography of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: What do you put that down to?</span> <span id="s579">Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: Why is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: I don’t know, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: You know, it’s a European.</span> <span id="s585">Old Europe, I suppose.</span> <span id="s586">And that’s why I -- I mean, I always dreamt of a -- you know, of Holocaust, you know, becoming a sort of light.</span> <span id="s587">But there is something missing, there is a missing link and so on, and -- of course you -- you gather material and so on, but it never became the light you see, and -- and there there is an enormous amount of work that should be done.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: In Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: No, in here --</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Here?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: -- in everything, in the world in general.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: Could you explain a little bit more, because many people would say that that has happened already, that the Holocaust is being used as a -- as a -- as an example to teach others not to have it happen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: There I disagree with you because that’s not enough.</span> <span id="s594">Because that sacrifice, you see, that should not -- no longer, no -- I mean to -- to make the aura, you know.</span> <span id="s595">Knowing is something very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Why that -- to transform that sacrifice of a whole nation into a -- a hope, a light.</span> <span id="s598">You will agree?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Oh, of -- of course I agree.</span> <span id="s600">I agree.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Especially for the Jewish youth, and so on.</span> <span id="s602">And -- and there I see that there is work to do, but I’m too old to -- for doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: What do you think would be ne -- what do you think is still needed?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: Three things.</span> <span id="s605">First of all, you have to connect right -- no, because for me, for me is -- is not at all -- is no longer -- is not something -- I’m not centering on the horror of the thing.</span> <span id="s606">I see that as a -- a-a-as a hope, I mean the -- and recently I got to understand much better the universality of the Jewish faith, if I may use that word.</span> <span id="s607">I don’t whether I -- I hope I do not offend you, be-because the thing is that the root of western culture, although it’s called Judeo-Christian, wi -- ba -- th-the first root is the -- the col -- the vocation of Israel, for instance, that Shema and so on, for me it’s an -- wi -- although I’m a -- a ca -- believer Catholic [indecipherable] believer, there is -- for me it’s absolutely fundamental.</span> <span id="s608">And I see it -- I would not say that in a Jewish way, but for me I-I see the origin of my own Catholic faith here, right in that extraordinary history of Israel and so on.</span> <span id="s609">No, wh-what I mean to say is that first of all there’s still a tremendous amount of ignorance.</span> <span id="s610">Why -- I don’t see why, in every Catholic school, or in every public school there should not be a -- some -- a booklet or something, a very short, well written, educative information on the Jewish customs and so on and on the basic Jewish beliefs and so on.</span> <span id="s611">It could be done at a very little expense.</span> <span id="s612">Why -- di -- that’s one thing, and the second thing is that you know the west?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: Now, we underwent a cultural revolution, wi -- and now the values, the traditional values, which we call Judean-Christian values are now deconstructed and so on.</span> <span id="s615">And there there is a tremendous work to do.</span> <span id="s616">I’m not negative, and I think that in that -- what I call that cultural revolution, wi -- there is something which could be transformed into a positive [indecipherable] the values of the western culture a-are changed.</span> <span id="s617">The change has been very negative and so on, but it -- it’s also, you see, very -- i-it could be transformed into a positive -- and there I see if the Jewish -- if there could be a common formulation.</span> <span id="s618">Not that the Jews really should -- to express that basic fundamental reality, the universality of the Jewish message and so on.</span> <span id="s619">But that should not be done, you know, by grade, or I don’t know, or books and so on.</span> <span id="s620">It should be done -- it should come bottom up, you see?</span> <span id="s621">And that could be done.</span> <span id="s622">That -- that -- that could be done, because I’m sure that, first of all that there would be a communion of -- of the jewi -- because I am -- been a teacher all my life, you see and I’m oriented towards the -- the younger generation, I feel more at ease with -- but if that effort could come bottom up, wi -- through friendship, you know, networking.</span> <span id="s623">Of course, there is an intellectual work which has to be done.</span> <span id="s624">And that means educational work.</span> <span id="s625">But the reality should be friendship, should be personal counters, and start, you know, very low profile, not, you know, those big reunions.</span> <span id="s626">For instance, my daughter met David Rosen, Rabbi David Rosen, do you know him?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Mm-mm, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: No, but anyway, he’s a very outstanding person, but you know, now he’s totally identified with those groups in [indecipherable] and go to Rome and so on, and you know they captured him and so on, and that aspect of personal encounter, friendship, mutual understanding, cooperation where cooperation is possible, that is what is lacking, in my judgment.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: That’s number two.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: Number two?</span> <span id="s631">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: That’s number two, you said there were three things?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: No, number one is to formulate, if possible -- first of all to understand why the structural framework of that deconstruction, which has now been established --</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: -- and which threatens the basic Jewish faith and tradition and questions and so on, as they do for the Christian and so on.</span> <span id="s636">And so there is a commonality, because the origin of Christianity are Jewish, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: That’s right, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s639">And the basic -- my faith, the Catholic faith is based on the Bible, and -- which is Jewish experience.</span> <span id="s640">So, in other word, number one is understanding of the -- of the structure -- intellectual structure of a deconstruction wh-which si -- is contrary to the fundamental Jewish tradition which, insofar is it is common to the Christian origin.</span> <span id="s641">Right?</span> <span id="s642">Number two i-is, if possible, try to be more interactive, or more intelligent in spreading basic knowledge, even for kids and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: I see, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: In schools, and so on, and of course at the upper level even more, of Judaism, right?</span> <span id="s645">And third is that fred -- friendship business.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: The context.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: You know, [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: By internetworking, by --</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Did you -- here is an irony.</span> <span id="s651">Since we didn’t speak much before the interview, I had very little information.</span> <span id="s652">But of the little that I had, our -- our, you know, contact who told us of you said that you hadn’t spoken much about your experience during the war, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: -- okay.</span> <span id="s655">Did you tell your own children?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Did you te -- did you tell your own children --</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: No --</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: -- did you tell your own family?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: [indecipherable] little, very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: And is there a reason for that?</span> <span id="s662">Was that a conscious decision on your part?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: No, no, there was no reason, I was just --</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: Did they know --</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: -- too bashful to push myself forward, that’s about it, though.</span> <span id="s666">You know, they know about it, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Then --</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: Because in addition to that experience with the priest, you know, I always thought about --</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: -- I was connected with a -- though that was a very deep friendship and so on, and also with my wife, of a French politician named Michelait I don’t know whether you know his name.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: No, his name is not known to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: Anyway, he saved many, many Jews and so on, and he was a gr -- a great friend of mine, and he became minister, he was a friend of de Gaulle.</span> <span id="s673">He went to Dachau and se -- and so on, but in Dachau he -- he worked -- I mean, he did not work, but his association was more with the communists inmates than with the -- the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s674">But he saved, for instance, many Jewish friends I -- I have who I met here in America, just -- so that experience is a little bit divided, but I was a -- I wa -- never reluctant to speak about it and so on, it’s because my role, first of all, what I could do, except in that exceptional situation where I really risked my life for them, but I never thought I was doing much and so on.</span> <span id="s675">It’s only after the war, after the business Buchenwald that I-I realized the magnitude of the -- of the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: I read a little bit about the Holocaust in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: And comparatively to, let’s say the Netherlands, there were in -- in the articles that I read, it was stated that more people were involved in hiding and saving Jews, that f-fewer Jews died.</span> <span id="s679">St-still many, many --</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: Mm.</span> <span id="s681">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: -- over half were killed, but the percentages were lower in -- in Belgium --</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: -- than in the Netherlands.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: And in some of the other surrounding countries and that there were a number of factors that contributed to that.</span> <span id="s687">Is that something that you found also to be --</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: No, I am not aware of that at all, just --</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: -- no.</span> <span id="s691">But I am aware of the number of people who performed, you know, heroic action around that -- that system, that little system we -- I was a-associated with.</span> <span id="s692">I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Was your family -- did your family know what you were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: No, no, no, not the family, not the -- none of the family.</span> <span id="s695">The people around , for instance, there -- you know, there was a -- a bakery and -- a bakery that supplied bread, you know, as a [indecipherable] and so on, and -- and that woman really was heroic, heroic.</span> <span id="s696">She was leaving [indecipherable] not very far from the center.</span> <span id="s697">And that sort of thing, a p-place to a-avoid the family, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Your family --</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: And go through the --</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: -- your --</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: -- not my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: -- no, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Yeah, [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: -- did they know what you were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: They -- no, of course not.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Okay, so neither your parents, nor your brothers or your sisters --</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: No, no, of course not.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: And that was entirely an un -- individual decision and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: Did you speak of --</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: But I do not mean to say that -- no, I -- I was [indecipherable] or that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s712">I ju-just accepted -- I did not even consciously accepted the risk.</span> <span id="s713">I did it as a service for the -- the children, the boys we had, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Do you remember their names, any of the names of the boys?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: We actually never knew them, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: Bless you.</span> <span id="s719">Did yo -- did they stay for just a certain period of this time in this house and then move on?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: Were there always different boys that were coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: No -- oh yes.</span> <span id="s723">Yes, yes, but that was, I think -- I believed at the time that [indecipherable] it was some Jewish organization taking care of that circulation and moving the boys and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: And they were very effective, as proved, as I said, by the coupon -- or they probably printed them, or I don’t know, stole them, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: But we received whole sheets, you know, of -- of --</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: Of those ration tickets?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: Yeah, the ration tickets.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: Can you tell me a little bit more, I wasn’t very clear about the French connection, this man who you said was a minister under de Gaulle and had spent time in Dachau.</span> <span id="s731">Was your contact with him after the war, or during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: No, it was mostly after the war, because during the war he actually was the mayor of this town in southern France, the middle of France, and he printed, you know, identification paper -- i-identity papers and so on, and -- and saved, actually saved them.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: But he was captured fe -- I forgot what it was, but I think it was fairly early.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: I see, I see.</span> <span id="s736">Is there anything else from your notes that you would like to --</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: No, as far as I know, let me see.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: To -- a -- a -- I remember -- I-I recall that it -- the priest came in ’68 --</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: Invited by the Jewish appeal in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: What was his last name?</span> <span id="s743">Was -- you said that --</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: Andre, Andre.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Andre?</span> <span id="s746">I thought that was like a middle name.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: No, no, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: No, no, that was his last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: Andre [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A:
