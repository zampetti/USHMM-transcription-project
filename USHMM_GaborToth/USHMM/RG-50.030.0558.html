id="s10">November 8, 2008</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Question: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Helena Swierczynska, in Arlington – I’m sorry, in Alexandria, VA on November 8th, 2008.</span> <span id="s12">And the interview is conducted by Stephanie Blyskal.</span> <span id="s13">Good evening, thank you for letting us interview you.</span> <span id="s14">Can you start out telling me your name at birth, and where you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Answer: My name is Helena Swierczynska.</span> <span id="s16">I was born on the April 2nd, 1943, in Poland, in the place called Mielitz(ph).</span> <span id="s17">I’m not positive, I’m not sure hundred percent that this is exactly where th – I was born, but that’s what is in my birth certificate.</span> <span id="s18">My family was in hiding.</span> <span id="s19">Year 1943 was the worst year for Jews, ever, in Poland.</span> <span id="s20">Until today I don’t understand how my mom could afford to get pregnant, you know, during such a horrible time.</span> <span id="s21">But anyhow, she had the baby in hiding.</span> <span id="s22">Most of my family was hiding in the – the – in the barn.</span> <span id="s23">The family lived in a small village.</span> <span id="s24">We had a little bit of land, couple houses, nothing big.</span> <span id="s25">But enough, big enough to be hated by all Polish neighbors.</span> <span id="s26">So my family, which means my grandmother, my grandpa, and bunch of cousins, they were hiding in the barn – paying, of course, huge money for it.</span> <span id="s27">And my mom had me that summer, I don’t know where, and with help of midwife.</span> <span id="s28">Well, the midwife, she was Polish, and she didn't want to have a Jew – Jewish baby, you know, for longer than few hours.</span> <span id="s29">So she kept me actually one day after I was born.</span> <span id="s30">And then my mom, you know, after delivery, she was sick, not able to – to do nothing.</span> <span id="s31">So my two uncles, my mom’s brothers, they came to pick me up.</span> <span id="s32">It is very important to understand that I was one day – one day old.</span> <span id="s33">My – my mom was the only daughter, and she had four brothers.</span> <span id="s34">Two of them, they took me from that midwife, to the place that the family was hiding.</span> <span id="s35">And I was crying and crying and crying.</span> <span id="s36">By the way, I just learned this all few years ago.</span> <span id="s37">I had no idea what happened to me.</span> <span id="s38">But my uncle who – who was about to die, finally he felt that he needs to tell me something.</span> <span id="s39">So that’s how I learned, you know.</span> <span id="s40">Today I am 65, and I was probably about 60 when the – you know, I learned what happened to me.</span> <span id="s41">So anyhow, I was crying, I was screaming.</span> <span id="s42">Probably I was hungry, I was wet.</span> <span id="s43">And all those people hiding there were scared that, you know, they gonna be killed because of me.</span> <span id="s44">So my grandma, according to my uncle, my grandma decided that I cannot be with them.</span> <span id="s45">She came up with an idea that she’ll – they will put me on – on the ground where people walk by a lot, and somebody will see a crying baby and will take the baby.</span> <span id="s46">That’s what she was hoping.</span> <span id="s47">Well, nothing like this happened.</span> <span id="s48">They put me on that frozen ground.</span> <span id="s49">It – you know, the beginning of April in Poland – I don’t even think it was April, cause the – there is no certain date, you know, that’s – probably it was in March, because it was very, bitterly cold.</span> <span id="s50">So they put me, you know, on that cold ground, you know, and they were looking through, you know, sort of the hole in the wall, looking at me what’s gonna happen.</span> <span id="s51">And people were walking – were walking by, and nobody stopped.</span> <span id="s52">Nobody stopped.</span> <span id="s53">I was screaming like crazy, they were crying.</span> <span id="s54">Finally, after I don’t know how many hours, my grandma said no, I – I cannot do this.</span> <span id="s55">She decided, you know, to take me back and when night came, my two uncles took me – still, you know, screaming, to the house of the lady, very simple woman, who was apparently mentally sick and nobody talked with her.</span> <span id="s56">People were scared of her.</span> <span id="s57">So she was without of contact with – with anybody.</span> <span id="s58">And her house was on the – on the skirt of that village.</span> <span id="s59">They took me there, cause they thought, she’s alone, maybe she will take the baby.</span> <span id="s60">So one year old baby – I mean, one day old baby – this is very important and that’s why I repeat it, you know, they put me on her steps.</span> <span id="s61">I was screaming.</span> <span id="s62">She opened the door, she saw the baby, she took me in.</span> <span id="s63">So this was ’43.</span> <span id="s64">I was in her house until ’45.</span> <span id="s65">No idea how – how – what happened during this time.</span> <span id="s66">I might suspect that when I was crying, she was beating me up, because, you know, she was scared, too.</span> <span id="s67">So, actually – okay, of course, there was no milk.</span> <span id="s68">I was feeding, you know, with potatoes and water.</span> <span id="s69">I don’t know how this happened that I survived.</span> <span id="s70">It’s – I’ve talked to the doctors, they say they never heard about such a thing.</span> <span id="s71">But anyhow, what happened during these two years, my mom, of course – my father was in a forest, hiding there.</span> <span id="s72">And my mom was very depressed.</span> <span id="s73">She was 19.</span> <span id="s74">She lost her baby, which she never touched.</span> <span id="s75">She didn’t have parents and family.</span> <span id="s76">So she, one day she decided to go where they were hiding to see her mom and her dad.</span> <span id="s77">And the people who in the meantime took over our houses, our land, these people saw d – her going there.</span> <span id="s78">And they let know to the police – Polish police, which was working very close with Gestapo, and th-the Germans came, killed almost everybody immediately.</span> <span id="s79">My two uncles, they were not there, they were hiding in the fields.</span> <span id="s80">So my mom, apparently that they – they didn’t kill her at once, but she was hurt badly.</span> <span id="s81">And a few years ago, I went there.</span> <span id="s82">I was told not to by many people, because the people living there, they remember the family.</span> <span id="s83">They stole everything which belongs to us, and I was told it’s dangerous to – even to be around, especially that I look hundred percent like my dad, so I am very easy to recognize.</span> <span id="s84">But I did, I go, I did go there.</span> <span id="s85">And I saw – I met li – a lady who was – I was just asking million questions, you know, and just between one sentence and the other, she told me about my family.</span> <span id="s86">I couldn't believe my ears, but I – I didn’t even ask about the family.</span> <span id="s87">But she started to say, oh, we’ve had the Jews, you know, here.</span> <span id="s88">There were parents and five kids, you know.</span> <span id="s89">There was one – one girl and four brothers.</span> <span id="s90">And that girl, she had a baby that’s – the lady is telling me, you know, I am standing in front of her.</span> <span id="s91">And – and she says, but that baby for sure didn’t survive, she says.</span> <span id="s92">And she says, I will never forget the scene the day they killed all – all that family, you know, hiding there.</span> <span id="s93">And she was not killed immediately, but she was hurt badly.</span> <span id="s94">And she had the long hair.</span> <span id="s95">They grabbed her, you know, for the hair, and they were dragging her through the main street of that village to the nearest forest.</span> <span id="s96">And they then – she was killed there.</span> <span id="s97">And that woman tells me, you know, I – this – I – I can see like today, you know, that blood, you know, behind this woman.</span> <span id="s98">She had no idea who she talking to, and I had a dilemma, you know.</span> <span id="s99">I – I wasn’t sure – I mean, that was no time to think it over, but I – you know, I wanted to do something with this, so before I left, you know – I was with my husband, by the way, he is Polish, and he was shocked even more than I was.</span> <span id="s100">And my husband says, let’s go, let’s go, don’t – don’t stay here.</span> <span id="s101">But before I left, you know, I ask her, do you know whom you’re talking to?</span> <span id="s102">And she says no.</span> <span id="s103">I said, I am that baby, and I survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: And you have my houses, my land and everything.</span> <span id="s106">You will never, ever be with – in peace with this.</span> <span id="s107">That’s how I left.</span> <span id="s108">So, you know.</span> <span id="s109">But going back, okay, so – so I left.</span> <span id="s110">I mean, I lost everybody.</span> <span id="s111">I had only my father and two uncles.</span> <span id="s112">My father survived the war, he was in hiding in the forest.</span> <span id="s113">And he, right – you know, when – when war – you know, was over, the Russians came in, because I’m talking about eastern –</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: – Poland.</span> <span id="s116">So first, you know, they didn’t see Americans, they – they saw Russians, and the Russians, you know, came in and my father somehow was able to get in touch with my – one of my uncles, and he knew where I was, you know, in which house you know, I was, you know.</span> <span id="s117">He knew I survived.</span> <span id="s118">So, it was – he came in the evening.</span> <span id="s119">So, he decided to wait until the morning to pick me up, you know, take me from there.</span> <span id="s120">And one of those Polish people, you know, who – I can say it, they killed my family, okay, saw him, and they got scared.</span> <span id="s121">So, what they did, they killed him, just from outside of the house through the window.</span> <span id="s122">He was shot and killed immediately.</span> <span id="s123">My uncle who was with him, he saw it, he run to the street, and the – the Russian tanks, you know, were coming, you know.</span> <span id="s124">He stops one of the tanks and he says, oh, th-th-th-the Pol – Polish guy just killed a Jew, you know?</span> <span id="s125">And that guy, the Russian guy says, do you know who, exactly?</span> <span id="s126">My uncle says, yeah.</span> <span id="s127">My uncle, the one who told me this story, which I was waiting, you know, 50 year – 60 years to hear.</span> <span id="s128">And he said, yes, I know.</span> <span id="s129">Show me.</span> <span id="s130">Well, Russians killed the guy, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Just like this.</span> <span id="s133">So, okay.</span> <span id="s134">So I had two uncles, young men.</span> <span id="s135">Because you know, four kids, my mom was the oldest.</span> <span id="s136">So my mom was like – more like a mother to them, okay?</span> <span id="s137">They – they came to pick me up – well, actually, they – he told me with this – I’m gonna tell you a lot of bitter words about Jews.</span> <span id="s138">I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Mm-hm, it’s fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: But my uncles, you know, they didn’t take care of me.</span> <span id="s141">He told me that when he came, you know, to see me, you know, I was behaving like – like a little animal.</span> <span id="s142">I was hiding everywhere, I – I didn’t let anybody to come close to me.</span> <span id="s143">I was – you know, sick.</span> <span id="s144">Later, you know, I – I – you know, the doctors discovered I had tuberculosis, I am surprised only tuberculosis, you know.</span> <span id="s145">And I didn’t speak.</span> <span id="s146">I – I ha – hardly walk.</span> <span id="s147">I was – I was just like, you know, like animal.</span> <span id="s148">So he was not even able to – to come close to me and touch me.</span> <span id="s149">So they left me.</span> <span id="s150">They left me and this woman, she didn’t want me.</span> <span id="s151">I don’t thinks she ever liked me, but you know, it was something human in her that she took me in.</span> <span id="s152">But anyway, as soon as it was possible, she put me in the orphanage home.</span> <span id="s153">It was ’45 -’46, a lot of anti-Semitism in Poland til today.</span> <span id="s154">So, I started my second holocaust, which I am very disappointed, you know, like [indecipherable] you know, you talk a lot about, you know, what happened, how was the war, this and that.</span> <span id="s155">Nobody talks about people after the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s156">People – especially about the people who were still in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: And had to face, you know, another holocaust, another hatred, another anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Can I just stop you for one minute –</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: – and ask you one question.</span> <span id="s162">What di – you have no memories of being in this house with this woman –</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: – who was taking care of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: What – and we’re probably going to get to this, but what do you think your first memory was?</span> <span id="s167">What’s the first thing that you remember as a – as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: The – the orphanage home.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s170">And where – where was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Hoo.</span> <span id="s172">How many, you should ask.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: How many were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: So where did you start out?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: So, I was in orphanage home in Kraków, in Zheshuv, in Kielce and Radom.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s180">So – so when s –</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: They seventh – you know, the thing was, nobody wanted to adopt me.</span> <span id="s182">Ah.</span> <span id="s183">And my uncle, my beautiful family, they just escaped Poland.</span> <span id="s184">Poland was a dangerous place to live, so they just escaped, they left me.</span> <span id="s185">Like piece of nothing, garbage.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: How –</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Little girl, completely unprotected, with nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: And they – first they went to Breslau, [indecipherable] then from there to Germany.</span> <span id="s190">From Germany to America.</span> <span id="s191">And I was still alive, one orphanage home, second, third, fourth, fifth.</span> <span id="s192">Many, many kids were adopted.</span> <span id="s193">And I remember nobody wanted me.</span> <span id="s194">I was ugly.</span> <span id="s195">I know I am – I am good looking now.</span> <span id="s196">I am like a, you know, wine, which you know, ge – as more is – older it is, is better, yeah.</span> <span id="s197">I am somehow – yeah, I am kind of attractive woman comparing my age, of course.</span> <span id="s198">But, as a – as a child, I was ugly, and I didn’t speak.</span> <span id="s199">I hardly walk.</span> <span id="s200">I peed in my pants, you know, until I was probably 11 or 12.</span> <span id="s201">Scared to death, and physically sick.</span> <span id="s202">So, it was – it was very difficult, and this I remember.</span> <span id="s203">Seeing, you know, a lot of kids, you know, going with the other families, and I was still there.</span> <span id="s204">And because, you know, it was after war, you know, lack of money and this and that.</span> <span id="s205">So they were closing one home and open another one, and they were transferring, you know, kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: So that’s how, you know, I was traveling.</span> <span id="s208">And one day, I was seven years old, look how many years I’ve – I – I was there, came the man, by himself.</span> <span id="s209">He was looking for somebody to adopt.</span> <span id="s210">He was by himself, without a wife, which was stupid, because that kind of decision should be, you know, taken by both parents.</span> <span id="s211">But, you know, she probably told him, well, whatever you do, you know, I agree.</span> <span id="s212">So he saw me, he was very good man, and he said, her.</span> <span id="s213">So to – they adopted me.</span> <span id="s214">Unfortunately, she disliked me from the first moment she saw me.</span> <span id="s215">Actually, you know, now, looking you know to the back from the perspective, all the years of experience and, you know, knowledge, I got about life, about people, I think she was mentally sick.</span> <span id="s216">And her behavior, you know, is really difficult to explain.</span> <span id="s217">But I know it now.</span> <span id="s218">As a little kid, you know, I just felt, not only not loved, but just – you know, being hated, you know.</span> <span id="s219">Very scary thing to somebody like me, who hardly survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Anyhow, he was wonderful guy, but he was weak man, and she was the one with – with the pants, you know, so they both were communists and she was, as I say, more red than the red flag.</span> <span id="s222">So maybe that’s why I never enrolled in communist party, and everything which goes with communists, you know, is, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Right, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: – against what I believe in.</span> <span id="s225">Because I dislike her with all my heart.</span> <span id="s226">So this was my third holocaust.</span> <span id="s227">And she hated me that much, that finally it came to the point that I had a choice, to get married with whoever and then get out, or just to go on the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: So, you know, I got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: How old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: 19.</span> <span id="s232">And the guy, he knew I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s233">I knew nothing about my family.</span> <span id="s234">What I told you now, I learned few years ago.</span> <span id="s235">I knew nothing, zero.</span> <span id="s236">I knew I am a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: That’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Did you have – still have your birth certificate with you, did you have paper –</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: I never – I ne –</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Like, how did they know your name, how did they know –</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: I had zero documents.</span> <span id="s243">All I have is one picture of my dad, that my uncle gave me, nothing about my mom.</span> <span id="s244">And my birth certificate was written after the war, wher – and th-there – there is, you know, a note, parents un – unknown, you know.</span> <span id="s245">So actually, I’m not certain of the day, I’m not certain on the place, you know.</span> <span id="s246">It’s just – it just a – a document –</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: – means nothing to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Did your uncles – when – your uncle when he dropped you off at the orphanage, or however you got there, he gave you your information?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: No, no –</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: – no, no.</span> <span id="s253">What happened with them, th-they f – they came to America, and before they came to America they – they started to make money in Poland selling this and that, you know, it was popular then.</span> <span id="s254">Popular way to make money.</span> <span id="s255">But anyhow, no, actually they like crossed me out.</span> <span id="s256">And I didn’t know –</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: – about them.</span> <span id="s259">I – I didn’t know nothing, until one day – one day.</span> <span id="s260">My oldest uncle, he was about to be called to Korea in ’53.</span> <span id="s261">And he was afraid that he might not come back.</span> <span id="s262">So he decided to look for me.</span> <span id="s263">I mean, it was something, you know, he was, I guess, afraid to face the God.</span> <span id="s264">He started to look for me through Red Cross, because they – first, you know, they contact the – the orphanage ho-home they know I was – that – that address changed and changed.</span> <span id="s265">They went through Red Cross, and finally he was able to find me being adopted to those people.</span> <span id="s266">The name was Zyro, z-y-r-o.</span> <span id="s267">But I just got married.</span> <span id="s268">So, sort of like he wanted to do something for me.</span> <span id="s269">Actually, it was too late.</span> <span id="s270">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: I – I guess I’m wondering how the people at the orphanage knew who you were.</span> <span id="s272">Like, how they knew your name, how they knew when you were supposedly born.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: They probably called – they – they gave me the name, and you know, it was following – following me from one place to another.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: So, they si – they probably knew your last name.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: No, no, no –</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: – no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Because you know, that uncle I’m talking about, he’s the one who told me –</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: – this whole story a few years ago, before he died.</span> <span id="s282">And he didn’t know my name, and nothing.</span> <span id="s283">You know, I was just born.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: You know.</span> <span id="s286">They w – they all – I mean, th – th – my uncles, they were young men.</span> <span id="s287">And I am surprised that – which I told him, cause I am very open person, you know, and if I have something to say, I do say, no matter what.</span> <span id="s288">And I told him once, I asked him, how could you leave such a little baby after this all, and just escape, you know, to – how can you, you know, leave like this, with this knowledge?</span> <span id="s289">He said oh, you know, we were so young, we – we win – we knew we had – we have to escape.</span> <span id="s290">What do we do a do – what do we – we do with such a baby, you know, we – we – we wouldn’t even know what to do.</span> <span id="s291">And I said, hey, people you know, go to concentrate camp, you know, go t – you know, to air – anything and everything, the family is together.</span> <span id="s292">We – the – people were dying because they wanted to be together.</span> <span id="s293">So there is no way, never ever, that I can understand and forgive.</span> <span id="s294">And I told him this.</span> <span id="s295">I told him this.</span> <span id="s296">So – but anyway, so I – I knew I have a family in America, okay?</span> <span id="s297">Well, I thought they, maybe they – they can help me, or whatever.</span> <span id="s298">Well, the life in Poland was not easy.</span> <span id="s299">One thing I have to say positive about my step-mom.</span> <span id="s300">As bad as she was to me as a mom, she was very demanding in terms of education.</span> <span id="s301">She pushed me hard, so I had to go, you know, higher and higher and higher.</span> <span id="s302">And this is something that, I have to admit it, I have because of her.</span> <span id="s303">How much I need it, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s304">Well, definitely it’s useful, but anyhow, with my first husband, I – I had the first son who died shortly after was born.</span> <span id="s305">It was sort of pathology you know, probably, it doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s306">But it still hurt, you know.</span> <span id="s307">Then, I had another son, and my son, Robert, he’s gonna be 40 in few days.</span> <span id="s308">He’s everything I have.</span> <span id="s309">So one day, I, before he graduated from the high school, I send him to America for a vacation, to see the friends, and – and he fell in love with America.</span> <span id="s310">He got crazy about America, you know, he loved everything here.</span> <span id="s311">He begged me, Mom, I love this country.</span> <span id="s312">Do whatever you can, come here and we will stay here.</span> <span id="s313">Well, you know, I have only one son, and as I say, nothing else matters in my life.</span> <span id="s314">So I said okay, I’ll try, I’ll see.</span> <span id="s315">Took me three years to get Polish passport, because it still – we had the communist.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Communist there, and ma – I was constantly told by – by the authorities that I’m too high educated, I’m needed in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: So they didn’t want me – they didn’t want me to – to – to leave Poland.</span> <span id="s320">So my son was here for three years by himself, calling me constantly, spending all the money, you know, he was able to make, you know, on the phone, see, it costs fortune then.</span> <span id="s321">And he said, Mom, if you don’t come, I’ll come back.</span> <span id="s322">So I, you know, put myself, you know, on – on my – you know, almost upside-down, you know, and finally I got the passport, and I came here.</span> <span id="s323">I was hoping that my family, my two uncles, they will help me, if not for myself, maybe for their parents, or maybe for their only one sister.</span> <span id="s324">Stupid me.</span> <span id="s325">Nothing.</span> <span id="s326">And because I came, you know, for a visit, I had no papers, no green card, no driver’s license, nothing.</span> <span id="s327">So, I had to start from the scratch.</span> <span id="s328">My son, he is a genius.</span> <span id="s329">It’s out of question.</span> <span id="s330">It’s not because he is my son, and you will understand why, I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s331">I know when mom talks about own child, mom thinks it’s – his child – her child is the best in the world.</span> <span id="s332">I’m not easy to – to praise anything and anybody, I am very difficult, you know.</span> <span id="s333">But my son surprises me every single day of my life.</span> <span id="s334">He never went to college.</span> <span id="s335">He doesn’t have any degree, all he’s got is high school.</span> <span id="s336">Because when I came ho – here, he was working in a factory as, you know, it was a – a – I don’t know how to call it, steel, you know?</span> <span id="s337">Steel, they – they, you know, were – were processing, you know, out all you know, like iron and everything.</span> <span id="s338">So, he had to work physically, you know.</span> <span id="s339">They didn’t have proper equipment, so mostly he had to, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Manual labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: – put manually, you know, tons of things, you know, into the press, which his back is hurt and there will be suffering until the – the last, you know, day of his life.</span> <span id="s342">But he loved America.</span> <span id="s343">As of me, I started to clean the houses.</span> <span id="s344">First, I was stupid enough to rich to Jewish people.</span> <span id="s345">Not far from where we were renting an apartment, there was a synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: And where were you living at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Skokie</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: And, you know, I know nothing about religion, about Jews, ye – you know, there are – there were no Jews around me.</span> <span id="s350">Tabula rasa, if you know what it means.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: Mm-hm, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: So, but I did go to synagogue, and I talked to the rabbi, and I told him my story.</span> <span id="s353">And I said, rabbi, I – I’m not looking for you to give me the money, what I need is a job, any job, simple job, because we have no bread –</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: – on the table.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: And this is the 1980s?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: This was the beginning of 90 – 1990.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: Mm-hm, because I came to America it was in September ’89.</span> <span id="s360">So it was a couple – couple months later, okay?</span> <span id="s361">And what the rabbi said, oh, he was touched of course, he was touched.</span> <span id="s362">It’s hard not to be touched by this story, the story of, you know, one day old baby left alone.</span> <span id="s363">He said, well, I don’t have a job for you, but if you want you can clean my house.</span> <span id="s364">And I said okay, I will do that.</span> <span id="s365">And you know what?</span> <span id="s366">I did clean his house, took me over 10 hours.</span> <span id="s367">He paid me 40 dollars, and I had never, ever seen as dirty, filthy house in my life.</span> <span id="s368">Never before and never after.</span> <span id="s369">They had like five cats or something, you know, the cobwebs.</span> <span id="s370">That stuff from the cats, you know, underneath of the beds.</span> <span id="s371">I couldn’t believe that the house could be that dirty, you know.</span> <span id="s372">That’s how rabbi helped me.</span> <span id="s373">Well, actually, he cured me.</span> <span id="s374">I never, ever went rich to Jews.</span> <span id="s375">Never.</span> <span id="s376">And you would not talk to me today, if not one friend of mine.</span> <span id="s377">She – she tries, you know, to bring me, you know, closer.</span> <span id="s378">But I’m still in denial, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: There’s too – too many bad things.</span> <span id="s381">And the funny thing about Polish people, you know, is they – first of all they think, you Jew?</span> <span id="s382">Oh, you must be rich.</span> <span id="s383">That’s one – one thing.</span> <span id="s384">The second thing, you Jew?</span> <span id="s385">Ooh, Jew – Jewish – Jewish organizations, they help.</span> <span id="s386">They give you this, they give you that.</span> <span id="s387">Bullshit, I’m sorry to say it –</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: That’s okay, that’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: – but please to understand, this is what is in my heart.</span> <span id="s390">It’s not true at all.</span> <span id="s391">Nobody helped me with the green card.</span> <span id="s392">How I got the green card?</span> <span id="s393">I, you know win – I – I – I mean won, in a lottery.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Me.</span> <span id="s396">I’m not lucky person, I won.</span> <span id="s397">For me, for my husband and for my son, we got green card.</span> <span id="s398">But anyhow, America – America is my furt(ph) kolokowst(ph).</span> <span id="s399">Very difficult country.</span> <span id="s400">Not for young people.</span> <span id="s401">For my son, he loves America.</span> <span id="s402">He’s actually American.</span> <span id="s403">He speaks like American you know, no accent, nothing.</span> <span id="s404">He just absorbed everything easily, immediately.</span> <span id="s405">For me, I was 45, between 45 - 46 actually.</span> <span id="s406">Start from scratch, learn English, go so much down from where I was, was almost impossible.</span> <span id="s407">My so – my – my husband followed me – my second husband, because the first one, I, you know, divorce after 11 years.</span> <span id="s408">It was – was always very difficult for me to – to divorce husband, because you know, I – I was doing everything possible to keep the family.</span> <span id="s409">But, he was nobody.</span> <span id="s410">I mean, nobody.</span> <span id="s411">He is still my son’s father.</span> <span id="s412">He is zero.</span> <span id="s413">One day, finally, you know, when the laugh was over, he told me, you dirty Jew.</span> <span id="s414">So I divorced him.</span> <span id="s415">It was very difficult, he didn’t want to give me divorce.</span> <span id="s416">He fight it.</span> <span id="s417">Maybe he loved me, but in the way, you know, I could not accept.</span> <span id="s418">My son was four years old.</span> <span id="s419">And remembering the background, you know, where I’m coming from, it was so dif – so – so important for me to be f – for my son, you know, no matter what.</span> <span id="s420">So I, you know, I met another man.</span> <span id="s421">Of course Polish too, because as I say, no –</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: – no Jewish in Poland at all, and in America, I don’t have Jews around me.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: You know, I live in a neighborhood, there are no Jews.</span> <span id="s426">No synagogues, nothing, and not that I care, you know, but that’s how it is.</span> <span id="s427">So, my second husband, he – he is a good man, but America was too much for him.</span> <span id="s428">He followed me, he followed me up here, and he couldn’t stand America.</span> <span id="s429">First of all, he was not able to learn English, so for him, very good engineer, somebody really important, V.I.P. in Poland, and suddenly here, nobody.</span> <span id="s430">And it’s not that he didn’t try.</span> <span id="s431">I know he was trying hard to learn English, he just was not able.</span> <span id="s432">So, one day, it was 10 years ago, he told me, Helena, I can’t stay here.</span> <span id="s433">I want to go back.</span> <span id="s434">And he said, you should go back with me, because Robert, my son, you know, he’s gonna hav – have own family, and you know, besides, you work too hard in America.</span> <span id="s435">And in Poland you gonna be a lady.</span> <span id="s436">You may do nothing, or a little.</span> <span id="s437">What I was doing here, you know, after cleaning, I was taking care of old people.</span> <span id="s438">Then I, when I got green card, my first job, nursing home, I was cleaning after dead people.</span> <span id="s439">That was my job.</span> <span id="s440">For almost two years.</span> <span id="s441">And one day, my supervisor – I wa – I was part of housekeeping department, my supervisor realized that, you know, I am worth much more, and I’m able to be in charge of people, and this and that.</span> <span id="s442">And he might get some cash, you know, for me, if he finds me a job.</span> <span id="s443">Which I had no idea, at the moment.</span> <span id="s444">He asked me if I want to be a supervisor.</span> <span id="s445">And I said, I’m too old.</span> <span id="s446">I was like 48, you know.</span> <span id="s447">He says no, that’s the perfect time, you know.</span> <span id="s448">So, I was a supervisor, it was next step.</span> <span id="s449">Then, account manager, then manager.</span> <span id="s450">So working hard and hard and hard, I got somewhere.</span> <span id="s451">With pretty mo – pretty good money.</span> <span id="s452">But I lost my marriage, and my husband, I divorce him, because I told him, you know, you have to be here or there, you cannot be little bit here, little bit there, you know.</span> <span id="s453">And he said, I can’t.</span> <span id="s454">America is not for me.</span> <span id="s455">And I said, look, I cannot, you know, leave my son alone.</span> <span id="s456">He’s got nobody.</span> <span id="s457">And – and that’s how it ended up.</span> <span id="s458">My son, when he was 20, that place he worked, you know, at, a couple American guys, they offered him, they – you know, they realized that he – he is very talented [indecipherable] I mean, I – it’s – you know, I have no answer for this, because the guy, whatever he touches, it’s superb.</span> <span id="s459">If he cooks, it’s, you know, superb cooking, you know, it’s – I – I don’t know.</span> <span id="s460">I – I – I didn’t teach him, you know.</span> <span id="s461">Whatever he does, he just – he does excellent job.</span> <span id="s462">And he’s very handy in terms of electronic, and cell phones.</span> <span id="s463">So they, together they started cellular phone dealership, 20 years ago.</span> <span id="s464">He was 20 years then.</span> <span id="s465">In the meantime, one guy got killed in motorcycle accident.</span> <span id="s466">The other one, something happened, so in the meantime he just – he is alone, he is the only one.</span> <span id="s467">And this company is still alive.</span> <span id="s468">This company goes through, you know, hard time, like – like whole – whole economy, you know, but we’re still in business.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: Hold on for one second.</span> <span id="s470">[tape break] I want to go back to your adopted parents, if it’s not too difficult for you.</span> <span id="s471">Did – did they want you to change your name, did they give you their last name?</span> <span id="s472">Did they ask you to sort of take on their identity as a family?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s474">Being adopted in Poland meant that, you know, automatically, I had their name.</span> <span id="s475">So, actually, th-there was no-nothing which would show that I was adopted, okay?</span> <span id="s476">I had a new birth certificate with their names as mom and dad.</span> <span id="s477">So that’s how it is.</span> <span id="s478">They both – they were Jews, but they never talked about this, and it was like a – something to be ashamed of, you know.</span> <span id="s479">They never admitted to anything from this area, you know.</span> <span id="s480">Just – they were very much involved in what happened in Poland they – those years, and I am not proud of it, because my step-mom, she was teaching – I don’t know how to say in English, but you know, probably Marx, Lenin –</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: Okay, this –</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: So, she was teaching communist –</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Communist –</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: – history, communist theory?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Ideology.</span> <span id="s487">Oh, that.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Ideology, yeah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: So, she was very, very difficult and, you know.</span> <span id="s490">And he was working for the – for the government, so they were – you know, they were very, very much involved in what was going on.</span> <span id="s491">And they were close-minded in terms of ideology.</span> <span id="s492">Everything was stupid, you know, and worth nothing, only – only this.</span> <span id="s493">He died first, due to cancer, throat cancer.</span> <span id="s494">I loved him with all my heart.</span> <span id="s495">I was taking care of him until, you know, he – he passed away.</span> <span id="s496">She hated me, she was kicking me out, she didn’t want me to take care of him.</span> <span id="s497">And well, you know, she was kicking me out through the door, I was coming back through the window, because he was so sick that I – I had to wash him, you know, feeding him.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: How – how old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: He was 70, it was 25 years ago –</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: – he passed away.</span> <span id="s502">But I promised to myself that I’m not going to do it to – to her.</span> <span id="s503">Because I told her, if you are a human being, you have to let him die in peace.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: She knew what was wrong with him.</span> <span id="s506">She knew that there is no cure, that he has to die.</span> <span id="s507">We didn’t even – we d – we only didn’t know when.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Okay, because there is no doctor who would tell you exactly when somebody will die, okay, and regardless, you know, her ego was stronger.</span> <span id="s510">So, I told her, if you will not let him die, give hi – give him that comfort, you know, of dying in peace, I will pay you back, and I will never, ever take care of you if – when you need it.</span> <span id="s511">That’s what I told her.</span> <span id="s512">And that’s exactly what happened, because when she was dying, I paid people to take care of her.</span> <span id="s513">But me, by myself, I didn’t touch her.</span> <span id="s514">That’s how I could, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: – pay her for – for that hell, you know, she, you know, had for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: So that’s all about my – my parents, I can tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: How – you said you – you visited synagogues.</span> <span id="s520">Have you ever – I guess the best way to ask this is, what is your feeling about being Jewish and – and religion itself?</span> <span id="s521">Do you see that as – as part of your life now, or have you ever had a con – a relationship with – with Judaism as a religion, or is it just –</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: You know, when I – when I came to America, I was not religious at all, because my parents, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: Mm, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Communists, they – they don’t believe in – in God, and you know, in anything, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: – actually, I was raised without of – any religion.</span> <span id="s527">As of, you know, Jewish religion, my uncles, you know, when I came here, he – they did nothing to bring me close to this religion.</span> <span id="s528">So for me, I don’t go to synagogue, very seldom.</span> <span id="s529">Her grandson, he had the Bar Mitzvah, you know, I was there.</span> <span id="s530">But I always, you know, I feel like, you know, like – like I’m watching something from outside, you know.</span> <span id="s531">It’s too late for me to be involved.</span> <span id="s532">It’s just too late.</span> <span id="s533">It’s not that I am in denial, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: – but you have to be raised to understand – I am open to anything and everything, you know, that’s how I raised my son, you know.</span> <span id="s536">We – we don’t have a borders, you know, in terms of religion, and you know, in terms of everything, you know.</span> <span id="s537">We have to be open and understand other people who think maybe differently.</span> <span id="s538">But no, definitely, you know, I am not – my heart is not there.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Did – did you, when you came to the United States, and obviously you did have discussions with your uncle, even if it was late in his life, did you see them at all when they were here?</span> <span id="s540">Did they live near you?</span> <span id="s541">Did you try to –</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: Very seldom.</span> <span id="s543">Okay –</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: – did you try to contact them?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: Very seldom, okay.</span> <span id="s546">The one – th-the oldest one i-i-is dead, and he died like maybe five years ago.</span> <span id="s547">The o – the other one is alive, but we d – we don’t live close, you know.</span> <span id="s548">He o – of course, he – he lives in very, very rich, you know, area.</span> <span id="s549">I, by myself, live in very beautiful area, and well known, if you know Chicago.</span> <span id="s550">Saint Charles is extremely, you know, beautiful place.</span> <span id="s551">A lot of antiques, you know, and it’s more like, you know, you in the country, you know, but when you s – when you tell people that you live in Saint Charles, they say oh.</span> <span id="s552">Well, I’m there because my son –</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: – did th-that – that far, you know, that’s why.</span> <span id="s555">And we stay very close.</span> <span id="s556">But my uncle, you know, he – he must feel guilty, very guilty, because every holiday, Jewish holiday, they want me to come over.</span> <span id="s557">Regardless I like it or not, you know, I have to be with them.</span> <span id="s558">Maybe this is one of the reasons that I don’t like these holidays.</span> <span id="s559">Because, you know, if you, for a whole year, you know, show no heart, no – not – n-no interest in – in somebody’s life, and twice a year, you know, you want to show other people that you are a good family, you know.</span> <span id="s560">I mean, it’s wrong, it’s false, it smells.</span> <span id="s561">You know, it’s fishy.</span> <span id="s562">I don’t like it.</span> <span id="s563">My son hate it.</span> <span id="s564">I – I go.</span> <span id="s565">I do it for my mom.</span> <span id="s566">And besides, what I’m doing now is for my mom.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: I don’t do it for your museum; which I admire, of course, your job.</span> <span id="s569">But I think that because maybe it’s funny, you know, I’m not religious, but I do believe in God.</span> <span id="s570">I do.</span> <span id="s571">I have to believe in something, you know.</span> <span id="s572">Otherwise I will be dead by now.</span> <span id="s573">I believe in God, and I think that my mom, which I don’t know, and a poor, little girl, I mean f – somebody who – who was not given that chance to touch their only child, you know, that she deserves something from me.</span> <span id="s574">So, being alive, and having the chance to talk about everything what happened, that chance she never had, you know, give me a privilege, you know, and that’s why – that’s why I called Shoah, you know, one day.</span> <span id="s575">Only for this.</span> <span id="s576">I mean, I – I have no other reasons.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: I want my mom to know that I am alive because I do have something, you know, to do for my family, my – my grandpa, my grandma, you know, to do something for them.</span> <span id="s579">And I’m trying just, you know, to be okay with myself, that’s all.</span> <span id="s580">Not much.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: No-o, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: A lot.</span> <span id="s583">As of my son, my son, he doesn’t feel that he’s a Jew.</span> <span id="s584">He completely and definitely he knows where I come from, and as of religion, he’s far away.</span> <span id="s585">His wife is American Italian, and she’s not religion too, but – but still, you know, it’s far.</span> <span id="s586">But for my son, my son, he loves me more than I can explain it to you, because – nots that he’s my son, you know, but what we went through, both of us, and that I never quit on him.</span> <span id="s587">He – he recognize this, and he is very thankful.</span> <span id="s588">And I can tell you one thing, okay, which might make you think.</span> <span id="s589">When I had that interview with Shoah, you know, they told me to turn off the phones.</span> <span id="s590">It was in my house, and my son, he calls me hundred times a day, Mom, what are you doing?</span> <span id="s591">Wh-Wh-Why you doing this, where you going?</span> <span id="s592">Whom you’re going with?</span> <span id="s593">Do you have to go?</span> <span id="s594">You know, you – it’s that kind of – I – he – he thinks that because I never had a family, he thinks that he is my – my both parents together.</span> <span id="s595">He feels that he has to take care of me.</span> <span id="s596">He – you know, he’s now okay with this, you know, Washington stuff, because she’s with me, and – and he – and he trusts her.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: But when I go by myself, he is – he is shaking, you know, that something might happen to me.</span> <span id="s599">That’s what sh – he is afraid.</span> <span id="s600">I understand it’s not good, and I’m not happy about this.</span> <span id="s601">But that’s the point, you know, that we both came to, you know.</span> <span id="s602">But anyhow, this was the mo – he knew that I h – I have this interview at home, he knew.</span> <span id="s603">And my both phones were disconnected.</span> <span id="s604">He was nervous, you know; it took few hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: So he, when he couldn't reach me, you know, on the phone, he came to the house.</span> <span id="s607">The lady, I – I forgot her name, but anyway, suddenly we – we heard the knock on the door.</span> <span id="s608">I didn’t want him to be involved in this – in this interview, you know.</span> <span id="s609">I don’t – I’m not that kind of mother, that I don’t think that – that kids have to take your – all the burden, you know.</span> <span id="s610">I mean, everybody has own life, own responsibilities.</span> <span id="s611">I didn’t want him to be part of it.</span> <span id="s612">He’s got enough.</span> <span id="s613">But he walked in, so she said, oh, as you’re here, maybe you want to say something, because we are very happy when we can talk to second generation, and maybe you – you have something to add to what your mom said.</span> <span id="s614">And I can see my son, you know, walking up the stairs, I had a townhouse, you know, on – on the upper floor.</span> <span id="s615">And he was walking up the stairs, he – he said – he – you know, jeans, and not dressed up, nothing, completely, you know, out of the blue.</span> <span id="s616">And he said, okay.</span> <span id="s617">And he – in the end of everything, he just said few words.</span> <span id="s618">And he said – you don’t even know Ida, because I didn’t tell you.</span> <span id="s619">He said, this is my mom.</span> <span id="s620">And he said, this is – that I am here, as you can see me, it’s only in hundred percent because of her.</span> <span id="s621">He says, this is the best thing ever happened in my life, that’s my mom.</span> <span id="s622">That’s what – how it was, I mean.</span> <span id="s623">So he knows, and you know, he – he understands.</span> <span id="s624">He – it’s not that he wants himself to be [indecipherable] you know, my – my Jewish, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: – part of my life, because he knows I am a Jew, and I don’t – I – I don’t – I’m not going to say different.</span> <span id="s627">But he – he looks at, you know, Jews, through me.</span> <span id="s628">Okay, unfortunately the family, you know, didn’t do a good job.</span> <span id="s629">And he is far away from everything, which he’s supposed to, you know.</span> <span id="s630">He not supposed to – oh, let’s say this way.</span> <span id="s631">So, my son, my son, as I mentioned to you, he’s gonna be 40 in few days.</span> <span id="s632">And I am very proud of him, I really am.</span> <span id="s633">Without a college degree, he managed, you know, to – you know, get to the point that not many people in America are able to get.</span> <span id="s634">And I was able to not only survive, but take care of myself.</span> <span id="s635">The – the bad part is that I am alone.</span> <span id="s636">But – but I – you know, I’m okay with this, you know, because I – I know how to support myself, and I have him, and the – we live very close.</span> <span id="s637">And every time I need him – you know, we work together, so I – you know, I am with him 10 hours a day, but still he – he would never go to sleep without of calling me and asking me, Mom, are you okay, are you – do you need something, and you know.</span> <span id="s638">And always, if anything happened, he would never, ever let anybody to take me to the airport, never, ever.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: [coughing] It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: He would – he would – it might be nervous.</span> <span id="s641">He would, you know, if there is – sometimes people, you know, offer me, you know, you can go with me.</span> <span id="s642">No, no, no, no, no, I take Mom, you know.</span> <span id="s643">Even t – even coming here, you know, I – I – I was offered by her, you know, to come to her house, and then we could go together.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: No way, no.</span> <span id="s646">I’ll take Mom to the airport, I’ll pick Mom from the airport, and wa – I know he’s counting hours, you know, for me to come back.</span> <span id="s647">He needs me because you know, I work with him, and I take care of money.</span> <span id="s648">If I’m not there, nobody does my job.</span> <span id="s649">One day – and I’m gonna have a pile, you know, waiting for me, you know, to be taken care of.</span> <span id="s650">So, he is – he – he depends on me, and he – constantly he tells me, Mom, I would be nobody without of you.</span> <span id="s651">And I am blessed, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: So that’s the story, no matter how much group of Poles, you know, wanted me to die, kill my family and no matter what happened with me through all those years, I’m not only alive, but I am – I can – I can say I’m successful, you know.</span> <span id="s654">I’m on my own.</span> <span id="s655">I got enough money to, you know, do this and that.</span> <span id="s656">And what I appreciate the most in my life is that God gave me opportunity to be part of my son’s success.</span> <span id="s657">You know, that my work for him let him go furth – further and further, you know.</span> <span id="s658">That – there are not too many moms who can say it, you know.</span> <span id="s659">And, you know, I – I am just a part of – of his huge success, and I am proud of it, you know, and nobody’s gonna take it away from me.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: Congratulations.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: That would be all.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q:
