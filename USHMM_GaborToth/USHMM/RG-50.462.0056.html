was 14 years old I went away to Bratislava, and I went to school for a while.</span> <span id="s23">Then I became a singer in the choir of the biggest synagogue in Bratislava.</span> <span id="s24">So, I used to get paid like 60 Czechoslovakian Krone in a month.</span> <span id="s25">And I didn't like school so much, so I was looking for a trade.</span> <span id="s26">I was looking to do something.</span> <span id="s27">So I went in to learn a trade to become a barber, because I saw that the barbers, the people who come to the barbers give a lot of tips.</span> <span id="s28">And that made an impression on me, so I'll have plenty of pocket money.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">SR: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">GD: But, after two, three weeks, I didn't like that profession.</span> <span id="s31">And I was still singing in the choir in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s32">And my mother sent me money, because she was very happy that I'm still in the Jewish tradition, going to shul and singing in the choir.</span> <span id="s33">So she sent me money every month.</span> <span id="s34">And I was looking around to get some kind of a trade, to learn some kind of a trade.</span> <span id="s35">Then I went into fashion.</span> <span id="s36">I went into tailoring and designing.</span> <span id="s37">And I have learned that in the city of Bratislava.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">SR: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s39">I see.</span> <span id="s40">Did you live by yourself, or did you live with a group, or...</span></p> <p><span id="s41">GD: No, I lived by myself.</span> <span id="s42">I took a small apartment, one room.</span> <span id="s43">And I lived by myself.</span> <span id="s44">And my mother helped me to support myself.</span> <span id="s45">And I ate by some of the people that they knew me.</span> <span id="s46">They gave me food.</span> <span id="s47">I had, like a few days a week I went to certain people where I ate, for the first year.</span> <span id="s48">Then, when I started to learn the trade, my boss liked me so much, he gave me food; he gave me board.</span> <span id="s49">He gave me everything.</span> <span id="s50">He also gave me pocket money.</span> <span id="s51">And I was doing very well, as a young man.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">SR: Even though you were an--just an apprentice.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">GD: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">SR: He--they gave you all this...</span></p> <p><span id="s55">GD: Right, right...</span></p> <p><span id="s56">SR:

money.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">SR: Can I ask you something...</span></p> <p><span id="s59">GD: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">SR: About--you say that you had other people who gave you food, and you would go to--dinner.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">GD: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">SR: Dinner the year around.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">GD: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">SR: How did you find those people?</span> <span id="s65">Was that something people did?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">GD: Those people I--right.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">SR: Oh.</span></p> <p><span

Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s71">And some of those people were salesmen, where they used to come to my town.</span> <span id="s72">And they recognized me in the shul.</span> <span id="s73">And right away one of the salesmen knew who I am, knew that I'm not very poor from home.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">SR: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">GD: And I want to do something for myself, because my father didn't live already.</span> <span id="s76">I was an orphan, and so this gentleman, he knew me as a salesman.</span> <span id="s77">We had a store next to our bakery.</span> <span

representative.</span> <span id="s85">And he recognized me.</span> <span id="s86">And he asked me what I want to do there.</span> <span id="s87">First he invited me to his house for a few days, and he found out what I want to do.</span> <span id="s88">He liked it.</span> <span id="s89">He liked that I want to learn a trade, and I was singing in the choir in that same shul that he was going to.</span> <span id="s90">So he liked me very much, and he went over to a few friends of his, and he made appointments to eat there every day, like three different places to eat a day or two during the week.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">SR: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">GD: The first year.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">SR: Can I back up a little bit...</span></p> <p><span id="s94">GD:

profession.</span> <span id="s618">But, because the officer was so good to me, I ran away from the camp about eight, nine times.</span> <span id="s619">Anybody else who would run away, more than 500 yards from a camp, there was a law that they could shoot him on the spot.</span> <span id="s620">I was never touched, because I knew my officer, my head officer, who was a captain, he would never let anybody touch me.</span> <span id="s621">So I had courage, and I did go around, I left the camp a few times, about eight times.</span> <span id="s622">And I always came back, because, and that was bad situations.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">SR: You came back on your own?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">GD: I was trying to hide.</span> <span id="s625">I was trying to hide with Christians, or in some towns where I would stay over till the Russians come, because we knew that the Russians already coming.</span> <span id="s626">So I was trying to run away, and wait for the Russians.</span> <span id="s627">But then I saw that a lot of German soldiers are concentrating in that part, so I sneaked out and ran back to my own group, to my own military place where we were working.</span> <span id="s628">All the Jewish boys were working there, so I went back.</span> <span id="s629">And the officer would never bother me.</span> <span id="s630">He wouldn't tell me nothing.</span> <span id="s631">Finally, at the last moment, his city was also taken over by the Russians, which was in deep Hungary, near the Yugoslavian border.</span> <span id="s632">So he told me, he doesn't want to go to Germany himself.</span> <span id="s633">He doesn't want to go to the--to Germany.</span> <span id="s634">He wants to hide himself, and he wants to wait till the Russians will free us.</span> <span id="s635">And that's what he did.</span> <span id="s636">He kept all the 220 people.</span> <span id="s637">He didn't want to put us on the train.</span> <span id="s638">He kept us walking so the Russians could catch up with us.</span> <span id="s639">And the Russians did.</span> <span id="s640">And we were hiding for three, four days in a spot, on a farmland.</span> <span id="s641">The city was called Bereksaz.</span> <span id="s642">[phonetic] That was in the Karpathen.</span> <span id="s643">And when the Russian army freed that city, we were all freed--and him too, the officers.</span> <span id="s644">And nobody bothered him.</span> <span id="s645">Nobody did anything to him.</span> <span id="s646">But, the second day, when the Russians occupied that city, one officer, he was drunk a little bit.</span> <span id="s647">He was a lieutenant in the Russian army.</span> <span id="s648">And I speak a little bit Russian.</span> <span id="s649">And because I was dressed good, and because I was Jewish--he was an Ukraine--he was an antisemite, he wanted to kill me.</span> <span id="s650">So I was waiting six years under the Nazis to be freed, and in the day when I was freed, half a day later, a Russian officer wanted to kill me.</span> <span id="s651">He took away my watch, my money, everything I had.</span> <span id="s652">And he took me with a gun and he wanted to, wanted me to go in in the city in a special between houses, where it was a closed-in place, so nobody sees.</span> <span id="s653">He didn't want to kill me on the street because there were a lot of Russian officers.</span> <span id="s654">And one of my friends who was with me, in the same camp that I was, my best friend, he ran over to those officers and he start to cry that this is a Jewish boy, and this soldier, this lieutenant wants to kill him.</span> <span id="s655">And when I saw he ran over to the officers, I ran away from this guy.</span> <span id="s656">He told me to go into this place.</span> <span id="s657">At that point I made a right turn and started to run away.</span> <span id="s658">And he turned around and wanted to shoot me.</span> <span id="s659">He saw the officers, and he stopped, and he put away his gun.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">SR: Oh my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">GD: So, the officers blew a whistle.</span> <span id="s662">There were about six, seven officers--high ranking officers.</span> <span id="s663">Because they just occupied one day this city.</span> <span id="s664">And they had a little conference on the street, in the middle of the city.</span> <span id="s665">And my friend was crying there, and he spoke better Russian than me.</span> <span id="s666">And he told them what happened.</span> <span id="s667">So one Russian officer says to both of us, "You just stay here on the side."</span> <span id="s668">First they called over that off-, that officer who wanted to shoot me.</span> <span id="s669">And he came over, shivering, put away his gun, saluted--because these were very high ranking officers--saluted the officer.</span> <span id="s670">And the officer asked him, "What do you want to do?"</span> <span id="s671">He says, "Nothing!</span> <span id="s672">Nothing!</span> <span id="s673">I didn't want to do nothing!"</span> <span id="s674">So one officer told him, "Get lost from me or otherwise I'll blow your brains out."</span> <span id="s675">And he ran away, he went away.</span> <span id="s676">And the officer told both of us, my friend and me, to wait here a few minutes.</span> <span id="s677">So they finish the conference.</span> <span id="s678">And between those five, six officers were two Jewish officers.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">SR: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">GD: When they finish the conference, one of the officers comes over, asks us in Jewish, "Are you Jewish?"</span> <span id="s681">We said, "Yes!"</span> <span id="s682">He told him already we are Jewish.</span> <span id="s683">So he says, "All right.</span> <span id="s684">Wait here.</span> <span id="s685">You gonna come with me."</span> <span id="s686">So we waited a few minutes.</span> <span id="s687">He took us, he was in charge of delivering all the food to the front.</span> <span id="s688">He took us to his concentration where he concentrated the food, where he had kitchens, and they cooked for the army as they were progressing against the Nazis.</span> <span id="s689">He gave us lunch.</span> <span id="s690">He gave us beautiful treatment.</span> <span id="s691">And he said, "You wait here.</span> <span id="s692">And my trucks are going back to a certain city which is called Sighet.</span> <span id="s693">And over there they're going to bring more food and delivering it here.</span> <span id="s694">So you go back from the front.</span> <span id="s695">Because the front could turn around tomorrow, and the Nazis could come after us.</span> <span id="s696">We don't know, so you go back at least forty, fifty miles backwards, in that direction."</span> <span id="s697">So we said, "We are from that direction.</span> <span id="s698">We want to go home, and that's that direction."</span> <span id="s699">So he put us with his, one of the officers who was going with the trucks back to Sighet.</span> <span id="s700">And my friend, who spoke very good Russian, the officer took him in the cabin in the front near the, near the driver.</span> <span id="s701">So they were sitting in the front.</span> <span id="s702">And they put me in the back of the truck, and I was standing on the truck, and watching all the Russian army all over the places.</span> <span id="s703">When we were outside the city, going towards Sighet, just a mile or so outside the city, one Russian soldier was very drunk, and he opened up a--fire on the truck, and on us.</span> <span id="s704">He almost killed the officer.</span> <span id="s705">He almost killed everybody in the truck.</span> <span id="s706">He just was very drunk.</span> <span id="s707">He didn't held good the machine gun.</span> <span id="s708">Otherwise we would have been all killed.</span> <span id="s709">The truck at that moment stopped right away, and two soldiers were in the back of the truck with me--they didn't watch me, they were just going, they were watching, they were doing their duty--and the officer in the front with a sergeant.</span> <span id="s710">So these soldiers jumped down with their machine guns, against that one soldier.</span> <span id="s711">When he saw them coming, he laid, he sat on his knees and he begged the officer shouldn't do nothing for him, he made a mistake.</span> <span id="s712">And the officer said to these guys, "Put him away."</span> <span id="s713">And one of these soldiers took his machine gun, and machine-gunned the guy on the side of the street right away and took away his gun and brought it back on the truck.</span> <span id="s714">And I thought to myself, what the hell is going on?</span> <span id="s715">What kinda army, what kinda discipline, what kinda thing?</span> <span id="s716">But on the other hand, I know that the soldier could have killed us all.</span> <span id="s717">So there was judgment right on the spot.</span> <span id="s718">And I was very frightened, and scared, and I didn't know where I'm going or what's gonna be.</span> <span id="s719">But, they didn't bother us.</span> <span id="s720">They took us back like thirty, forty miles.</span> <span id="s721">And then they took us, let us get off the truck when we asked to get off.</span> <span id="s722">And we took the direction where we're supposed to go, towards home.</span> <span id="s723">And we did.</span> <span id="s724">And we came home, and we found about eight Jewish boys and about two, three girls who were hiding in the hills, who were guerillas.</span> <span id="s725">And they were looking for my brother, because he was in a different group.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">SR: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">GD: And they could never find him.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">SR: They never could, because he...</span></p> <p><span id="s729">GD: So he was caught two weeks before, and he was executed.</span> <span id="s730">I don't know if he was executed, or he was taken to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s731">Some people told me he was taken to Auschwitz, some people told me he was executed.</span> <span id="s732">But, he wasn't alive when I came back.</span> <span id="s733">And when I came back, I volunteered right away to the police, and I was working with the police from October, 1944 to, through the end of war.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">SR: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">GD: And, by the order of the Russians, we gathered all those people who were Nazis, who worked with the Nazis, from fourteen years to fifty-two years old, and we marched them towards Russia.</span> <span id="s736">And the Russians took them over, and they took them for work, for hard work, hard labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">SR: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">GD: And after the war, I went back to my city where I used to live.</span> <span id="s739">In my town I couldn't live, because I couldn't take the pain...</span></p> <p><span id="s740">SR: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">GD: To see our houses without anybody.</span> <span id="s742">So I went back to the city where I learned the trade, and where I worked before.</span> <span id="s743">And I went back in, and I worked for a while with the Russian military secret police, with the, with the Russian Kommandatura.</span> <span id="s744">That means like, like over here, the military secret police.</span> <span id="s745">And I was trying to do a little bit work on the Nazis what they did to us, pay them back a little, and I did.</span> <span id="s746">I did it as a policeman, and I did after the war as working with the Russians together.</span> <span id="s747">And then finally...</span></p> <p><span id="s748">SR: Did you help find Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">GD: Oh yeah, we had, we found plenty of them.</span> <span id="s750">And we sent them back...</span></p> <p><span id="s751">SR: What, did you...</span></p> <p><span id="s752">GD: One of the Nazis' father, who was in my town a businessman, when I was in the policeman, police force, he was, I would say maybe the richest German in our town.</span> <span id="s753">My father was a very good friend of his, but in the last few weeks, when I came on vacation for a few days, from the camp where I was, where I was, and I saw what this man did, I was surprised.</span> <span id="s754">Because this man didn't have to do nothing against the Jews, because he was rich himself.</span> <span id="s755">He wasn't poor.</span> <span id="s756">I can understand if somebody is very poor and he goes for some, some things that the Jewish people had.</span> <span id="s757">But this man didn't need nothing.</span> <span id="s758">He only wanted to get rid of the Jews, so it showed that even those people that you thought they were nice, they were not so nice, those Germans.</span> <span id="s759">And he took over the biggest stores that the Jewish people had, and he helped the police, which was a surprise to me, that he helped the Nazis to get rid of the Jews.</span> <span id="s760">And I saw that.</span> <span id="s761">When I came back, and I was, after the war, when I was liberated, the war was still on, in 1944.</span> <span id="s762">I was liberated in October, '44.</span> <span id="s763">And I was in November at home, at the police.</span> <span id="s764">One of his sons was in the army.</span> <span id="s765">I don't know if he lives or not.</span> <span id="s766">He was a teacher, and he was an officer in the German army.</span> <span id="s767">His son was only 14 years old, the youngest son.</span> <span id="s768">And his father came to me, and he trusted me, because he knew that I know that his fa-, my father and him were good friends.</span> <span id="s769">So he said to me, "Gabe, I want you to do me a favor.</span> <span id="s770">Please don't take away my youngest son.</span> <span id="s771">I have nobody else, just this one son.</span> <span id="s772">My other son is in the..." And I said, "Victor, why did you go after the Jewish people, in the last few weeks, when they took away every Jew from there?</span> <span id="s773">Why did you go to help the Nazis?</span> <span id="s774">Was that a nice thing from you?</span> <span id="s775">You didn't need it!</span> <span id="s776">Why did you go?"</span> <span id="s777">"Oh, I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s778">I made a big mistake!"</span> <span id="s779">And he says to me, "Gabe, I'll give you gold.</span> <span id="s780">I'll give you silver.</span> <span id="s781">I'll give you dollars.</span> <span id="s782">I'll give you anything you want.</span> <span id="s783">Just please don't take my son away."</span> <span id="s784">And I was so mad that he did, next morning we took away his son, and we sent him with the rest of the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">SR: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">GD: And, later on, I didn't live in that town no more, after the war was over, I went to my city, to Bratislava, and I lived there.</span> <span id="s787">So I really don't know what happened to his son.</span> <span id="s788">But I know what happened to a lot of these Nazis, who were very bad through the time of the war.</span> <span id="s789">And when I was in the police force, there was a few friends of mine, and all those boys who were hidden in the hills, they were all in the police force.</span> <span id="s790">And we did some work on some of those Nazis, that they were bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">SR: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">GD: We paid them back.</span> <span id="s793">Some of them were begging on their knees we shouldn't take them, they were sick, they couldn't walk, they couldn't do things.</span> <span id="s794">I didn't give a damn.</span> <span id="s795">Just the way they did with us, that's exactly that we did with them, except we didn't kill them.</span> <span id="s796">We just took them for work, that the Russians needed them to fix bridges, to fix highways, to fix things.</span> <span id="s797">And we gave them over to the Russian army.</span> <span id="s798">And that's what I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">SR: Let me ask you this.</span> <span id="s800">If I can just back up a little bit.</span> <span id="s801">When your brothers and your sister went to Auschwitz, your mother went with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">GD: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">SR: They all went together...</span></p> <p><span id="s804">GD: They all went together.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">SR: Except your brother who had hidden...</span></p> <p><span id="s806">GD: Who was hidden in the hills.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">SR: And then at the end of the war...</span></p> <p><span id="s808">GD: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">SR: When you were walking, when your officer was marching you, had he been told to put you into trains and send you, but he decided to walk you?</span> <span id="s810">I..</span> <span id="s811">.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">GD: He, not us.</span> <span id="s813">He had to go, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">SR: He went too.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">GD: No, no, the officer had to go with us to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">SR: And he didn't want to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">GD: He didn't want to go, and we didn't want to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">SR: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">GD: So we slowed down on the road.</span> <span id="s820">We walked miles, slow, so the Russians could catch up with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">SR: Right.</span> <span id="s822">He wasn't rushing you.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">GD: We, we were, he didn't rush us.</span> <span id="s824">But we still made like 25, 30 miles every day.</span> <span id="s825">We couldn't stay in one place.</span> <span id="s826">Because there was like a, the Germans were running away from the front, and anybody who stood in their way, they would kill them.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">SR: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">GD: They were afraid for the Russians.</span> <span id="s829">They were running like crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">SR: I'm sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">GD: And, we were on their way.</span> <span id="s832">We were walking.</span> <span id="s833">So, if we would stay somewhere, if we did stay somewhere, we were hiding.</span> <span id="s834">We were...</span></p> <p><span id="s835">SR: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">GD: We would go to a..</span> <span id="s837">.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">SR: [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s839">GD: To a farm, where we would not be on the highway so they could see us or whatever.</span> <span id="s840">And we did that a lot.</span> <span id="s841">Every night we did that.</span> <span id="s842">We went like four o’clock we went to a farm place, and we slept in the places from the cows and everything.</span> <span id="s843">We didn't care, just to slow down.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">SR: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">GD: To catch up with the Russians, to wait till the Russians free us.</span> <span id="s846">And that's what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">SR: How about after?</span> <span id="s848">Where did you stay afterward?</span> <span id="s849">In the city there when you moved you stayed until you came to this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">GD: After I was freed through the Russians, and I almost got killed from the Russians, I went back to my town where I was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">SR: But you weren't happy there you said.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">GD: I wasn't happy there, no.</span> <span id="s853">I wasn't happy there.</span> <span id="s854">I didn't even live in my house.</span> <span id="s855">I lived in one of my friends' house, close to the police station.</span> <span id="s856">And we were at the police, and we were even afraid that some, because we took away so many Christians, who were working with the Nazis, so we were not sure from, for ourselves.</span> <span id="s857">Some, somewhere somebody could kill us.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">SR: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">GD: So we were all going around with guns and all that, but we still were a little bit afraid.</span> <span id="s860">And there was, at night no civilians were allowed to walk.</span> <span id="s861">There was a curfew.</span> <span id="s862">So no civilians after six thirty were allowed to walk.</span> <span id="s863">If we would catch somebody, we took them in right away to the police station and we beat him up and we put him in jail.</span> <span id="s864">No civilians were allowed to walk, except police or military, soldiers, officers.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">SR: You weren't ma-, how old were you, when the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">GD: 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">SR: When the war was over you were?</span></p>

Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">GD: '22, '45.</span> <span id="s873">I was 21.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">SR: You were 21.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">GD: Yes.</span></p> <p><span

few Jews who came back to your hometown?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">GD: Very few.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">SR: So you eventually left there.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">GD: What we did, when I was in the police force, I opened up my store what I had my store before.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">SR: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">GD: And I put in those tailors to work.</span> <span id="s885">And we kept all those people, we made a kitchen for all those people who came back from the camps, I paid from my money, and my friend who lives today in Los Angeles, we both worked, and we made sure that people who knew this business worked.</span> <span id="s886">And we had a lot of customers right away.</span> <span id="s887">Business was good, though we didn't take money from the work, or for our selling goods.</span> <span id="s888">We took food--cows, calves, chickens, bread, or flour, milk, butter, everything that we can accumulate.</span> <span id="s889">So all the people who came, started to come from concentration camps, who were liberated, they came to that part of the country, they were all greeted and given food for a few days--as long as they had to stay till they found themselves a spot where to work or whatever.</span> <span id="s890">Because the war was still on.</span> <span id="s891">The people didn't have where to go and what to eat.</span> <span id="s892">And we couldn't get in touch with anybody from Joint Distribution.</span> <span id="s893">We were too far away, and we didn't, we didn't need it.</span> <span id="s894">We did it ourselves--me and my best friend, who lives today in Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s895">We paid like for six, seven months, for all the food to give the people, whoever came back from a concentration camp, or a working camp.</span> <span id="s896">It didn't matter.</span> <span id="s897">So long as they were Jewish and they were from that surrounding towns.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">SR: And you finally left there, though.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">GD: Finally I left...</span></p> <p><span id="s900">SR: Because you were so uncomfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">GD: After the war was, the war was over, I left right away, and I went to the city where I was living before the war--but not in the town where my mother lived, where my grandfather close there had his farms and everything, because I couldn't stay there.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">SR: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">GD: Not because they didn't let me, then later on the Russians took over that part of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s904">It's today...</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s906">SR: This is a continuation of the interview with Gabriel Drimer, by Sue Rosenthal, on April 21st, 1985, in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s907">Now tell me how, what happened, how you came to this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">GD: O.K. First of all, after the war I lived, I worked for a while in Bratislava, and I went into business.</span> <span id="s909">I went into the business that I knew, the manufacture of ladies' coats, suits, and men's.</span> <span id="s910">And it was very easy to do, because in Czechoslovakia after the war, the Germans, three million Germans, there were about two-and-a-half million Germans, were deported to Germany.</span> <span id="s911">So, because I was a survivor, because I was in the camps, I had a special right.</span> <span id="s912">I applied for a license to get a store.</span> <span id="s913">So they told me in City Hall, go and take any store that you like from a German person, and we'll give you the permission to do it.</span> <span id="s914">We'll give you the papers for it.</span> <span id="s915">So I went, and I took over one store, in Karlsbad.</span> <span id="s916">And they gave me right away permission and I took it over, and I ran that store.</span> <span id="s917">Then I went to another city later, and I took another store.</span> <span id="s918">And I got permission for that, and I ran that store.</span> <span id="s919">Then I went out, took over another store.</span> <span id="s920">So I had three stores taken over from Germans, and I took people to work, and started to do business.</span> <span id="s921">I started to do very good business.</span> <span id="s922">Later on I went into the leather business.</span> <span id="s923">And I started to build my own life.</span> <span id="s924">In the meantime I got married with a girl who I knew from home.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">SR: How did you find her?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">GD: And she came, she came home after the war, and before I left to Bratislava, she came home right after, May 9, '45.</span> <span id="s927">And I met her, and we got engaged, and we got married soon.</span> <span id="s928">And I was starting to build my life, buil-, and I knew already that my family was all wiped out, and I needed somebody.</span> <span id="s929">That's why I got engaged so fast.</span> <span id="s930">I got married to have somebody, to have a little family, and to start to build a little family.</span> <span id="s931">And I built a very good business.</span> <span id="s932">I had a lot of connections.</span> <span id="s933">I was born there, I speak the language, I had those three stores, and I also took out, took a villa in a city which is called Ashvchekov [phonetic], near the German border.</span> <span id="s934">And I took over a villa where the commander from the S.S. lived.</span> <span id="s935">And, the mother was still there.</span> <span id="s936">I found a very beautiful home, with everything in it.</span> <span id="s937">And the mother was about 75, 80 years old.</span> <span id="s938">And she was very unhappy.</span> <span id="s939">She begged me I shouldn't take over the house.</span> <span id="s940">She argued with me.</span> <span id="s941">When I walked into the house, I saw Hitler's picture was still on the wall.</span> <span id="s942">So I got very mad.</span> <span id="s943">I took the picture and I stepped on it on the floor, broke everything, and I had a big argument with the woman who lived there, with her mother.</span> <span id="s944">And she knew what is gonna happen.</span> <span id="s945">She knew that if I go to the City Hall, I get the house right away.</span> <span id="s946">And she was very ill.</span> <span id="s947">I think she had a heart attack, and the next day she was dead.</span> <span id="s948">So I told her that the next day she had to be out of the house.</span> <span id="s949">The next day they carried her out of the house, and I took over the house.</span> <span id="s950">And I found in the attic I found gold.</span> <span id="s951">I found a briefcase with thousands of marks.</span> <span id="s952">I found the, for beds, sheets and all that, brand new, that they never were touched.</span> <span id="s953">I found a lot of stuff, and, naturally, a beautiful home with everything in it, with all the furnitures.</span> <span id="s954">I took it over.</span> <span id="s955">I was so naive.</span> <span id="s956">I was just engaged.</span> <span id="s957">I wasn't even married then.</span> <span id="s958">I took the gold and gave everybody, my friends, a piece, because I figured gold doesn't mean nothing.</span> <span id="s959">The money, I put away in a, in one of the shelves in the house.</span> <span id="s960">And I figured what is German marks aren't worth nothing.</span> <span id="s961">I need Czechoslovakian money.</span> <span id="s962">I was so young, I didn't know.</span> <span id="s963">Later a few months I found out that the marks are good, in Germany, and they'll be even good in Czechoslovakia, I can exchange it.</span> <span id="s964">I went to look for the marks, I didn't find them no where else.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">SR: Somebody else had found them.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">GD: So somebody else from my friends already, because I had no enemies coming to the house.</span> <span id="s967">And whatever happened, let them have fun.</span> <span id="s968">So they found the marks before me.</span> <span id="s969">And they knew probably that they were good, so they took them.</span> <span id="s970">And I built a very good business.</span> <span id="s971">I had a very, very good business.</span> <span id="s972">But in 1948, everything was working very good, making a lot of money, and making a good living, and the few Jewish people that they survived they were already gathered together.</span> <span id="s973">Wasn't too many of us.</span> <span id="s974">Finally we found out that there is a need for Israel, to get ammunition and to get soldiers and to get, go fight for Israel, because Israel is becoming a State.</span> <span id="s975">I was between the first one to volunteer to the Haganah.</span> <span id="s976">And we were the first ones to go out, from Czechoslovakia, with a ship, ammunition, and come to Israel to fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">SR: So you went to Israel, then, and you fought...</span></p> <p><span id="s978">GD: Yes, in 1948...</span></p> <p><span id="s979">SR: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">GD: I went to Israel, voluntarily left all the stores.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">SR: You left everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s982">GD: Everything, except I took some money, converted to dollars.</span> <span id="s983">I took all the furniture that I liked, and put it in in a big car, carload, like a train carload I built it, and I shipped it with a ship to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">SR: To Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">GD: All the electric appliances, gas appliances, and some of the most sophisticated machines that I can get for my factory, and I got permission from the government of Czechoslovakia, which...</span></p> <p><span id="s986">SR: Before the Russians...</span></p> <p><span id="s987">GD: Before, no, no, ‘cause this was after the war, and after the war it was, that part where I lived...</span></p> <p><span id="s988">SR: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">GD: Already now it was already Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s990">It was Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s991">The part where I was born, the Russians took over.</span> <span id="s992">But this part was Czechoslovakia, but was under control of the Russians.</span> <span id="s993">So the Czechoslovakian government was about eight or nine Jewish ministers.</span> <span id="s994">Between the twelve ministers were about eight, nine Jewish ministers.</span> <span id="s995">Was, this was in Stalin's time.</span> <span id="s996">And the minister of finance, and tourism and all that, was Fisher, a Jewish minister which I knew personally.</span> <span id="s997">And when I applied for my visa, and a permission to take out stuff from Czechoslovakia, to my surprise, they allowed me everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">SR: I am, I'm surprised too.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">GD: And I took whatever I could.</span> <span id="s1000">I didn't, I couldn't take so much, because I didn't think they would allow me that much to take out.</span> <span id="s1001">But whatever I asked...</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">SR: They did allow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">GD: They did allow me.</span> <span id="s1004">So I did take everything whatever I could, and I went to Israel.</span> <span id="s1005">And I lived in Israel for seven years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">SR: With your family and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">GD: With my, then I had my wife already, and we had a child, a son.</span> <span id="s1008">And we moved to Israel.</span> <span id="s1009">I volunteered.</span> <span id="s1010">I left everything in Czechoslovakia, because in 1948 the Communists took over.</span> <span id="s1011">I knew already what's gonna happen.</span> <span id="s1012">They asked me to give up my stores, to become a manager for all the corpor-, to be the head of the corporation, of all the clothing industry.</span> <span id="s1013">And I said, "O.K., I'll consider it."</span> <span id="s1014">In the meantime, they didn't know that I'm working on papers to leave the country.</span> <span id="s1015">And I did everything legally, and I volunteered for the Haganah.</span> <span id="s1016">We were trained two months in Czechoslovakia for the Haganah, and I became a sergeant in the training course.</span> <span id="s1017">And we moved to Israel.</span> <span id="s1018">We left Czechoslovakia voluntarily, legally, and we moved to Israel.</span> <span id="s1019">And in Israel, I was first in the army.</span> <span id="s1020">Then I found out that if I join the police force, it would be counted like being in the army, but I'm get-, I'll get more pay and I'll be closer to home.</span> <span id="s1021">So finally I applied to become a policeman.</span> <span id="s1022">I also had papers from Czechoslovakia that I was in the police force there during the war, and I was a sergeant in the police force.</span> <span id="s1023">I had all those papers, and I applied in Israel.</span> <span id="s1024">When I came to an interview with the officer who hires all these young policemen, I didn't speak good Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1025">I hardly spoke Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1026">So he told me, "I'm sorry, we cannot take you.</span> <span id="s1027">The only problem is that you don't speak Hebrew, and you don't write Hebrew good."</span> <span id="s1028">Well, I couldn't do nothing against that, so, I was dismissed.</span> <span id="s1029">But I didn't give up, because I knew that I want to be a policeman, because the money that I brought to Israel, if I go to the army for two years, and I stay in the army, my wife will use up all the money, and I'll have nobody in Israel.</span> <span id="s1030">I have nobody from my family who is gonna help me.</span> <span id="s1031">I'll be a poor man forever, and I'll be a worker.</span> <span id="s1032">This way I have some money left if I go to the police, and I'll be able to survive easier, and build my family.</span> <span id="s1033">I applied again to the police department a few months later.</span> <span id="s1034">Like, I made believe like nothing happened before.</span> <span id="s1035">They didn't know.</span> <span id="s1036">And, the same thing happened again.</span> <span id="s1037">I was not, I was rejected because of not speaking Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1038">In the meantime I went to school and I read Hebrew newspapers, trying to learn Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1039">Naturally, I spoke a little better Hebrew, and I knew already the questions what he is asking.</span> <span id="s1040">And I thought the next time he's gonna ask the same questions.</span> <span id="s1041">I knew the answers good in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1042">But it doesn't work that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">SR: No, new questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">GD: He asked different questions.</span> <span id="s1045">The third time--I applied three times--the third time I applied I was rejected, too.</span> <span id="s1046">I went out from that office.</span> <span id="s1047">Every time I was applying, we were going for a hearing, they were hiring about 100 police officers, out of three, four hundred boys.</span> <span id="s1048">So I wasn't the only one who was rejected.</span> <span id="s1049">There was hundreds of them.</span> <span id="s1050">But I still knew that if I don't go to the police department, I'll be in the army for two years and it's gonna be the end of my money, because my wife will use up every penny.</span> <span id="s1051">She cannot survive on $25 a month.</span> <span id="s1052">So, that's what the army paid.</span> <span id="s1053">In the police force I would have gotten $65 a month.</span> <span id="s1054">At that time, that was easier, because that was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">SR: You could live on...</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">GD: Three dollars, no, a pound.</span> <span id="s1057">It's not $65.</span> <span id="s1058">It's £ 65.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">SR: Oh, that's right, pounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">GD: Twenty-five pounds or sixty-five pounds.</span> <span id="s1061">So, I walked out from that office the third time.</span> <span id="s1062">I said, "This is it.</span> <span id="s1063">I mean, I can't do it no more.</span> <span id="s1064">And I'm through with the police department."</span> <span id="s1065">As I was walking in the hall, a police officer walks towards me, and he sees me, he looks at me.</span> <span id="s1066">And I look at him.</span> <span id="s1067">And this is one of my older brother's friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">SR: Oh my.</span> <span id="s1069">You couldn't believe it, I bet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">GD: No.</span> <span id="s1071">And he was an officer, he was an officer in the police force.</span> <span id="s1072">And he was an officer in the English police force, because the Haganah sent him from the Kibbutz Masaryk.</span> <span id="s1073">He was a member in Kibbutz Masaryk.</span> <span id="s1074">And they probably picked out some young boys to send them in to the police department, under the English, that they could know things what's going on.</span> <span id="s1075">And this guy was one of those.</span> <span id="s1076">He was a very devoted Zionist.</span> <span id="s1077">And he was a very smart boy when he left our town.</span> <span id="s1078">And he met me, and he said, "Aren't you the baker's son?"</span> <span id="s1079">So I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1080">He says, "What are you doing here?"</span> <span id="s1081">So I told him.</span> <span id="s1082">But I told him the truth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">SR: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1084">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">GD: I told him why I want to be a policeman.</span> <span id="s1086">And, when luck works, it works.</span> <span id="s1087">So he said, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s1088">You want to be a policeman?</span> <span id="s1089">Come with me."</span> <span id="s1090">He says, "You will go over here.</span> <span id="s1091">And I'll go into the office and I'll talk to them."</span> <span id="s1092">So he went in to the office, and he spoke to the officer, and five minutes later I was called in, and I was sworn in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">SR: How amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">GD: And I was two years in the police force, almost two years.</span> <span id="s1095">And at that time, because of publicity in the papers and all over the place, they were looking for young men to go in kibbutzim to try to do farm work.</span> <span id="s1096">They had to import everything and all that.</span> <span id="s1097">And I saw that my business, shmattes [“rags”, clothing] is not that good.</span> <span id="s1098">Heh, in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">SR: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">GD: Because I brought my machinery and everything.</span> <span id="s1101">And I was working like three, four months designing and making things for Haifa, for the biggest stores, for Dan Gabrielli and Rosenblum, who are very big stores.</span> <span id="s1102">And they gave me the goods, and I made styles for them.</span> <span id="s1103">They liked it very much.</span> <span id="s1104">And they were very satisfied.</span> <span id="s1105">And they told me they're gonna give me work all year.</span> <span id="s1106">But after three months this was, in 1949, '48, December, 1949, January, February, March.</span> <span id="s1107">Those four months I also organized a shop.</span> <span id="s1108">I had people working.</span> <span id="s1109">And I was trying to develop something, while I was in the army--so nothing goes wasted.</span> <span id="s1110">After four months there was no more work, because I worked on jackets and coats, and they don't need any because it's too warm.</span> <span id="s1111">So the thing that he promised me while I was starting with him was because I had nice styles and I did a good job, so he wanted to have me work for him.</span> <span id="s1112">He told me I'm gonna get work all year, but he couldn't give me work all year.</span> <span id="s1113">He only could give me three, four months' work.</span> <span id="s1114">And I said, "Well they were talking by us that Israel is bad.</span> <span id="s1115">I don't see it's so bad.</span> <span id="s1116">I mean, you can work.</span> <span id="s1117">You can get work.</span> <span id="s1118">You can organize yourself."</span> <span id="s1119">I was very happy.</span> <span id="s1120">Well, I didn't have an apartment yet.</span> <span id="s1121">My wife was in a special place where they took all the new people, in a concentration, olim center.</span> <span id="s1122">But I was looking around, and I said, "I'm not gonna spend three, four thousand dollars for an apartment, then I wouldn't have money for a business.</span> <span id="s1123">I'll keep the money to get first a business.</span> <span id="s1124">Then I'll buy apartment."</span> <span id="s1125">So, that's what I did.</span> <span id="s1126">I didn't buy an apartment.</span> <span id="s1127">I took an Arab house that they started to build, they only had the walls, and the, the roof.</span> <span id="s1128">And they, it had no windows, no floors, no electric, no, no water, no heating, no nothing, no.</span> <span id="s1129">So I made a deal with the city that I'll take that house and I'll fix it for my own money.</span> <span id="s1130">They just have to give me the permission.</span> <span id="s1131">So in Israel it doesn't go so easy.</span> <span id="s1132">They didn't give me the permission so easy.</span> <span id="s1133">It took a long time, but finally I got it.</span> <span id="s1134">I got the permission, I fixed up the house, and we had where to live.</span> <span id="s1135">And I was working.</span> <span id="s1136">But after four months that I worked in the shmatta business, I saw that that's no deal, is no, nothing.</span> <span id="s1137">I cannot make a living working four months, and eight months with, we'll starve.</span> <span id="s1138">So, that's when I started to go after the police, to get me into the police department.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">SR: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">GD: Finally I got into the police department through a dear friend of mine, who knew me, who spoke to the officer.</span> <span id="s1141">They took me in, and I was, I even became a sergeant right away, because I had all the papers.</span> <span id="s1142">And I was in charge of twelve officers, which they were all surprised.</span> <span id="s1143">How can they give me a rank and a char-, and a responsibility to be in charge of other people when I don't speak good the language?</span> <span id="s1144">But I promised to the officer that's what he, when he swore me in, he says, "You have to promise me that you're gonna learn every day Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1145">You have to know Hebrew in another few months, otherwise you'll be out of the police force."</span> <span id="s1146">So I did.</span> <span id="s1147">I learned, and I was almost two years in the police force.</span> <span id="s1148">While I was in the police force, I was trying to go in, in farm business.</span> <span id="s1149">And they were advertising all kind of ways to go in in the farm.</span> <span id="s1150">They wanted young people to go in kibbutzim.</span> <span id="s1151">In the kibbutz I didn't want to go.</span> <span id="s1152">I wanted to make a farm, but it should be my own.</span> <span id="s1153">And I started to organize farms.</span> <span id="s1154">At that time, Golda Meir was just a representative in the Histadrut.</span> <span id="s1155">And there was not enough food in Israel for, before Pesach.</span> <span id="s1156">And I got to know Golda Meir through the party.</span> <span id="s1157">I got to know Golda Meir with her very good friend, I don't remember exactly her name.</span> <span id="s1158">She was a blond woman.</span> <span id="s1159">They were always going around together.</span> <span id="s1160">They were from the Histadrut.</span> <span id="s1161">That was in 1949.</span> <span id="s1162">So, somehow, in the town where I lived, near Haifa, somebody suggested, they wanted to give out potatoes for Passover for the people in the town.</span> <span id="s1163">And the town was called Tirat HaCarmel.</span> <span id="s1164">So, somebody suggested my name, that I will be the sincere guy, the honest guy, who will not make some tricks or steal the, the tar, the potatoes that it belongs to the people.</span> <span id="s1165">And they gave me like a lot, a lot of potatoes for each family, for a person to give let's say six pound per person in the family.</span> <span id="s1166">And I did that, and that's when I got in touch the first time, I got to know Mrs. Golda Meir.</span> <span id="s1167">Then later on she became the Prime Minister of Israel.</span> <span id="s1168">And I lived in Israel for seven years, and I organized 45 farms.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">SR: Private farms?</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">GD: Private farms, around Haifa.</span> <span id="s1171">We took over the land.</span> <span id="s1172">I took over 40 acres land that was Arab land.</span> <span id="s1173">All the land was Arab land.</span> <span id="s1174">Their Hushanatush [phonetic] gave us leases for a year.</span> <span id="s1175">Every year we renewed the lease.</span> <span id="s1176">And I had three, four cows myself.</span> <span id="s1177">I had chickens.</span> <span id="s1178">I saw that with my shmatte [clothing] business I cannot make a living in Israel.</span> <span id="s1179">I was also in the police force already, and I started to build farms.</span> <span id="s1180">Because I didn't, police force is not my cup of tea.</span> <span id="s1181">This was just till I get something better.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">SR: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">GD: In the meantime, while I was in the police force, and I was in charge of twelve other policemen in the Takhanah Mizrakhit [Eastern station]; I looked around and I saw that the government is helping a lot to become farmers.</span> <span id="s1184">They lent money.</span> <span id="s1185">They have a special bank who lends money for farmers.</span> <span id="s1186">And I got in touch with all these big people, and I became the president from all these farmers.</span> <span id="s1187">And I got to work with the government once a month in Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s1188">We had to, whatever the farmers produced, we had to give up a certain stations where they sold it for, under government-controlled prices.</span> <span id="s1189">Naturally some of the things the farmers sold on their own, which they made some extra money.</span> <span id="s1190">And they were growing very rapidly.</span> <span id="s1191">If a farmer wanted a loan in the bank, I had to O.K. it.</span> <span id="s1192">Not to be the sponsor, just to, the bank would know that this person or these people are really gonna build a farm.</span> <span id="s1193">So they made me like a, I don't know what, what do you call that, trustee or whatever.</span> <span id="s1194">I had to put my initials on it...</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">SR: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">GD: On the application for a loan.</span> <span id="s1197">And if I did, they got the loan, which was with very low interest.</span> <span id="s1198">And so, if they brought in horses for the farmers, and they gave it to all the farmers around the country, I would go to that place, and I would get for my farmers my share.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">SR: You would distribute.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">GD: I would dis-, I would go with my farmers, and they would give me three horses.</span> <span id="s1201">Then we'll, we would work it out between the rest of the farmers who gets the horses.</span> <span id="s1202">Same thing with cows.</span> <span id="s1203">The same thing with a tractor or whatever, whatever.</span> <span id="s1204">I was their representative, and I worked with them.</span> <span id="s1205">And I worked it out very good.</span> <span id="s1206">They were very successful for four or five years.</span> <span id="s1207">And I never thought to leave the country, because I had a good business.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">SR: Yeah, I want to know, I'm interested in why you left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">GD: I sold to all these farmers the feed for the cows, horses, and chickens.</span> <span id="s1210">And it wasn't easy to get the license, but I got it.</span> <span id="s1211">And, but, the land was not our land.</span> <span id="s1212">The land was Arab land.</span> <span id="s1213">We applied, I applied for all these farmers, for all the land that we were paying rent every year, we applied for permanent, to buy the land.</span> <span id="s1214">And, the City of Haifa applied for the land.</span> <span id="s1215">The same land that we applied for, they applied.</span> <span id="s1216">They want to build housing for the new people that are coming to the country.</span> <span id="s1217">And we wanted to stay on the farms.</span> <span id="s1218">So the government offered us land far away from the cities, like in the Negev.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">SR: Yeah, that's where they wanted everybody to...</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">GD: All right.</span> <span id="s1221">I could understand that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">SR: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">GD: But my people...</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">SR: But you didn't want to go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">GD: My people who are, who already built those farms, who already were successful, they were starting to look somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1226">I was the first one to find out.</span> <span id="s1227">A commission of a few people came to the town, Tirat Hakarmel where I lived, and we had the land there.</span> <span id="s1228">They came down, and they sat down with me, and we spoke.</span> <span id="s1229">And they told me the first time that, "The city applied--Haifa--the City applied for the land, and you farmers applied for the land.</span> <span id="s1230">Now, you haven't got a chance."</span> <span id="s1231">So, my business, my connections, and everything, was starting to go downhill.</span> <span id="s1232">They didn't allow us, they didn't give us no more leases for the land.</span> <span id="s1233">They told us we'll have to get off the land.</span> <span id="s1234">Now, then I figured I'm gonna, I had a lot of connections in the world.</span> <span id="s1235">I said to my wife, she had a sister in New York.</span> <span id="s1236">And I said to my wife, "Now, we have to start new again, because this business is gonna be out in another year or so, because the commission told me that we don't have a chance."</span> <span id="s1237">So I knew we're not gonna get the land, that the City is gonna get it.</span> <span id="s1238">And, so I said to my wife, "I have connections here.</span> <span id="s1239">I can get any license I want.</span> <span id="s1240">And I'm buying you the nicest, in the Carmel, in Haifa, I'm buying you a condominium, and let's stay here, because the, the connections with people that I know here, in this country, I can never know anywhere else.</span> <span id="s1241">Because I know, and because I came early, and I got to know them through my work and all that."</span> <span id="s1242">So she came to the Har HaCarmel, and we looked up a beautiful apartment.</span> <span id="s1243">She liked it, but she still wanted to go to her sister in New York.</span> <span id="s1244">And I said, and I said, "The government offered me to open up like an A&amp;P, a Kol-Bo store, [“everything in it”] a Ko-, supermarket, which was called Kol-Bo.</span> <span id="s1245">And all the, the wholesalers where I delivered the farm products before, they were behind this thing, because a lot of little stores were selling, you know, for high prices.</span> <span id="s1246">And they wanted to have more big stores to compete with the little stores, so they keep the prices down.</span> <span id="s1247">So they wanted me to open up a store like that.</span> <span id="s1248">They would give me right away the license and everything.</span> <span id="s1249">And I wanted to do it.</span> <span id="s1250">Then all of a sudden the people in town found out, the fish store found out, the milk store found out, the vegetable store found out, that I'm gonna open up in this neighborhood a store like that, I'm gonna kill all these little stores.</span> <span id="s1251">And they were some of these my very good friends.</span> <span id="s1252">All of a sudden they were enemies of mine.</span> <span id="s1253">So, my wife says, "I still want to go to America."</span> <span id="s1254">So I applied, I made the papers to go to America, because to make that store I would have made a lot of enemies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">SR: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">GD: So I gave up to make the store.</span> <span id="s1257">I had all the connections.</span> <span id="s1258">I had all the resources to make it, but I still have a good trade.</span> <span id="s1259">I have a good, if I come to America, I'll do something else.</span> <span id="s1260">So I start to work on my papers.</span> <span id="s1261">I put in my papers to the Consul of the United States in Tel Aviv, and I started to liquidate my businesses, sell my apartment.</span> <span id="s1262">They allowed me to sell the apartment even though it wasn't mine, that I built it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">SR: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">GD: I invested money, so they don't care how much I paid for it.</span> <span id="s1265">But whatever I get for it is mine.</span> <span id="s1266">And I sold my businesses, which was a milk station from the farmers what I took in.</span> <span id="s1267">And the guy who bought the milk station, he said he's gonna make there a butcher store.</span> <span id="s1268">He's gonna take out the tanks there because the farm's gonna be...</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">SR: No more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">GD: Dismantled.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">SR: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">GD: No, it, yeah, it went slowly.</span> <span id="s1273">And the government gave everybody who had a farm, gave him an apartment, a condominium for nothing, just to get him off...</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">SR: Get him off the farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">GD: To get him off the farm.</span> <span id="s1276">And they, some of them had houses already there, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">SR: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">GD: Not expensive ones, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">SR: But still.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">GD: It helped.</span> <span id="s1281">But the government made deals with them.</span> <span id="s1282">But I left, and I went to the United States so...</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">SR: So you came to New York then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">GD: I came to New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">SR: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">GD: So I came to New York, but before I went to New York, I applied for my visa, and one of the butchers who had a butcher store, he knew that I sold my milk station, and the guy who bought that was a big farmer--he had about forty cows--and he knew that the guy wants to make a butcher store there.</span> <span id="s1287">And it was right next to his butcher store.</span> <span id="s1288">So the guy sent in an anonymous letter to the Consul that I'm a Communist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">SR: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">GD: And the United States Consul would not give me the visa.</span> <span id="s1291">They would not tell me for what reason.</span> <span id="s1292">And I didn't get it for a year.</span> <span id="s1293">And I liquidated everything.</span> <span id="s1294">I sold everything, but with a point, with a agreement that as long as I don't get the visa, I'm not getting out from the apartment or business.</span> <span id="s1295">Well, the business I did give up because the, slowly the farmers had to liquidate, so there was no more business.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">SR: So you...</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">GD: Right.</span> <span id="s1298">So I gave up the business and I kept the apartment.</span> <span id="s1299">One day, I went, well, I didn’t know what is happening.</span> <span id="s1300">Everybody who applied with me for visas got it.</span> <span id="s1301">And they are already in the United States, and I’m not.</span> <span id="s1302">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s1303">So I went down to the Consul at least I think three or four months later.</span> <span id="s1304">And I met a young fellow.</span> <span id="s1305">He was a Greek.</span> <span id="s1306">He was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1307">He was a Greek.</span> <span id="s1308">But he worked in the Consulate.</span> <span id="s1309">And we became a little bit friendly.</span> <span id="s1310">And I said, "What happened?</span> <span id="s1311">What happened to my papers that I got, that I'm not getting?</span> <span id="s1312">I'm not refused, but I'm not just getting.</span> <span id="s1313">You know, they're keeping me on hold.</span> <span id="s1314">They're not telling me what's what, why, how long it's going to take, or what.</span> <span id="s1315">I feel just like I'm swimming around on top of the ocean."</span> <span id="s1316">So this guy says to me, "Now, confidentially, somebody sent me in a letter about you.</span> <span id="s1317">And this will take a little while till they check it out.</span> <span id="s1318">And if everything is all right, you'll get your visa."</span> <span id="s1319">Finally I got my visa, and I came to the United States.</span> <span id="s1320">And that's where I am today.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">SR: What are you doing here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">GD: I came, and I started to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">SR: When did you come?</span> <span id="s1324">What year did you come?</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">GD: 1955.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">SR: '55.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">GD: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">SR: You've been here a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">GD: Yeah, 1955.</span> <span id="s1330">This year it will be thirty years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">SR: Thirty years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">GD: Right.</span> <span id="s1333">So I started to work.</span> <span id="s1334">Now I'm going back to my profession, to my...</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">SR: To your designing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">GD: Designing.</span> <span id="s1337">First I worked in a few stores, like the Stern Brothers, a few weeks only.</span> <span id="s1338">They didn't pay much, so I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">SR: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">GD: Then I worked somewhere else for a manufacturer.</span> <span id="s1341">They didn't pay much.</span> <span id="s1342">I didn't speak the language.</span> <span id="s1343">I didn't know the system.</span> <span id="s1344">But slowly I got to know the system.</span> <span id="s1345">I got to know the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1346">And wherever I worked, they didn't want to let me go.</span> <span id="s1347">So I worked on two jobs--seven years on one and seven years on another--as a designer.</span> <span id="s1348">I got good pay, treated like a king.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">SR: In New York City?</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">GD: In New York City.</span> <span id="s1351">I worked for Fair Group, which makes ladies' coats and suits.</span> <span id="s1352">And I worked for a Herman Kay [phonetic] company another seven years.</span> <span id="s1353">And then I asked this, these gentlemen from Fair Group, the owners, the father and son, that I would like to go on myself in business, if they ever get across a good salesman that wants to be on business, they should keep me in their mind, because they were very happy with the way I worked for them.</span> <span id="s1354">And they didn't want to let me go, but it's a long story, that day that I left the job, because I took a much bigger job, for much more money, and more responsibility.</span> <span id="s1355">And they would have given me the money that I got from the other job, but I didn't want to push out the head man who was there before.</span> <span id="s1356">And he was a Catholic.</span> <span id="s1357">He was a good friend of mine.</span> <span id="s1358">And I don't go for something like that, that for $50 or $100 I should lose a friend and push him out of the job.</span> <span id="s1359">I don't do that, so I didn't want to do it.</span> <span id="s1360">So I took a job with somebody else, and this man was still on the job.</span> <span id="s1361">Otherwise he would have lost the job, because I would have taken over, instead of being an assistant, to be the head.</span> <span id="s1362">And that's a true story.</span> <span id="s1363">That happened here.</span> <span id="s1364">So these people liked me so much--one of them is Milton Solomon, and Jerry Solomon, father and son--a half a year later that I asked them to do me a favor if they ever come across somebody, or a year later, they called me up and says, "Gabe, are you still interested to go in business?"</span> <span id="s1365">I said, "Yes!"</span> <span id="s1366">So they gave me a phone number from a gentleman, who was a buyer at Bloomingdale's.</span> <span id="s1367">And he was interested to go in business.</span> <span id="s1368">"And you get together and see what you can work out."</span> <span id="s1369">So we got together.</span> <span id="s1370">And this is a long story how it worked out.</span> <span id="s1371">But we formed a corporation.</span> <span id="s1372">We went into business.</span> <span id="s1373">Until today's day, my business is called Drindle [phonetic] Inc.</span> <span id="s1374">And we were very successful.</span> <span id="s1375">And we have a very good business.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">SR: You make wonderful, you make women's clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">GD: Women's coats, women's clothes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">SR: Oh, that's wonderful.</span> <span id="s1379">And it's in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">GD: It's in New York, 512-7th Avenue, New York.</span> <span id="s1381">And I'm selling it right now to my partner, my share of the business, because my partner is not that nice of a guy.</span> <span id="s1382">I didn't know that in the beginning, which in this business happens a lot.</span> <span id="s1383">And we don't get along too good, because there's a lot of money involved, and he is a very, very hungry man.</span> <span id="s1384">He's a very greedy guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">SR: And you're very ethical.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">GD: And, yes.</span> <span id="s1387">Yes.</span> <span id="s1388">And I didn't like that.</span> <span id="s1389">I know he's stealing me blind.</span> <span id="s1390">So, I decided instead of getting sick or having problems, that who knows what may happen.</span> <span id="s1391">We were first three partners in this business.</span> <span id="s1392">This gentleman, Jack Litman, who was a buyer at Bloomingdale's, he took in another partner that he has somebody with him that he is going to be the strong, those two are going to be the stronger ones against me.</span> <span id="s1393">If ever it comes to a good business, two against one.</span> <span id="s1394">And my lawyer told me--it was written in my contract, in my agreement, two out of three--and my lawyer told me, "Two out of three could mean nothing, and two out of three could mean a lot of trouble for you.</span> <span id="s1395">Because if those two people know each other from before, and when business is going to start to go, they're going to give you the business."</span> <span id="s1396">And that's exactly what's happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">SR: So you're selling out to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">GD: So, no, no.</span> <span id="s1399">It's a long story.</span> <span id="s1400">So, we were partners, three of us, close to nine years.</span> <span id="s1401">In the nine years they gave me a lot of trouble.</span> <span id="s1402">And I saw that these two people, these two guys, are especially, they were trying to push me out, as little money as possible.</span> <span id="s1403">But it wasn't easy because I'm not that stupid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">SR: And you're also strong!</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">GD: And I'm very strong.</span> <span id="s1406">Because whatever I went through, this is all a last minute, it's all experience.</span> <span id="s1407">So, this, one of his friends--one of the two partners is a friend from Jack Litman; they know each other twenty years--they were working together against me all the time.</span> <span id="s1408">So finally I figured out I have to break out these two guys.</span> <span id="s1409">We have to stay two out of two, not two out of three, because it doesn't work.</span> <span id="s1410">It works good for them but not for me.</span> <span id="s1411">So, this third partner was Jerry Small.</span> <span id="s1412">He was putting me up to have fights with this Jerry, Jack Litman because they worked together, and he told me that he's going to stay with me and we'll buy out Jack Litman.</span> <span id="s1413">So I agreed to buy out the third partner.</span> <span id="s1414">When it came to the buyout, the real thing, this guy stabbed me in the back and he went back with his friends.</span> <span id="s1415">This was all worked out between themselves.</span> <span id="s1416">So, I didn't trust him no more and I was figuring what to do with these two guys.</span> <span id="s1417">I gave him a high price because I didn't want to get out from the business.</span> <span id="s1418">The business was good, and I built it.</span> <span id="s1419">I did all the production, all the styles I made, everything, I got the factories, I got all the work done, but they did the selling.</span> <span id="s1420">If you have a good product, anybody could sell it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">SR: You can sell it, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">GD: Yeah, so anyway, we were good.</span> <span id="s1423">It was good, except that they weren't honest guys.</span> <span id="s1424">And they were trying to screw me, but they didn't have the, they had their own guy.</span> <span id="s1425">So finally, then about another year or two, they didn't want to pay the price what I wanted, so I said, "There is nothing to do."</span> <span id="s1426">They didn't want to let me see the books.</span> <span id="s1427">They didn't want to let me check things.</span> <span id="s1428">And they were threatening me all kind of different ways.</span> <span id="s1429">They were playing like big mafiosos.</span> <span id="s1430">So finally I figured out the other guy, Jerry Small, a year or two later he says he doesn't want to stay with the other guy, that he wants to stay with me.</span> <span id="s1431">Again the same story.</span> <span id="s1432">I says, "You did that already to me once, and I don't trust you, and you're playing games with me.</span> <span id="s1433">You have the wrong guy," I says.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">So he says to me, "You know what?</span> <span id="s1435">Let me have a meeting by my son's house and he'll be a witness, and I'm telling you this time I'm really wanting," because the guy's stealing away from him, too.</span> <span id="s1436">So he got mad.</span> <span id="s1437">So he says, "This time I want to do it with you, and I don't want to stay with the other guy.</span> <span id="s1438">The other guy is a crook.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">I says, "O.K. We'll have a meeting at your son's house, because I don't trust you no more."</span> <span id="s1440">We had a meeting at his son's house, and we agreed that we're going to buy the other guy out.</span> <span id="s1441">The next day, and his, the other guy's wife worked there, and his wife worked there.</span> <span id="s1442">So we both agreed, two out of three, that we're going to fire his wife.</span> <span id="s1443">And this way we don't stop to get, buy him out.</span> <span id="s1444">This guy stabbed me in the back again.</span> <span id="s1445">It came lunch time.</span> <span id="s1446">I says, "I'm going to go fire his wife."</span> <span id="s1447">She said, "No, no, no, don't fire her yet.</span> <span id="s1448">Let's wait a little."</span> <span id="s1449">"Oh, I says," again with the, with the game?</span> <span id="s1450">O.K." He comes at night, so he talks to me, he says, "Gabe, I can't do it.</span> <span id="s1451">I can't do it.</span> <span id="s1452">I have to stay with the other guy."</span> <span id="s1453">"Oh?</span> <span id="s1454">All right.</span> <span id="s1455">Stay with the other guy.</span> <span id="s1456">Fine.</span> <span id="s1457">You want to buy me out?</span> <span id="s1458">Give me just what I am asking."</span> <span id="s1459">So naturally they didn't want to pay.</span> <span id="s1460">They wanted to give me the business so I go out, and they have the business for nothing, almost for nothing.</span> <span id="s1461">But then, I figured this time, this guy stabbed me twice in the back.</span> <span id="s1462">It's time to pay him back.</span> <span id="s1463">So I went over next day to the other guy, to Jack Litman, who I was doing the fighting with, and I said, "Jack, we both can work together."</span> <span id="s1464">He didn't think we could work together.</span> <span id="s1465">"And we don't need the third guy, Jerry Small.</span> <span id="s1466">We can buy him out.</span> <span id="s1467">We'll work together.</span> <span id="s1468">I'll take care," I says, "on the production.</span> <span id="s1469">You take care of the selling."</span> <span id="s1470">"Fine."</span> <span id="s1471">In two months the guy was out.</span> <span id="s1472">We bought him out.</span> <span id="s1473">He gave his best friend the business.</span> <span id="s1474">He couldn't take it.</span> <span id="s1475">He couldn't take it not even two months.</span> <span id="s1476">He wanted, he begged, he wanted to get out, but I didn't.</span> <span id="s1477">So he went on.</span> <span id="s1478">And this guy is a crook.</span> <span id="s1479">And a crook cannot stay too long honest.</span> <span id="s1480">So he stayed two, two-and-a-half years honest with me.</span> <span id="s1481">And nicely, we worked beautifully.</span> <span id="s1482">Then he went into his old business, grabbing, stealing, and this.</span> <span id="s1483">And that's why I'm selling it out now.</span> <span id="s1484">Because I don't want to have fights, and it doesn't pay.</span> <span id="s1485">What I went through, all my life, it doesn't pay to go through with that.</span> <span id="s1486">No.</span> <span id="s1487">If I was--not Jewish, with a guy like this.</span> <span id="s1488">I would be the biggest antisemite in the whole world.</span> <span id="s1489">Because that's the way this person is.</span> <span id="s1490">I didn't check him under his fingers, I didn't check him for $5,000, for $10,000.</span> <span id="s1491">It's a $6,000,000 business.</span> <span id="s1492">But he wasn't, he, that wasn't enough.</span> <span id="s1493">Five, ten thousand dollars more for him wasn't enough.</span> <span id="s1494">He needs hundreds of thousands of dollars.</span> <span id="s1495">And he lives high.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">SR: [unclear]</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">GD: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1498">He lives high.</span> <span id="s1499">He gambles.</span> <span id="s1500">He gambles so.</span> <span id="s1501">He gambles for more money.</span> <span id="s1502">He gambles.</span> <span id="s1503">And if he has to pay his debts, he sells my goods, and he pays his debts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">SR: You have what, one child?</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">GD: Two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">SR: Oh, you have two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">GD: I

in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">SR: In Israel.</span> <span id="s1516">And are they both here, in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">GD: Yes, they're both here.</span> <span id="s1518">With my son I have a lot of problems.</span> <span id="s1519">With my son I have a lot of problems.</span> <span id="s1520">He was a genius.</span> <span id="s1521">He graduated Yeshivah Flatbush with scholarships, with highest marks.</span> <span id="s1522">He went to Brooklyn College.</span> <span id="s1523">And this was in the '68, '69, the Vietnam War, and he experimented with some LSD, and he ruined his mind.</span> <span id="s1524">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1525">And my daughter, thank God, is all right.</span> <span id="s1526">She has a family.</span> <span

<span id="s1534">And at least one side is all right.</span> <span id="s1535">The other side...</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">SR: It's a shame.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">GD: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1538">He ruined himself.</span> <span id="s1539">And I'm trying to help him in any way I can.</span> <span id="s1540">And he, he doesn't, he doesn't want no help.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">SR: Then you can't help him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">GD: He doesn't want to help himself, and he doesn't want to accept help.</span> <span id="s1543">And this goes on already for the last ten, twelve years.</span> <span id="s1544">I can't do nothing about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">SR: No, you can't.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">GD: I went to hospitals, I went to doctors, I went to psychiatrists.</span> <span id="s1547">I went all over the place you can imagine.</span> <span id="s1548">You’d better turn this off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">SR: Yeah,
