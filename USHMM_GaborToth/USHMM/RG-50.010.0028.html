Drewry -- D-R-E-W-R-Y.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">Q: And your address?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: 6640 Williamson Drive, N. E., Atlanta.</span> <span id="s7">Q: And your date of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: The sixteenth of February, 1921.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: And how old were you at the time of liberation?</span> <span id="s10">A: About 23 or 24.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: At that time, what were your career plans?</span> <span id="s12">Your prospective profession before you went into the service?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: I came directly from military school into the service and I had wanted to stay in service as a career.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: So that was your career goal.</span> <span id="s15">And your present occupation?</span> <span id="s16">A: I’m an engineer.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: What was your military unit?</span> <span id="s18">A: 602nd Field Artillery.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: And your rank at the time of liberation?</span> <span id="s20">A: First lieutenant.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Were you involved with the liberation of any specific camp?</span> <span id="s22">A: The name that comes to mind is Landsburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: How did you first hear about the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: We were not in an artillery support mission at that time.</span> <span id="s25">We were trying to help with the German POWs, and trying to take care of all the mob that was moving through our lines.</span> <span id="s26">Some of the people in our unit were with the infantry units.</span> <span id="s27">I was assisting in collecting the displaced persons and other people who were trying to get out of Germany.</span> <span id="s28">As soon as we got word back from our people about this particular camp, then I went on up to see what it was all about.</span> <span id="s29">I guess it was as much curiosity as anything else at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Was this the first you had heard about these camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: No, it was not, but with so much going on I didn't pay too much attention to it, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: What did you expect to see when you went to Landsburg?</span> <span id="s33">A: I had no idea, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: What about the people you were with?</span> <span id="s35">Did you go to the camp alone or with your unit?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: I went with my driver.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q. Had he heard about the camps?</span> <span id="s38">A: I don't think so.</span> <span id="s39">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: So you were sort of unprepared?</span> <span id="s41">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s42">Very much unprepared.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: And what date did you arrive at the camp?</span> <span id="s44">A: I would have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Approximately.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Let's see, the war was over in June, was it not?</span> <span id="s47">It was probably about a month.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Maybe not that long.</span> <span id="s49">I'm not completely sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Approximately a month before the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: It is hard to remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Right - that many years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: What I would like you to do, in your own words and in your own way, describe the camp as you remember it.</span> <span id="s55">What you saw, what you heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: When we got there, there were a few GI medics who had already gotten in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">The German people -- the camp operators -- were trying to, I guess you would say, destroy the evidence.</span> <span id="s58">They had several railroad cars loaded with corpses and they were putting gasoline on them, trying to burn them when we got into the place.</span> <span id="s59">They had the traditional striped uniforms there.</span> <span id="s60">I remember going into the gate and on the right hand side of the gate, there was a fence -- two rows of barbed wire -- and at that time there were people leaning up against the fence.</span> <span id="s61">They were barely alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: These were the prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: The prisoners.</span> <span id="s64">And over on the left of it, there were a couple of barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Apparently, this was not one of the larger camps.</span> <span id="s66">I never read anything about it in any of the records.</span> <span id="s67">The railroad yard, if I remember correctly, was toward the back end of the compound.</span> <span id="s68">By the time we got there, as I said, they were trying to burn the bodies.</span> <span id="s69">They had piled a bunch of them in the railroad cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: These were the Germans who worked the camp?</span> <span id="s71">A: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Were they military or were they civilians?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: They were military.</span> <span id="s74">They had on military uniforms.</span> <span id="s75">A few of the younger prisoners were walking around.</span> <span id="s76">One in particular, somehow, had a camera and was taking pictures.</span> <span id="s77">I distinctly remember that.</span> <span id="s78">How he got the camera of course I don't know.</span> <span id="s79">But he was taking pictures of what was going on.</span> <span id="s80">We stayed there for a while -- maybe a day or so -- and tried to help out.</span> <span id="s81">Then the medics and the graves registration people came and took over.</span> <span id="s82">We evacuated to a hospital somewhere some of the people.</span> <span id="s83">I don't have any idea of numbers.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Have you any idea of how many prisoners were there at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: It was not a large camp.</span> <span id="s86">Of that much I’m sure.</span> <span id="s87">I'd guess probably a couple of hundred.</span> <span id="s88">In fact, I don't believe there were more than about two barracks there or three at the outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Was there anything else there, other than the barracks, that you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: A couple of small shacks that were probably command shacks or something like that.</span> <span id="s91">I don't believe that this one was an extermination type thing like the Dachau type thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: You saw no evidence of anything other than...</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Other than just emaciated people and trying to get rid of the bodies.</span> <span id="s94">Q: Were there many bodies that you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: There were more lying down than there were standing up.</span> <span id="s96">Some of them, without examination, you couldn't tell whether they were living or dead.</span> <span id="s97">They were at that point.</span> <span id="s98">Most of them were very emaciated.</span> <span id="s99">This young fellow I'd guess was probably in his early twenties....</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: The one that was taking the pictures?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s102">He looked better than any of the others and I'm not so sure he didn't switch uniforms, now that I think about it, since he did look so much better than some of the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: What do you mean by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: I mean from a German uniform to the other one.</span> <span id="s105">Q: Because he looked physically so well?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Because he looked physically so much better than the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Did the prisoners do anything when they saw you?</span> <span id="s108">Do you remember that?</span> <span id="s109">A: We were not the first ones in there.</span> <span id="s110">We came in very soon thereafter.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: About how long afterward?</span> <span id="s112">A: Probably less than an hour.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: So you were one of the first people in?</span> <span id="s114">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Did the prisoners come up to you?</span> <span id="s116">Did they do anything in relationship to you?</span> <span id="s117">A: The ones that were walking around were glad to see us</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: How did they express that?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Just general jubilation.</span> <span id="s120">I don't know.</span> <span id="s121">I didn't understand German.</span> <span id="s122">A few of them were speaking English, but they didn't have to put it into words that you could understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Non-verbal communication was there.</span> <span id="s124">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Of course, you were there as a visitor, but were there any specific orders concerning the treatment of the prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: We were just trying to give first aid until our military government people and civil defense people came in who knew how to take care of the situation.</span> <span id="s127">We didn't stay there too long.</span> <span id="s128">We got out as soon as the other people got in.</span> <span id="s129">We’d made an effort to feed them and that was about it.</span> <span id="s130">Our own aid people were working with some of the people that needed medical attention</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: You told me initially that you and your driver went in.</span> <span id="s132">Who is the "we" that you are talking about at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: The American troops.</span> <span id="s134">An infantry unit.</span> <span id="s135">And I’m reasonably sure about the name of this particular location.</span> <span id="s136">I guess maybe you've cross interviewed.....</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: This name is not familiar to me, but I'm sure it is to someone else in the Project.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">It was located near where?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: Landsburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: That was the name of the camp or is that they name of the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: That's the name of the town.</span> <span id="s142">I said Landsburg - there were two of them.</span> <span id="s143">I'm confused.</span> <span id="s144">One town is Landsburg and one town is Augsburg.</span> <span id="s145">I was certain when we first started talking, but right now I'm not so sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: That's okay.</span> <span id="s147">That's close enough at this point and time.</span> <span id="s148">So your unit itself went into the camp after you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Our unit was split up.</span> <span id="s150">I had a few people with me trying to take care of the people who were trying to get through our lines -- the Germans who were trying to surrender and the displaced persons trying to get back home and the German defectors trying to come on through with the displaced persons.</span> <span id="s151">We were, more or less, trying to herd them up and get them to a point where the MPs and the civil affairs and military government people could take care of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: So your role was predominantly, as you said, a first-aid type of thing.</span> <span id="s153">A: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: How did your fellow soldiers and/or superior officers treat the prisoners?</span> <span id="s155">What did they say to them that you can recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s157">They had teams in there as soon as this was reported.</span> <span id="s158">Apparently, our Intelligence effort on this particular location was not as good as it should have been.</span> <span id="s159">I don't think the camp was expected to be there.</span> <span id="s160">It did catch my group in particular by surprise.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: You don't recall any of the behavior of the soldiers, the liberators, in the camp?</span> <span id="s162">A: They were all awed -- all of us -- at the humanity that we saw at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Would you tell me what you mean by awed so I'll really understand this?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: I guess we were amazed, surprised to find human beings being treated in this</span></p> <p><span id="s165">manner.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Do you remember any of your feelings about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: I guess I probably had a feeling of disgust as much as anything else.</span> <span id="s168">Why one group would treat another one like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Not disgust toward the prisoners, but disgust toward the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Disgust toward the Germans.</span> <span id="s171">My orientation and my plans were to stay military at that time and, of course, we had been indoctrinated on the Geneva Convention and this other type of prisoner of war treatment and to see what one group had done to another was disgusting.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Pretty strong feelings.</span> <span id="s173">A: Yes, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Seeing the condition of the prisoners, did it make it difficult for you to think of them as human beings?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Yes, that it very true.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Can you tell me something about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: I don't know how to put this into words.</span> <span id="s178">Here I was, used to people fairly healthy, fairly strong -- GIs, American soldiers -- and here we come into a place that really had listless people, the ones that were living.</span> <span id="s179">I guess probably the most prevailing mood among the people -- there were so many of them just sitting down or lying around -- was that this was just a matter of course.</span> <span id="s180">This is what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s181">Resignation.</span> <span id="s182">I don't know whether I've answered your question there or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: You’ve told me what you were observing about that.</span> <span id="s184">It's a hard question to answer, when you see people is such a shape.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: That's, that's right.</span> <span id="s186">You kind of forget one minute that they are human and then the realization hits you that they are human.</span> <span id="s187">The initial shock is human, and then you go on about your business, the work that you had to do, and the human aspect still stayed there, but it changed slightly.</span> <span id="s188">Just how, I can't put into words.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: It sounds as if you are trying to say that maybe it became a job -- something you had to take care of.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Yes, I guess you're right.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: The personal aspect was sort of pushed away.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s193">Our unit had been through some fairly rough times prior to that and it got to be a job really.</span> <span id="s194">Whereas they weren’t Americans, they were another nationality over there and it didn't quite have the impact, of course, if it had been people you had served with.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Let's talk about the Germans a little bit.</span> <span id="s196">You said that there were some Germans present at the camp when you arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Yes, they were in custody at the time.</span> <span id="s198">The first group of infantrymen had already taken them into custody.</span> <span id="s199">A few of them had been shot, but most of them had been taken into custody.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: How did you recognize the guards that were there?</span> <span id="s201">A: By their uniforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: What did the Germans in the camp do toward you?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: When we got there they already had them collected.</span> <span id="s204">Som e of them had been evacuated.</span> <span id="s205">I believe that we took some of them back.</span> <span id="s206">I say "we" -- some of our people came in later on.</span> <span id="s207">I think we evacuated some of them, but I'm not sure about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: What about their behavior?</span> <span id="s209">Do you remember anything about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Remorseful.</span> <span id="s211">Remorseful as far as their actions were concerned.</span> <span id="s212">We didn't do any talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: What about toward the survivors?</span> <span id="s214">Did you see the guards doing anything in relation to the survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: No.</span> <span id="s216">Other than what I've said.</span> <span id="s217">The burning was over when we got there.</span> <span id="s218">The infantrymen had extinguished it as best they could, but it was still smoldering.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: What were your orders concerning the treatment of the guards?</span> <span id="s220">A: Just to evacuate them.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: How did the survivors or the American soldiers treat the guards?</span> <span id="s222">Did you see any behavior along that line?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: No, I didn't.</span> <span id="s224">They just put them on trucks and moved them out.</span> <span id="s225">Q: Were the Germans pretty docile?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Not the German arrogance that had been prevalent.</span> <span id="s227">We had captured some German prisoners from time to time and these were not the same people -- no resemblance in their actions.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Describe the difference for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Some of the German soldiers that we had captured had been German professional soldiers, and in spite of the fact that they were on the other side, you had to respect them.</span> <span id="s230">The conscript -- that was another story.</span> <span id="s231">They had a different attitude entirely from the professionals.</span> <span id="s232">Some of them were the die- hard type -- defend the fatherland type soldiers.</span> <span id="s233">Others, once they were captured, were glad to get out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: That was the conscript soldier?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Right.</span> <span id="s236">That was the soldier.</span> <span id="s237">My contact was not that much with the prison guard.</span> <span id="s238">They did what they were told to do.</span> <span id="s239">I used the word "remorseful" a while ago.</span> <span id="s240">I think that resignation is a better word than remorseful.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: What would your answer be to the question what kind of people would do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: After this latest thing down there in Guyana with people that have been thoroughly brainwashed, I really don't know.</span> <span id="s243">And I've thought about this a lot since then.</span> <span id="s244">I guess I'm almost convinced that they thought that they were doing right.</span> <span id="s245">Of course, right is a judgment term.</span> <span id="s246">With Hitler and his leadership, the ones that were against him were eliminated one way or the other.</span> <span id="s247">And so this thing in Guyana -- the leadership there were highly convinced to take their own lives.</span> <span id="s248">At least, that's what we hear.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: So, what are you saying then?</span> <span id="s250">That they were almost brainwashed?</span> <span id="s251">A: Yes, that would have to be it.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: One last question in relation to the German guards or military in the camp.</span> <span id="s253">Did you see any violent incidents between any of the survivors and any of the guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: If they had taken place, it was before we got there.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: You witnessed nothing?</span> <span id="s256">What about German civilians?</span> <span id="s257">Were there any around at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: I didn't see any.</span> <span id="s259">I heard that the military government brought some civilians in to help dispose of the bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: And what did you hear about that?</span> <span id="s261">A: About a day or so afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Did you hear anything about the civilians behavior?</span> <span id="s263">A: No, I didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: I know it is difficult to answer when you didn't witness it, but what you heard, too, is important.</span> <span id="s265">You say some were brought in to help dispose of the bodies?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: That is what we heard from our headquarters.</span> <span id="s267">Q: You don't know how they reacted?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: After seeing the camp, did you feel that the civilians had any responsibility.</span> <span id="s270">A: How do you mean any responsibility?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: For the camp, for the situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Obviously it could not have gone on without civilian knowledge.</span> <span id="s273">I say that, but things go on right here in Atlanta without my own knowledge, so maybe it was apathy on the part of the civilians.</span> <span id="s274">Of course, at that time there weren't too many civilians.</span> <span id="s275">All the males of all ages just about were in service.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Did you have any orders in relation to the civilians at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Only to round them up and then the military government and intelligence would handle it from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Round up some of the civilians?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Right.</span> <span id="s280">Any of them that were in our way or prohibiting or inhibiting us in the things we were attempting to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Let's talk about yourself and your military unit.</span> <span id="s282">How did you and your men cope with this experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: I guess, as I said previously, a job.</span> <span id="s284">We were trying to wind things up.</span> <span id="s285">Things were going good for the U.S. and Allied side.</span> <span id="s286">We were moving fast and we didn't stay there long enough for it to gnaw on us.</span> <span id="s287">We had so many other things.</span> <span id="s288">Of course, we were aware of it, had seen it, but we had so many other things that really were more important to us at that immediate time.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Did anyone ask to be relieved of this particular duty?</span> <span id="s290">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: I'm looking for any particularly strong reactions such as did the Chaplain have a more active role at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: In the situation we were in, the Chaplain was not.</span> <span id="s293">He might have come up later on.</span> <span id="s294">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: After you left the camp -- some of this may apply- - did the men seem to have to deal with this in some way?</span> <span id="s296">The men in your unit.</span> <span id="s297">Any talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: We had a Jewish supply clerk that didn't talk.</span> <span id="s299">He went for several days.</span> <span id="s300">He almost went completely mute.</span> <span id="s301">That's the only major reaction that I recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Did the other men talk about it?</span> <span id="s303">A: Yes, it was general conversation.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Do you remember any of the kinds of things they might have been saying.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Probably the physical appearance of the people.</span> <span id="s306">We had about as much discussion on that as anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: What about you?</span> <span id="s308">Did you tell anyone about the camp or talk with anyone about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Only to our Battalion Intelligence officer as far as the unit was concerned.</span> <span id="s310">Do you mean since then?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Both.</span> <span id="s312">Then and now.</span> <span id="s313">But first, at that point in time.</span> <span id="s314">Right after the experience.</span> <span id="s315">A: I guess probably my driver and I talked about it f rom time to time.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: What kind of things?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Here again man's inhumanity to man would be the summation of it.</span> <span id="s318">Q: Did you write home about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: I really didn't think it was anything to be discussed.</span> <span id="s322">In retrospect, it's something I guess everyone should see.</span> <span id="s323">Everyone should see what has taken place.</span> <span id="s324">Then we had censorship.</span> <span id="s325">I guess it would have cleared censorship, but we didn't have the free press like we...we didn't have the expression of ourselves like we do today.</span> <span id="s326">We didn't have the media coverage.</span> <span id="s327">Of course, we had photographs but they were suppressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: By whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: You didn't see all this stuff in the papers here that you did...the more gruesome things that took place in Korea and Viet Nam.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: You feel that the media coverage was not as extensive then?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: Right.</span> <span id="s332">You didn't have any television.</span> <span id="s333">You had your movie cameras there, but they were very careful not to show too much.</span> <span id="s334">When you saw the films, the pictures were selected with a little greater taste.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Who did this kind of selection?</span> <span id="s336">Who was discriminating in the selection?</span> <span id="s337">A: I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Was it an individual choice or do you think there were some rules laid down from someplace else?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: I would have no idea, but I would guess it was probably more of an individual choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Why are you willing to talk about this to us now?</span> <span id="s341">You indicated that you really had not talked about it too much before.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: I guess after seeing the presentation and seeing what a rosy picture is painted on the presentation....</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Which presentation is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: The Holocaust1, the television show.</span> <span id="s345">That really was rosy compared to the actuality.</span> <span id="s346">Even on the little part that I saw.</span> <span id="s347">I think that the general public does not have a complete picture on what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: What part was "rosy?"</span> <span id="s349">Were they leaving out a part of the reality?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: The real gruesomeness was not shown.</span> <span id="s351">Even though it was a "parental guidance," the real gruesomeness was not there.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: Have you talked with your wife and children about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Only to the extent that when the TV program came out, I mentioned something about it at that time.</span> <span id="s354">But only to that extent.</span> <span id="s355">Other than that, I don't think I've 1Holocaust was an NBC television mini series which aired in January of 1978</span></p> <p><span id="s356">said anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Do you feel it's important that they should know about this?</span> <span id="s358">A: Yes, I definitely do.</span> <span id="s359">Now.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: What do you mean by now?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Going back to the TV presentation.</span> <span id="s362">Anyone who hasn't experienced at least a little of it really doesn't get the entire picture.</span> <span id="s363">You saw actors doing thus and so; you saw families separated but that was just a small part -- the real impact wasn't there.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: So the Holocaust has stimulated your wanting to talk, not only to us but to them about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: What kind of feelings do you feel it should get across to them, the message to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: The message is if you sit back and do nothing, the same thing could happen right here in this country.</span> <span id="s368">We think it's remote, but we've seen it just in the past month or so -- this thing with Jones.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: Is there anything people can learn from this?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: Yes, indeed.</span> <span id="s371">There’s a great message there.</span> <span id="s372">Unfortunately, as of now, we haven't done too much about it.</span> <span id="s373">If we don't do something, if we don't take part in our own government and express our own opinions, this could happen right in our back door and really not know it because it's too late.</span> <span id="s374">From what I've read, this is what happened in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Should this be taught in the schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: It definitely should be taught in the schools.</span> <span id="s377">Q: In religious classes?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Not necessarily religious classes -- political science.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Why the emphasis more on political science?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Because your religion is so curtailed today; the things you can teach in public school on religion.</span> <span id="s381">Political science, not yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: I was thinking about religious classes in churches.</span> <span id="s383">A: Fine, there.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Do you want to restate what you think the message ought to be?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: The message should be that we have got to get over our apathy -- express our opinions and get involved in governmental processes and let our voice be heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: I like the way that sounds.</span> <span id="s387">Did you have any difficulties with nightmares after this experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: No.</span> <span id="s389">I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: None at all?</span> <span id="s391">What about more recently?</span> <span id="s392">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Let's talk a little bit about religion, in relation to this.</span> <span id="s394">First, did you consider yourself a religious person at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: I really don't know.</span> <span id="s396">I've been born, brought up, and raised in the church.</span> <span id="s397">My mother made me go every time the church doors opened.</span> <span id="s398">I had a basic belief, of course, but as far as being "born again", no.</span> <span id="s399">I had a basic faith and basic belief.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: But you did not consider yourself a particularly religious person one way or the other?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: When we were getting ready to do something extra, I would usually go to chapel services.</span> <span id="s402">Maybe it was a kind of insurance program.</span> <span id="s403">Maybe because of my basic training before at home.</span> <span id="s404">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: You don't recall feeling any particular need [unintelligible] training?</span> <span id="s406">A: I didn't understand you.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: A need to go to religious service out of something else other than just out of your training.</span> <span id="s408">It is as if you were saying it was a habit -- something you were used to doing.</span> <span id="s409">At that time, you said you went as insurance.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Yes, when I said something "big" I meant when we were getting ready to launch any kind of action.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: It's a hard question to answer.</span> <span id="s412">I’m going to go ahead and turn this over.</span> <span id="s413">[End of Side One.</span> <span id="s414">Conversation resumes on Side Two as follows]</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Do you mind telling me what your religion is?</span> <span id="s416">A: Methodist.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: Are you a member of the church?</span> <span id="s418">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Did you have any conscious thoughts about God or religion when you were at the camp that you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Man’s inhumanity to man.</span> <span id="s421">The prevalent thought was how could anybody do this to anyone else.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Did you have any thoughts that you might consider irreligious?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: My general opinion of the [unintelligible] at that time was definitely irreligious.</span> <span id="s424">Q: Do you want to tell me about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: This goes back to how could they do this?</span> <span id="s426">If they didn’t like the people, there are other ways and means of [unintelligible] than this starvation and extermination which they were utilizing.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Do you think religion might have had anything to do with the way you viewed the prisoners?</span> <span id="s428">Your religion or theirs.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Are you talking about anti-Semitic...?</span> <span id="s430">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: No.</span> <span id="s432">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s433">I’ve never been anti-Semitic, anti most anything about a person.</span> <span id="s434">I’ve always pretty much judged a person on his own merit, his own ability.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: I sort of get a sense that you didn’t have a great feeling about religion entering into any of your own religious [unintelligible].</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Did you ever give any thought as to whether you would have kept your faith if you were a prisoner, if you had been in their place?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: I think faith is the only thing they had to go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Did your own religion have any affect on your attitude towards forgiving the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: This is something that I don’t know if I’ve ever forgiven in the true sense of the word.</span> <span id="s441">Forget?</span> <span id="s442">No.</span> <span id="s443">I don’t think I could answer it any further than that.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Are you saying that you really don’t feel you can forgive them for what they did?</span> <span id="s445">Is that what you’re saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: I guess I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: One last section now.</span> <span id="s448">We’ll talk about political aspects.</span> <span id="s449">Did this experience change your political views in any way towards civil rights?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s451">As I said earlier I’ve always tried to judge people by their own ability, their own merit.</span> <span id="s452">I wouldn’t have gone out and campaigned for civil rights as such.</span> <span id="s453">I wouldn’t have paraded down the street with a bunch of black [unintelligible] or white [unintelligible] with a placard.</span> <span id="s454">I wouldn’t have done that.</span> <span id="s455">As far as Jewish people is concerned, historically they’ve been an oppressed people.</span> <span id="s456">They have usually managed to come around and here again I’m [unintelligible].</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: What about towards the Viet Nam war or the war in the Middle East?</span> <span id="s458">Did this experience have any affect on your political views now or through the years towards that?</span> <span id="s459">I can sense that you’ve never thought about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Not consciously.</span> <span id="s461">I have other thoughts on the Viet Nam deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: But you did relate it to what happened in Guyana as we talked here today.</span> <span id="s463">Why do you think it happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: You had a leadership not too much unlike Hitler except for Hitler’s atheistic beliefs.</span> <span id="s465">Hitler came along and did what the German people wanted to have done.</span> <span id="s466">Jones did the same thing.</span> <span id="s467">No question about it Hitler turned the German economy around completely.</span> <span id="s468">But it was a dictatorship all the way through.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Jones had that same thing too.</span> <span id="s470">This goes back to my statement of if we sit down and keep quiet...I won’t say Jimmy Carter can do it but he’s done a few things here recently that maybe don’t exactly fit into the mold, but if we sit back and don’t express our opinion more can happen.</span> <span id="s471">Not necessary by him but by anyone else in that position.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: What you’re saying again is political awareness and involvement is very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Do you have children?</span> <span id="s475">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: What would your reaction be if your child said he wanted to be a Nazi?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: First place my son, who turned 23 on Christmas, would not do it.</span> <span id="s478">I say that.</span> <span id="s479">I think I know him but then again we don’t always know our children.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Why do you think he wouldn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: For one he’s in the Coast Guard Reserve.</span> <span id="s482">He’s very anti-Nazi.</span> <span id="s483">He’s been doing a little reading himself on this.</span> <span id="s484">He’s very American [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s485">Same thing about my daughter but that’s another story.</span> <span id="s486">I don’t know what my reaction would be.</span> <span id="s487">I guess as I’ve grown old I’ve gotten a little more mellow.</span> <span id="s488">I certainly wouldn’t approve of it.</span> <span id="s489">I’d try to talk them out of it.</span> <span id="s490">You can’t lead their lives for them.</span> <span id="s491">You give them some guidance and they’ve got to take care of their own destiny.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: Would it disappoint you if they had said something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s494">I'm hoping that Nazism is history.</span> <span id="s495">We've got several areas that are bordering on it, but....</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Which areas?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: I said Nazism.</span> <span id="s498">I guess dictatorship is really what I'm talking about.</span> <span id="s499">Brazil is doing pretty much the same thing according to the newspaper reports.</span> <span id="s500">And there are probably some more.</span> <span id="s501">Mao Tse Tung, Ho Chi Minh are doing the same thing except really not too much different circumstances either.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: What do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: Dictatorship.</span> <span id="s504">Call it whatever you want, but that's really what it was.</span> <span id="s505">They were eliminating their opposition and that is what was happening in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Do you see the Holocaust and what was happening in Germany as primarily a Jewish persecution or was it a general persecution?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: It started out as a Jewish persecution and it expanded.</span> <span id="s508">From what I've read, it definitely expanded.</span> <span id="s509">It got to the Polish people - not necessarily Jewish, but Poles.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: It expanded to other groups of people?</span> <span id="s511">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Can you identify what the persecution was directed toward?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Only by what I've read.</span> <span id="s514">I think that, here again, that was a thorn in Hitler's side because the Jewish people were and always have been industrious and they controlled a good bit of the money and industry.</span> <span id="s515">This was something that didn't fit into Hitler's plan -- the so-called Aryan race.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: You talked about the expansion of the persecution to other people.</span> <span id="s517">How did that fit in?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: I believe that after he got started in the elimination programs, which you can call a success as far as Hitler was concerned, they thought nothing of just adding to the operation.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: For what purpose?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: [To eliminate] people who were defying the governmental authority.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: The opposition.</span> <span id="s522">As you were saying in relation to Mao Tse Tung.</span> <span id="s523">Did what you saw there change your attitude toward Jews in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Yes, I probably began to feel more sympathy towards them as a race.</span> <span id="s525">Certainly, as a race, the Jewish people have not had it easy ever since Biblical times.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: So it changed in that they haven't had it easy.</span> <span id="s527">In what way did your attitude change?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: More sympathetic for the Jewish race.</span> <span id="s529">Here again, I go back to what I try to do, which is to judge a person on his individual merit.</span> <span id="s530">I have some very good Jewish friends and some very good black friends.</span> <span id="s531">I guess this is a typical statement there.</span> <span id="s532">As a race, they've had it pretty rough.</span> <span id="s533">No question about it.</span> <span id="s534">Right now, with this peace treaty thing, I can't put myself in the position of the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s535">It looks like Egypt is trying to make a concerted effort and Israel is, maybe, making demands that are not reasonable.</span> <span id="s536">I don't know.</span> <span id="s537">I think my general opinion towards the Jews could change somewhat if they don't make a more concerted effort to try to get a peace in the Middle East.</span> <span id="s538">Of course, we don't know the whole story, but from what we hear and read, it seems that Israel [sic] is making a concerted effort to get a peace and it looks like Israel is demanding the utmost for the peace.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Let's clarify what you said.</span> <span id="s540">I'm not sure you said it the way you meant.</span> <span id="s541">You said two things.</span> <span id="s542">You said you think Israel is making...let’s go back and just play that little section.</span> <span id="s543">[Pause] All right, we've played it back and you said yes, that was what you meant to say.</span> <span id="s544">Okay, one last question.</span> <span id="s545">Do you feel a need to do something today to make sure this never happens again?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s547">I think I've hit on that several times here in this interview.</span> <span id="s548">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Yes, we have.</span> <span id="s550">In politics, education, religion, your occupation, personal contacts.</span> <span id="s551">How?</span> <span id="s552">What?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: Education-- both in the schools and through the media.</span> <span id="s554">A concerted effort to get people to, at least, vote even if they can't do anything else.</span> <span id="s555">The power of the individual -- what an individual can do.</span> <span id="s556">Of course, we've got Hitler in this case, but in our own country, what's her name, Madeline O'Hara, down here in Texas.</span> <span id="s557">She got the prayer out of the schools.</span> <span id="s558">She's now working on taking out "under God" in our Pledge of Allegiance and "in God we trust" on our coinage.</span> <span id="s559">It shows what one person can do if we sit back and let one person do it.</span> <span id="s560">We have got to educate our people.</span> <span id="s561">Things like this will definitely help.</span> <span id="s562">We've seen another case of 1954 and the Civil Rights movement got in its big push.</span> <span id="s563">The leaders were saying "register to vote.”</span> <span id="s564">You see what happened there.</span> <span id="s565">A lot of things have changed as a result of that -- getting out and registering to vote and voting.</span> <span id="s566">So, we've got an obligation to get to our young people.</span> <span id="s567">We've got to get to them.</span> <span id="s568">We have got to set examples ourselves.</span> <span id="s569">The least thing we can do is to vote.</span> <span id="s570">I insist that my boy vote, and as doon as my daughter is old enough, I will insist the same thing.</span> <span id="s571">My wife and I both do that.</span> <span id="s572">She is more active than I am.</span> <span id="s573">She goes to school board meetings, etc.</span> <span id="s574">I try to see what is going on.</span> <span id="s575">We have got to take an active part in this.</span> <span id="s576">We have got to write our Congressmen and Senators.</span> <span id="s577">Apathy is what took care of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: I take it your message is involvement and awareness.</span> <span id="s579">A: Involvement, that's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: What you’ve been saying all along.</span> <span id="s581">And you are practicing what you preach by teaching your children.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Absolutely, I practice what I preach on that.</span> <span id="s583">Both Nunn and Talmadge know me by my first name.</span> <span id="s584">There's no question about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: So, you give more than lip service.</span> <span id="s586">I made a note earlier to myself that when we first started talking, you said that you had planned to stay in the military.</span> <span id="s587">I made a note to myself to ask you did this experience at the camp change your mind in any way about staying in the military?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: No.</span> <span id="s589">My mother and father didn't want me to stay in the military.</span> <span id="s590">That was the main reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Well all right, and thank you.</span></p></body></html>
