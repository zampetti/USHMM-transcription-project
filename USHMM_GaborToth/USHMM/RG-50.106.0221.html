id="s412">A: Because some of the fellows went out to Kansas and some went to Altoona, Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s413">And Washington D.C. was easy to get to New York on the railroad.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s415">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: So, I was lucky there.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: Then after that, what did you do?</span></p>

id="s671">In fact, he told me that was the best year of his life, when he was there, because he had a beautiful home, right, at a beautiful area.</span> <span id="s672">It's a peninsula on there —— where the East River joins the Long Island Sound.</span> <span id="s673">Another son had been an infantry captain, another grandson.</span> <span id="s674">And they took him out of the infantry, and he never went overseas.</span> <span id="s675">He was assigned to, I think, Camp Detrick, in Frederick, Maryland.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Fort Detrick.</span> <span id="s677">Fort Detrick.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s679">It became Fort Detrick</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: And the reason they took him out of the infantry was, he had a doctorate in bacteriology.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s683">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: And he did research on biological warfare.</span> <span id="s685">In fact, I think he came down with anthrax himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: Oh, my gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: But he survived.</span> <span id="s688">They were working with the bug.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Um—hum.</span> <span id="s690">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: And another one, doesn't say where he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: Where —— let's go back to your story now.</span> <span id="s693">So, you took the Queen Elizabeth over.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: Right.</span> <span id="s695">With 20,000 other men.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: Twenty thousand.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: You couldn't imagine how crowded it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s699">And where did you land?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: We landed in —— I think it's called Gourock, the Port of Glasgow.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: Is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: I don't know names.</span> <span id="s705">And we were welcomed ——</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: —— as we landed in the morning by a parade of a band of men in kilts playing bagpipes.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: That was our greeting to Great Britain.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: And as we paraded off, we march to the train and that took us to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: And it was a full day trip down to a place —— I don't know what —— where they stopped, but I know wherever we stopped, I had gotten sick on the train.</span> <span id="s714">I got land sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: And the fellows helped me off onto a truck, and we went to a camp at a place called Wotton—under—Edge.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: I don't think you've ever heard of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: But a very famous man came from there.</span> <span id="s721">Wyecliffe.</span> <span id="s722">You ever hear of Wyecliffe?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: Wyecliffe translated the Bible to English.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s726">Into English, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: You're talking about April '44, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: April '44.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: I think it took us about eight days to get there.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: Now, the Queen Elizabeth normally would make England in about four days and five hours, but it took a wandering course.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s735">I would imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Every trip was different.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: And the ship changed course every six minutes.</span> <span id="s739">But the last night, as we were approaching the coast of England, up at Scotland, it was changing course every minute or two.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Oh, my.</span> <span id="s741">Oh, my.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: And people were falling out of the bunks.</span> <span id="s743">It was just keeling.</span> <span id="s744">Unbelievable.</span> <span id="s745">But they got us there safely.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Yes, right.</span> <span id="s747">Right.</span> <span id="s748">So, then you were in Wyecliffe.</span> <span id="s749">And then what?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: We were there maybe about a week, and we went to another town, at —— called Clevedon, on the coast.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: A beautiful town.</span> <span id="s753">And from there, you could see Wales.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: And now this is still before D—Day; right?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: This is before D—Day.</span> <span id="s756">In fact, that's where we were preparing for D—Day.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: And how much did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: We didn't know too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: But ——</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: And you are still doing your radio work?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s763">But we didn't know too much.</span> <span id="s764">We did our work, and that's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: And then we went to —— from there, we're there maybe two or three weeks, we went to a place called Pittsfield, about 20 miles north of Bristol.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: Um—hum.</span> <span id="s768">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: And we were in a camp there with —— I think there was a —— a PX company that ran PXs, and also a camouflage engineer battalion.</span> <span id="s770">And that's where we had our last preparation for the invasion.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: And one of the days just before the invasion —— in fact, maybe a couple weeks before the invasion, we would —— went training on every weapon we had in the company.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: You fired every weapon.</span> <span id="s775">Machine guns and rifles and submachine guns and pistols.</span> <span id="s776">And suddenly, a couple of groups of men from my section were taken out.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: We didn't know where they went.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: And they —— and also one group that went, went with the radio truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: On a two—and—a—half—ton truck.</span> <span id="s783">It was what —— a doghouse.</span> <span id="s784">I don't know if you've ever seen them.</span> <span id="s785">And it was a radio, and then these were groups that were landed.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">One of the groups in my section, we learned later, operated General Bradley's communication.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Oh, my.</span> <span id="s788">Were you in one of those groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: Well, I wasn't in that group.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: No, I know.</span> <span id="s791">But ——</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: They were —— came from my group.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: But we had no choice.</span> <span id="s795">They took some men, and they left.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s797">Right.</span> <span id="s798">So, what did you do then?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: So —— well, I remained in the company.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s801">And then?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: And those groups landed on, I think D Plus One.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: The second day.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: Second day.</span> <span id="s806">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: The ones with the radios for ——</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: —— General Bradley and also —— one truck reported war correspondents.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: And they were —— that was —— the name of their radio station was Jig Easy Sugar Queen, JESQ.</span> <span id="s812">They reported, I think, from D Plus Two on.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: And I remained with another unit, which was a bigger broadcast unit than that one.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: Had —— it had two trailers.</span> <span id="s817">And I could drive a small truck.</span> <span id="s818">I had never driven a big truck.</span> <span id="s819">Before we landed, we were on a troop ship, and LST, Landing Ship, Tank.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: This is D Plus One?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: No.</span> <span id="s822">This is —— actually, this is D Plus 20.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: We were supposed to go in much before, but there was a big storm.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s826">So, this is three weeks after D—Day?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: Twenty days.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s829">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: When the rest of the company went there.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: And the company commander asked me to drive the trailer truck.</span> <span id="s833">And I said, "Look, I've never driven one of these.</span> <span id="s834">If you order me to, I'll try."</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: But I didn't want to drive it because it had about six or seven forward speeds.</span> <span id="s837">And I had never driven one.</span> <span id="s838">I wouldn't be accustomed.</span> <span id="s839">It would be ridiculous ——</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: —— to founder around and try to figure out what to do when you're landing at a beach.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: Um—hum.</span> <span id="s843">Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: So, he had another fellow do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s846">So, now you land on Normandy Beach?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: Right.</span> <span id="s848">And that day, we ——</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: Do you know which beach it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: Omaha.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: It was Omaha.</span> <span id="s852">Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: There were still explosions on the beach taking place.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: Oh, my.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Mines.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Oh, my.</span> <span id="s857">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: And we drove up the hill that they had to take.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: Which they took in the first day.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: The rangers took that.</span> <span id="s863">We drove up the hill and stayed overnight up on top of the hill.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: And then we went to a place called Colombieres.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: Colombieres is on the road to Sainte—Mere—Eglise.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: Um—hum.</span> <span id="s869">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: Have you ever been there?</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: Have you ever heard of Colombieres?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: I don't think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: C—o—l—o—m—b—i—e—r—e (sic).</span> <span id="s875">That was where 1st Army headQ:uarters were.</span> <span id="s876">And we were at the Chateau De Colombieres, outside the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: Our company was at the chateau.</span> <span id="s879">Most of the men lived in the field around it, and the officers lived in the chateau.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: And it had a moat around.</span> <span id="s882">It was an old chateau.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: And I operated a radio there.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: I —— that time, I was with the transmitting section of the trailer.</span> <span id="s887">We had one transmitting —— one big trailer with a transmitter, one—kilowatt transmitter.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: Did you have any mixing with the civilians or any refugees at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: No.</span> <span id="s890">We didn't see any refugees.</span> <span id="s891">This was a French area.</span> <span id="s892">We saw French people.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s894">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: And we spoke to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: And some of the fellows would go out and take a water can, and buy —— they would buy calvados from the farmers.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: Do you know what calvados is?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s901">Yeah.</span> <span id="s902">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: But that stuff that they bought was liQ:uid fire.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: I can imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: It wasn't aged or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: I tried it once, and I spat it right out.</span> <span id="s908">I never touched it again.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: Well, we were there, maybe —— well, trying to think.</span> <span id="s911">Well, while we were there, I was grabbed to go to ammunition supplies going to 128.</span> <span id="s912">And I always used to wonder, what does 128 mean?</span> <span id="s913">And I finally figured it out.</span> <span id="s914">It was the ammunition supply point one of the 28th Infantry Division, which was in Normandy.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: And I was put in the —— they had me in a tent, to take care of the shells ——</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: —— that would be used for firing leaflets.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: Actually, they were shells with smoke canisters in them.</span> <span id="s921">They'd take out the smoke canister and put in a roll of leaflets.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: And I was right there in that —— they gave me a pyramidal tent to sleep in above the ground with a cot.</span> <span id="s924">And at night, the German planes would come over.</span> <span id="s925">We used to call them Bed Check Charlie.</span> <span id="s926">And I noticed, here I am, and if any bomb comes down close by, I'm right near the shells, I don't stand a chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s928">Right.</span> <span id="s929">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: So, I noticed where the headquarters of the camp were.</span> <span id="s931">That was in another field.</span> <span id="s932">And the men had dug slit trenches, about three, four feet deep, and they have empty ammunition cases across the slit trench, and they cover the ammunition cases with the earth that they had shoveled up as a protection.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: So, after a few days being in the —— in the pyramidal tent, and sometimes fellows were drunk going past and shooting like wild, I said, "Eh, I am going to go dig myself a slit trench."</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: Where the headquarters of the company is.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: That way, I'm not right next to the ammunition.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: And I was there maybe about a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: And then I went back to the company.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: And from there, where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: From there, when we broke out of Normandy —— the day before we broke out, the planes were coming over in droves, without stopping, dropping bombs at the Germans in the Saint—Lo area.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: And they broke through Saint—Lo.</span> <span id="s947">And I drove to Saint—Lo maybe the day after it was taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: And the fields were full of dead cows.</span> <span id="s950">Unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: And in Saint—Lo —— there was a church in Saint—Lo.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: Well—known church.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: And right in the field in front of the church was a dead German.</span> <span id="s957">See, when an American was killed, his body was immediately removed.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: The Germans, they waited 'til they got enough Germans to collect them.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: Prisoners.</span> <span id="s962">In fact, when I was at that field where I was next to the shells, at the end of the field, there was dead German bodies all over the place that hadn't been picked up.</span> <span id="s963">And at night, I learned what the stench, smell of death is.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: Oh, dear.</span> <span id="s965">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: It permeated my clothes.</span> <span id="s967">It was horrible.</span> <span id="s968">But I wouldn't go near them.</span> <span id="s969">I saw them, and I never went there again.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: Some fellows came with a truck from my company, and there were looking for loot.</span> <span id="s972">And they went to the bodies, and they picked up things, you know, food and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s973">And then they were sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s975">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: Stupid.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: But I was there.</span> <span id="s979">And then I went back to the company.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: And then from Saint—Lo, where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: Then we went, my section, were ordered in to a place beyond —— in Brittany.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: We drove past Rennes, which is the capital of Brittany, to a village called Thourie —— Thourie.</span> <span id="s984">And there there had been a tremendous radio station.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: 5,500—kilowatt station.</span> <span id="s987">And the building had been bombed by our planes.</span> <span id="s988">It was records.</span> <span id="s989">But still you could get up to the roof.</span> <span id="s990">And there were bombs all around.</span> <span id="s991">And what the Germans didn't do to damage the transmitter, they did before we got there.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: But we had two —— civilian engineers, Mr. Morry Peace (ph), of CBS, and Mr. Darcy (ph), of BBC.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: They were working on repairing it, the transmitter.</span> <span id="s996">I understand they did get it fixed after a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: But I was sent —— then I was taken off

<p><span id="s1063">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1064">So, moving along, where did you then go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: From then, I was at Verdun for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: And then I was assigned to another unit with a two—and—a—half—ton truck and that radio broadcasting doghouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: The BB radio operator of that.</span> <span id="s1070">And we were sent to —— oh, I had another experience before that.</span> <span id="s1071">I'll tell you.</span> <span id="s1072">One time, while I was at Verdun, they wanted to send some leaflets to the 1st Army unit at the Spa in Belgium.</span> <span id="s1073">And I was driving.</span> <span id="s1074">So I drove a three—Quarter—ton truck with leaflets.</span> <span id="s1075">And it was right close to the front.</span> <span id="s1076">And I drove up, and at one point, I skidded off the road.</span> <span id="s1077">I think above Longwy, before a lawn, and I just took —— I had a winch on the truck, and I just put it around the tree, a tree, and pulled myself out, and got out to the road, and continued.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: And I went past Bastogne.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: And as I came to the top of the hill, suddenly there was a mud slick on the load, and I spun around.</span> <span id="s1082">And my truck landed up against a tree, but, fortunately, the spare tire, spare wheel, was on the driver's side, and my truck was disabled, but I was all right, and I got someone to —— a truck driver to pull me into Bastogne, this is before the Battle of Bastogne.</span> <span id="s1083">And I went to a place, and I called up my company, and they came and got me in a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: But that was my experience there.</span> <span id="s1086">After that, I was sent to the 9th Army with Lieutenant Balthour (ph), Raymond Wilson, and Mike Arob (ph).</span> <span id="s1087">Mike Arob was the truck driver, the two—and—a—half—ton truck driver.</span> <span id="s1088">And ——</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: And where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: We went to —— to —— to Maastricht.</span> <span id="s1091">On the way Maastricht, it was uneventful until we got near Liege, maybe about 20 or so miles from Liege we saw light lighting up the entire sky.</span> <span id="s1092">We didn't know what it was.</span> <span id="s1093">We had heard what it was, but as we got to —— closer to Liege, which is a major crossroads in the city, we noticed something odd: Girls passing us wouldn't wave to us and wouldn't smile.</span> <span id="s1094">Well, we learned when we got to Liege what it was all about.</span> <span id="s1095">We got into Liege and suddenly buzz bombs, V—1s, were dropping all around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: Um—hum.</span> <span id="s1097">Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: And we were looking for a bridge to get across in the River Meuse in Belgium, and in France, it's called the River Meuse.</span> <span id="s1099">We finally found a bridge to get across, and we went up to Maastricht, and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: And at Maastricht, for a number of days, we lived in the building where the reporters lived and the sensors lived.</span> <span id="s1102">We slept in the halls, the enlisted men.</span> <span id="s1103">And then they sent us up to —— up to —— on top of a hill, in the village called Bamalyn (ph), top of the hill, there was a hotel, and I think the 4th Mobile Radio Broadcasting Company was there.</span> <span id="s1104">And we operated a transmitter.</span> <span id="s1105">The reporters would come up from ——</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: And, again, you didn't see any refugees yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: No, we didn't see any refugees, not there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: And then from there, where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: We didn't see refugees until we went into Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: Let's get to that then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: After crossing into Germany, we saw refugees all around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: I remember one city we were in, the last town we were in before we got to Die Alb, where we stopped, this place, people were breaking into stores, and the German people stopped us.</span> <span id="s1114">Police started to beat them up, and we stopped them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: We stopped them.</span> <span id="s1117">And that was about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: Did you talk to any of the refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s1120">Didn't have a chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: Um—hum.</span> <span id="s1122">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1123">And so, then, where were you in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A: In Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: At first —— well, we were near Die Alb for quite a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: Right, um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: And then we were ordered, my unit, the broadcasting unit, we were ordered to Bremen, and there we broadcast reporters from Bremen.</span> <span id="s1129">The war was over by then.</span> <span id="s1130">The war ended on May 8th.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: So, this is after May 8th?</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: And had you gone by any camps?</span> <span id="s1134">Had you gone past any camps when you were ——</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: Well, I had an opportunity to go to Bergen Belsen, and I didn't want to see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q: Because?</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">A: I didn't want to see the ugliness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1139">But you were, by that time, well aware of what had happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: I was well aware what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: To the Jews and others.</span> <span id="s1142">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1143">Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: And that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: Basically, until —— let me see —— oh, when I was in the —— something else.</span> <span id="s1147">When I was in Rennes, we had a fellow, another man working with us, a language man, Irving Barrinson (ph).</span> <span id="s1148">And he —— we went with him once to a Dr. Loucarlay (ph), in the village of Quintin, Q—u—i—n—t—i—n. Irving Barrinson had been a teacher in New York, French teacher, and before the war, he had studied at the Le Se (ph).</span> <span id="s1149">And he knew the son of this Dr. Loucarlay, and he wanted to visit him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: And we visited him, Dr. Loucarlay, we visited.</span> <span id="s1152">And Dr. Loucarlay's son had been taken by the Germans.</span> <span id="s1153">He didn't know what had happened to him exactly.</span> <span id="s1154">No one knew.</span> <span id="s1155">And we went —— and this trip, too, we were invited to a liberation banQ:uet for Brittany.</span> <span id="s1156">And it was the biggest meal I ever had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: What was your feeling when you heard the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: Oh, well, I knew it was over, ending as we moved across.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: But, emotionally, what were your thoughts?</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: I was very happy.</span> <span id="s1161">I was interviewed twice.</span> <span id="s1162">Once by Lieutenant Fuller —— I think he later became an officer in my company —— on a wire recorder, and the second time, after the war was ended, by Bill Downs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: Of CBS.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q:

No.</span> <span id="s1169">Because of the —— they wanted to interview me on the US, on the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: Nothing because I was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1173">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: And that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: So, then you stayed in Europe for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: I stayed in Europe —— well, after we were in Bremen maybe two or three weeks, and we were ordered to company to the headQ:uarter at Wiesbaden.</span> <span id="s1177">And then, at Wiesbaden, I did notice one thing that was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1178">I used to go —— to where I used to go to get a bath, a bath house, attached to a Jewish cemetery, the Jewish cemetery of Wiesbaden.</span> <span id="s1179">And there were signs in it forbidding anyone from entering it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: Um—hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: Put up by the Army.</span> <span id="s1182">But I didn't see any Jewish people there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: Um—hum.</span> <span id="s1184">Did you talk to any Jewish refugees at all while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: No, not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: Not really.</span> <span id="s1187">Okay.</span> <span id="s1188">And so then you came back to the United States when?</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: I came back to the United States in November.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: Of '45.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: Of '45.</span></p>

id="s1194">A: Well, I got a job teaching almost immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1196">And then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: And I also went back to school
