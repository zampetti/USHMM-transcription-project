interviewing Mary Rita Bergquist on the 15th of July, 1995.</span> <span id="s4">We’re in West Park, New York.</span> <span id="s5">Tell me your -- when and where you were born and what was your name?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Answer: I was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut in 1923.</span> <span id="s7">What else do you want to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Q: Your family name.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A: Oh, my family name was Hannan, H-a-n-n-a-n.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Q: Uh-huh, and tell me a little bit about your parents and you know, what it was like -- what -- you know, what your life was like in Bridgeport.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: Oh, my father owned a lumber yard in Bridgeport and my mother was just a housewife and we had five children.</span> <span id="s12">We owned our own home and went to school there until I graduated from high school and went in training.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: What year did you graduate from high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: This -- I -- I -- from -- 1940, then I went in training.</span> <span id="s15">I graduated in June and then I went in training in September in Saint Vincent’s in New York City.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: And why did you decide to go into nurse’s training?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: Well, my aunt was a nurse, she worked down Doctor’s Hospital in New York and she always liked it and she had been a nurse in the first World War and -- just figured that it was something I wanted to do.</span> <span id="s18">I enjoy helping -- working with people and --</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Had she told you stories about being a nurse --</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: She had, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: -- in the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: Yeah, yeah, she did.</span> <span id="s23">In fact, she married -- while she was in the war, she married a doctor and she had a really nice life and she traveled a great deal and she wou -- then, after she came out -- well, I guess she had -- after she was divorced, she worked as a -- in charge of the operating room at Doctor’s Hospital in New York and so I decided to go into Saint Vincent’s for training.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: And when did you get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: 1943.</span> <span id="s26">And I -- shortly after that -- well, most of the girls were going in the service and -- [inaudible] I went, I wanted -- my best friend was going into the army nurse corps, but I didn’t -- flight -- flight nurse.</span> <span id="s27">I didn’t particularly care for that, so I just went into the -- the army nurse corps.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Do you think most of the people in your -- that graduated from nurse’s training with you, went into the service, was that your impression?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: I think -- I think most of them did.</span> <span id="s30">Not -- not all, some of them were getting married, some of them were -- wanted to stay and work at -- you know, stateside, but I would say the majority of us went into the service, either the navy or the army nurse corps.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s32">It’s so -- did it s -- fe -- it felt like sort of the thing to do?</span> <span id="s33">A lot of people --</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: It did.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: Yeah, everybody was going there at the time.</span> <span id="s37">Well, I can remember working on one of the wa -- halls and they came and said when -- that the Japanese had attacked Pearl Harbor and we all thought that was such a shocking thing, that you know, they -- here these boys were taken so completely unawares and decided that this would be the type of the thing we would like to do, you know, go in and help take care of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: And -- and you enlisted then, in ‘43 did you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: ‘43.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Where at?</span> <span id="s43">Where did you go in?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: I was inducted in Fort Dix, New Jersey and then we went to Atlantic City for our basic training.</span> <span id="s45">I can’t remember where I went.</span> <span id="s46">I stayed at Fort Dix for quite awhile, until we got our or -- oh yes, I guess I stayed there until we got our orders to go with the 131st evacuation hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: And what was the basic training like?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Oh, I remember long marches along the streets in Atlantic City.</span> <span id="s49">It was a nice place to take your basic training.</span> <span id="s50">Climbing under fences and practicing with your gas masks and ex -- a lot of exercises and -- and the social life there in the evening was -- was good.</span> <span id="s51">We like the different -- like Glenn Miller was there.</span> <span id="s52">In fact we saw him the first -- the last time he played in the States and he flew from there to England and his plane was lost.</span> <span id="s53">But the basic training, you know, was very strenuous and concentrated.</span> <span id="s54">And right from there, I forget where I went then.</span> <span id="s55">I remember staying there for quite awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s57">And then you got orders to join the 131st?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: 131st, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: And -- and then what happened?</span> <span id="s60">Where did you go or what was the -- [indecipherable] the next major thing that you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: I remember getting on the ship, the Queen Elizabeth, that -- we were all surprised that we were going to go over on that.</span> <span id="s62">And that was a very hairy ride, with the mines and whatnot in the water that time.</span> <span id="s63">And we ended up in Greenock, Scotland.</span> <span id="s64">And that’s where -- I was saying downstairs -- excuse me -- the Salvation Army was there to greet us with coffee and donuts.</span> <span id="s65">And then we went on from there to Alteringham, England and we were living in a private home wh-when -- all I can remember it was freezing.</span> <span id="s66">They only heated the house with fireplace -- didn’t keep you very warm.</span> <span id="s67">But we rented bikes and we rode around the countryside and then we were as-assigned to a general hospital, I can’t remember the number of the general hospital and we worked there with the boys that were being brought back from Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: This was the winter of ‘45 -- ‘45, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: ‘45, right, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s70">I remember going to Christmas eve mass and it was so foggy, we had to hang onto one another walking down the street and you couldn’t see in front of you.</span> <span id="s71">And from there we got our orders to go -- to get the h-hospital -- to get -- we -- a lot of -- I guess some of the girls went to different hospitals, I’m not sure about that, though.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: In England, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: In England, yeah.</span> <span id="s74">General hospitals.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: But they -- but you were just taking care of GI’s -- American GI’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: GI’s, oh yeah, just American GI’s, yes.</span> <span id="s77">In fact I met a boy I knew from home, from Bridgeport.</span> <span id="s78">He -- I had him as a patient.</span> <span id="s79">He had been injured at Anzio.</span> <span id="s80">And -- fact I saw him several times after we got out of the service, exchanged experiences.</span> <span id="s81">And then we got -- the hospital unit got together again and we went over the chelver into Sudan, France, as I remember and we set up our tents and all named -- heh -- gave them all different names.</span> <span id="s82">I think I lived in Fools Rush In.</span> <span id="s83">And some -- Idiot’s Delight was one, or something.</span> <span id="s84">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: What was it like living in a tent?</span> <span id="s86">This was in the spring, now?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: This was in the spring, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: April?</span> <span id="s89">March, April?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: I guess.</span> <span id="s91">Must have been, cause I know we were in England in Christmastime and then -- yeah, it must have been early spring.</span> <span id="s92">It was fun.</span> <span id="s93">We had -- we slept on cots and we had air mattresses, and so it was fairly comfortable.</span> <span id="s94">The only thing was the showering and bathing and all, that was rather difficult, but then we started to get patients there to take care of, they were bringing some back from the front and we got our first experience there of actually being an evacuation hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: And how was that different from what you’d done before?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Oh, oh it was quite different, because you were all set up in tents, you know and it was -- well, you know, it -- it -- the -- the general hospital in -- in England, I think that must have been a regular hospital that they had taken over and they had all the facilities, whereas out in the field, you -- you know -- you didn’t -- you just had temporary, makeshift things, but it didn’t seem as though we were there too long.</span> <span id="s97">As I said, I can’t remember all this.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: How was it -- that was the first time you had -- were caring then, for --</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: For actual casualties that were coming in from the war front, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Well, it was very challenging.</span> <span id="s102">You could hear -- in fact, from where we were you could hear the bombs and hear shooting and stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Were you frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: Not -- not really.</span> <span id="s105">No, no.</span> <span id="s106">We knew we weren’t right up on the front line, we were far enough back, that -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Did you talk to the injured men?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Oh yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s109">Oh, yeah, I talked to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: What did they want to talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Most of them wanted to talk about their girls back home and how homesick they were and couldn’t wait til they got back and if they weren’t injured very much, they said, “Oh, this means I’ve got to go back into the war -- fighting again,” you know, and I -- but others that were being -- that’s -- if they were more seriously wounded, were shipped back to England and then they vess eventually they went home or were taken care of there.</span> <span id="s112">And I think it was there that we got word that one of our nurse’s husban -- it was at -- yes, it was at the Battle of the Bulge and her husband was lost and reported as either dead or a prisoner of war and then as we went along -- can’t remember where we were, Mike showed up.</span> <span id="s113">And that was exciting, you know, that he was actually a -- a prisoner, taken a prisoner and a colonel friend set them up in a house and they were able to be together there.</span> <span id="s114">Then we moved on -- oh, we had to get our Eisenhower jackets or something, so we all piled in the big truck and went into --</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: What were those?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: They were those short jackets that -- they named them after Eisenhower because I believe he wore them.</span> <span id="s117">And we didn’t have them to -- to go on further, so we drove into Belgium and oh, those people were just so happy to see the Americans, they were so friendly.</span> <span id="s118">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Why did you have to get those jackets?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: I don’t -- I guess it was accepted ca -- to wear in the battle areas, or something.</span> <span id="s121">I don’t remember, but I know we were told we had to go up there, so we got in big trucks and went along and were singing the army songs as we went up to pick them up.</span> <span id="s122">And then shortly after that we must have moved out and I --remember exactly where we went from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Wha -- When you were there -- this was in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: What -- What was your particular responsibility?</span> <span id="s126">What -- what was your job?</span> <span id="s127">Were you in a ward or an operating room, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: N-No, no, I was in a ward, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Caring --</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Dispensing medication and dressings and yeah [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: These were men who’d been operated on, some of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Some of them had been operated on, yeah, some of them had -- you know, a broken leg and some shrapnel wounds and -- helped to take care of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s134">And then you stayed there for awhile and then moved?</span> <span id="s135">You moved a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: We moved quite often and I can’t remember all the different places we moved.</span> <span id="s137">Can’t even remember where we -- I should have read my thing I have at home.</span> <span id="s138">I didn’t re -- expect to have to tell it.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: But you did -- you did move around?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: We moved around quite a bit, yeah and finally we got -- we went into Austria and that was just gorgeous.</span> <span id="s141">We lived in regular homes in Austria and they -- right through -- it was near vee -- it was near Linz, Austria.</span> <span id="s142">And it was across from ver -- Vienna and very often at night, the Russians would be shooting out the lights and shooting at the wires and the -- your electricity would go out.</span> <span id="s143">They had maids who came and they polished your shoes and did different things for you while you were there.</span> <span id="s144">These were, I guess, local Austrian girls.</span> <span id="s145">And then we had to go to -- the only thing I can remember is go -- they told us we were going to a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s146">And the one thing that I can remember most about that was for miles before we got there, was the smell -- the dead bodies rotting, oh.</span> <span id="s147">That was just -- it was hard to believe.</span> <span id="s148">And when we would get there, you just see the bodies all piled up, you know and then they eventually would dig trenches, they would just -- they couldn’t make coffins for them fast enough and dug -- put them in common graves.</span> <span id="s149">And we went in and they were -- most of those people that were not dead, that were s -- who they had -- most of them, they had practiced on.</span> <span id="s150">They practiced taking out an appendix or practiced removing an arm or a leg and these people needed to be nursed back, you know.</span> <span id="s151">And you al -- you couldn’t speak their language, but you could almost feel that they knew what you were saying and you -- course, sort of knew what they were saying, they were just so glad to see somebody come in.</span> <span id="s152">Their food was so terrible and most of them looked like skeletons.</span> <span id="s153">I have pictures of them.</span> <span id="s154">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: What was your work -- daily work there?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Mostly just taking care of these patients, a lot of them of course, they had had operations and they were left in -- had -- all infected and you had to take care of those and put clean dressings on and try it on some of them that -- help with the therapy, to help them to get walking.</span> <span id="s157">They were ba -- they put them -- like if they had taken a leg off or something, then they would be walking on crutches and you would be helping them with that, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: What was the place where you worked, and what was --</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: It was a tent.</span> <span id="s160">Most of these patients were all like in tents or shacks, if I remember.</span> <span id="s161">I’m not sure which -- what it was.</span> <span id="s162">It wasn’t -- it was nothing, you know, like -- it didn’t look like a hospital at all, excepting that there were rows of beds where the patients were in.</span> <span id="s163">A lot of them had casts on as I remember and they wanted you to sign it for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: So you didn’t set up your hospital -- tent hospital there, you worked in their --</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Well, I think our -- our men had gone ahead and I think they had set up some of this, because by the time we got there, they were -- the area where we were going to be working was set up.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s168">Cause they went on ahead of us, now that I think of it and I -- unless they -- I don’t think that they were -- had any type of hospital set up before they got in there, but -- but they might have, I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: So you worked with people?</span> <span id="s170">Others have told me that they never touched patients or they were not supposed to touch patients, but it sounds like you were changing dressings and --</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Oh yes, you were changing dressings and helping them to wa -- and then you’d take them outside and have them walk and get out in the fresh air, cause most of them hadn’t seen daylight or sunlight and all they gave them was bread and water and -- to eat.</span> <span id="s172">And I loved the bread, it was that dark bread that they get overseas.</span> <span id="s173">But I mean, not -- not any nourishing food, they hadn’t had.</span> <span id="s174">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Were they men or women or both, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: They were both.</span> <span id="s177">They were both, but mostly men.</span> <span id="s178">The majority I -- as I recall, were men.</span> <span id="s179">But they -- there were some women there, too, yeah.</span> <span id="s180">I didn’t see any children.</span> <span id="s181">There might have been, but I don’t remember seeing them.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Did you -- do you remember caring for women as well as men?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: No, I don’t.</span> <span id="s184">I don’t remember having women patients.</span> <span id="s185">I remember just having male patients, as -- now that I think about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: And do you know -- d-did you know then who they were or where they were from, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: No.</span> <span id="s188">You knew where -- they -- they would tell you where they were from, yes, they would tell you where they were from, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Did you know at that time whether or not they were Jewish people or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: No, I didn’t, no.</span> <span id="s191">Some of them would -- you knew -- they said they were, but most of them you would just t-try to get out from where they came from.</span> <span id="s192">A lot of them seemed to be -- come from Poland and -- it was hard to understand them, but you -- yo-you know, you tried to decipher as much as you could.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s194">Did they try and express to you anything at all -- some of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: They tried constantly to express their gratitude, you know, for what we were doing for them, they -- and hope that they would get that -- w -- you know, well and be able to go back home again, if there was any home to go to, [indecipherable] often said that.</span> <span id="s196">They didn’t know what the conditions were going to be like back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Were you able to do much for them over the period of time you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: I think that they -- a lot of them I -- we thought -- felt were improving and were putting weight back on and -- especially I can remember one young man on crutches and then he seemed to be able to wa -- go to a cane and could walk with a cane and did get help.</span> <span id="s199">Course a lot of -- I guess they just kept them in a bed, or in -- I don’t know where they kept them and -- so that they didn’t get up and were able to really move around until we had gotten in there, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Do you have any i-idea of what else was going on there while you were there?</span> <span id="s201">I mean, was there continuing to bury bodies while you were there?</span> <span id="s202">That was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Well, we s -- oh yes, they were continually burying the bodies, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s204">They -- a lot of them died while we were there, too, but they also were burying the bodies that were piled up when we got there.</span> <span id="s205">And when they could then eventually they had a cemetery and they would put, you know, little markers on each one.</span> <span id="s206">But at first it was just a communal grave where they had to put the bodies.</span> <span id="s207">And there was the crematorium that they used to burn them and gas them.</span> <span id="s208">They had that and they burned that down while we were there to prevent the spread of disease, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: You saw that?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Mm-hm, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: What did you think when you saw that, did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s213">And what upset me the most was you would see these reels from home and people said, “That’s not true, that’s all propaganda.”</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: What do you mean reels?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: They said they were army -- my parents would write, you know, they were army reels and that would say that it was all propaganda, that these things didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s216">In the movie theaters, apparently [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Oh, newsreels?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Newsreels, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s219">They must have shown them and I said, “Well then, let them come over here and see it.”</span> <span id="s220">And because, it -- even today you’ll hear people say that they don’t believe it existed and it certainly did.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: When you were seeing that, did you have any sense of -- of how widespread it was in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: No, we really didn’t at that time, no, til we then heard about so many of the other concentration camps and all.</span> <span id="s227">They were much bigger than camp Gusen.</span> <span id="s228">I guess Mauthausen and some of them were much larger and had a lot more, you know, prisoners than we did, but at that time we had no idea of that, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Were -- did you have any sense of how the people in the town were reacting to this?</span> <span id="s230">Did you have any contact with people in the -- in -- in Linz?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Not really, not really, no.</span> <span id="s232">Just the girl -- th -- some of the women that would work -- work at the camp that were -- you know, lived in the village, but they didn’t say very much, and -- of course there was a language barrier.</span> <span id="s233">Couldn’t really understand them all.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Do you remember people coming to Gusen from the town to -- to do work or --</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: I don’t remember -- not at the -- no, not with the patients they weren’t, no.</span> <span id="s236">Not that I remember.</span> <span id="s237">They could have, but I really don’t remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Did you have any other s -- did you have any sense of -- of what kinds of things the people were doing and when they were inmates there?</span> <span id="s239">Were they --</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Don’t think --</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: -- do you know about the -- I mean, for example, I know there was a quarry nearby where people had to carry stones.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Yes, yes, I do remember hearing --</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Did you see that, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: I don’t remember seeing that, but I do remember hearing about it, yeah.</span> <span id="s245">They had -- they -- they di -- I know they were tru -- cruelly mistreated because they also had a -- the commandant hung in effigy.</span> <span id="s246">I guess the prisoners that were there and they finally had gotten home, I have a picture of him hanging there and was something else I had -- just [indecipherable] skipped my mind.</span> <span id="s247">Oh, taking their skin and making lampshades out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: You heard about that or you saw that?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Oh yeah -- no, I heard about that, but I did see one of the lampshades and they said it was made from the skin of the patients that were there.</span> <span id="s250">This was the commandant -- commandant’s wife or somebody made -- was supposed to have made these.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Where did you see that lampshade?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: There, there.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Were all of the -- all of the survivors who were there ill or were s-some people able to go around and --</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Some of them were able to go around and do some of the -- the work, you know, cleaning up and yeah, they weren’t a -- they were functional, yeah, they weren’t all, you know, like bedridden people or that had things wrong with them, no.</span> <span id="s257">That -- wa -- that’s where we were supposed to, you know, do most of our -- was with the sick ones, but there were others walking around and -- all looked like skeletons, though.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: How long were you there at Gusen, roughly?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Seems like we were there about three months or so, but I’m not -- I really can’t remember.</span> <span id="s260">I have all those things written down at home [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: And then after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: From there, can’t remember where we went.</span> <span id="s263">We went to a camp, but I can’t remember where -- cause I remember being there on VE Day and celebrating --</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: VE Day?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: -- the victory.</span> <span id="s266">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: VE Day before you went to Gusen.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Well, that was before, that’s right, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s271">No, that’s right, yes, yes [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Other people have mentioned a camp called -- it’s named after a cigarette -- in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: 20 grand?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: 20 grand, yes, yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Is that the one you’re thinking of?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: 20 grand, yes, that’s what I’m thinking of.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: In France?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: In France, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: And you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: And from there we learned we were going home -- to go to the Pacific.</span> <span id="s281">And some of them that were -- we were -- there were several ho-hospitals there and a lot of them were going directly to the Pacific, but we were supposed to go home -- wi -- go home on leave and we went home on the General Bliss as I remember and were home on leave when they dropped the bomb on Hiroshima.</span> <span id="s282">And then I was shipped out to -- where was it, it was where they have the racetress -- racetracks out -- hm, we used to go to the races once in a while, that -- Bonnie -- did you interview Bonnie?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Not yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s285">She and I were roommates there.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: It wasn’t Texas, was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: No, it wasn’t Texas.</span> <span id="s288">Gee, I know it as well as I know my own name, but my memory’s getting very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: But you didn’t go -- at any rate, you didn’t go --</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: We did not go to the Pacific and then was discharged from there.</span> <span id="s291">And I got on an army plane and flew out to California to visit my sister and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: So you were in for what, about a year?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: N -- About 18 months I’d say, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s295">And I wanted to go back and ask you what you thought when the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: I was very, very happy to think that it would save so many lives instead of, you know, continuing this horrible war and I wasn’t anxious to go to the Pacific myself, being selfish, but I was so glad for the boys that didn’t have to, you know, lose their lives fighting over there.</span> <span id="s297">Yeah, I know I thought that it was a very, very wise decision at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: When you look back now, 50 years later on that year, and especially on that experience you had, witnessing what had happened at the concentration camp, what does it mean to you?</span> <span id="s301">What -- how -- how has is affected you?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: Well, it was an experience that I would never have wanted to miss.</span> <span id="s303">I felt that, you know, we did a lot of good and got a lot out of it my-myself, I enjoyed it and I’d do it again if -- if the opportunity had come, you know, if I was to go into the service.</span> <span id="s304">Not now, but, you know -- but I really thought it was a very rewarding experience.</span> <span id="s305">Patients were all so very happy you know, were glad to see you and you felt that -- as I said, you felt you were doing something.</span> <span id="s306">I felt I was doing more there than I would have been if I went to work in a -- a hospital or -- here in the States or, you know, into one of the -- couple of my friends went into the -- like Sikorsky’s and different places, worked as industrial nurses, but I thought being an army nurse was the best.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: And th-the experience you had, especially at Gusen, how do you think of that, how does -- what -- what did you learn from that?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: Well, I -- hopefully I learned that -- that this would never, ever happen again.</span> <span id="s309">And I have often -- I’ve spoken to some groups and -- to let them know that it really did happen and I had sent the pictures to school and my children, you know, have brought it up when they’ve been in school and studied it.</span> <span id="s310">And gone into school occasionally and talked to some of the classes, because so many of the people still felt that it was -- it was just a lie, that it never had o -- had occurred and so I felt it was important to let them know that it did.</span> <span id="s311">And racial discrimination and whatnot certainly shouldn’t be a part of our lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Learned that.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: What else?</span> <span id="s315">I -- I -- I know we just kind of did a brief review, but what did -- is there anything you’d like to say, or any particular memory that you want to --</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s317">As I said, a lot of it I just can’t even remember any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: It seems -- it’s so interesting to me that 50 years later, this group of women is still in touch with each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: Yeah, yeah, we have kept up.</span> <span id="s320">We have a round robin and then we’ve gotten together, you know, for reunions, but -- well, in my training school is the same thing, we -- we’ve gotten -- every five years we go to New York City and get together and have a reunion.</span> <span id="s321">It’s nice to keep -- we have so much in common.</span> <span id="s322">I think this is, you know, what keeps -- keeps us coming and getting together.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: You ha -- is it just what you did then that you have in common?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: No, I think living for that length of time together and living under not very good conditions, you know, you just sort of got much closer to the girls than you normally would, you know, if you were in the every day world.</span> <span id="s325">You slept together, you wash together, you eat together and you were -- had a common purpose.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s327">Good, good.</span> <span id="s328">Well, thank you.</span> <span id="s329">Let me -- I have to say that this is the end of the interview with Mary Rita Bergquist, July 15th, 1995.</span> <span id="s330">This is Nina Ellis.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">End of Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
