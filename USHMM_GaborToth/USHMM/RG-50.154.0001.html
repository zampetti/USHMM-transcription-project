Alice Adler in Sarasota, Florida.</span> <span id="s4">Today is April 11th, 1986.</span> <span id="s5">Mrs. Adler has kindly agreed to be interviewed and to talk with us about her experiences in the Holocaust but before we get to that point I would like it very much Mrs. Adler if you would tell us something about your early childhood so we have a picture of you as an entire person not just during those terrible years.</span> <span id="s6">Do you just want to tell if you had brothers and sisters, what your parents did for a living and describe a little bit of your early life.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">A: I was born in Budapest, Hungary.</span> <span id="s8">My parents were born in Austria and my upbringing was practically bi-lingual because disciplined I was in German and school was in Hungarian.</span> <span id="s9">I had two brothers who were both designers, the same way as my parents were.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Q: Designers of what?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: Designers of women’s wear and my parents founded a very prestigious women’s wear establishment in 1906 and it was one of the finest in the city.</span> <span id="s12">We got a marvelous education.</span> <span id="s13">My parents were very very adamant about studies in languages, in art, in music which later came in very very handy in different ways.</span> <span id="s14">We were planning to leave the country first when Hitler over-ran Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Did you have – how much formal education did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: In Hungary you have four elementary schools which is like high school and I had four years of art school.</span> <span id="s17">Partly in Hungary and partly in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Did you have much religious training?</span> <span id="s19">Was religion practiced in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: In our home religion was very important foundation.</span> <span id="s21">My father was very religious.</span> <span id="s22">He was, we had Shabbos, we observed the candle lighting ceremonies.</span> <span id="s23">We observed all the High Holidays but what is more important we lived a Jewish life, we identified with a city, with a country being an Austrian-Hungarian monarchy, part of it.</span> <span id="s24">It was, it had a deeply rooted anti-Semitism so from our earliest age in school we had encountered [it].</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Can you describe - because it is hard for people in this country to comprehend – can you describe an anti-Semitic experience that you recall from your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: As a young child I remember my two brothers coming home their heads bleeding, thoroughly shaken up.</span> <span id="s27">That was the day that they both went enrolled to the university which had a so-called numerous Klaus which means that a certain amount of Jews are only allowed.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: A quota system?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Like a quota system and [blank space], I mean they were fighting, they were expelling the Jewish students, they couldn’t even register so when they came home my father said I don’t want to endanger your life, you’re going to learn a trade where you will not be segregated and that’s what happen.</span> <span id="s30">Both of them became designers.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: And what about you?</span> <span id="s32">Did you have some similar experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: My earliest experience was one day when I run home from school and never wanted to go back because the children tore my clothes and my hair and they kept saying you’re a dirty Jew, you’re a dirty Jew and I came home and I was hysterical and I asked my mother why do they say this to me and she said show me your hand.</span> <span id="s34">You see how dirty you are, go wash your hands and face and just forget about it because that’s all they meant but I could not forget about it.</span> <span id="s35">I have had a deep resentment to be singled out.</span> <span id="s36">There were very few Jewish children in the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: And that wasn’t a very satisfactory explanation was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: At that time I was about 8 years old and to a small child a mother just can’t explain the bigotry of the country.</span> <span id="s39">She just wanted to make it very insignificant.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: I would imagine then under those circumstances you would have selected your friends and acquaintances only among Jewish people to avoid this kind of bigotry?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: I was very selective, strangely enough not whether it’s a Jewish person or non-Jewish person but whether they met the standard I set for myself and exchanged the same likes and dislikes and excitement for the beautiful things we believed in and I had quite a number of non-Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s42">I had quite a number of non-Jewish friends, I almost felt that I am spreading the impression of this is how we are, you see you must get to know us, you must get to learn.</span> <span id="s43">I instinctively tried to build a bridge.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Feeling is they got to know you they would understand you were like themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: We are people and I thought it would be better to react to animosity with civilize way and I succeeded.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: That’s wonderful.</span> <span id="s47">When Hitler came into power in Germany, what was the reaction of your family or yourself or people that you knew in terms of your own lives?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Naturally we thought it was a tremendous tragedy even though it was far away you could feel instinctively that our lives were going to be affected and it will never be the same.</span> <span id="s49">Life is never going to be the same.</span> <span id="s50">But really it hit us hard when my mother and father’s families in 1938 after the Anchluss in Austria started to be deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Please explain Anchluss because a lot of people are not familiar with that term.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: In 1938 the Austria government was overthrown by Hitler.</span> <span id="s53">The troops marched in and little by little they overtook the entire country with great jubilation by the Austrians.</span> <span id="s54">It was a country where anti-Semitism was running rampant already under Franz Joseph and all the other Hapsburgs emperors.</span> <span id="s55">When our uncles and aunts and cousins started to disappear on my mother and father’s side, that’s when it really hit home and we started to talk about how we could leave and make a new life in America.</span> <span id="s56">It was just talk because it was a tremendous decision; it’s like planning your own execution.</span> <span id="s57">You are finishing your life and it’s up to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: It sounds like other than the anti-Semitism, you had a rather secure, financially secure life.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: We had a very secure life under circumstances by you really never knew when new laws are going to be coming in effect to appease the German government because we were one of the Axis countries and therefore it was that we were never really secure.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: How old were you at that time of the Anchluss?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: At the Anchluss, I was 28 years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Were you married at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: I was married and had a very successful business and right after the Anchluss.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: How long had you been married?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: I was married three years and Jewish young men were rounded up and sent with the Hungarian government’s consent, sent to German borders where they have to pick land mines before the German troops were marching in to a certain area and of course from about 25 to 30,000 young men only 2 or 3,000 came back.</span> <span id="s66">One of them was my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: He returned from this experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: He returned.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: That would be almost like a miracle?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: It was almost like a miracle.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Did you have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: We had no children which I was very very happy about.</span> <span id="s73">It sounds strange but would I have, going ahead of my story, would I have had a child I wouldn’t be alive today.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: I have had other people say exactly the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: How can you separate yourself.</span> <span id="s76">Facing danger is one thing but to separate yourself from loved ones which was a favorite pastime for the Germans.</span> <span id="s77">When you would show any kind of attachment to a person that would be the first one to be separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Okay, so when did your-, you said you talked about leaving and coming to the United States?</span> <span id="s79">What happened after that?</span> <span id="s80">Did you just talk?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A; After, after we have faced this possibility of getting out of the country, we have talked with many other Jewish families who have traced relatives in America and by sheer coincidence some people with whom we were connected in business had relatives in Bronx, New York State, one of the boroughs of New York City who lived in the Bronx and would sponsor people.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: In those days you had to have a guarantee?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: You have to have a guarantee and that made it very difficult.</span> <span id="s84">Because people didn’t have $15,000 just to take out of the bank and give to a person which was very justified by it just couldn’t be done.</span> <span id="s85">We got two sponsors.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: People who you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: People who knew the people we knew in business.</span> <span id="s88">They vouched for us that we are trustworthy and decent hardworking people.</span> <span id="s89">And it was very important when you get here that you should not be a burden to the government.</span> <span id="s90">Because of that he got a passport and we had some connections through a company which run boats once every week from the harbor, it was an American outfit.</span> <span id="s91">And the captain could get us across if we bought a ticket.</span> <span id="s92">Which we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: For who?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: For my mother and my brother and myself.</span> <span id="s95">I had a younger brother who came out to America in 1939 in March to the World’s Fair.</span> <span id="s96">He was a fur designer and he had a very special article which they were very much interested in.</span> <span id="s97">At the time that we planned he was just on a business trip.</span> <span id="s98">Friends in America advised him to try to be able to stay because it looked very bad in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">With our passports and our tickets mother, my older brother and I arrived in Paris leaving Budapest with a, we arrived in Paris like we were going to an ordinary business trip.</span> <span id="s100">We used to do that twice a year.</span> <span id="s101">We did not want to burn up the bridges because we were not really sure whether our undertaking would be successful.</span> <span id="s102">And we were right in anticipating the problems because in the beginning of August a young attorney, a French woman whom we had consulted said it looks very bad, it looks like there is a concentration of German troops on the Polish [border?]</span> <span id="s103">and American authorities have already notified people who lived in Paris that they should be careful with their plans and she advised us to make sure that our reservations were valid otherwise it could be difficult if war should break out to get away.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: And your father was still there and your husband was still there?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: My father died when I was 18 years old and I must say that fortunately he was not buried in a marked grave.</span> <span id="s106">I was privileged to go every Yarzheit and pray by his grave until I was in Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: And your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: My husband was in Hungary and he was quite ill after coming back from his experience with the Germans and he was really just taking care of his health looking out for investments.</span> <span id="s109">It looked like I have to change my ticket and my mother’s ticket because our most important concern was that she should get away because an older person and after we secured her passage my brother left and I would be the third one to leave but my boat ticket was for the Bremen and it was a German boat anchored in the harbor and that very morning when I was suppose to board the ship there was radio news interrupting the regular program was the Germans had won the Polish border and the Second Work War had begun so anybody with visitors visas could not sail as the boat was confiscated by the French government.</span> <span id="s110">There was no guarantee how people with a visitor’s visa could come back after six months, it was only valid for six months.</span> <span id="s111">And therefore the Americans have made it clear that people holding visitor’s visas could not enter America.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Even though these people in the Bronx had guaranteed that you would not be a burden?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: It made no difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: You said that part of the reason you did not burn your bridges behind you was because you were not sure that your plan would work.</span> <span id="s115">Also if you had liquidated your business and made it clear that you were going to leave the country permanently, do you thing that you would have been allowed to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: You could sell property at that time yes, and you could have somebody whom you trusted to tell, you handle my possession I am going and be a confidant but there was nobody, you could not trust even your oldest employee and people whom you have been dealing with because you were a Jew and maybe they had been nice to you in spite of the fact and maybe they would have felt that eventually they would own everything you have owned and worked for.</span> <span id="s117">You just couldn’t do it, and our instinct dictated to and see what you can do which was the right decision.</span> <span id="s118">Although my mother who was 18 days on the high seas, the boat was torpedoed several times, she finally arrived in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: With your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: With my brother.</span> <span id="s121">It was very interesting that until Hungary officially didn’t declare war against the Americans until 1942 after Pearl Harbor, we could write to each other but I’m getting ahead of my story.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Well, I interrupted you.</span> <span id="s123">You go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s125">The war broke out and there was no way for me to leave and I wanted</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: You went back to Budapest?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Right.</span> <span id="s128">I wanted to go back but the French authorities did not allow you to pass the border unless you have a ticket paid up all the way to Hungary.</span> <span id="s129">The ticket office would not sell you a ticket unless you had a visa so this meant you are allowed to leave, they didn’t call it a crime in France, the authorities allowed you to leave.</span> <span id="s130">It took me four endless months before the traffic police issued an exit visa for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">During these four months I have sold all my clothing, I have sold my wedding band, I was getting support from the attorney who we knew bought my ticket.</span> <span id="s132">I finally finally in a total blackout.</span> <span id="s133">I left Paris the city of light which I will never forget as long as I live.</span> <span id="s134">I arrived on the Italian border, everything was lit up in contrast to the total darkness that we left in France.</span> <span id="s135">It was really a magnificent experience, people total strangers on a platform holding up steaming spaghetti and food and drink to the people who arrived from France and we had to have a very brief passport check and visa check.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Even though Italy was a fascist country, it was still?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Yes, yes, but it was not not officially declared war.</span> <span id="s138">I arrived back to Budapest and although I felt it was a very wise decision to have left everything intact as much as we could I was shattered by being separated from my family.</span> <span id="s139">At the same time by the time I got back, my first husband was again in the army, he had to join even through he was not totally well, they found jobs, menial job for Jewish young men to do.</span> <span id="s140">I was totally alone facing the situation from 1940 to 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: What happened during those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: During those years I conducted my business and I conducted my mother’s and brothers’ business and eventually sold it.</span> <span id="s143">My business was a very successful fashion boutique and in spite of the fact everybody knew about being Jewish or what have you, I had many German customers because I speak fluent German and it seems that they liked what I was doing and it was not so horrible to support my shop.</span> <span id="s144">When the day came that you have to wear the yellow star that’s when it started to be very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: I can tell you the date exactly because it’s indelible in my mind.</span> <span id="s147">It was 1944, March 18, suddenly German tanks appeared in front of the Parliament which was a big plaza and tanks were all over the city and people who we thought were our friends suddenly had swastikas on their arms and came into stores and distributed the yellow stars and told you what restrictions you had.</span> <span id="s148">The third day after this taking over of Budapest I got a notification from the Gestapo and without a further hearing, without ever allowing me to look back or take any of my possessions, just the way I was dressed, huh, I had to follow this man.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Who came to your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Who came to my home very early in the morning.</span> <span id="s151">They had a habit of getting there when it shakes you up enough.</span> <span id="s152">I was interned two days in a Rabbinate.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: What’s a Rabbinate?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: A Rabbinate is a school, a religious school attached to the Temple and where they conduct education for children.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: A religious school?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s157">Two days later we were put into vans and driven out to the edge of the city and we saw maybe 15 or 20 freight cars.</span> <span id="s158">We were put into the cars and the train started.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: How many hundreds or thousands of people were involved at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Frankly, I would not be able to tell you because when you see a disaster like this you don’t really rationalize what is going around you, you just summon all your power, will power to hold on.</span> <span id="s161">An enormous amount of people, like a whole city was emptied out.</span> <span id="s162">The freight cars which would be probably for 35 or 40 animals got packed solid with maybe over a hundred people some of them only could stand or they changed standing or sitting on the ground and a very, very agonizing long trip which must have lasted for days and days and days.</span> <span id="s163">We already knew when we arrived that it was Auschwitz of course.</span> <span id="s164">We knew that once entering the freight train.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: There was no way out?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: No windows.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: What did you do in terms of food, in terms of water, in terms of sanitation?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: There was no water, no sanitation, no food.</span> <span id="s169">By the time they opened those freight cars, there were more dead than alive.</span> <span id="s170">The stench and the screaming and the yelling in the morning is something that when I’m alone and think about it, I just have to feel that it was “bashert” [destined] for me to live.</span> <span id="s171">It was to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: But you managed?</span> <span id="s173">Then what, when you got</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: When we got, when we got, when the doors were opened and we were falling out and pushed out and shoved out and beaten with sticks and whips and had to stand up whoever could stand up.</span> <span id="s175">There was a great big line of people watching us coming in, who probable just came back from some kind of work.</span> <span id="s176">And later on did we know when they were screaming EAT, EAT, EAT what they really meant no matter how bad it was what they gave you it would mean life but it didn’t mean anything then.</span> <span id="s177">That was the time at the arrival when they separated</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: The selection process?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: By the grace of God I was alone.</span> <span id="s180">After the arrival there were no barracks to house us because they were totally filled.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: What time of year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: That was 1944 end of April, the beginning of May.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: In the spring?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: In the spring.</span> <span id="s185">Cold nights, very cold nights and excruciating hot sun during the day.</span> <span id="s186">We were actually there, planted on that lawn for ten days or that’s what they said, it might have been ten days outdoors with one sheet of clothing which they threw to us.</span> <span id="s187">Day and night for maybe two days not even water.</span> <span id="s188">Mind you we had no food or water on the train.</span> <span id="s189">Many people were totally dehydrated and died.</span> <span id="s190">Standing in the sun, being soaked by the rain, drying up, day and night, day and night.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Finally one barrack opened up which was the C Lager.</span> <span id="s192">Lager means a concentration of many barracks.</span> <span id="s193">Each and every barrack, concentration of barracks had a special importance.</span> <span id="s194">Those in C were for extermination.</span> <span id="s195">Those who were in D, we found all of this out later, were prepared to be shipped out eventually for forced labor.</span> <span id="s196">Arriving in C, Barrack C, we have gotten doused.</span> <span id="s197">Where we had no way of, where we have no way of any hygiene except we were told where the outhouses were, about 65 or 70 holes in planks of wood in a big barracks guarded by Germans watching us going and taking care of our biological needs which was one of the most humiliating and degrading experiences but of course that was just one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">The Germans had a very peculiar sadistic way of eating into your pride, into your dignity step by step by step.</span> <span id="s199">You thought this is it, they can’t do any worse, what else can they possibly do to destroy me but every day brought something else.</span> <span id="s200">And you felt, I can’t take it, I just have to think back to how much more I had to take.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: What did you do there?</span> <span id="s202">Did they put you to, first of all you said you were in an extermination barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: That was the extermination barracks.</span> <span id="s204">About two or three weeks later, I happened to be fortunate to meet Dr. Mengele who was overlooking this last transfer where I belonged if there is anyone strong enough to be sent out.</span> <span id="s205">That was the so-called selection where I was standing naked with many hundred others raising my left arm.</span> <span id="s206">We had to raise our left arm because that was showing whether our ribs showed under the skin.</span> <span id="s207">If we were too thin there was no point in sending us out and giving us a piece of bread and taking us to forced labor because we could not stand it.</span> <span id="s208">I was selected and in about two more weeks I was sent with many others this time already with a dress and a coat and shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: During the selection you were naked?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Yes, we have just one sheet of clothes which was thrown at us and we have to put it on and whatever shoes you could find because shoes were very important if you have an infection on your foot, you’re going to the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: And all the other people who were in this barracks were exterminated?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Several of them came from that trip I was on.</span> <span id="s213">We were sent out to Sudenten Deutschland which was occupied Czechoslovakia by the Germans.</span> <span id="s214">It was a very highly industrial area with many factories still working full steam producing aviation parts.</span> <span id="s215">I was sent to [blank space] which was in the high mountains in the Alps totally secluded although later on we found out that the American Air Force knew exactly which factory had forced labor because we were never bombed.</span> <span id="s216">Everything around us was bombed and fires were raging and our factory never got a hit.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: And you feel they did that selectively to preserve your lives?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Later on we found out after the liberation that they had a complete intelligence network of everything which was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Were the conditions there any better?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: The conditions were equally bad because we got one piece of bread and some brown liquid which we couldn’t identify what it was.</span> <span id="s221">That was out total intake for 16 hours a day of work.</span> <span id="s222">After the 16 hours we have to walk to our living quarters and walk back in the morning at the crack of dawn.</span> <span id="s223">Standing, I made a mistake because they were selecting machines to work on according to your background, studies, etc. and they gave me five machines to work on, an excruciating job because the machines were running horizontally back and forth and sort of had a very hypnotic effect on you especially not being fed very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">It was crucial to produce a certain amount of pieces which we had to do.</span> <span id="s225">If you didn’t you sabotaged everything.</span> <span id="s226">If they counted not enough pieces in your output, they sent you back to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s227">I was there until 1945, March the 14th.</span> <span id="s228">At that date some French prisoners who worked in the camp too in this labor camp and sort of walked around freely because they had been prisoners since 1939 working with the Germans, have let us know that the Allied forces are nearing and it is not too much long that we are going to be liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Did you believe them?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: I believed them because one bright day around 12 o’clock noon instead of giving us our daily ration, we were assembled in a courtyard, that never happened before during the day.</span> <span id="s231">We were always assembled after working.</span> <span id="s232">We were counted and re-counted and had to march to a railroad station where they took us into freight cars again.</span> <span id="s233">The previous day in the washroom I bumped into a German auxiliary who was a supervisor of work and in a very typically Viennese accent she said to me you are going tomorrow to Nuremberg where there are still several crematoriums working and with that she left.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: What a terrifying thing to hear?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: There were hundreds of soldiers, little 14, 15 year old kids with machine guns and police dogs guarding this railroad station.</span> <span id="s236">And in spite of all this I had a sudden impulse that I am going to survive and I just can’t tell you how thick with suspense it is.</span> <span id="s237">My dead father prayed for me which I prayed with him all along.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Did you still have some faith in God?</span> <span id="s239">After all this?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s241">Because of that I’m here.</span> <span id="s242">I feel that a very, very strong guiding force whatever you want to call it was there.</span> <span id="s243">I jumped out of the train which went to the crematories.</span> <span id="s244">Half an hour after the departure, the train was going very slowly up a hill and I looked around in the freight car and there was a small opening.</span> <span id="s245">I climbed up on a chair, today I don’t believe I did it.</span> <span id="s246">I put my head out and I pushed myself out of that opening.</span> <span id="s247">This vent was probably meant for fresh air for the animals but before I knew it I was falling out on the embankment and I saw the tail lights of the train go.</span> <span id="s248">There wasn’t a shock, there was nothing.</span> <span id="s249">I was there by myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: This was in the daytime?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: That was at night.</span> <span id="s252">We were assembled at noon and by the time they counted and re-counted and put us up into the trains, it was getting dark.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: And here you had just fallen out of the train in the countryside all by yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: All by myself not really knowing what am I to do now.</span> <span id="s255">Is this freedom, is this something now you are on your own, it’s your decision because I almost forgot what it is to make a decision.</span> <span id="s256">I was just a link and little by little first I prayed.</span> <span id="s257">I remember very distinctly first I prayed and I wasn’t afraid at all.</span> <span id="s258">I started to get up and examined by body thinking rashly did I break anything.</span> <span id="s259">Am I all right?</span> <span id="s260">And I tried to walk.</span> <span id="s261">The next feeling was that maybe, maybe I have to walk back where I came, where they assembled us and my instinct was right because those French prisoners who saw the train going out had a convoy.</span> <span id="s262">They were combing the neighborhood morning, noon and night looking for maybe they would find a survivor.</span> <span id="s263">And…</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: To what purpose were they looking for survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: they had no other purpose but to save them.</span> <span id="s266">They were in a similar situation as we were but they have been very, very important to the factory.</span> <span id="s267">They worked there, they were all engineers.</span> <span id="s268">They had been taken in 1939 when the Germans overrun the Maginot line so they used them.</span> <span id="s269">Now I was liberated, now I was taken care of by the French prisoners who took me back to their commando.</span> <span id="s270">They had an underground commando; they had a free radio Europe station.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">I was told later that I collapsed; I didn’t come to for several hours because at that point I could let myself go.</span> <span id="s272">They were wonderful.</span> <span id="s273">They were caring for me.</span> <span id="s274">They tried to feed me which was very unsuccessful because I simply couldn’t eat.</span> <span id="s275">I forgot how and they told me about the advancement of the Eisenhower forces.</span> <span id="s276">There was a time the Allies could not decide which part of Germany they would occupy, the British, the French, the Russians and I only knew that since Hungary was now occupied by Russia I didn’t want to go back.</span> <span id="s277">All I wanted to go was to America.</span> <span id="s278">In fact I many times said when I was still in Auschwitz I know I’m not going to die, I’m going to America because I was so sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: You really had a strong sense of your own survival and your own destiny.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: Here I was now with the French prisoners.</span> <span id="s281">They all had documents, I had nothing.</span> <span id="s282">I was 70 pounds and I was a very sick girl and they said to me we are leaving as soon as it is possible to join the American occupied territories because we are going to be repatriated as we go back to France.</span> <span id="s283">If we wait until the Russians come into the Eastern European part it would be ages before they are allowed to get back.</span> <span id="s284">If you want us to we can take you with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Were there other people in the camps besides Jews, other nationalities, other religions?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s287">I have a Catholic girlfriend, Rose, who was at gunpoint questioned on the whereabouts of the presence of money.</span> <span id="s288">She was secretary of the most powerful industrial and actually in eight days her hair turned white and as the greatest punishment they threw her into Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s289">So there were many others there but not in our camp.</span> <span id="s290">We just knew about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: I see, please go on, what happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: I now, the day came the French prisoners got news that it is time to advance and that there are very few Germans left .</span> <span id="s293">The ones who are left tried to show the white flag and be captured.</span> <span id="s294">They carried me on their backs, they carried me on a wheelbarrow, they carried me until they arrived at the American occupied zone.</span> <span id="s295">Of course I was very, very scared not having any papers just the tattoo on my arm.</span> <span id="s296">The war wasn’t practically over yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: There was still about six weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: Six weeks.</span> <span id="s299">We arrived on a road, as long as I live I will never forget the big dusty road with a moving van standing blocking our entrance scribbled on it was “No Man’s Land.”</span> <span id="s300">And this was where the American officers were in charge of screening people who wanted to go through.</span> <span id="s301">These four to six French prisoners stood up on that lawn with hand on their heart swearing that each and everyone personally guaranteed my story whatever I am going to be telling them and they vouched for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">People whom I had never met, people who have had a common denominator, who had suffered for all those years.</span> <span id="s303">We all felt we are one and it was touching experience.</span> <span id="s304">I was questioned by the authorities and they wanted to know why I don’t want to go to the Russian occupied territory and I said I want to go to America, because my mother’s there and my brother’s there.</span> <span id="s305">And the military government said you cannot go you have no papers.</span> <span id="s306">We have very strict orders that only responsible people can go through with ID’s but you have non.</span> <span id="s307">And I just saw my whole world collapse.</span> <span id="s308">I said maybe my brother can vouch for me if you could get in contact with him.</span> <span id="s309">What is your brother’s name, I told them his name and gave the address of his business in New York.</span> <span id="s310">This man came from nowhere in that moving van looked at me and said I know this man, my office is in the same building in New York.</span> <span id="s311">I have never met him personally but I have seen his name of the directory many times.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">So you asked me before if I believed in God and I say “Yes” because why or how in God’s name this man could have been there.</span> <span id="s313">And he said all right I’m going to get in touch with him, here is a pass, go.</span> <span id="s314">If you need anything, what do you intend to do and I said well, I will go the highest if I can and I am sure they will track down all the necessary roads for me to get in touch with my family.</span> <span id="s315">He advised me to be there next morning at the railroad station, the Red Cross train left, incidentally this road where I met Lima and Lima was the head of the military government over the occupied forces.</span> <span id="s316">Because they didn’t know yet how far they are going to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">I went to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s318">There were many other French, Polish, Czech prisoners, Dutch from all over Europe were all assembled and wanted to go home as soon as possible.</span> <span id="s319">We were all in that train with opened doors not like before.</span> <span id="s320">There were very bad memories about the freight train but this time we were taken care of with food and drink and as we went through Holland, first of all Germany, part of Germany, then Holland.</span> <span id="s321">Then Belgium finally right on the border connecting Belgium with France.</span> <span id="s322">I had to go through another investigation because I wanted to enter the country and stay there until I get a visa to go to America and they were absolutely marvelous to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">They had given me, the French authorities had given me tickets to buy food, gave me transportation, tickets for sugar, everything was rationed yet because the war was on.</span> <span id="s324">A place to live, clothing, it was really a time which I have forgotten.</span> <span id="s325">When I arrived in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: For the first time in seven years you were being treated like a human being?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: Without any motives, I arrived in Paris and I found the highest who advised me to get in touch with the United.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: United Nations you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: And they got in touch with the United World Congress and I was, I was a Hungarian, I had no papers.</span> <span id="s330">I had to first get myself a passport.</span> <span id="s331">There was no Hungarian consul because it was still war.</span> <span id="s332">I had to get some identification in order to ask for a visa and the [blank space] got in touch with my mother and my brother and they advised them to make arrangements to go to Washington because there were first for brothers, sisters, wives and GI brides.</span> <span id="s333">So after a year, a long, long time, I got my visa and I was allowed to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s334">I was the first DP with the GI brides who were flying through.</span> <span id="s335">It was March, 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: It was a long time to wait?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Knowing that your life was not in danger made it bearable.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Do you want to describe what it was like when you arrived in this country?</span> <span id="s339">To meet your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: When I arrived in this country, everything I had ever read about it, everything I had heard about it did not live up to that excitement, that overpowering, overwhelming depression that I had.</span> <span id="s341">I felt like a little ant.</span> <span id="s342">I felt overpowered by the traffic by the buildings like everybody else.</span> <span id="s343">But to see my mother who had fasted three days, had asked workers in organizations did you see my daughter?</span> <span id="s344">If you have met my daughter let me know.</span> <span id="s345">And she never, never, never thought that I am lost.</span> <span id="s346">She didn’t hear from me after the war broke out at Pearl Harbor in 1942 but somehow she said I’m going to be back.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: You sound like two equally---strong women you and your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Yes, but you know what is really strong, I would say the power to believe is giving you strength.</span> <span id="s349">Because you can be physically very strong but very weak in making decisions, and sticking it out.</span> <span id="s350">I think it is the fighting part, believing that is giving you strength.</span> <span id="s351">I don’t think that people perished because they didn’t believe in God, they perished because they didn’t believe in themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: That’s a good point.</span> <span id="s353">Had you regained some of your weight by the time you got to this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: Well I gained because my mother, God rest her soul, found a cousin who ran away from Hitler and they didn’t really know where she was until they checked her out and she lived in Paris and she collected me from the Higher and I lived with this cousin for one year who actually stuffed me morning, noon, and night was marvelous to me.</span> <span id="s355">When I arrived from the 70 pounds, the 75 pounds I was at my liberation, I was 160 pounds when I arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Oh, my word.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: I was a very, very sick girl.</span> <span id="s358">I must mention to you that among other atrocities, the Germans before they sent us out for forced labor, vaccinated us to sterilize every Jewish woman so we should not have a chance to have children in case we should survive this ordeal.</span> <span id="s359">Consequently this might have been a blessing in disguise, we had lost our menses, we had no period.</span> <span id="s360">For all practical purposes we were sterilized.</span> <span id="s361">Also it created a tremendous amount of storing of liquid, or water.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Fluid retention?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Fluid retention and that was no weight for me it was all fluid and mother sent to me while I was waiting for my visa application an injection from America with instructions from the doctor who took care of me in Paris which little by little by little restored my health but it took many, many years biologically, scientifically and otherwise.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Was the sterilization permanent?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: The sterilization was not permanent because I have other friends with whom we were together who have given birth to children.</span> <span id="s366">Obviously not everyone, they used one needle so not every vaccination took.</span> <span id="s367">Obviously mine did.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: When, so you were in Paris at the time the war actually ended.</span> <span id="s369">How did people react?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: It was like one happy family, everybody on the street regardless of color or wherever you were or whatever you came from or what your origin was.</span> <span id="s371">Dancing, happiness and embracing everyone hoping that this was the last war.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Were there still Germans left in Paris up till that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: I didn’t know because for a while after I was liberated I was in euphoria, I was totally trying to separate myself from whatever happened.</span> <span id="s374">Build my little ivory tower around me, I just wanted to be quiet and not let people around me because of the hundreds and thousands that had been around me all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: You had no privacy at all during all those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Well that was not the idea, the idea was really to restore your body if you had anything at all to offer.</span> <span id="s377">But coming to this country I have then met quite a number my accident people who had been in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s378">Like walking on Broadway in New York and suddenly confronting a friend with whom I had spent several months in the same barracks and she thought that I died and I thought that she was gone and these meetings were absolutely incredible.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: I wondered that she would have recognized you.</span> <span id="s380">You had been 70 or 75 pounds and you said by the time you came here you had put on almost…</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: It’s, it’s something magical how you recognize one another.</span> <span id="s382">It is.</span> <span id="s383">I wanted to mention also that while we were in Auschwitz, it was a very strange way of the German hierarchy; they always look for very beautiful women and girls to be chosen at first to be sent out.</span> <span id="s384">Nobody ever knew what their destination was but anybody who was chosen didn’t feel so good about it because working was a lifesaver but you didn’t know what else they had in mind and there were some women without hair which was shaven practically every week not to have lice.</span> <span id="s385">They managed to look beautiful, they had inner beauty and beautiful bodies and they were they were the ones that were selected first.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: What happened to these women?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: We didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: You really don’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Really.</span> <span id="s390">It was an eerie feeling so many times many of them would dirty their face, take something, charcoal whatever they found, you know so they would always look dirty or what have you.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Because knowing is better than the other alternative?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: I also have to mention which is a very interesting part of my life is that one day before I was sent out for forced labor, I was summoned to one of the offices and there was a woman who was there since 1940 taken in Czechoslovakia by the Germans.</span> <span id="s393">Consequently there for many, many years and according to the inmates they got higher jobs watching us instead of the Germans.</span> <span id="s394">And with whips and sticks or what have you.</span> <span id="s395">This woman was standing in the office and said to me I finally found you.</span> <span id="s396">I didn’t know what she meant.</span> <span id="s397">You see when I have my very, very successful boutique in Budapest many, many times a week magazines and newspapers would have articles and pictures of the things I designed and prominent people buying it and these magazines and newspapers were distributed all over the country and also Czechoslovakia where she saw them.</span> <span id="s398">So she could never, never afford going to my place ever but she saw these magazines and she heard from one of the inmates when I checked in, when I arrived that was the only time to had to say her name.</span> <span id="s399">Afterwards they forgot you, Alice Dunn has been killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Alice Dunn?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: D U double N.</span> <span id="s402">But there were two dots over the U and it was pronounced Denn in German.</span> <span id="s403">This girl got me and brought me over and she said now I’ve found you, now you’re going to work for me.</span> <span id="s404">I know what you’re doing because I was reading all the magazines from all the papers that I was too poor to come [to] Budapest and wear your clothes.</span> <span id="s405">And I just didn’t believe her and she said now come and follow me and she took me to barracks where they had collections of thousands and thousands of mohair blankets, scarves and all the things which people came with when they thought maybe to keep warm I don’t know where I’m going.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">All the confiscated garments and she said look around and anything you see that you can work with take that.</span> <span id="s407">So I wound up to be the dressmaker in this god-forsaken place for this supervisor who knew my background and I always thing about it when your name follows you everywhere.</span> <span id="s408">You can’t tell that where you’re going to wind up when they don’t know you.</span> <span id="s409">I was in Auschwitz sewing skirts from these blankets with names using twine to put it together and we had no, she gave me a knife from the kitchen.</span> <span id="s410">She had to be very careful also that they should not see what she was doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">So I became the official dressmaker.</span> <span id="s412">Her name was Margaret and she was the one who said to me one morning when I delivered a skirt.</span> <span id="s413">I was working in the barracks.</span> <span id="s414">Tomorrow there will be a selection, I will be supervising that so try to get in there.</span> <span id="s415">Leave the barracks very early the end of the road will be the assembly and then she left.</span> <span id="s416">I had the feeling that she expected me in a way for my background for what I did she wanted to give a little gesture.</span> <span id="s417">Incidentally she also gave me one piece of bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: You had to do this sewing in secret?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s420">In the barracks at nighttime.</span> <span id="s421">Sure enough next morning about 4 or 5 o’clock it was dark yet and the assembly was at the end of the road and I was in it and that was her final gift to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: That’s when we went to [blank] out to [blank] which was the southern part of Germany and where we go to a factory sharpening aviation parts.</span> <span id="s424">That was our forced labor job.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: And that’s where you had to work five machines?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: You’ve certainly had some extraordinary experiences and when I sit here and I look at you and I talk with you and you appear so normal and comfortable, I just marvel that you were able to overcome all of these dreadful things and proceed with your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: For a while you don’t and you can’t really rationalize it.</span> <span id="s429">I had a feeling in my special case I was put together with two different personalities, almost schizophrenic.</span> <span id="s430">Today when I think back it was another person to whom this happened.</span> <span id="s431">When I was very ill I said to myself all the time they can’t do this to me, they can’t do this to me.</span> <span id="s432">It was impossible, it can’t be and I know for a fact that it was going to be all over and then some time it didn’t look like it would be over and I saw many bodies in the morning when we went out to the latrines lying next to the barbed wire full of electricity.</span> <span id="s433">That there is a way out if I can do it.</span> <span id="s434">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Would you electrocute yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: I one night walked out and decided that maybe, maybe it’s just no use.</span> <span id="s437">Time was going by and nothing happened to us, we were not sent out, it was only a matter of days.</span> <span id="s438">I walked to that bonfire and that night I thought of electricity.</span> <span id="s439">I touched it and I stood there and I felt terrible ashamed.</span> <span id="s440">How can I be so weak.</span> <span id="s441">And that is until your point don’t do it.</span> <span id="s442">You can’t take your life away.</span> <span id="s443">And therefore when I’m answering you again I say is there a God, whatever was [blank], sometimes you say in Jewish your parents are davening, they’re looking down, this is your crutch.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: You talked about coming to this country and arriving in New York?</span> <span id="s445">How it did not measure up to your expectations and how overwhelmed you felt by the numbers of people and how insignificant you felt with these enormous buildings.</span> <span id="s446">What would you say were other types of experiences that you had here that were disappointing or disheartening to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: I would say that when somebody asks me what was disheartening in your experiences being through all the terror of the Holocaust and its experiences, I say the indifference of people.</span> <span id="s448">I realize that being indifferent was a protective shield for them because they felt well all right she is here but it can’t happen to us.</span> <span id="s449">And the indifference hurt me because I already felt my light years away from them knowing they don’t even know that it can and I feel therefore very strong about this.</span> <span id="s450">I have something to say and there is a reason why I was chosen among those who are alive to spread the word and to say don’t be complacent, people don’t change, it could happen to any country at any time and it does.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Yes, it does and that’s partly why we are doing these taped interviews because we want to do our little bit to hopefully prevent this from happening, to make people aware that this can happen any place at any time.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Of course we are, we are touched by it because we are the chosen people and we are going to be another 5,000 years regardless of the atrocities, regardless of what they’re trying to do to finish our lives.</span> <span id="s453">Somehow we will be dispersed and brought together again and we have a destiny in this world.</span> <span id="s454">We can’t be destroyed, I’m a perfect example.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: People like you, you’re right, you can’t be destroyed, you have a remarkable, remarkable spirit.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: It’s, it’s an obligation to be Jewish.</span> <span id="s457">Because that puts us over because when they say the Christians were eaten up by the lions and look what happened in Spain and look at the Inquisition and we are still here to tell the story.</span> <span id="s458">Of course there might have been many fantastic scientists.</span> <span id="s459">They might have killed people who might have changed the entire world but there will be others.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: To get back to slightly more practical things, you are remarried now?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: Yes, I am remarried, I met my husband in New York by one of his cousins, they are all Germans in the family.</span> <span id="s462">He just came back from the Orient.</span> <span id="s463">He was sent out, he was too old to serve in the army during the war and he was sent out as a trial lawyer to Japan and Manilla to represent the Japanese war criminals as defense counsel.</span> <span id="s464">Then it was a fantastic experience but when he left he gave up his practice so at the time that we met, he had just about come back and I arrived it was a very interesting thing because his background, the same background as I had.</span> <span id="s465">His parents are Hungarian but came here at the turn of the century but the background is the same and we have been very successful in our marriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">He’s not retired and I was instrumental in moving him out of New York and coming down here because I felt it’s a rat race and he worked hard enough, he has a heart condition and I felt if you walk away when it’s your choice it’s better than when you have to and so we wound up here in Sarasota.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: I think you told me you’ve lived here 14 years?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s469">It was 15 in March.</span> <span id="s470">Met a lot of people.</span> <span id="s471">The minute I arrived I threw myself into civic duties.</span> <span id="s472">I’m very active in [blank] which I very much believe in and education and my Temple</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: It is, you’re still being recorded.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: And worked for 10 years very diligently as Program Chairman of Organizer and now I’ve slowed down a bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: I’ve asked you a lot of questions, I realize this in a relatively brief time we cannot cover so many things that have happened to you.</span> <span id="s476">Are there things I haven’t asked you that you want to include?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: You didn’t ask me but I would say that my experience unfortunately has taught me to be very selective and be sure when you talk to somebody.</span> <span id="s478">I was sold out by friends in Hungary.</span> <span id="s479">I had very bad experiences during Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s480">I had wonderful experiences with total strangers who never knew me so I had to have a total shift of values during my experiences and I feel that friendship and trust is a very important thing and that is what really gave my experiences to live on.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s482">I think we’ll stop on that now and I thank you so very much for sharing this with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: You’re very welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: It’s been an emotional dramatic interview?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: After you leave I will probably remember many things that I should have told you but I’m glad that I put in the idea about me being a dressmaker in Auschwitz which is really the most remote thing you could possibly think of.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: And one more of those contributory things which helped you to survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: To survive?</span> <span id="s488">Yes and also the bottom line is you can never get away from what you are.</span> <span id="s489">I was very successful and I was a pariah and yet what you know serves you.</span> <span id="s490">Knowledge and languages, I pleaded my case when they said I was sabotaging and I went to the hierarchy in the forces labor camp and I was lucky I could speak in German and I thought that the very fact that I can clean my teeth in the barracks with a towel which was always in my mind because they say Jews are cowards.</span> <span id="s491">We are not.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: Did you learn to speak English in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s494">It was my parents very very strong will for education first and foremost.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Your vocabulary is extremely good.</span> <span id="s496">Much better than most people born in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: I wish I could have my accent lost.</span> <span id="s498">But I went to Dale Carnegie when I was in New York and I said I’m very unhappy about my accent.</span> <span id="s499">I can hear it and I don’t like it and he said look there are very few things you cannot buy with a dollar, one of them is an accent.</span> <span id="s500">Turn it around, let it work for you.</span> <span id="s501">What business are you in?</span> <span id="s502">Fashions, well forget about it it’s an asset.</span> <span id="s503">And in that very minute he gave me back my confidence.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: Well, your accent is charming and did not interfere.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: I think it is more important that you have a good vocabulary and that you keep on going.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Well, I thank you again more that I can possibly say.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: I am delighted that I could be of any help and of course I hope it will be successful.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Well, I think it is.</span></p></body></html>
