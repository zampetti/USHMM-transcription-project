And it was always Hedi Politzer.</span> <span id="s21">As I say, the Hedwig was not something that I especially cherished, even as a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: And where were you born and when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: I was born March 18th, 1920 in Vienna, the capital of Austria.</span> <span id="s24">I have an older sister, there are just the two of us.</span> <span id="s25">My parents were both born in Vienna, and they were both born in 1887.</span> <span id="s26">So we’re really going back to the Victorian age, the Gay 90s, whatever you want to call it, and my upbringing, I think, was accordingly.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: What is your sister’s name, and when was she born?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: My sister Ava – Eva – Ava, I guess, Ava Politzer, she is not married.</span> <span id="s29">She was born in Vienna also in June 1915.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Tell me a little bit about your parents, how – and also how far back the family goes in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s32">Both my parents came from rather prosperous, middle class, I guess you would call it.</span> <span id="s33">Both grandfathers were prominent businessmen in Austria.</span> <span id="s34">Grandfather Ludwig Politzer was born somewhere in the far reaches of the Hapsburg empire in what is now Hungary, I guess, and came to Vienna as a very young man, to learn the language and to absorb a little culture.</span> <span id="s35">That was the thing to do for young people with any kind of ambition, to come to the capital at the time.</span> <span id="s36">It was, of course, the cultural center, right after Paris and Rome and London.</span> <span id="s37">He had a very interesting gold and silver – he was a gold and silversmith in a ta – in a stre – on a street that was called Papagenogasse, which is rather – rather very Viennese, you know, Papa Geno is one of the characters in “The Magic Flute.”</span> <span id="s38">And a very interesting thing about Grandpa Politzer, we never really knew what kind of an artist he was, and in – in eight – in 1981, when the Metropolitan Museum had a beautiful exp – exhibit of Hapsburg treasures and – and costumes, we suddenly stood in front of a big, big [indecipherable] I call it, exhibit of jewelry that Hungarian noblemen wore, and it was made by Ludwig Politzer in circa – it said circa 1872.</span> <span id="s39">So my sister and I just – just – just couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s40">I mean, this was just an unbelievable thing.</span> <span id="s41">We traced it down and it is now the property of the Imperial Museum in Budapest.</span> <span id="s42">And to try to get hold of somebody who knew something about it was – this was 1981, I said, was impossible.</span> <span id="s43">So I’m still trying to figure out how I could see it one more time.</span> <span id="s44">But this was a – a beautiful thing.</span> <span id="s45">Also, he has a – a very interesting piece exhibited in one of the museums in Vienna.</span> <span id="s46">So unbeknownst to us when we lived in Vienna, he was apparently quite – quite an artist.</span> <span id="s47">The business was later on carried on after his death by one of the brothers of my father’s, but I don’t really know what happened.</span> <span id="s48">It doesn’t exist any more.</span> <span id="s49">The other grandfather also came from somewhere in Hungary, as a very young man, about 15 years old, to learn something besides Hungarian.</span> <span id="s50">And he turned out to be a very well-known businessman.</span> <span id="s51">He had the most – best known haberdashery, I guess you would call it, on what would be the Fifth Avenue of Vienna, called Kärntner Strasse.</span> <span id="s52">And once or twice a year he went to London and Paris for buying materials and – and – and for made-to-order suits for men and women.</span> <span id="s53">It was called the English fleet, the Englisch-Flotte, it was very well known, and it was, until about 10 years ago, carried on by a much younger child of hi – much younger than my mother’s child, but that’s a long family story that I don’t think I have time to relate.</span> <span id="s54">Well, anyway, they were both very prosperous.</span> <span id="s55">My father’s family had – there were two sisters and five brothers, seven.</span> <span id="s56">And my father, Oscar Politzer was the youngest.</span> <span id="s57">My mother’s family, there were two older sisters and one younger brother.</span> <span id="s58">My mother’s name was Marie, but she was all – always Mitzi, little Mitzi because she was tiny and very, very delicate.</span> <span id="s59">And all she really knew how to do was play the piano.</span> <span id="s60">That was the thing to do.</span> <span id="s61">And both households had a cook and a maid, and in my mother’s family there was a mademoiselle that came several afternoons a week because you had to learn another language, absolutely.</span> <span id="s62">And my father’s family with the five boys especially, there was a sort of a tutor, another – another teacher who saw that homework was being done by these – by this big family.</span> <span id="s63">I – I think this is important to – to realize how very much entrenched this – both families were in Vienna.</span> <span id="s64">They were socially and financially very, very much Viennese.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: And what kind of work did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: My father was, I guess you’d call it a businessman.</span> <span id="s67">He was supposed to – to, with his brother-in-law, my mother’s brother, take over the business from my maternal grandfather, but things happened.</span> <span id="s68">Grandpa Berger was his name, was widowed er – er – ma – at age 60, and remarried a much, much younger woman, to the great distress of the children.</span> <span id="s69">And they had another child, and that other child, of course, was inheriting the business, instead of the son and son-in-law and that was that.</span> <span id="s70">So my father had – it’s hard to – to translate it.</span> <span id="s71">He – he represented foreign firms.</span> <span id="s72">He was a businessman, and business was not good.</span> <span id="s73">We’re talking – my parents were married in 1914, beginning of the war.</span> <span id="s74">And the time between the wars was economically very bad in Europe.</span> <span id="s75">So we had everything a child would need.</span> <span id="s76">And besides, you didn’t talk business with your children.</span> <span id="s77">I was really not aware of what my father did.</span> <span id="s78">I wouldn’t say I didn’t care, but you just didn’t discuss it with your children.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Did your mother work?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: No, Mother did not work, and it’s – it’s interesting, because she was a very, very talented and very smart woman, but girls of this age in that level of society just didn’t work.</span> <span id="s81">There was – she played the piano very well, and I guess she knew how to cook, because she had to learn it.</span> <span id="s82">But then we always had a maid or somebody else who cooked, so Mother didn’t – I mean, she brought up my sister and me, but that was about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: How religious was your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s85">Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Did you celebrate any religious holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s88">We had a Christmas tree, and the 24th of December was sort of a family reunion.</span> <span id="s89">We had a Christmas tree with real candles.</span> <span id="s90">And there were always two big pitchers of water standing nearby, because we always had one or two mine – little minor fir-fires.</span> <span id="s91">But that – that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Was Christmas a religious holiday for you, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: – a civil hol – a civil holiday?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: It was strictly a civil holiday.</span> <span id="s96">We didn’t go to church or midnis – mass, or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Did you ever go to any synagogue services?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Very rarely.</span> <span id="s99">I remember one wedding of a cousin, much older cousin, that I attended, but that was about it.</span> <span id="s100">Which seems strange, but that’s the way it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Well now, let’s talk about you.</span> <span id="s102">Let’s talk about your childhood, and also your neighborhood where your family lived.</span> <span id="s103">Was it a mixed neighborhood of Jews and non-Jews when you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: You’re asking me a question I really don’t know how to answer, because I don’t know.</span> <span id="s105">Even though you hear a lot and read a lot about rising anti-Semitism, I was not aware of it.</span> <span id="s106">I had friends – I had Jewish friends and I had, of course, the state religion, so to speak, in Austria was Catholic.</span> <span id="s107">So most people were Catholics, but there were some Protestants.</span> <span id="s108">And you just didn’t pay too much attention to where people went on Sundays, or if they went at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: What kind of school did you go to as a young child?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: I went to four years of elementary school, and then –</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Was this a public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Public school, yes, definitely public school, very close by to my house.</span> <span id="s113">I walked – I could walk by myself.</span> <span id="s114">And after four years of elementary school, you had to decide whether you wanted to go to an eight year gymnasium, which was high school, or just four years of – which was called Hauptschule.</span> <span id="s115">Most of the time, if you just didn’t make very good grades, and couldn’t really do very well, you went to Hauptschule.</span> <span id="s116">Or if there was no money at all – cause you did pay a little bit for gymnasium.</span> <span id="s117">And children went to Hauptschule if they wanted to follow a trade.</span> <span id="s118">It’s th-the sy – the school system is very ve – was very different and still is very different from he – here in the U.S. I went to a eight year gymnasium, which was very strict, very difficult and very, very cut and dry academic, I would say.</span> <span id="s119">And I’m – I’m glad I had the good education I had.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: While you were going to school, I assume you had no religious training at – at that time.</span> <span id="s121">Did you have any hobbies or other interests, besides school?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: From age five on, I danced.</span> <span id="s123">I was gonna be a dancer, and I was gonna have a dance studio, somewhere.</span> <span id="s124">And that was that, and the opportunities, of course, in Vienna were tremendous.</span> <span id="s125">Our household was very much infused with music.</span> <span id="s126">We had a beautiful Bösendorfer.</span> <span id="s127">That’s one of the big, big, beautiful pianos we had.</span> <span id="s128">Mother played quite a bit.</span> <span id="s129">My sister had piano lessons, seemed forever.</span> <span id="s130">And Mother tried piano lessons for me, but I just couldn’t sit still long enough.</span> <span id="s131">So I – I had – Mother was my teacher for about three years and then we both gave up, and I’m truly sorry I did, but I gave up.</span> <span id="s132">So I – I danced two, three afternoons a week.</span> <span id="s133">You know, school was from about – well, em – elementary school it was from eight to 12.</span> <span id="s134">Then in gymnasium you went to school every day from eight to one, and it c – also on Saturdays, so the – the dance classes came in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s135">And very early in life, I did a lot of performing.</span> <span id="s136">That was really what I – what I loved.</span> <span id="s137">One of my teachers was a – one of the soloists at the Staatsoper, and she had a studio on the side, and was also often asked to choreograph for the Burgtheater, which was the dramatic stage – this dramatic, state supported stage.</span> <span id="s138">And there I had all sorts of opportunities.</span> <span id="s139">I got paid something, which amounts to nowadays probably for about 10 cents.</span> <span id="s140">But at the time it was – it was great to have a little – little money to save, and I usually saved it up to go on a skiing trip, because that was the other – I would n – wouldn’t know whether it was a hobby, but everybody skied, and we also skated.</span> <span id="s141">I – we had membership to one of the ice skating rinks.</span> <span id="s142">And then every year, that was later on in gymnasium, the whole school, or those who couldn’t ski well, they had to stay home, went somewhere for a week, into one of the youth hostels in the Alps, and just looking back on it, this was probably the most beautiful, best times we ever had.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: What language did you speak with your parents at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Well, we spoke German, and although people from Berlin don’t always want to admit that Austrians speak German, it is Volksdeutsche.</span> <span id="s145">So that was the language we – I had seven years of French in ha – in high school, in gymnasium, four years of Latin and about two or three years of English.</span> <span id="s146">So we – tha-that was very much – everybody had to take languages.</span> <span id="s147">And French was really usually the first foreign language.</span> <span id="s148">Now it’s – it’s English, but in those days it was always French was the first foreign language.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Were your parents, or maybe specifically your father, very politically oriented, politically involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s151">At least that’s the way it seemed to me.</span> <span id="s152">I have no way of – of knowing, but no, my answer would be no.</span> <span id="s153">I – my – my mother’s brother George, he was two or three years younger than my mother, was terribly proud of his World War I record.</span> <span id="s154">He was in the cavalry, and it was hard to get into the cavalry.</span> <span id="s155">I don’t know whether you had to pay somebody to get in, or it was the uniform, that beautiful red pants, red trousers and blue jacket that was expensive, but he was very proud to have been in the cavalry.</span> <span id="s156">And was wounded in World War I, he had a very badly crippled hand from – from a wound in World War I. And later on, after the war was over, he joined a party called the Ligity-misten(ph).</span> <span id="s157">They were – I don’t know whether it was a political party or just like an association, people who wanted to have the Habsburg – the Habsburgs back.</span> <span id="s158">And later on, when the Nazis marched in, that was – was very bad.</span> <span id="s159">I’ll come to that later.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Was your father Zionistic at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Not at all, not at all.</span> <span id="s162">Religion had – had absolutely nothing – no – no impact on me.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Did you feel Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: No, I never did.</span> <span id="s165">And I –</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Did you know that you were born Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: Yes, yes, that I knew, but it was just something that was just sort of glossed over, I guess you would call it.</span> <span id="s168">It’s hard to believe, but that’s the way it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: What kind of relationship did you have with your parents?</span> <span id="s170">Was it the kind that you could talk things over with, did you have especially close relationship?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Well, I think the relationship was close, yes, but close for these years, for – for the – for the years in the – in the 20s.</span> <span id="s172">Probably not for now.</span> <span id="s173">I’m – I’m very close with my daughter now, much closer than I ever was with my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: What about your relationship when you were a child, with your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Well, we – we fought, like all sisters do, but basically it was a friendship and we’re still very good friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Now let’s move to 1933.</span> <span id="s177">You are 13 years old, and Hitler has come into power in Germany.</span> <span id="s178">Do you recall – okay, obviously you were quite young – any changes that you were aware of when he f – from 19 – in the early – you know, 1933, in the beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Well, I want to go back few – few years before that.</span> <span id="s180">We talked about the Soltsis(ph) and the Nazis.</span> <span id="s181">The Soltsis(ph) were the social democrats, and the Nazis were – you know, the word Nazi comes from Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei.</span> <span id="s182">So there was this talk, and of course children pick up things.</span> <span id="s183">So neither one was particularly good, but the social democrats were the leading party after World War I. And I remember vaguely there was a kind of a – almost a little revolution.</span> <span id="s184">I think it was about ’27 - 1927.</span> <span id="s185">Maybe I’m thinking of 1931, I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s186">There was a big new building development where a lot of people could get very low rent apartments, and they tried to have a little revolution against the somewhat authoritarian Christian democrat –</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: [sneezes] Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: – government at the time.</span> <span id="s189">So I – I’m – I was aware that there was something – something going on.</span> <span id="s190">This was in ’31.</span> <span id="s191">1933, yes, we heard about Hitler, but that was next door.</span> <span id="s192">That was – that was far away.</span> <span id="s193">It’s hard to believe this nowadays, but you know, we didn’t have television.</span> <span id="s194">We had just gotten a radio, and communications just weren’t – and besides, I was 13 years old, I had too many other things I – I wanted to think about and do.</span> <span id="s195">So we – yes, we knew about Hitler, but that was about it.</span> <span id="s196">Then things became more serious.</span> <span id="s197">In 1934, and I remember that very well, that the Chancellor Dollfuss – I don’t think one even knows the name here, was murdered.</span> <span id="s198">He was the – the Austrian chancellor.</span> <span id="s199">And it was very obvious that the Nazis from – the German Nazis were behind that terrible murder.</span> <span id="s200">It was in July, and I was on vacation at one of my aunt’s villas on the lake.</span> <span id="s201">And we were very, very worried about what was really happening there.</span> <span id="s202">But then that calmed down.</span> <span id="s203">Dollfuss successor was Kurt von Schuschnigg, and he was a very, very different kind of chancellor.</span> <span id="s204">I remember Chancellor Dollfuss, he was a very short man, he was just five foot tall, and he was the butt of a lot of jokes.</span> <span id="s205">But he was a very popular man, he had a great deal of rapport with the – with the people.</span> <span id="s206">And the – this new man, von Schuschnigg was a kind of a college professor type.</span> <span id="s207">Very serious, seemingly not a whole lot of sense of humor, and he was also at the time, the head of the Heimwehr.</span> <span id="s208">Heimwehr was sort of a militia type party, it was a different party.</span> <span id="s209">It was somewhere between the Nazis and the Soltsis(ph).</span> <span id="s210">And a lot of the Heimwehr – Heimwehr people were aristocrats that at one time of course were for the return of the Habsburgs.</span> <span id="s211">So he definitely lacked popular appeal.</span> <span id="s212">And I think he – he had absolutely no way of communicating with Hitler, he wasn’t even trying.</span> <span id="s213">And he was the wrong type to ever meet up with Hitler.</span> <span id="s214">This is – this was 1934.</span> <span id="s215">The – 1936, of course, was the year of the Olympics, which the museum so very, very beautifully, I thought that was a marvelous decision, whoever made it, to have that year show other Olympics, because I remember that very well.</span> <span id="s216">I was very much into athletics and of course we realized that Hitler used this as a tremendous propaganda tool, the – the Olympic games.</span> <span id="s217">And we were so, so taken by this beautiful black man Jesse Owens.</span> <span id="s218">He was – but it was – it was very, very – there were several Austrian competitors, one or two of them were Jewish, who were not allowed to participate the last moment.</span> <span id="s219">So it was a very, very strained.</span> <span id="s220">It started – it started to be very, very strained.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: When Hitler came to power in 1933, and as the year started to go on, did you yourself think more about being Jewish, or did that not enter your mind?</span> <span id="s222">I’m talking, you know, even up through the ’36 Olympics.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: No, this – this didn’t really – I don’t know, I – I – it’s funny that I have no – no feeling, no – no memories that I said oh dear, you know, what’s gonna happen?</span> <span id="s224">Just not at all.</span> <span id="s225">This really didn’t happen until after 1938.</span> <span id="s226">I had in s – in school, of course there was a – we knew that there was an underground.</span> <span id="s227">The underground Nazi movement started when Schuschnigg came in because he – he did a lot of – lot of really very, very awkward things.</span> <span id="s228">He tried to outlaw the National Socialist party in Austria, and that was the wrong thing to do.</span> <span id="s229">They went underground there.</span> <span id="s230">So right – right on my right side, we – we sat in – in – in school, in sort of desks that were three or four.</span> <span id="s231">The girl on my right side, I knew wore a little swastika on her lapel, on the underside of her lapel.</span> <span id="s232">The girl on my left, her father was in the military, and he was to be the Austrian attaché in Berlin.</span> <span id="s233">So you know, I had a little bit of a political fallout there on – on either side of – but we were – we were friends.</span> <span id="s234">I think the girl who wore the swastika on the – on the side of the lapel knew that I knew she wore it.</span> <span id="s235">But that was alright, you know, it – and we also knew that there were certain – certain professors, certain teachers who we knew were – were Nazis, but they – they didn’t make any – any difference, they didn’t treat us any different.</span> <span id="s236">It was – it was interesting.</span> <span id="s237">When I think back of it, there was very little of this polit – it didn’t come down to the youngsters, let’s say, ti – our age group.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: So you yourself never, up until 1938, you yourself never experienced any difficulty, any anti-Semitic overtones?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s240">Not at all that I – that I can remember.</span> <span id="s241">Maybe there was, there probably was, underground.</span> <span id="s242">But a teenager just didn’t pay too much attention to it.</span> <span id="s243">I – I went to a very nice dance school.</span> <span id="s244">That’s – when I say that, it’s the social dancing, the same – same school that my mother went to, and he’s still there, the school is still there, only not th – the man is long dead, but there you know, you would have – would have said you – you – perhaps there were any – any differences who could come into this class or that class.</span> <span id="s245">But I just don’t remember that there was any discrimination like this, I just truly don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: And you didn’t see any evidences on the street or with businesses.</span> <span id="s247">What about your father’s work?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: No, my father’s work actually, I think he had some work with German firms, I don’t know what happened there.</span> <span id="s249">I – I really, as I said before, there was very little business talk, and children were – it was just like – like not in front of the children kind of a – kind of an attitude, which seems strange, but that’s – that’s the way, at least in my family was the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Well, now let’s move through – through 1937, and now to March ’38, unless there’s anything in 1937 you wanted to cover.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Not particularly.</span> <span id="s252">I think there were – there were signs that – that Hitler – it seems to me that – that Mr. Dollfuss and Mr. Schuschnigg were good friends with Mussolini.</span> <span id="s253">That was of course on our south, you know, we were in between.</span> <span id="s254">And Mussolini was – was very friendly to Austria and he – the way I – I read some of the stuff now in retrospect, after almost 60 years, he tried to – to tell Hitler to stay out of Austria, because I think he – he want – he was afraid of Hitler like everybody else.</span> <span id="s255">So when – when Hitler made moves to – which he did, to invite Schuschnigg to come to see him, Mussolini told him that he thought that was a mistake.</span> <span id="s256">And he also told Schuschnigg not to go.</span> <span id="s257">But I don’t know what happened in 1937, but I know 1938, early 1938, January, February, Schuschnigg finally had to go to Berchtesgaden.</span> <span id="s258">And I remember that – that period very well, because I was in my last year of high school.</span> <span id="s259">And there was a sort of an unwritten law, at least it was – my parents insisted that I didn’t go to any of the big carnival [indecipherable] it was called, until I was a senior in high school.</span> <span id="s260">So this was my – my time to go to – to balls, and – and the political situation seemed so – so uncertain and so – it was so, so gray, and so, so unpleasant that I was afraid they were all going to spoil my fun.</span> <span id="s261">But I did manage to go do some of the dances.</span> <span id="s262">But I do remember the time that Schuschnigg went to Berchtesgaden, I remember that – that very well, because even though we only had radio, it was all given over the radio and there was also something called – here it was called March of Time, I think.</span> <span id="s263">You went to the movies for just about 45 minutes, and you had the news there.</span> <span id="s264">So we – we got a lot of that through – through these films.</span> <span id="s265">And there were reports of how, for about two hours Hitler just raved and ranted and would not take – accept anything that Schuschnigg suggested.</span> <span id="s266">And Schuschnigg at the time had a minister – I don’t know minister of what, but his name was Guido Schmidt, who was really a Nazi.</span> <span id="s267">But he came with Schuschnigg and kind of egged him on and say oh, come on, give in, make a few little – little allowances.</span> <span id="s268">But it was a totally – total disaster, that meeting that he had with Hitler.</span> <span id="s269">He came home and if I remember right, I think it was a – it was a secret to the Austrian population that he was actually there.</span> <span id="s270">I don’t think we knew about it until he came back.</span> <span id="s271">And it was a – I mean, we were told that it was no good, and Schuschnigg suggested a plebiscite.</span> <span id="s272">And Hitler said absolutely not.</span> <span id="s273">But Schuschnigg did it anyway.</span> <span id="s274">And that truly was the straw that broke the camel’s back because that was just – Hitler was just waiting for – for an occasion.</span> <span id="s275">So on March 11th, he – his army crossed the border.</span> <span id="s276">And I remember that extremely well because I was at a dance rehearsal.</span> <span id="s277">See, by then I was – I was 17 going on 18 and I really – I was very serious about my dancing and this was gonna be a production of Faust, second part of Faust, under Max Reinhardt, and that – of course he was the – the – the god of the theater at the time.</span> <span id="s278">And this was Friday evening and the rehearsal was called off.</span> <span id="s279">And of course that whole thing was called off because Reinhardt was one of the first that crossed the border; he was smart, he left, Friday the 11th.</span> <span id="s280">And then Saturday the Luftwaffe flew over Vienna and Sunday the 13th, Hitler came in.</span> <span id="s281">And I will never forget that, because even though we were told not to go da – out on the street, of course we – we young people wanted to see, no matter – whether we’re for or against, but you – you wanted to see, and this Sunday night, I had tickets to go to the opera.</span> <span id="s282">I had a – a boyfriend at the time who was in his one year of army duty, military duty, and he had cheap tickets, or free tickets, probably.</span> <span id="s283">Well, you couldn’t – you couldn’t cross the street in front of the opera, I mean th – the ring – there’s the – there’s a big avenue that goes around the old town, called the ring.</span> <span id="s284">And all along the ring are the beautiful buildings, like the opera, and the – the parliament, and the university and the Burgtheater and all that.</span> <span id="s285">Well, people stood 10 deep to see the parade, so we never made it to the opera.</span> <span id="s286">In fact, at the opera, people were hanging out fo – of the windows, and it was sort of stormed by the – by the people who wanted to see the parade, and of course, Hitler himself, he was standing up in car with his right handed lifted, and so forth.</span> <span id="s287">So it was rather – rather impossible thing to erase out of your head, the noise –</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: What were your thoughts when you – you – you said you saw the parade.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: And what were your thoughts?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s292">I don’t know whether we thought that we – we had heard that the last few years, Jews really had a hard time in Germany.</span> <span id="s293">Their businesses were either closed, or they were not allowed to do this and that.</span> <span id="s294">But people still – still had a life in Germany.</span> <span id="s295">It wasn’t the – the horror – the Holocaust really didn’t start until several years later.</span> <span id="s296">So we figured well, Austria – because we always – the Austrians always felt oh, it won’t happen here, you know, that’s the Austrian temperament.</span> <span id="s297">But I don’t know whether – whether I – I was very busy trying to finish high school.</span> <span id="s298">That’s – that’s my feeling now, but I don’t know at the time.</span> <span id="s299">I think my parents were – were terribly undone by it.</span> <span id="s300">But they too felt, oh well, yes, the kids should probably leave, but we’ll somehow stick it out.</span> <span id="s301">It was that attitude.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: You said the day before was Saturday and the Luftwaffe came flying by.</span> <span id="s303">What were your thoughts then?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s305">I s – I – I was told to stay home, and everybody stayed home, because it was – by then you really had the feeling – see we – we thought that there was gonna be a fight.</span> <span id="s306">We thought there was gonna be a war.</span> <span id="s307">We had a small Austrian army, but I think they were totally overwhelmed by the thought of the – of the German army and the Luftwaffe, so that they decided well, we better not have a bloodbath.</span> <span id="s308">I think that was the idea.</span> <span id="s309">So one stayed home.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: All right, you’ve seen Hitler go by in the car, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: From a distance.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: – from a distance, and then what happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Well, we didn’t have school for a week.</span> <span id="s314">You know how kids are.</span> <span id="s315">And it was my birthday.</span> <span id="s316">And that was the birthday I don’t remember, because I think everybody else forgot about it.</span> <span id="s317">It was very, very – we – we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s318">It was a – it was a in limbo kind of a thing.</span> <span id="s319">There was a lot of – lot of parades, lot of oh, you have to join the Hitler youth.</span> <span id="s320">But of course, you know, we wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s321">We wouldn’t even think about it.</span> <span id="s322">It was a very –</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Why wouldn’t you think about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Well, because, first of all I – you – you had to declare that you had eight Gentile – Aryan it was called – grandparents.</span> <span id="s325">And then I know a lot of people who did not join the Hitler youth.</span> <span id="s326">You didn’t – you didn’t have to.</span> <span id="s327">You were told you had to, but if you didn’t join, you had to explain why.</span> <span id="s328">So it was a – I think that was probably the first feeling of oh, we better have – we have to leave.</span> <span id="s329">If you – if you not part of the Hitler youth, you couldn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s330">So I can’t really answer that question, I don’t know what I felt.</span> <span id="s331">As I said, I was busy.</span> <span id="s332">End of – end of high school was a very – it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s333">There was something called Matura which was oral and written exams, very difficult.</span> <span id="s334">It was a sort of a summary of your – your high school years, and we had to study hard.</span> <span id="s335">So we still were going to finish this.</span> <span id="s336">So that week of vacation, which I guess it was, I don’t know just exactly what I did.</span> <span id="s337">I – I’m sorry, I can’t tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Hedi Pope.</span> <span id="s340">This is tape number one, side B. And we were talking about – we had gotten up to the time when Hitler had come in and you had been a – you said, a half a kilometer away.</span> <span id="s341">Did you start to feel more Jewish from then on?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: No, I don’t think I did.</span> <span id="s343">The – I – I still saw my friends.</span> <span id="s344">I sa-sat next to the girl who now wore the swastika on the outside of her lapel.</span> <span id="s345">And school continued.</span> <span id="s346">This was March, we were going to have our Matura, that’s those orals and written exams in June.</span> <span id="s347">We had to work hard.</span> <span id="s348">One of our favorite professors was gone.</span> <span id="s349">She was the German literature lady.</span> <span id="s350">She was Jewish, so she had to go.</span> <span id="s351">We had a –</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: How did you react to that, knowing that she had to go because she was Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Well, you better not react it, because if you expressed yourself to somebody, you were not certain what that other person – how that other person would react, and perhaps tell somebody that Hedi said such and such, and then that could hurt my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: How did you know it could possibly hurt your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Well, we were told that you – right after March 13th, there were quite a few people who quickly disappeared.</span> <span id="s356">We weren’t sure just where to.</span> <span id="s357">Some of them voluntarily just left.</span> <span id="s358">Some of them left with a passport, some of them without.</span> <span id="s359">Others were taken to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s360">This was – this was rather – you – you – you realized very soon that things have changed and you had to be careful.</span> <span id="s361">Careful is the word.</span> <span id="s362">So you just accepted it.</span> <span id="s363">We had somebody else take her place.</span> <span id="s364">The principal was replaced, because he was part – he was high up in the Heimwehr; that was the patriotic front, or whatever you want to call it.</span> <span id="s365">And he was replaced by, interesting enough, one of the regular teachers who everybody knew that he – she was in the underground Nazi party.</span> <span id="s366">So that’s – those were the changes that took place.</span> <span id="s367">Also, as we came in after that one week of vacation, we saw a picture of Hitler in the classroom, all the classrooms had pictures of Hitler.</span> <span id="s368">And every class started, you know, different teacher comes in and we had to stand up and say heil Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: Did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: Yes, of course.</span> <span id="s371">And that’s another question I always get, and I feel like oh dear, what kind of a characterless person?</span> <span id="s372">But you know, I wouldn’t be here if I would not have raised my right arm.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Were you able to talk about your concerns and your fears with your parents, or did they discuss this with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Oh yes, oh yes, we discussed it.</span> <span id="s375">And the – the idea was to – oh yes, you children, you just must go, and for me it was a perfect time to leave or do something else.</span> <span id="s376">I was possibly gonna go to university, I don’t know what I was gonna do after Matura.</span> <span id="s377">So we started corresponding with two cousins we had in the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Ju-Just a moment, we’ll get to that.</span> <span id="s379">What was it like for you to see a swastika?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Well, it made you mad.</span> <span id="s381">I – I don’t know what else to say, I – because if – if you said some – again, I have to repeat, if you – if you said something against it, or if you s – I don’t know, people spit on it or some, they were immediately taken away.</span> <span id="s382">I mean, it was wi – life was dangerous.</span> <span id="s383">And I think our parents probably told us to, when we go out, be careful.</span> <span id="s384">And if somebody comes towards you and – and a perfect stranger says heil Hitler, you’d better say heil Hitler back.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Did you yourself have any fearful experiences on the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s387">I think partially because it was – I was very blonde and blue eyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s389">Did you have any special identity papers, or your family, saying that you were Jewish at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: No, not at all, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Y-Y-You said that people started to leave, that – those who could.</span> <span id="s392">Were you ev – ever aware of a man named Adolf Eichmann?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: Of what?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Of a man named Adolf Eichmann.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: No, no, not at all.</span> <span id="s396">No, we knew of – of Hitler and Goebbels and Goering and Himmler.</span> <span id="s397">Eichmann I – I – we – that name, I – I didn’t know until they were looking for him in Argentina, I think.</span> <span id="s398">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: All right, now you said your parents started to take measures to get you and your sister out of the country?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: We had – we had cousins who had come to Newark, or to the une – the U.S. and settled in Newark.</span> <span id="s401">There were two women, there was cousins on my father’s side, a good bit older than we were, very independent ladies.</span> <span id="s402">One of them – this – I’m talking about the 20s – got a doctorate at Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s403">Now that was very, very progressive.</span> <span id="s404">The other one was a x-ray technician.</span> <span id="s405">She went to Sweden.</span> <span id="s406">She just had had it with Austria, so she up and went to Sweden.</span> <span id="s407">And then the – the one who – th-the one who went to Sweden then went to the U.S.</span> <span id="s408">This was about 1936 or 1937.</span> <span id="s409">She was just a very adventurous person.</span> <span id="s410">The other one, with a doctorate from Heidelberg, got married and had a young child, and followed her sister.</span> <span id="s411">She – this woman with – then divorced, followed her sister to Newark, New Jersey, and the two of them eked out a living, so to speak, in Newark, New Jersey.</span> <span id="s412">And when we wrote to them, they said, by all means come.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: How soon after Hitler came into Austria did you – did your folks write to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: Oh, I imagine was probably June, July, somewhere there.</span> <span id="s415">Not really sure just when.</span> <span id="s416">One thing we did right away, and it was a – it was a network kind of a thing.</span> <span id="s417">Everybody went to the United States embassy and got a quota number.</span> <span id="s418">We had no idea what it was, but everybody should have one.</span> <span id="s419">In order to – to emigrate, you had to have a quota number; quotas being very different by countries.</span> <span id="s420">And the Austrian quota was very good, meaning the U.S. didn’t mind Austrians coming in.</span> <span id="s421">But the Italian quota was not very good, and God forbid if you were born in Hungary, they wanted – like two people a year they accepted.</span> <span id="s422">Was a very interesting thing because I don’t know whether this is still that way, but you – you needed a quota number.</span> <span id="s423">And if you wanted to know, you know, how many a month, they didn’t really tell you at the embassy.</span> <span id="s424">But I remember at the time they said oh well, your number should come up around the first of the year.</span> <span id="s425">So this was, you know, a – ’38, so maybe by ’39 we could – we could think of it.</span> <span id="s426">But I remember very well just stand in line at the U.S. embassy in Vienna and get a quota number.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Did you see any signs on Jewish shops saying that they were Jewish shops, or were you aware of businesses that were closed?</span> <span id="s428">Did you see any measures starting to take place once Hitler – once the anschluss occurred?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Yes, yes, we saw that, but to the extent of – not yet.</span> <span id="s430">This – this was to come, but not – not yet.</span> <span id="s431">Quite a few business people, what happened is they perhaps – if they had an employee who was Aryan that they could trust, kind of put it into his/her hands, and that way protected themselves.</span> <span id="s432">There were a lot of ways of – of getting around that.</span> <span id="s433">Then they needed doctors badly at the time, so the Jewish doctors could stay because they were needed.</span> <span id="s434">So there was a lot of case by case, it was this – this sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: In April, it’s been written that some Jews were taken to the local amusement park and assaulted.</span> <span id="s436">Are you aware of that?</span> <span id="s437">To the pra – the prater, p – p-r-a-t-e-r?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: No, I’m – I’m – I don’t know.</span> <span id="s439">I wasn’t – it was probably true, but I was – I was not aware of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: So you have graduate – when was your graduation?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: All right, we g – w-we graduated and that was kind of interesting.</span> <span id="s442">There were so many parades going on, and so many – so many different things that we did not have to go through the orals.</span> <span id="s443">And that’s unbelievable, I mean, if – if – if I can say there’s one – one good thing came out of it, that I didn’t have orals for my Matura.</span> <span id="s444">That the written exams were in – in mathematics, and Latin, literature and French, I think.</span> <span id="s445">And they were, you know, five hour exams.</span> <span id="s446">You – you got a – got a – a title, a theme, and you had to – to write a paper on it.</span> <span id="s447">So they – we had to go through that, but the orals – and then that was such a relief, it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s448">And we had a – there was a tradition of having a Matura fire.</span> <span id="s449">And that meant you went to a restaurant, and met one more time all the – all the peop – this was an all girls’ school, so there were about 30 of us.</span> <span id="s450">And I guess you call it a roast here, but one of – one or two of them wrote a newspaper about it, and said the most awful things about their teachers.</span> <span id="s451">But it was you – it was a totally, totally good affair, with – you couldn’t have guessed what was going on around – around us.</span> <span id="s452">This was in June then, at the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Did you talk, or confide in – confide with your sister and – your concerns, or your fears about what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s455">I – we probably did, yeah, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: What was she doing?</span> <span id="s457">She’s a – was older than you, so what was she doing while you were finishing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: Okay, she had done her Matura five years – four years before I did.</span> <span id="s459">And then took business courses, and went to Paris for a year as a receptionist at the Hotel Des Saint Peres, which still exists.</span> <span id="s460">So she spoke fluent French, which she still does.</span> <span id="s461">And then came home and really didn’t know what she was gonna do.</span> <span id="s462">It seems to me she worked for sa – for one of the book stores, as – I don’t know what she did, but it was no – no specialty.</span> <span id="s463">I da – I had this dance specialty, she didn’t really have a specialty.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Did you ever – or di – did your father talk about ever going to this central office for Jewish immigration in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: I – my father was a little bit more forward looking than my mother.</span> <span id="s466">She, I don’t think, could imagine herself leaving Vienna.</span> <span id="s467">My father started taking Spanish, and English and plumbing.</span> <span id="s468">He was – he was good with this sort of thing.</span> <span id="s469">And actually the – the line of – of pre – representations he had with other firms was in the line of bathroom fixtures and that sort of thing, plumbing type of thing.</span> <span id="s470">So he – he took – he took courses in that.</span> <span id="s471">And of course his – his business more or less came to a standstill, and I – I to this day wonder how we could afford the rent, and the food, really.</span> <span id="s472">I imagine there were some savings, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s473">We had – I had a very wealthy uncle and aunt, sister of my mother’s, who didn’t have any children, I think they helped us out at the time.</span> <span id="s474">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s475">Again, it was something that you didn’t discuss with your children, so I – I’m not aware of – of – of what happened.</span> <span id="s476">But the – they definitely turned to – turned our thoughts to getting out.</span> <span id="s477">I didn’t finish my story about what we were going to do about coming to this country.</span> <span id="s478">These two sisters were very willing to take care of us, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: What – what were their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Okay, of course they were both born Politzer, older brother of my father’s.</span> <span id="s481">And Helen, the one that went to Sweden and came over here, never married, so her – she stayed a Politzer.</span> <span id="s482">And the other one’s name was Freid(ph), and that’s an interesting story, but I don’t think I’ll have to tell – the time to tell about her.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: Her first name?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Anna and Helen.</span> <span id="s485">And they – when you sh – when you have – want – have some – somebody to immigrate, you have to furnish an affidavit.</span> <span id="s486">There was a – a new thing too, the quota and affidavit we had, those were new words in our vocabulary.</span> <span id="s487">And these two ladies did not have enough money to – didn’t earn enough to – to say, we’ll take care of these.</span> <span id="s488">So we had to find somebody with more money.</span> <span id="s489">And my mother had some old friends, two bachelor brothers who I think grew up in Vienna, that she wrote to.</span> <span id="s490">And this was very brave of her, because I don’t think she’d heard from them, I mean, I don’t know how many years.</span> <span id="s491">And they immediately answered, says yes, by all means, we’ll let you have an affidavit.</span> <span id="s492">And I think it was the idea they had to do it with these two cousins, because – here again, this is interesting about the U.S., two bachelor brothers could not bring in two young ladies.</span> <span id="s493">Which makes sense, I guess.</span> <span id="s494">So between the – this was a joint affidavit, between the two men, who had enough money, and the two women who had all the family love you could wish for, that said okay, we’ll take care of these two young women.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: You’ve graduated from gymnasium, and then what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: I graduated and we went for two or thr –</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Excuse me for interrupting.</span> <span id="s498">Was there any mention of Hitler at graduation ceremonies?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: Not that I remember.</span> <span id="s500">Not that I remember at all.</span> <span id="s501">As I said, it was very – it was a fun affair.</span> <span id="s502">I still have that newspaper with all the funny things in it, quite yellowed with age, and it’s in German and nobody but me can enjoy it.</span> <span id="s503">And the teachers were there, and they laughed with us, and it was – it was a goodbye and so forth.</span> <span id="s504">It was really amazing that there was none – no – no animosity whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: And now – you started to – to tell about what you did after graduation.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Okay, we had a real – real nice vacation.</span> <span id="s507">One of my aunts – one of ma – sister of my father’s had a lovely villa.</span> <span id="s508">She actually she lived there all year long, near Salzburg and we usually spent two or three weeks every summer there, and there was no exception, 1938.</span> <span id="s509">Only it was very sad, all the – the fun people, the – there were youngsters our ages, many of them came from Czechoslovakia, they had their summer villas at that lake.</span> <span id="s510">They were – none of them came at the time, because of course, the Czechs were next, and I think they knew it, so they just – they just didn’t come.</span> <span id="s511">So it was a very – it was a lovely time, but the good friends weren’t there.</span> <span id="s512">And then I took up – I watched my mother cook, and I took some dressmaking course, and I – I choreographed some – some dances for myself, because I wanted to audition, and I was going to, you know, make it big on Broadway.</span> <span id="s513">And that was about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Were you aware of a conference in July 1938, the Evian Conference?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: I just very, very vaguely – every time I see it at the museum, I say yeah, I think I remember that, but I – I don’t think I was terribly aware of it, no.</span> <span id="s516">It was – when – when the affidavit came in, I don’t know chronologically what – how it happened, but the coordination of getting your passport; telling the – the official, whatever, yes, we’re gonna leave; getting the affidavit; getting sh – a reservation on ships was – was – was – was daunting, it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s517">We went on the Holland American, of course they were overflowing with requests.</span> <span id="s518">And – but as I said, you – you weren’t sure whether – whether your papers were gonna be in order for this particular crossing, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: How did you feel about leave – talking an – talking about leaving Austria?</span> <span id="s520">Did you feel very Austrian?</span> <span id="s521">And leaving your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: I don’t think it really hit me until just – just before.</span> <span id="s523">As I said before, I had a – I had a boyfriend and he up and left rather precipitously because of something, I’m not su – just sure what it was.</span> <span id="s524">I guess it was the family’s house was searched, because one of his brothers was a member of the heim – Heimwehr.</span> <span id="s525">They were not – they were not Jewish.</span> <span id="s526">And he just up and left.</span> <span id="s527">And he told my sister, but he tell – he didn’t tell me.</span> <span id="s528">So I was very undone.</span> <span id="s529">This was in August, I think.</span> <span id="s530">And – so that – that was kind of sad.</span> <span id="s531">And then some of my – my – the girlf – my girlfriends left.</span> <span id="s532">One of them left for Sweden, and I still correspond with her, and her grandson came to see me about a month ago.</span> <span id="s533">So I – I keep in touch with people, and another one I went to school with left for England.</span> <span id="s534">And she wanted to come to the U.S., but didn’t have her affidavit yet.</span> <span id="s535">So people kept leaving, and there was a lot – lot going on all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: What’s that like for an 18 year old girl, and again, did you feel Austrian?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: Oh, I felt very Austrian.</span> <span id="s538">I did not ever want to say that I was German.</span> <span id="s539">And of course, to this day I – I ha – I have my old passport, and it has a big swastika on it, and that really – that really hurts.</span> <span id="s540">I was – I was never – never wanted to say that I was German, I’m Austrian.</span> <span id="s541">And I say it now, too.</span> <span id="s542">That – that was very important.</span> <span id="s543">Q: Well, here you feel very Austrian and – and you’re told – then you – your family says you’re going to be leaving.</span> <span id="s544">How did that affect you –</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: Well –</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: – at – at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s548">Well, I think at the time, it was a tremendous adventure.</span> <span id="s549">I think I felt that and I – I had to fee – it was the idea of the young ones go, and somehow make it possible for the parents to come too.</span> <span id="s550">So I – I think it was that feeling.</span> <span id="s551">I – I ca – I can’t really reproduce what I felt at the time.</span> <span id="s552">I think when you’re – when you’re 18, you’re a little selfish.</span> <span id="s553">You know, it’s just – it’s just one of those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: And again, the summer is over, the fall is starting, of thir –</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: The fall is starting, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: – of ’38 and are conditions worsening?</span> <span id="s557">Are you seeing things on the street, are you witnessing anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: I – I personally did not witness anything.</span> <span id="s559">But people are leaving, and then you heard some awful things happen, yes.</span> <span id="s560">That so and so’s father was shot because he tried to get away from something, or yes, yes, you did hear things.</span> <span id="s561">It was – it was – it got to be awful.</span> <span id="s562">But you know, until it happens to you, it really doesn’t register.</span> <span id="s563">And of course, that gets us to November, and that’s when – when things really became very serious for us too, for my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: From what I understand though, in October there were attacks on synagogues, to its schools and stores.</span> <span id="s565">Were you aware of that before the November night?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: I – I really d – I really don’t – not aware of it, no, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s567">Things have a way of blending together now, even though I remember things better from back then, than I can tell you what happened yesterday.</span> <span id="s568">But still it’s – it has a way of – of – of – the-there are a few dates and things that absolutely stand out and always will, but then I – I am not aware of anything in October.</span> <span id="s569">No, it was the – the November seventh when – when this young, very misguided man by the name of Hershel Grynszpan went to the German embassy in Paris and shot this consular official of some sort, vom Rath, vom Rath.</span> <span id="s570">And that was on seventh, I think, and then, during the two days before the man died – he didn’t die until the ninth, things started to – to boil, but didn’t really boil over until the man was dead.</span> <span id="s571">And then Hitler took advantage of that, and it seemed – almost seemed as though he was waiting for an occasion like this.</span> <span id="s572">And that of course was – was horrendousness, the only way I can describe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: And what was – what did you see then?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: Well, what I – what I saw before it hit our family, I remember one thing that – I don’t know what I was doing downtown.</span> <span id="s575">Right in the center of the city there was a – I don’t know he – whether he was the rabbi, or he was – he was just somebody with – threw a robe and a little yarmulke on his head, and two or three guys went just after him with – with a whip, you know.</span> <span id="s576">And the man cried, and – and leave me alone, you know, and the ah – and then people around it, it was – it was terrible, you know, you just – just went away.</span> <span id="s577">You – you – you felt you should protect the poor man, but then again, if you did, then you got the whip.</span> <span id="s578">So it was this sort of thing all the time.</span> <span id="s579">So that’s what I saw, and then, as I said before, my father took classes.</span> <span id="s580">I don’t know whether this was plumbing, or English, or whatever it was he took, and he just didn’t come home on – on – we always call it November 10th, because that was when it – when things were really – in Vienna were really unleashed.</span> <span id="s581">And we never saw him again.</span> <span id="s582">And that was – that was rough.</span> <span id="s583">No phone call, no anything.</span> <span id="s584">Somebody called a few days later saying I bring regards and he’s fine, and hung up.</span> <span id="s585">Well, it was somebody who was let out apparently, for some reason or other.</span> <span id="s586">And much, much later, not too long ago in fact, I read a description of what happened to people.</span> <span id="s587">They herded them to one of the military installations in Vienna and they made them stand up for 24 hours, and then – no – no water, no food, and then took them to the train stations.</span> <span id="s588">It was November, it was very cold.</span> <span id="s589">And the next thing they knew, they were in Dachau.</span> <span id="s590">And I’ve – I read a lot about it because my mother never – never really heard, and I’m glad she didn’t, that there was quite a bit of torture going on, and horrible things.</span> <span id="s591">And what puzzles me very much, because my father had been in the war.</span> <span id="s592">He was in World War I.</span> <span id="s593">He was not a hero or anything, but he had served in the military.</span> <span id="s594">He was only 52 years old, not quite.</span> <span id="s595">He got to be 52 in January.</span> <span id="s596">And people got out.</span> <span id="s597">If you could prove that you – that you – that you gonna be out of the country within two weeks or something like that.</span> <span id="s598">And we – we moved heaven and earth.</span> <span id="s599">We had a nephew of my father’s, a cousin of mine, who had been in Israel by the – at that time.</span> <span id="s600">He was a rabid Zionist and he had gone before things happened.</span> <span id="s601">And he – I think we telegrammed, and – and he somehow found a way, and we, you know, let them know that my father will be out, but nothing happened.</span> <span id="s602">And the – we have – I can show you that later, we have com-communications.</span> <span id="s603">We have the correspondence of my father.</span> <span id="s604">I think after about two weeks we had a card saying I’m fine, don’t worry, you know?</span> <span id="s605">And we got about every other week, or something like this.</span> <span id="s606">I have donated the correspondence to the – to the Holocaust Museum, I don’t know what they’re gonna do with it.</span> <span id="s607">I made copies though, so I have it right here, I can let you have it.</span> <span id="s608">And on it, it says you have to have only so and so many lines, and be sure and date it, and I don’t know what else, I mean you – you were really – you – you basically had to tell your family that you were fine, that – that was the thing.</span> <span id="s609">So that was it, and this was January – November, December.</span> <span id="s610">Our date of departure was 11th of January, which was my father’s birthday, and we were so hoping that we – that he could get out and we could see him.</span> <span id="s611">And he – again and again wrote don’t – don’t change your plans.</span> <span id="s612">Don’t – don’t – don’t do it, so we wa – which we didn’t.</span> <span id="s613">And so we left –</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: Le-Le-Let’s back up a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: What else did you see in November?</span> <span id="s617">You said you saw the rabbi being attacked.</span> <span id="s618">Did you see any other damages?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: Yes, horrendous.</span> <span id="s620">I – I – I terribly resent the name of Kristallnacht, because all I can think of is – is – is something pretty.</span> <span id="s621">And it wa – there were a lot of – lot of broken windows that I saw.</span> <span id="s622">And I – there’s several other things that – one of my friends, she was not a real buddy friend, but she – a good – good ac – acquaintance, called me and said, I want you to come over and see something.</span> <span id="s623">She called me and then her very best friend.</span> <span id="s624">So the two of us went over there and I shall never forget what happened.</span> <span id="s625">Some people rang the bell and said we – I don’t know whether they said they want to inspect the apartment or what it is, but they totally, totally vandalized, like breaking Dresden figures.</span> <span id="s626">Cutting open feather pillows and going all over the place, and cutting nice upholstery.</span> <span id="s627">I mean, it was just something you – you, in your worst nightmares.</span> <span id="s628">So she wanted me to see that.</span> <span id="s629">And I mean, things like that.</span> <span id="s630">Or so and so’s father was – didn’t come home, or so and so left, on – of course, we had a story to tell too, but you were told to be very careful and – and not – not talk about it, which is hard to do.</span> <span id="s631">You were really very dependent on your concierge.</span> <span id="s632">You don’t call it concierge in Vienna, you call it housemaster in Vienna.</span> <span id="s633">But we had a – a family, they – you know, they live sort of on the – on the – as you come in.</span> <span id="s634">And usually have a little apartment there.</span> <span id="s635">And the family that – that took care of us, I think we – we were very lucky to not – not have more happen to us than it did, because they put – they had – they could protect you.</span> <span id="s636">If somebody came to their hou – to – to that door and said, okay, tell us, who – who should we vandalize or something, you know, you were – you were totally in – a victim in – in their hands.</span> <span id="s637">And a lot of this – this happened.</span> <span id="s638">Or if – if, let’s say I – one of my classmates wouldn’t like me, or something like this, or if – if somebody’s – somebody’s boyfriend you broke up with or something.</span> <span id="s639">I mean, it was this sort of thing.</span> <span id="s640">Revenge was rampant.</span> <span id="s641">It was – it was not – it was not good.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: What did that do to you in a personal way?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: Well, I – we were terribly, I mean, to – for my sister and me to leave, was – was terrible, you know, what could we do and – and we – we could leave – we could each take 40 dollars with us.</span> <span id="s644">So we had –</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Wha – wa – when you say for you to leave was terrible, what did you mean by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: Well, you – we didn’t know when we were going to see our parents again, of course.</span> <span id="s647">By then Mother was alone, but my uncle and aunt, her sister, had moved in with her.</span> <span id="s648">And we were terribly afraid that something was going to happen to Uncle Alfred, because he was president or vice-president of a company that had its headsqu – head – headquarters in Berlin.</span> <span id="s649">And not only – of course it was the – by then he had lost his job, and we were terribly afraid that something’s gonna happen to him.</span> <span id="s650">Well, nothing did, and they lived with my mother until they all together came over here in 1940, and Mother could join us.</span> <span id="s651">But the – the idea that – that our father was at Dachau and – and Mother was alone was – was pretty awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: In November did you see any destruction of synagogues, or any building destruction?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: Yes, yes, yes, yes, I saw – I saw a lot of this.</span> <span id="s654">Interesting thing happened to my – but that di – that – no, that didn’t happen in November, that happened before, and I think I’d like to back up because that’s rather interesting story.</span> <span id="s655">My Uncle George, my – younger brother of my mother’s, who I earlier told you about, that he was a member of the Ligity-misten(ph), the one that was – he was hurt in World War I, had a store in the inner city of Austria, of Vienna.</span> <span id="s656">And one day some – two SR men came in and said, come with us.</span> <span id="s657">And he immediately showed his World War I wound, and I don’t know what happened from there, but they let him go and said, but you and your family have to be gone in a week.</span> <span id="s658">So here is, you know, your – your life suddenly, you got to – where do you go?</span> <span id="s659">And at the time the – his wife had a brother in Italy – I mean, the irony of going from Austria to Italy.</span> <span id="s660">But they did, they were safe with the young boy, who was eight years old at the time, my cousin Peter.</span> <span id="s661">And they went to Italy, and of course pretty soon they were thrown out of Italy, so they had to go to – to Cyprus.</span> <span id="s662">And then this – then they were thrown out of there, I’m not sure what happened, but they ended up in Palestine, and were protected by the Anglican church.</span> <span id="s663">And my cousin, the young boy who was eight years old, is a very well-known university professor, Boston University.</span> <span id="s664">The – the man in sociology.</span> <span id="s665">So, you know, s-some – but I remember we ma – my mother and my sister and I packed up their stuff after they were gone, you know, they had to – to get out in one week.</span> <span id="s666">And we – we packed up their belongings and – and sent them to I don’t know where, but they – they never caught up with them, so they – they had nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: You said that you felt bad about leaving your – your parents and not knowing when you’re gonna see them.</span> <span id="s668">Did you feel bad about leaving the country?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: Feeling Austrian.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: I felt very bad – badly leaving the country, but as I said before, going to America was quite an adventure, and there were quite a few – before things happened, before things got bad, a lot of young people, not as young as I was, maybe a little older, went to America.</span> <span id="s672">The ones that – with a sense of adventure.</span> <span id="s673">America was – was where – where – where it was at, you know, we got all the – the – the movies, the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movies, and this sort of thing.</span> <span id="s674">So America seemed like quite the – quite the place to go, cause a lot of people did not have the good luck to go to – to the u – to the U.S., they had to go to the Dominican Republic.</span> <span id="s675">And I know of people who went to Columbia and Bolivia.</span> <span id="s676">And that was just not as – not as attractive as going to the U.S.</span> <span id="s677">But it was – I had very mixed feelings, I’m sure I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: So your quota number came up while your father as in Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: Mm-hm, that’s right.</span> <span id="s680">I think it came up then or maybe a little before that, I’m not really sure just – just when it come.</span> <span id="s681">I have an old – old little diary that I have, I should look this up, but I’m not sure just when we finally were told yes, you – your affadave – no, well, not only the quota number, the affidavit was accepted, because quite often people got their affidavits and oh everything’s gonna be all right.</span> <span id="s682">Well, something happened, and something was not all right, I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s683">But the combination of our affidavits, I think, was – was very good with the – the – the family, the – the cousins that took us, and the – the – the financial security of these two men.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: You said your father was picked up, was this while he was in class?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s686">Apparently the whole class was picked up.</span> <span id="s687">We-We’re not sure.</span> <span id="s688">We – we really don’t know, and we will never know.</span> <span id="s689">But they were picked up.</span> <span id="s690">That was a – it was probably because I think the – these classes were overseen by – by a – a Jewish organization, I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s691">Or may – before emigration or something.</span> <span id="s692">We – we will never know.</span> <span id="s693">I mean I will never know.</span> <span id="s694">My mother probably would have known, but I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Hedi Pope.</span> <span id="s697">This is tape number two, side A. And we’re now in January 1939, and you started to talk about getting ready to come to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: We were very sad to leave without knowing too much about our father’s status, but our – my aunt and uncle who had moved in with Mother told us, just don’t worry about it, an-and – and everything will be all right, they said.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Did you write back to your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: Oh yes, yes, but I think just mother wrote, because there were – there was – you know, they limited you to so and so many lines, so many – a-and only one side of a piece of paper and so forth.</span> <span id="s701">So it was just Mother who wrote as – as little as she – as much as you could say in so many words, and he – Father wrote again – again and again, the girls should go and I wish them a wonderful trip and so forth, but don’t make any change of plans on account of me.</span> <span id="s702">So we did – we did – we did write, yes, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s703">And we left on the 11th of January, and went to Rotterdam, and there we had a friend look out for us for one day and a night.</span> <span id="s704">Let’s see, yeah, we went to – we started from Rotterdam with – on the Vandam(ph) with Holland American Line.</span> <span id="s705">It was January in the Atlantic, it was very, very – how do you say it?</span> <span id="s706">I get seasick, in other words.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: Wa – what was it like to say goodbye to your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: It was – it was very difficult, and I remember myself just sobbing away.</span> <span id="s709">My sister was much braver, but I, I was really – I was really quite undone.</span> <span id="s710">But I, you know, finally had to get on the train, and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Did you take anything special with you, or did she?</span> <span id="s712">Did your mother give you anything special to take?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: Well, we had a little – we had – you could take one or two pieces of jewelry, but you were told if an SR man or SS man on the border says he wants that, you have to give it to him.</span> <span id="s714">So we bought a ring, and a diamond pin, and we took a few things with us, yes, but very little.</span> <span id="s715">You know, you – you had luggage, and there was just so much space.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Did you bring anything of sentimental value?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: Well yeah, we had diaries and old letters and – that I still have.</span> <span id="s718">And the – the little bits of – of jewelry and – and pictures, photos.</span> <span id="s719">Lots of photos and stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: And so what was the train ride like?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Well, the train ride was – was very – very interesting, but not – we had a little food with us to – to eat on the way, and the lady in Rotterdam was a friend of one of the cousins in America was just lovely, took care of us for a day and a night.</span> <span id="s722">It was very rainy, and gray and – and sad.</span> <span id="s723">That’s all I can describe it in – in retrospect.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: And then you get on the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: I got on the boat, and that was lots of fun.</span> <span id="s726">I hate to admit it.</span> <span id="s727">The first four days I was terribly seasick, and I was afraid to go down in my cabin because I always got sick.</span> <span id="s728">But then I got over that, and the Vandam(ph) was a very slow boat, and there was something wrong with it too.</span> <span id="s729">So instead of just nine days, it took 12 days for us to cross.</span> <span id="s730">And there were a lot of others in the same boat, so to speak.</span> <span id="s731">Several Viennese, and we danced a Lambeth Walk at – in the evening, and the food was delicious.</span> <span id="s732">And it was really the first time on a – on a boat for me.</span> <span id="s733">We hadn’t traveled a great deal.</span> <span id="s734">So it was sort of a – almost a last fling kind of a thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: Did you run into any difficulty in showing your papers once – in leaving Vienna and getting to Rotterdam?</span> <span id="s736">You know, when you had to go through that type of situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: Not at all, I had a – I had a passport with a swastika on it, and – and it was just made out, you know, rather recently.</span> <span id="s738">And no, there was no – no problem.</span> <span id="s739">I s – a lot of people did, I think we were – we were lucky, because it depended totally on who you met up with.</span> <span id="s740">As I said, if somebody wanted your coat or your – your ring or something, they – you had to – you had to surrender it.</span> <span id="s741">There was nobody there that you said oh hey this – this person is not – not supposed to do that.</span> <span id="s742">This totally, totally lawless – lawlessness, but that was – we went through Germany, and then of course we went through Holland, Rotterdam, everything was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: How did it feel to go through Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: It was a – it was a night train, and really it was perfectly – perfectly normal.</span> <span id="s745">Everything – everything was just fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: You had referred to your passport, even previously, with the swastika in it.</span> <span id="s747">What – what is that like for you to carry a passport – or what was it like for you to carry a passport with a swastika?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Well, it – if this was the only way I could get out of, that was it.</span> <span id="s749">You had to accept it.</span> <span id="s750">You – there was no way you could protest, no way.</span> <span id="s751">And I think this is very difficult for – for – for young people in America to – to understand, that there was no – no phone number, no 9-11 you could quickly call, or anyth – anybody.</span> <span id="s752">There was – there was no law.</span> <span id="s753">There was – was absolutely no place where you could complain.</span> <span id="s754">You just had to accept it.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: Was there any time prior to your leaving that you ever felt your life was in immediate danger?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: Not really, but I think it was just in my nature and my being 18 years old that I was just – I was optimistic and everything was gonna be all right.</span> <span id="s757">And the worry about our father, I think was just so – so on the forefront, that I didn’t worry about myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Were you a very daring young woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Gee, I don’t know how to answer that.</span> <span id="s760">I-I – I guess you’d call it enterprising, yeah, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s761">I don’t know about daring.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Was your sister as optimistic as you?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: No, my sister’s much more re – much more retiring than I am, an-and I think that is pretty much true through the rest of our lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: So now you’re on the boat and for – what’d you say, 11 days?</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: Yeah, it was 12 days, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s766">Was a – was a long ride, but th-the landing, the approaching New York harbor is – is something that – that’s – that’s just overwhelming.</span> <span id="s767">And it was a – finally cleared up.</span> <span id="s768">The sun was out, it was very cold, but there was the Statue of Liberty against a blue sky, it’s – it’s good.</span> <span id="s769">And there were ma – both my cousins, and only one of the gentlemen were at the dock.</span> <span id="s770">And things went very smoothly from there, we had all – our papers were in order, and we had a big what you call steamer trunk, and – or two of them, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: How good was your English by that time?</span> <span id="s772">You said you had taken English in high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: Well, unfortunately, I had seven years of French, but only three years of English, and my English was not good.</span> <span id="s774">I could s-somewhat understand, but I was – it was – it was a disaster.</span> <span id="s775">But of course, here again too, you – you – when you’re young you – you can muddle al – muddle along.</span> <span id="s776">And living with my cousins meant at least I could – they – their – their English was pretty good, they had very heavy accents still, but the – the – it was – it was pretty good.</span> <span id="s777">So right immediately we didn’t feel that this was gonna be a disaster.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Did you have any special emotions when you stepped onto American soil?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: Well, I did.</span> <span id="s780">I – you know, you – you heard so much about people kissing the – the earth, and – and – and Ellis Island, and so forth.</span> <span id="s781">I think we – we were a little bit more sober about it all.</span> <span id="s782">We were glad that we were there, but we also were wishing that – that our parents could be with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: On the ship, were there other young women your age?</span> <span id="s784">You said there were other people in your s – in the similar situation, leaving.</span> <span id="s785">But were there a substantial number of young people in their late teens, early 20s?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: Yes, I think I was probably among the younger ones, but there were young couples, and young singles too.</span> <span id="s787">Yeah, it was a very – it was a very interesting – interesting 12 days.</span> <span id="s788">We had – we had fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: So now you’ve landed, you’ve met – and your – did you go directly to New Jersey?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: We went directly to Newark, New Jersey, yes, and so what are we gonna do next?</span> <span id="s791">Well, everybody – we were called refugees.</span> <span id="s792">Oh, we were one of the big army of refugees, and I got to hate that word.</span> <span id="s793">And we came with all sorts of addresses.</span> <span id="s794">Everybody had people to call on that could help.</span> <span id="s795">And some – some of them were very unlikely.</span> <span id="s796">But very soon – my – my sister very soon found a job with a family to take care of some children.</span> <span id="s797">And I was determined I was gonna dance.</span> <span id="s798">And I didn’t – didn’t find anything right away.</span> <span id="s799">And of course, within a week, we got a letter from our s – our mother that our father had died.</span> <span id="s800">Which meant of course, everything just – just kind of fell apart there for a few days, and oh, our cousins were wonderful.</span> <span id="s801">But we had to pick ourselves up.</span> <span id="s802">As I said before, we he – we each had 40 dollars.</span> <span id="s803">And it’s amazing how far 40 dollars went in 1939.</span> <span id="s804">So we –</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: What – what date did you actually land in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: We landed on the 23rd – or was it 25th?</span> <span id="s807">I think it was the 25th of January.</span> <span id="s808">I always get mixed up between the landing and my father’s death.</span> <span id="s809">I think his – he died on the 23rd of January, and I think we landed on the 25th, something like that.</span> <span id="s810">So it was – it was very cold in Newark, New Jersey and we started going into New York, which meant you had a little s – little streetcar ride that cost 10 cents.</span> <span id="s811">Then you did the Hudson tubes, which cost a nickel.</span> <span id="s812">And then you had the subway, another nickel.</span> <span id="s813">So there went, if it’s a round trip, 40 cents went for transportation.</span> <span id="s814">And of course, if you were in New York and you were a whole day, you had to have lunch.</span> <span id="s815">So at Niddick’s(ph) you could get a na – a frankfurt for four or five cents, and an orange drink for five cents.</span> <span id="s816">And if you were still hungry you could get a cream cheese and nut bread for five cents.</span> <span id="s817">So for, let’s see, 40 cents fare and 15 cents, that’s pretty good.</span> <span id="s818">You still didn’t have to pay more than 55 cents for the day.</span> <span id="s819">So those 40 dollars went for – for quite some time, and everything else, our cousins were beautiful about it, and took care of us.</span> <span id="s820">My sister, as I said, then she gave up the – the job of taking care of children, and she at the time, of course, had – knew shorthand and typing and she was fluent in French.</span> <span id="s821">Her English was better than mine.</span> <span id="s822">So she found some secretarial work very quickly.</span> <span id="s823">And I got in touch with somebody who had – who was the pianist for one of my dance teachers.</span> <span id="s824">He was in New York and I looked him up.</span> <span id="s825">He was also the nephew of somebody we knew, so it was almost like a friend.</span> <span id="s826">And he says well, he said, it just so happens that I got together with somebody from one of the cabarets in Vienna and they’re forming a new group, and they found some sponsors, and maybe they can use a dancer.</span> <span id="s827">And I got in touch with this person who was – whose name was Herbert Berghof and he was very well known actor in Vienna, and I did my little twirling around with my dance dress, and I had a record on the record player.</span> <span id="s828">And he says, well, I think maybe we can use you.</span> <span id="s829">And they had just started rehearsal – this was in February – and we got rehearsal pay, 15 dollars a week.</span> <span id="s830">Now that’s – that was good.</span> <span id="s831">That was very good.</span> <span id="s832">So I started rehearsing with this group.</span> <span id="s833">It was an interesting group, they were something called fromme a kleine kunst Bühne, which literally translated means small stage theater.</span> <span id="s834">It was a – sort of a topical review that had been very successful in Vienna.</span> <span id="s835">And they got out quickly, because it was the kind of a topical review that made fun of politics, and – and they – they better – had to get out.</span> <span id="s836">So they met again in vien – in New York with Herbert Berghof as a director, and they had sponsors, a list of sponsors that you wouldn’t believe.</span> <span id="s837">George S. Kaufman and his wife, Irving Berlin, Edna Ferber, down the list.</span> <span id="s838">They all – I don’t – I have no idea how much money they – they gave, but it was a little corporation that was formed, called itself the refugee artists’ group.</span> <span id="s839">And they got a theater and we opened a show in June 1939.</span> <span id="s840">And for – as I said, rehearsal pay was 15 dollars a week, and then when we opened, we got 40 dollars a week, which was the minimum that actors’ equity paid.</span> <span id="s841">And you know, all the other refugees made anywhere from 12 dollars, 15 dollars, 20 dollars, but nobody made 40 dollars a week.</span> <span id="s842">So I really thought I had it made.</span> <span id="s843">This was summer 1939, it was terribly hot.</span> <span id="s844">There were all but four theaters opened on Broadway because they were the only four that had air conditioning.</span> <span id="s845">And the music box, where I was doing my thing, was one of them.</span> <span id="s846">It was just a glorious two month.</span> <span id="s847">And interestingly enough, for some reason or other, some time before I got in with that group and knew that it was really gonna do something, I had applied for college scholarships.</span> <span id="s848">That was another address I had, to be sure and go to the international students’ service, and apply for a scholarship.</span> <span id="s849">Of course, I did really not know what a scholarship was and I really didn’t terribly want to go to college because I had done my Matura and I was not that brilliant a student.</span> <span id="s850">So I had applied anyway, and the woman there didn’t speak German.</span> <span id="s851">I – my English was very broken, so we got along just fine and – and she said, well, you might hear from us.</span> <span id="s852">And sometime in August I got a beautiful letter from International Student Service that said, we have scholarship for you at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.</span> <span id="s853">And I just had totally forgotten that I had ever applied.</span> <span id="s854">And I was so happy performing on Broadway, I really didn’t want to do it.</span> <span id="s855">And there was some friends – friends of my cousin’s, wonderful woman who lived in New York, who was in radio and the arts, says, you’d be a darn fool if you wouldn’t take this.</span> <span id="s856">Said, I don’t want to.</span> <span id="s857">She said, well, you better.</span> <span id="s858">And of course, war clouds over Europe, very, very obvious things were going to – to be really bra – breaking there very quickly.</span> <span id="s859">And this show had very good critiques, but somehow we being refugees and foreigners, with the war breaking out, it was all a bad situation.</span> <span id="s860">We had to be fingerprinted because we were enemy aliens.</span> <span id="s861">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Was it – was the troupe primarily a Jewish troupe?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s864">Some – some were, some were not.</span> <span id="s865">And so I reluctantly said to Herbert, you know, I’m going to go to coll – Herbert was the director – I was gonna have a scholarship.</span> <span id="s866">He says oh, I hate to lose you.</span> <span id="s867">I said, well, what do you think of the show?</span> <span id="s868">He says well, it may just fold.</span> <span id="s869">And it did.</span> <span id="s870">And I want off to Miami University, Oxford, Ohio.</span> <span id="s871">So that was one of those decisions that I did the right thing.</span> <span id="s872">At the time it was – it was very difficult, and I had to leave New York where my sister was, and I was suddenly thrown into a totally, totally different environment.</span> <span id="s873">It was a good thing.</span> <span id="s874">And I think from then on in, I realized that there’s more to it than just staying in New York and being surrounded by nothing but refugees.</span> <span id="s875">And it was a – it was a good – it was the best decision I ever made.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: How did the other students ac-accept – accept you?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: Well, I’m gonna write a book about that some time.</span> <span id="s878">In fact, at my f – my 50th reunion at Miami University, I was asked to give a speech, and it was mostly on Am-Americanization.</span> <span id="s879">And Miami University was a good place to – to get it.</span> <span id="s880">I think some of them thought I was from the moon, and they – they – you know, Austria and Australia, and Vienna and Venice.</span> <span id="s881">I mean, it was all very confusing and what did you speak, what language did you speak?</span> <span id="s882">And I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s883">I got – I went to the – the registrar didn’t really know what to do with me, or whoever says whether I’m a freshman or a sophomore.</span> <span id="s884">He said, well, we’ll see.</span> <span id="s885">I brought my – my report cards, but you know, they were all in German.</span> <span id="s886">So I guess I got sophomore status right away.</span> <span id="s887">And I said, yes, but I just want to dance, I don’t want to play basketball.</span> <span id="s888">Well, I had to take all these things, cause I was a physical edu – physical education major.</span> <span id="s889">And the faculty was just wonderful.</span> <span id="s890">I mean, I can’t – I can’t say enough of the – the kindness that – that was extended to me.</span> <span id="s891">The students were kind of strange.</span> <span id="s892">I think they re – really didn’t know – I was dating some, but very little, because my English wasn’t good enough, and I think it was too much work to go out with somebody who didn’t speak the language.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: Were there other students in your position?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: Yes, there was a – a – there was an Italian boy, young man from Rose(ph), but he was Italian, for some reason or other.</span> <span id="s895">And there was a Hungarian and a German – two German girls, and a whole group of Indonesians.</span> <span id="s896">And their English was – was nonexistent, so I don’t know how they got along.</span> <span id="s897">But I had – I just – the faculty was just wonderful, because I’d had to take freshman English, and this woman sat down with me, and you know, corrected, and taught me, pronounced and so forth.</span> <span id="s898">I – I immediately got a part in a play because the word got out that I’d been on Broadway, you know, that was – so – so this – this marvelous man, who was a well-known Shakespeare scholar of all things, gave me a part in the – in the – in “Twelfth Night,” and sat down with me and worked on pronunciation.</span> <span id="s899">So there were all these wonderful things that happened, and I – my grades were strange in the first semester, but my English was – by Christmas my English was a hundred percent better, and I graduated with a B.S. in 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: What kind of nata – and your mother, you said, came over when?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: Okay, let’s see, this was f-fall ni – fall 1939, I went to – to Miami and I remember there was a minis – one of the – I think it was a Presbyterian minister, I don’t know how I got to him.</span> <span id="s902">Well I – I had really wanted to join a church, I needed something, especially with – with my father having died, it was just this – it was – I was totally undone.</span> <span id="s903">So I got to – to talk to somebody from one of the churches and said that I’d like to help my mother come over here.</span> <span id="s904">And they were actually ready to help, but then Mother got affidavits from the same two men, and the uncle and aunt got – there was a distant cousin in Illinois.</span> <span id="s905">So they got over here, they came over here together in April 1940.</span> <span id="s906">And very difficult for them.</span> <span id="s907">My mother was 52.</span> <span id="s908">Her sister was a good bit older, like 59 or something, 60, and Uncle was about in his early 60s, and he was a – a – a big man back in Vienna.</span> <span id="s909">And even though he had a little money that he managed to bring out, illegally of course, but still out, he had to take some insignificant little position doing something.</span> <span id="s910">And they eked out a living for a few years, yeah.</span> <span id="s911">Mother came down here with me after a few years and – and spent her last years with – with me, with her grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: Did your – you said you had the need to turn to the church after your father died.</span> <span id="s913">Did you turn to the church rather than exploring your Jewish roots because of what happened to you because you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: I have the feeling, you know, it’s – it’s – it’s funny, I – I can’t – I can’t think of – of what happened.</span> <span id="s915">I have the feeling the churches turned to me.</span> <span id="s916">I think they – they felt they wanted to do something for me.</span> <span id="s917">I – I really think it was that way.</span> <span id="s918">I just don’t know.</span> <span id="s919">It’s a good question, that I will ponder, but I don’t – I don’t know how to – how to answer that, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: You had to leave Austria because you were Jewish.</span> <span id="s921">Did – did that make you feel more, or less Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: Less, I think.</span> <span id="s923">I think I was mad.</span> <span id="s924">I really think I was – was – was very angry.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Angry at being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s927">If – if that’s the way it is, goodbye.</span> <span id="s928">I was – I was not brought up with, you know, going to temple and doing this every Friday night and the big holidays, so – so what good did it do me?</span> <span id="s929">It – it – it – it was terrible, what it did to me.</span> <span id="s930">I – I really think that was my – that was my attitude.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: You were, I guess in the beginning of your college career when Hitler invaded Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: Yeah – yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: What was your response to that news?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: Well, I – you know, I think we all felt well, finally there’s gonna be a war, you know?</span> <span id="s935">And of course, we were waiting from – I think it was a great disappointment that America didn’t do more.</span> <span id="s936">In fact, that – this is something I remember.</span> <span id="s937">When we were – when Hitler marched int – in March ’38, what did President Roosevelt say?</span> <span id="s938">Wha – why doesn’t he?</span> <span id="s939">Because we had great respect for the – for the president.</span> <span id="s940">Help is gonna come from there, you know, that was the promised land.</span> <span id="s941">And that was a great disappointment.</span> <span id="s942">Now, I was old enough to understand that, at the time.</span> <span id="s943">And then you came over here, and there were some strange things.</span> <span id="s944">There was a Father Coughlin(ph), this isolationists.</span> <span id="s945">And by then we were old enough to understand.</span> <span id="s946">And I remember at Miami University there was a lot of this – this isolationists, like they didn’t know what language I spoke, and so forth.</span> <span id="s947">You know, it was f-from – from another world.</span> <span id="s948">I think this was an eye opener.</span> <span id="s949">And I don’t know what my reaction to war was.</span> <span id="s950">I think if – I think we were terribly scared.</span> <span id="s951">I was at the time scared that my mother wasn’t going to make it out.</span> <span id="s952">And I think it was the last Dutch boat that came – that left Rotterdam in April.</span> <span id="s953">And I also remember that one of my best friends – but this already happened in summer ’39, she came over, I knew she was on the Bremen, and that was one of the ships that – I think it was the Bremen – the news was turned around, it was going back.</span> <span id="s954">And I said, oh my word, Charlotte is on it.</span> <span id="s955">Well, they turned back again and she – she landed.</span> <span id="s956">But it was – it was those – those things.</span> <span id="s957">So I think it was f-finally it was gonna do something.</span> <span id="s958">And – and also maybe, just maybe Americans were gonna be pulled in.</span> <span id="s959">But of course they weren’t until they had to.</span> <span id="s960">Which is a – which is all – which I can understand.</span> <span id="s961">I can understand it now better than I did then.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: So you were in college for the next three years?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: Well, I – I – I graduated in – in 1942, and during the summers during those years, I had camp jobs.</span> <span id="s964">I was a camp – camp counselor, because my – my field was, well, as I said, physical education, but I still did the dance as a kind of a major.</span> <span id="s965">And at one of the – one of the summer camps, the head counselor was a faculty member at Wellesley.</span> <span id="s966">And she asked me what I was gonna do when I graduated from Miami, and I said well, I guess I’ll teach phys ed in some school.</span> <span id="s967">She says oh, go on, go on with it.</span> <span id="s968">I’ll what I can do for you to get you a scholarship to Wellesley, and by golly, she did.</span> <span id="s969">And I – from Miami University, I went to Wellesley on a full scholarship and got a Master’s degree there in ’43.</span> <span id="s970">So I had it made by then, cause that – that opened all the doors.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: So, just to get back to the church; so you said the church was a big help to you a-and but did you con – actually convert?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: Well n – yeah, I actually converted, but – but again I didn’t – didn’t practice and –</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: Wha – when did you convert?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: I’m trying to think.</span> <span id="s975">I think ’39, I think it’s before I went to college.</span> <span id="s976">No, no, no, ’40.</span> <span id="s977">I think it was ’40 because Miami kind of – you know, they were nice to me.</span> <span id="s978">They – they – they cared.</span> <span id="s979">So I – it must have been 1940, somewhere there.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: What – what denomination?</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: It was – it was Presbyterian because the Presbyterian minister, you know, was – was just very kind, very nice, and his wife invited me to Thanksgiving dinner, that sort of thing, you know, it – it – it – I guess you’d call it an opportunist.</span> <span id="s982">But then, whoever is nice to you, you know, you – at the time I was – I was alone, I had to – to – to fend for myself.</span> <span id="s983">So I think that’s – that’s what happened, I’m not so sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: So you were at Wellesley for a year?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: For a year, yes.</span> <span id="s986">That was a very tough year.</span> <span id="s987">It was 40 – ’42.</span> <span id="s988">Fall ’42 to ’43, was very cold.</span> <span id="s989">They – because of the fuel shortage, they made a two month vacation.</span> <span id="s990">I think we – we left there early in December, and didn’t come back til February.</span> <span id="s991">I took a job somewhere in a public library in New York.</span> <span id="s992">My mother was here by then, of course.</span> <span id="s993">And in ’43, I graduated and – ’43 – of course, the war was very much on, and accepted a job.</span> <span id="s994">I had – yeah, I had th – some choices, but – and I really wanted to – to – my mother, of course, very desperately wanted me to stay in New York, but nothing came through in New York.</span> <span id="s995">So I went to Spartanburg, South Carolina, Converse College, and had three very happy years there as an assistant professor.</span> <span id="s996">And that took me to 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: You obviously followed the path of the war.</span> <span id="s998">How difficult was that for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: Well, again, I was very young, and you had these attachments to various people who were on different fronts.</span> <span id="s1000">I corresponded with one young man in Europe, one in a – inya – Burma theater and another one in the South Pacific.</span> <span id="s1001">And I did a little dating in Spartanburg, it was a –</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: The-These were all Americans?</span> <span id="s1003">A: Yeah, oh yeah, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1004">This was a – Spartanburg was very much a camp town, Camp Croft.</span> <span id="s1005">It was an infantry camp.</span> <span id="s1006">And it was a lovely college that had a very interesting music department.</span> <span id="s1007">So with – with my dance thing I – I really had a – it was a good – good place for me.</span> <span id="s1008">Cooperation with the music department, and I had to put on the – the annual May Day and there were several other chances to dance myself, and it was – it was a good – it was a good three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: Can you describe your thoughts at the time of the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: May 1945, I remember it so well and – and I get a big, you know, young kids shake their heads because it – it was at Converse College, and I guess we heard the news on the radio and everybo – everybody sa – it was announced that no classes this morning because there’s gonna be big announcements about armistice.</span> <span id="s1011">And we were all assembled in the – in the big assembly hall and listened to a radio saying the war is over.</span> <span id="s1012">So that was – that was tremendous.</span> <span id="s1013">And of course I – my mother was in New York and my sister was working.</span> <span id="s1014">And I was, by then, 20 – 25, and I was just wondering what – what was gonna – what – what’s gonna happen in Austria.</span> <span id="s1015">I didn’t immediately want to come back, because I realized that that’s impossible, and I didn’t have any – didn’t have – had very little money.</span> <span id="s1016">My first salary was 1700 dollars a year for assistant professor.</span> <span id="s1017">It’s hard to believe, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: Were you a citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: When did you become a citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: You take out first papers when you first come.</span> <span id="s1022">And I took out my first papers in New York.</span> <span id="s1023">This was – it must have been right away in ’39.</span> <span id="s1024">And it takes five years, so that would have been ’44.</span> <span id="s1025">Something happened there, because I was in Ohio when I was supposed to be doing something else, be sworn in for something, and it took extra long for me.</span> <span id="s1026">It – it took, I think five years and a half for me to be a citizen, but – because there was some paperwork there.</span> <span id="s1027">So it must have been ’44, maybe – maybe early ’45, I’m not sure just – just when, but yes, I definitely couldn’t wait.</span> <span id="s1028">Your – your first papers are your – your sort of your – your passport to everything.</span> <span id="s1029">But we had – we had to be fingerprinted.</span> <span id="s1030">When the war broke out in September 1939, all alien – I was an enemy alien.</span> <span id="s1031">I had that passport with the swastika on it.</span> <span id="s1032">So I was an enemy alien, and had fingerprinted.</span> <span id="s1033">But – and you had a little card with your fingerprints on it, I think, or something.</span> <span id="s1034">It was – was kind of obnoxious, but then, why not?</span> <span id="s1035">It’s just like now, you know, with a – I – I – the immigration nowadays, you know, I – I tried to tell everybody I was a legal immigrant.</span> <span id="s1036">And that was the only way to come to this country, I don’t think there were illegal immigrants then, I don’t know, maybe there were.</span> <span id="s1037">But this – this was all very legal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: Did you have any negative experiences from other Americans because of where you came from and the way you spoke?</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: I remember one – one professor in the education department in Miami University who gave me a D and I was very undone about it.</span> <span id="s1040">It was very difficult for me, I mean the expressions were so – it was so far removed from my background.</span> <span id="s1041">And I remember I went to my advisor at the time and I said, I don’t know what I’m gonna do, you know, it was so divis – and she talked to him, and she very frankly said well – he said – he said, how is she every gonna get along in a school with that – with a broken English, or something like this.</span> <span id="s1042">That was – that was the only time though.</span> <span id="s1043">Otherwise no, it was – it was nothing but – but positive.</span> <span id="s1044">I – I must say I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: Where did you live after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: Okay, I was three years in Converse College, and I got – I was married in ’46.</span> <span id="s1047">And that’s very interesting story because I corresponded with my husband for a year before I met him.</span> <span id="s1048">His – he was in South Pacific, and my best friend, who went to Indiana University while I was at Miami, met her husband at Indiana University, and they were married there.</span> <span id="s1049">And when the war broke out, her husband went into the navy and was stationed in the South Pacific.</span> <span id="s1050">She took a job with the Defense Department in Washington.</span> <span id="s1051">And every time I went from Spartanburg to New York, I stopped over in Washington and visited with her and we had fun, we took pictures.</span> <span id="s1052">And she sent a photograph of her and me, to her husband in the South Pacific.</span> <span id="s1053">And this Lieutenant Pope saw my picture and wanted to know whether I was free and available.</span> <span id="s1054">So I said, well we’ll – we’ll try a correspondence.</span> <span id="s1055">And he wrote me a letter and I wrote back, and we went back and forth for a year.</span> <span id="s1056">And it’s – was ver – it was a very interesting correspondence.</span> <span id="s1057">And – and war was over in the South Pacific in August 95 – in – in August ’45.</span> <span id="s1058">And he came back – well, the – the single guys didn’t come back right away, you know, they had to wait.</span> <span id="s1059">So he came to Spartanburg in January ’46, and stayed and stayed.</span> <span id="s1060">And I said, don’t you think you should see your mother and father?</span> <span id="s1061">He said yeah, I think I’ll do that, and hope to get a car away from my father, and I’ll come back.</span> <span id="s1062">And he did exactly that, and he was back within a week and stayed, and we became engaged and married in June ’46.</span> <span id="s1063">And the funny thing is that he kept all my letters, and I kept all his letters.</span> <span id="s1064">And when we celebrated our 50th anniversary a year ago, I put all this together into two books and gave it to my children.</span> <span id="s1065">So they have all that correspondence, which is kind of a nice story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: How many children do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: Two.</span> <span id="s1068">We have two children; a daughter Bonnie, who is – lives in Des Moines, Iowa, married for the second time.</span> <span id="s1069">She is a special education, learning disabilities teacher.</span> <span id="s1070">She is married to a – to a – to a physician.</span> <span id="s1071">Her first husband was – is an academic, he was – he’s now vice president of a university in California.</span> <span id="s1072">And she had a child with the first husband, our only granddaughter.</span> <span id="s1073">She’s 19 som – End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Hedi Pope.</span> <span id="s1075">This is tape number two, side B, and you were talking about your son.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A: Okay, our son Bruce is – he’s a little younger than daughter Bonnie.</span> <span id="s1077">Lives in Atlanta, is an optometrist.</span> <span id="s1078">He was married for five years, but is divorced.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: Did you work after you were married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: When we got married in 1946, we first settled in Washington.</span> <span id="s1081">You could not find an apartment for love or money in Washington in 1946.</span> <span id="s1082">Somehow we – we – we got a little place in Adams Morgan, and I immediately found a teaching position which – which was called Marjorie Webster Junior College.</span> <span id="s1083">I taught dance for two years, until our daughter was born in ’47.</span> <span id="s1084">We moved into Fairlington Apartments, stayed there for four years until we built this house, 1400 Questo(ph) Drive.</span> <span id="s1085">I did what I said I was gonna do when I was 10 years old, I was gonna have a dance school, and I did it in Alexandria, Virginia.</span> <span id="s1086">I opened it in 1947, and it was a – was a really flourishing business.</span> <span id="s1087">I’m very proud to say that I had as many as 250 students.</span> <span id="s1088">I taught afternoons, of course, children had to come after school.</span> <span id="s1089">I did all sorts of benefits and – and performances.</span> <span id="s1090">I carried on until about 1980.</span> <span id="s1091">I was somewhat burned out by then, and one of my former students took over briefly, only she didn’t try to – she – she didn’t want to work that hard.</span> <span id="s1092">And it’s finally closed, I’m not sure just when, 1985, I think.</span> <span id="s1093">We had a – a – a professional group, dance group attached to it, but that – that really depended on funding and things became just too difficult.</span> <span id="s1094">So I’ve been very happily retired since about 1980.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: Do you think that you would be a different adult if you hadn’t experienced what you had gone through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1097">And I hate to – hate to say this but I think my two children are – are very di – they’re wonderful children, and they’re making a good living, and they’re – they’re working hard, but they’ve never had the hardships that I had to go through, and it’s – it’s hard to admit it but I think a little hardship now and then is good for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: What did it do for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: Well, I’m – I’m more compassionate.</span> <span id="s1100">I’m more aware of what – what awful things can happen, and I don’t know, it’s just – I’m not – I’m not glad that things happened the way they happened, but I – it has certainly – certainly widened my horizon, if that’s a – that’s an understatement, I think.</span> <span id="s1101">Yeah, I think things could be very different, very different.</span> <span id="s1102">I can see it now.</span> <span id="s1103">We go to Austria often.</span> <span id="s1104">I have good friends there, I went back to my 50th high school reunion, and I stayed with a former classmate who was m – first time married to a pilot in the Luftwaffe.</span> <span id="s1105">And she invited me.</span> <span id="s1106">And I think it was almost – th-the invitation wi – to me was almost like a peace offering, it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1107">She – she just was as sweet and nice as you can be.</span> <span id="s1108">And I heard a lot of stories that what happened to people who stayed over there.</span> <span id="s1109">And some of the experiences were worse than mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: Yo-You’re saying austri – not – not Jews, but Austrians who stayed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: Yeah, Austrians, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1113">Was there ever a time when you resisted thinking about what you went through in those difficult months in Austria, and then losing your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: Well, I – I don’t know how to answer that.</span> <span id="s1115">Of course, I th – I think of – in fact, I think of it all the time and it’s – it’s very difficult to – to – to not – not be bitter.</span> <span id="s1116">Ma – my mother lived with us for 10 years and she naturally, understandably was very bitter.</span> <span id="s1117">And she could – she could not enjoy the things she should have enjoyed, like a – two cute little grandchildren here.</span> <span id="s1118">And my husband was very good to her.</span> <span id="s1119">My husband is Gentile.</span> <span id="s1120">So she was bitter.</span> <span id="s1121">I – I am not bitter, and – and I don’t think I ever will be.</span> <span id="s1122">I think the – the – the museum d-doing the – the museum work is almost like therapy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: Let’s talk about that now.</span> <span id="s1124">Can you describe your first encounter with the museum?</span> <span id="s1125">This is before you began as a volunteer.</span> <span id="s1126">How did you learn about the museum and so forth?</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A: Well, there was an awful lot in the paper about the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s1128">And initially, maybe when it was first chartered, which I think was in 70 – 1978 under Jimmy Carter, I said to myself, what do we need a museum right here in Washington for?</span> <span id="s1129">I – really, this was my reaction.</span> <span id="s1130">Which is strange, but – but that was it.</span> <span id="s1131">I said, people are not gonna understand it.</span> <span id="s1132">Which, you know, I had exp – experience with that, and that’s why I never really – I never really talked about my experiences to anybody.</span> <span id="s1133">My children didn’t know about – about their grandfather until they were grown, because I had the feeling that was – was – I couldn’t do it, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1134">It’s strange, but it’s – that’s the way it was.</span> <span id="s1135">So I had the feeling wha-what’s this – what’s this museum gonna do here?</span> <span id="s1136">And then i-it was built.</span> <span id="s1137">Of course, you saw the picture of the – the railroad car coming into the museum, and all that, it got be kind of exciting.</span> <span id="s1138">So when it – when it opened, and there was a little item in the paper about volunteers are – are being searched for, I – I applied.</span> <span id="s1139">And I think the first visit was – is quite overwhelming.</span> <span id="s1140">And I – I remember my sister and some other people said, how can you do that, how can you do that?</span> <span id="s1141">And I still have a very good friend who was – was married to a German, and she said, I don’t want to go there, I can’t go there.</span> <span id="s1142">Different people react differently.</span> <span id="s1143">I – I – I wouldn’t say I enjoyed it, but it was – to me it was wonderful that this was done.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: So you began working when it first opened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: I – I – I think I was in the second group of volunteers.</span> <span id="s1146">It opened in April ’93.</span> <span id="s1147">I didn’t start working until October/November ’93.</span> <span id="s1148">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: And – and what kind of work do you do there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: Just on the floor.</span> <span id="s1151">I can’t think of the word right now for –</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: In the Visitors’ Service?</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: Thank you, Visitors’ Services, yes, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1154">The – the usual, you know, answering questions in the information desk, giving the little spiel at the elevator, tearing tickets and just – just generally.</span> <span id="s1155">I – I wish sometimes that the work would be more intelligent, but then, if they need the menial tasks, that’s all right too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: Why is that all right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: Well, they need – somebody needs to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: How has working at the museum affected your life, or has it?</span> <span id="s1159">And has it affected your memories of the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: Yes, it has definitely affected my memories of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1161">I have a library about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1162">I’ve learned a lot of things about it that I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1163">This is – this is – and the bookstore, I think, in that museum, is wonderful.</span> <span id="s1164">I – I – I buy all the time, and I – I feel as though this is a – this is very important work.</span> <span id="s1165">Very important.</span> <span id="s1166">I had a chance to – to do some of the Fanny Mae tours, but I truly felt that the children who are led in small groups had no idea what this was all about; they were not prepared.</span> <span id="s1167">I think it’s been corrected now, and they only take the little older ones, and prepare them better.</span> <span id="s1168">I – I love to give a little briefing to th-the group there.</span> <span id="s1169">But I la – I like my duty at the group desk best, because there yo – I have the feeling I’m – I’m dealing with – with people, and I – I love these little older teenagers, juniors or seniors in high school.</span> <span id="s1170">And give them the briefing and tell them about no eat or drink and that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s1171">And then I very briefly mention that when you go on the fourth floor now and you see the takeover for Austria, you think of somebody who’s been there, and their mouth just drop open.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: Cause you tell them you yourself are from Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: That’s a huh, just like that, you know.</span> <span id="s1174">And I wish I could do more of that.</span> <span id="s1175">That’s the – that – that’s [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1176">I wouldn’t call it a complaint, because that’s the way it is, but one – I think one could – could use people like me, who’ve been there, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: What special insights do you think you bring because of your experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: That it’s really, truly true and somebody who was there is still alive.</span> <span id="s1179">It’s a – I – I th – that’s what makes it very interesting to me, that I’m old enough now to look back at it and how – how – how wonderful that I could be there and now I’m here and I can still talk about it, and it’s all true.</span> <span id="s1180">I – I think the museum has la – done a lot to the – the deniers of the Holocaust anyway, but then if there’s somebody there who – who really – and this person, you know, I speak English pretty good, and all that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s1181">It’s – I think it makes it very believable to – to that particular group, and I can tell, because then they get on the elevator and – and they say thank you, thank you so much and that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s1182">It’s – it – I think it means something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: If you have friends who are survivors, do you enlist them to be volunteers in the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: I haven’t really, no I haven’t – I haven’t tried.</span> <span id="s1185">I – I don’t have any friends here who are survivors.</span> <span id="s1186">I’ve – me think, no, I – I don’t have anybody.</span> <span id="s1187">My sister came to visit and of course she looked at it, and she was – she was somewhat blown away by it.</span> <span id="s1188">I think you are when you see it the first time, but then you get used to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: Can you describe your relationships with the other volunteers who are survivors, or who were witnesses to the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: In my particular group, let me see, let me think.</span> <span id="s1191">Yeah, my particular group is one – one other lady from Hungary, and we talk about it a little bit, but not very much.</span> <span id="s1192">And then there’s another gentleman on Fridays who – Friday mornings who I talk to.</span> <span id="s1193">I’m not sure what happened to him.</span> <span id="s1194">We – we talk about it very little.</span> <span id="s1195">It’s interesting, but we – we don’t.</span> <span id="s1196">I – I don’t feel our – I’m – I want to dwell on it.</span> <span id="s1197">I’m very happy to talk to you and talk about it there, but – but to constantly – it’s a little bit like, you know, people, men who have been in a war, and constantly talk about their experiences in the war, and people just sort of yawn and say, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1198">It’s – it’s li – it’s a little bit like that, and I don’t want to be that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: Can you tell me about your impressions of the me – museum’s non-survivors volunteers and staff, either Jewish or non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: I’m – I’m very impressed with the type of person who is a volunteer.</span> <span id="s1201">I don’t know whether I’m just – just lucky with the particular group on Friday afternoons, but they are just a – just a wonderful group of people, and they – they – they listen to your experiences and they – they – they feel that I have something to offer that they don’t have, and they like to listen and hear about it.</span> <span id="s1202">I have to say the same about all the nice young people who are employed, and not volunteers.</span> <span id="s1203">I say that especially because I-I’ve heard people complain about them being not always aware and tactful and so forth.</span> <span id="s1204">I’ve had just the opposite experience.</span> <span id="s1205">I – I think they’re very nice young people, and they too want to listen, and when they hear that you’re a survivor, oh, you know, they – they get very curious.</span> <span id="s1206">And one young man wrote a paper about me for his – one of his college courses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: This was an intern, you mean, at the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: No, he was a regular employee.</span> <span id="s1209">He wa – he was a regular Visitor Services, but paid, Paid staff.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: What is it like for you when you’re at the museum and you hear people speaking German, do you say anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: Yes indeed, I say it in German.</span> <span id="s1212">And then they kind of look around and they’re very happy.</span> <span id="s1213">I do that in German and I speak enough French too, to do it, and I enjoy that very much.</span> <span id="s1214">I – I – it’s – it’s difficult to admit, but my mother tongue is sort of gone away.</span> <span id="s1215">It’s difficult sometimes to – to express myself.</span> <span id="s1216">So it’s – yeah, I – I like that the – the – the foreign language thing is – there should be more of it, I think and should be publicized perhaps that – but then again, me – especially Germans, they all speak English, so they don’t really need me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: Is there any memorable experience that you’ve had while you’re working at the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: Well, the – the one small group of Fanny Mae kids I had, and I led them around and we came to the – to the Austrian part and then to the Evian Conference, and the idea of – of people not – people not being able to go anywhere if they’re thrown out of their own country, and this young man, who had no clue to what this whole thing was all about, he says, oh dear, where would I go?</span> <span id="s1219">That to me was a very poignant remark.</span> <span id="s1220">Otherwise I – I – these very much routine, and it’s – it’s pleasant work, but it’s not – not terribly challenging, shall we say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: Are there any particular exhibits there that you identify with personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1223">I – I think the – the one – the little – little video on Austria, which is – is very wrong in a way, because it doesn’t show the many people that didn’t go out there and yell heil Hitler; there were a lot of them.</span> <span id="s1224">I mean, on the outside it looked as though they were welcoming Hitler, but there were a lot of them who didn’t.</span> <span id="s1225">The – let’s see, seems to me there was a – a – one – one thing that gives me goose pimples every time I go up there, there is something called a Horst Wessel Lied, have you ever heard of that?</span> <span id="s1226">Which became almost like an anthem, and we had to learn the words to it.</span> <span id="s1227">And that – that is being played, you know, on the fourth floor.</span> <span id="s1228">And every time I go up there and hear it, I just – just shiver a little bit.</span> <span id="s1229">It’s interesting.</span> <span id="s1230">It’s a very kinesthetic experience.</span> <span id="s1231">And the whole thing on Kristallnacht is – is to me is – is very – very shattering.</span> <span id="s1232">It’s shattering to me, and sometimes I stand up there and people go up there and they look and then they walk right by.</span> <span id="s1233">And I feel as though I want to shake them and say hey, read on, you know, that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s1234">So I think that’s – that’s probably – but that’s impossible to impart on anybody else.</span> <span id="s1235">That’s just something you – you have to have experienced yourself and – and nobody else can – can feel the way you do with things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: Did you lose any extended members of your family?</span> <span id="s1237">Do you know of any who lost their lives?</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: Yes, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1239">We – let’s see, I have cousins on my father’s family that were deported to Auschwitz and Theresienstadt, and I wasn’t sure which ones, so I looked up their names and I found them in the archives.</span> <span id="s1240">Those were children of the older sister of my – my father, so they were quite a bit older than I was.</span> <span id="s1241">And I have a cousin in England who lost her parents and older sister.</span> <span id="s1242">She is exactly my age.</span> <span id="s1243">Her father was my – my father’s brother, and mother.</span> <span id="s1244">So we lost them.</span> <span id="s1245">Let me think, on my mother’s side, there was a cousin of my mother’s, and her mother’s sister.</span> <span id="s1246">So the very, very old lady, and her daughter, they were deported to Theresienstadt and the old lady was 80 years old, had a broken hip when she was deported.</span> <span id="s1247">So I hate to think of what – what happened to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: What is it like to stay in in the archives and look at a list and see your family relations’ name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: Well, I don’t know, it’s just – I don’t know whether it was because it was almost 60 years ago or what.</span> <span id="s1250">And I have the feeling if – if – what they must have suffered, I should suffer a little bit, looking at the names.</span> <span id="s1251">That’s one way to look at it.</span> <span id="s1252">I don’t know how – how else to – to describe it, you know, it’s – it’s – again, it’s sort of like therapy.</span> <span id="s1253">It’s guilt, I guess.</span> <span id="s1254">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">Q: Guilt of what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">A: Guilt that I’m here and they are not.</span> <span id="s1257">Cause it was – it was luck, and these two cousins, one of them – one of them died when she was 80.</span> <span id="s1258">The other one, kind of an interesting story, the one that – that was married and divorced and has a son, is now 94 years old and lives in Helsinki.</span> <span id="s1259">Cause her son, who got his degrees from Swarthmore and Harvard, he’s a psychiatrist, married a Finnish girl, and the Finnish girl couldn’t stand it in the U.S., so they had to move to Helsinki.</span> <span id="s1260">And he teaches there, and my cousin Annie lives in Helsinki, and writes, and she writes in German and English and Finnish and French.</span> <span id="s1261">A real genius.</span> <span id="s1262">And my sister visited her last – last [indecipherable] so some – some people, you know, if – if these two women wouldn’t have given us the affidavit and the impetus to come, we – I – I wouldn’t be here.</span> <span id="s1263">So it’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: Over the years, in 50 - 60 years later, have your feelings about being born Jewish changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: I don’t think about it.</span> <span id="s1266">And was kind of interesting, I have one – one granddaughter, and okay, my children are – are half Jewish, so my granddaughter is – has one Jewish grandmother, me.</span> <span id="s1267">And this was a few years ago, she – they going to Congrational(ph) church, or something like that.</span> <span id="s1268">And she says, you know, Mom, you know I am Jewish?</span> <span id="s1269">And you should see her, she’s blonde and – the most beautiful blonde hair, blue eyed.</span> <span id="s1270">She looks like a – like a Scandinavian of some sort, but you know, it’s that sort of thing, it’s – it’s – makes you laugh.</span> <span id="s1271">No, I don’t – I don’t – I don’t feel Jewish.</span> <span id="s1272">And I don’t – this dwelling on – on what happened, and some awful things happened to these people who – who speak for the museum, you know.</span> <span id="s1273">I don’t know whether you’ve – you’ve interviewed any of the ladies who – who speak about their experiences, and – and – and they go around talking about it all the time.</span> <span id="s1274">I don’t think I want to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: Did your mother or sister also convert?</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: No, no, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1277">But my mother never went to – never went to synagogue.</span> <span id="s1278">You know, we live across one s – synagogue right here.</span> <span id="s1279">I’ll show it to you.</span> <span id="s1280">And Mother was lonesome and Mother didn’t have anybody her age, and I said, well, Mother, I’ll take you across there, I know they have women’s gr – oh, I don’t like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: So neither your mother or your sister were upset when they heard –</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A: No, no, oh no, no.</span> <span id="s1283">No, they – I think they encouraged it.</span> <span id="s1284">Not at all.</span> <span id="s1285">It seems strange, but – but I think – I think European Jews are very different in that respect from American Jews.</span> <span id="s1286">Maybe it became that way, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1287">I – I just truly don’t know, I would hate to – to express my – an opinion.</span> <span id="s1288">My – my cousin, the sociologist college professor, he – they converted when they were in Palestine with the Anglicans.</span> <span id="s1289">I think they became Anglican.</span> <span id="s1290">And he, in fact, writes a lot and talks a lot about religion.</span> <span id="s1291">Was on television with Bill Moyers not too long ago, and he considers himself a – maybe not a Christian, but – but forgets about it.</span> <span id="s1292">So this is a – I think the har – the – what has happened has a lot to do with it.</span> <span id="s1293">He maybe felt angry too.</span> <span id="s1294">Hey, if you don’t want me, I don’t want you kind of a feeling.</span> <span id="s1295">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1296">That’s hard to analyze.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: You said that you really did not tell your children when they were growing up, about your –</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: – experience, or what happened to their grandfather.</span> <span id="s1300">And when did you start telling them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: I hate to pinpoint it, I – because I’m not sure – when I had the feeling they were old enough to understand.</span> <span id="s1302">When they learned things in history, you know, to s – to place it where – where it belonged.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: And what was their reaction?</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: I – I – I know – I know my – my daughter, let’s see – I took her to – we were in Vienna together, and I took her to my father’s grave, and there was some Hebrew letters on it, and I think that’s – that’s when it came out.</span> <span id="s1305">She was a teenager then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: So your father’s body was returned from Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: He was cremated, yeah.</span> <span id="s1308">Because the story goes that it’s – it’s – that he died from natural causes, if you can say that.</span> <span id="s1309">It’s ridiculous.</span> <span id="s1310">He – he became ill with pneumonia.</span> <span id="s1311">And believe it or not, he – there was a hospital.</span> <span id="s1312">He was – it was at a – the – at the concentra – conc-concentration camp hospital, and died there.</span> <span id="s1313">So his – his ashes and – and belongings with a little package, you know, came – came to Mother.</span> <span id="s1314">And something happened there, he – they – they wouldn’t open the grave of his parents, so he’s actually buried with his grandmother.</span> <span id="s1315">Very, very strange.</span> <span id="s1316">And I go there, I mean, when we go to Vienna I always go to – go to the grave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: What was your daughter’s reaction when you told her then that – of your background?</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: I don’t think she – I don’t think she reacted at all.</span> <span id="s1319">She says, yeah, I saw – I saw the Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1320">Is – this was not – this was not anything that was either upsetting her or even – it was just something she – she took.</span> <span id="s1321">And then I think she – she told her brother and – and he said, oh, you’re kidding.</span> <span id="s1322">But that would be his reaction, he’s a different sort.</span> <span id="s1323">So it’s – it’s not – it’s not that much of a deal, somehow.</span> <span id="s1324">I hate to admit it, but that’s just about the way it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Q: Are there any sights or sounds today that trigger a memory of your time –</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: The Horst Wessel – the Horst Wessel Lied, yes, and oh, Strauss waltzes, yes, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1327">But I think that’s my dancing background that does that.</span> <span id="s1328">I was – I would just come from – from – we – we spent two weeks in Europe in September, and we were – for one week we were in Austria in a little village way up in the Alps.</span> <span id="s1329">And it’s kind of interesting to see these young people, it’s – Austria is – is booming, you know, it’s very, very do – economy is doing very well, and even the people up there that – what used to be peasants, they’re very – they speak English rather well, and you – you wonder what their grandparents did.</span> <span id="s1330">In fact, that was my real reaction.</span> <span id="s1331">I – there was a group of German kids at the museum, and it was such a happy coincidence because the – the museum should somehow be prepared to get foreign s-speaking people into the right places.</span> <span id="s1332">Well, this was wonderful, this was a group of exchange students who were on their way back home, I think, they came – they were in Cleveland.</span> <span id="s1333">And they were wonderful kids, very well behaved, but I really and truly said to myself, I wonder how much they know about this, and I wonder if anyone’s grandfather or great-grandparent was one of those SS people who did awful things, or what – what they know about it.</span> <span id="s1334">Because for a few years now – I – I mean, y – I think now they’re teaching it again in school, but let’s say in the 50s or 60s, I don’t think the schools in Germany were taught – taught about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1335">I – I really don’t think they were.</span> <span id="s1336">Oh what?</span> <span id="s1337">Yeah, really, does that happen?</span> <span id="s1338">No, not here, kind of a thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: Ha-Have you been to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: I – just through it.</span> <span id="s1341">Not really, I’ve never – well, you know, you land in Munich, and we took what is called the romantic road.</span> <span id="s1342">I’d like to go to Berlin because it’s supposed to be beautiful.</span> <span id="s1343">But not really.</span> <span id="s1344">But I don’t think it’s on purpose or – it just hasn’t worked out.</span> <span id="s1345">I’d rather go to Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: Do you feel Austrian or American?</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: I feel American, very American.</span> <span id="s1348">In fact, this hyphenated thing, you know, Italian-American and so forth, I – I just think it’s bad.</span> <span id="s1349">I’m – I’m American, very much so.</span> <span id="s1350">And I – in fact, I think as soon as I went away from New York, cause I went back a lot, because my mother was there – my sister still lives there.</span> <span id="s1351">But as I started Miami University and went to college, and entered Wellesley and so, I was – was very bent on – on Americanization.</span> <span id="s1352">I was probably going to the other extreme.</span> <span id="s1353">I wanted to not have an accent, I wanted to – to be Americanized.</span> <span id="s1354">And, I don’t know, then with American husband, of course, he was in the navy, you know, and his parents, Massachusetts, Boston.</span> <span id="s1355">So I – I made a real effort the other way, maybe – maybe to the extreme, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1356">But I feel very American.</span> <span id="s1357">But when I go back to Austria the – the dialect comes back and I – I feel very much at home.</span> <span id="s1358">It’s a wonderful feeling.</span> <span id="s1359">It’s something that – that is kinda great when you go to a foreign country, but it’s not a foreign country.</span> <span id="s1360">It’s very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: Is there anything you want to add before we close?</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: [indecipherable] I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1363">I think you thoroughly milked the subject.</span> <span id="s1364">I don’t – I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1365">I have no – nothing.</span> <span id="s1366">No, not particularly.</span> <span id="s1367">I was very happy to do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q: Well, thank you very much for doing the interview.</span> <span id="s1369">This concludes the interview of Hedi Pope.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">End of Tape Two, Side B</span></p>
