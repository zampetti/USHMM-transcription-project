<span id="s68">The apartment we lived in, there were two entrances, one for the waiting room and his -- where he saw his patients and the other for the family.</span> <span id="s69">And when I went back to Vienna many years later, there was still a doctor living there.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Could you see the apartment when you went there?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: I couldn't get myself to ring the bell.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: I can imagine that would be nerve-racking.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: I just couldn't.</span> <span id="s74">I stood there like I was frozen, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: I can understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: But it was still a doctor's office.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s78">Did

<p><span id="s90">A: I don't think so, but I'm not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Do you have good memories of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Nice.</span> <span id="s94">Do you have any -- anything specific or --</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: I know the fraulein was really nice and she took us to the park and she took us -- she walked us to school and/or at least me.</span> <span id="s96">My brother was older, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Fraulein.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Fraulein.</span> <span id="s100">I understand.</span> <span id="s101">So your father was a doctor and he was able to be close to home?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s103">Well, he would visit his patients but he would --</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: So you saw him a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: His practice was at home.</span> <span id="s106">Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: That's good.</span> <span id="s108">And I understand you were -- so 1930?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: So you were in Vienna for the first eight years of your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: And can you tell me about school and --</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Well, I was -- we were in a school -- we were the only Jewish children in the school.</span> <span id="s114">I was in second grade when the Anschluss occurred, and I remember the principal of the school came to our house crying that we could not stay at that school.</span> <span id="s115">We had to go to another part of the city to go to a Jewish school because of -- and she was very upset about it because she liked my parents and she liked me and --</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: How soon after the Anschluss did that happen, that you had to leave school?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Well, the Anschluss was in March and school ended in the summer, so it was -- I'm not exactly sure.</span> <span id="s118">It wasn't very long that we went to the other school, and I have no memory of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: But I remember that we had to go to this other school and we had to take the street car to get there.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Do you know where it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: In a completely different area, but, no, I don't remember the name or the street or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: I know that today young children move about Vienna on the subway and on the trans by themselves, which we would never do here.</span> <span id="s124">Was it that way when you were a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: I think we went by ourselves after -- to that school, my brother and I, but I -- I really -- somehow I don't have a lot of memories about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Sounds like you only attended that school for a short time?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: It was for a short time, yes, because we left in August.</span> <span id="s128">I mean, and school was out, I think, in June, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s130">So you said you were the only Jewish children in your first school?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: And do you recall an awareness of Judaism as your religion or --</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: I knew I was Jewish, but I don't think -- I think I went to the temple once with my mother, but I don't really remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Do you know which temple?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: At that time there were many.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: There were many, but I don't think there were too many in Meidling.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: I don't think there were any in Meidling.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Maybe not.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: I assume it was near where my grandmothers lived, but I really don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: So that's actually a good -- what other family members in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: My two grandmothers both lived in Vienna, and they lived together.</span> <span id="s144">They were very good friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: How nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: So I felt that was what everybody did, that they went to see their grandmothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: That's wonderful for children.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: And did they live near you?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: No.</span> <span id="s151">They lived on Mariahill Fortash (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: But I don't know exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: But and was that -- today it's a shopping areA: Was it a shopping area then too?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: I really don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: That's okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: I didn't do much shopping at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: No, I guess not.</span> <span id="s159">And so does that mean that your grandfathers were no longer living?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: I never met my -- both my grandfathers had died before I was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s162">Were your grandparents also from Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: My -- on my mother's side, yes.</span> <span id="s164">On my father's side -- well, my father was born during the Austrian Hungarian Empire in 1894, and he was born in a little town in what we thought was Hungary.</span> <span id="s165">His name was Gaza, which was a Hungarian name.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: And but he went to Vienna for the -- for his schooling and he lived in ViennA: He considered himself a Viennese.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Did he speak Hungarian?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: But we didn't.</span> <span id="s172">My mother didn't and we didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Yeah, well, I guess German is most important in ViennA:</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: And I don't remember my grandmother having a Hungarian accent whereas other people, other relatives that, you know, not close relatives had -- did.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s176">Were there other relatives in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: No, but they visited.</span> <span id="s178">Both -- obviously the families of my mother and my father were very close to each other and so we had relatives from both sides visiting us.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: So did the close relationship between your grandmothers bring your parents together or did your parents come together -- bring them together?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: I think they had -- they brought them together, but we had a very close relationship after they were married.</span> <span id="s181">Like my mother introduced one of her best friends to her brother-in-law.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Who, you know, so -- and then later on my other uncle was the one who saved -- saved our lives, I mean, let us come -- get out of Austria, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: When you said that they brought them together, the grandmothers brought your parents together or --</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: No.</span> <span id="s186">I think my parents got the grandmothers together.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: But they were both widows, I guess, by then.</span> <span id="s189">As I understand, as far as I know they lived together.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: That's okay.</span> <span id="s191">Yeah.</span> <span id="s192">That's really lovely for children.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: That's really -- and both families were Jewish, mother's family and father's family?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Were your grandparents -- grandmothers religious at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: I don't think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s199">It's typical for Viennese Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Viennese, we're very much assimilated.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s202">Yeah.</span> <span id="s203">Do you know, were your parents members of the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: I don't think so, not in ViennA: I mean, when we lived in Ecuador later on, yes, but -- I know -- well, let me take that back.</span> <span id="s205">They were both Zionists.</span> <span id="s206">In fact, they met in a hiking club, Zionist -- what was it called?</span> <span id="s207">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s208">They always mentioned it, but I don't remember what it was called.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: So they met through their common interests in Zionism --</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: -- and hiking?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s214">Sounds very Austrian and Jewish, Zionism and hiking.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s217">And so then other than -- or in addition to Zionism, do you know what your parents' political affiliations were?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: I would think they were very liberal sort of socialist.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Probably, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Sometimes young people have memories -- people who were young at that time have memories of being in the socialist youth group or the communist youth group and --</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: No, we were not -- I was in no -- in any -- not in any group of any kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: I got -- I guess I was -- as I said, I was -- I had just turned eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s226">Very young, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: In fact, I hadn't turned eight yet when the Anschluss occurred.</span> <span id="s228">It was a few months later.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Of course, yeah.</span> <span id="s230">On June 30th.</span> <span id="s231">And how do you recall your neighborhood and the surroundings before the Anschluss?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: We had -- it was a nice place and people were very friendly and they loved my father.</span> <span id="s233">They all -- they all were very close to -- most of them were his patients.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Sure, yeah.</span> <span id="s235">And so he had many non-Jewish or maybe even all non-Jewish patients?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: I'm sure he had some Jewish patients, too, but, yeah, most of -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: I know you were young, but do you recall any kind of antisemitism or discrimination before the Anschluss?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s239">I never -- I never felt it.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: That's good.</span> <span id="s241">And do you recall your parents talking about it or later?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: They didn't talk about things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s244">I understand.</span> <span id="s245">Some questions might seem silly, but I have to --</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: But I mean, you know, they -- as I said, we had a fraulein who sort of -- so I wasn't participating in my parents' life as much as American kids do, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Well, yeah.</span> <span id="s248">Gets -- it's changed a lot, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Did you -- I know you were young, but did you know anything, were you aware of Hitler or Naziism before the Anschluss?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: I remember the Hitler Jugand marching, and I thought that sounded really neat.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s253">Where did you see them or hear them march?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: I saw them from my window.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Before the Anschluss?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: After?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: I guess it was after.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: I guess, yeah, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: I guess it was after.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s262">So it was impressive?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s265">And do you -- do you recall -- again, I feel like I should preface everything with I know you were young.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: No, that's okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: The day of the Anschluss, do you recall the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: No, no, I don't know exactly the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Do you know any stories your family had about that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Not about that day.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: But then --</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: I know later on my father was picked up and was put in a jail with -- they picked up all the men, the Jewish men and he was in a -- in a jail cell, and I assume the next day or soon after they would have been sent to a concentration camp; and the guy who was the night guard at that jail was a former patient of his and he let him out.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: And I know that -- I assume my parents had talked about leaving before that because then he came home and he told my mother, see, we have friends, we don't have to worry; and my mother said no, and we left either the next day or very soon thereafter.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: And we had passports and we left by an airplane in 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: That's so unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: And I saw that airplane or one like it at the museum here in (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s280">Do you know -- I have no idea about airplanes, but what kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: It's a Fokker trimotor.</span> <span id="s282">I -- I have a picture of me standing in front of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: I mean now, not as a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: That would have been --</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: With my great grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: That's great.</span> <span id="s288">So before we get to that, because that's the big piece of the story --</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Yeah, I know.</span> <span id="s290">That's a lot later, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: So you just mentioned, though, that after the Anschluss you remember being impressed with the Hitler Jugand marching?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s293">I believe they had flags and they were marching and sounded like it should be fun to an eight-year old.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s295">And maybe it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Not in the context that we know it now of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: What about adult Nazis, adult officers and officials do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: I don't remember -- I remember after the Anschluss my father would go and whenever he visited his patients at their home, the owner of the garage would take him and would drive him instead of having my father drive, and once he took me along.</span> <span id="s301">I remember while I was waiting downstairs while he went to see somebody and I saw the sign owned by Arians and I asked, what does that mean, and the guy shushed me up and told me not to ask those questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s303">Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: That was, you know, one of the vignettes that I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Do you remember other -- seeing other signs, these sort of --</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: I mean, we weren't allowed to go several places and --</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: How did your parents explain that to you as a little girl?</span> <span id="s310">Do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: I don't -- they didn't.</span> <span id="s312">We just didn't -- they just didn't talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s314">I think sometimes --</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: And they tried to protect us, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: And also I think sometimes in such dire situations, parents think, okay, we have to do this, this, and this and --</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s318">They didn't discuss those things in front of us.</span> <span id="s319">Like, I don't know how the plans were made for us to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: So you -- you said that when your father was arrested within a day or two of his release you were packed and leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: When was his arrest?</span> <span id="s323">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: I don't know the exact date.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: So sometime between March and August?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: And August.</span> <span id="s327">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: If you left in August --</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: I don't know if you have a copy of my passport there, because I know they took pictures of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: I don't have your passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: I -- I have it at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Well, if we have it here I can look at it too.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Because I -- you know, the day that we left is stamped on it, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: In your letter to your granddaughter --</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: I don't think I had it then.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: -- you said you -- but you said you left in August of 1938?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: So that means --</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: I know it was August, but I have the date stamped.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: That's fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: On the --</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: That's fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: On the passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: We can look that up if we need to.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: I have heard many Austrian historians and other historians now like to say that the Reich Programna (ph), the Cristnauf (ph) in Vienna began in March 1938, and they refer to it as months of the kind of persecution that Germany started to see --</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: -- on that night.</span> <span id="s349">Do you recall that kind of activity?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Well, I know that we were told not to -- not to go out, you know, to stay home or else go to school and just come straight home and --</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: And as I said, we had to go to another part of town to go to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: And was that the only time you would go out of the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: We would go visit our -- some friends.</span> <span id="s355">I know the night before we left I spent the night at a friend's house.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: To say goodbye?</span> <span id="s357">To have a --</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: I didn't know I was saying goodbye.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Did you know you were leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s362">Wow.</span> <span id="s363">Do you remember that morning?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: I remember, you know, that we went.</span> <span id="s365">It was a stormy day and we went -- I don't know how we got to the airport, and we each were allowed one suitcase, and I remember that my father's suitcase was lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Oh, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: But we flew from Vienna to Rotterdam in Holland where we had an uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: And did you pack your own suitcase or did your mother do that for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: No, I didn't pack my suitcase.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Do you remember what --</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: I remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: -- you brought?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: -- talking on the plane to people saying oh, you know, we're going to -- and they kept shutting me up.</span> <span id="s374">They kept telling me not to talk to the other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Did they tell you we're going on a little vacation, honey, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: No.</span> <span id="s377">They just said we're leaving, we're going to see, you know.</span> <span id="s378">They didn't want me to blab about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: I was a chatterbox.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: And so you mentioned this uncle was in Rotterdam?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Well, actually, he was in another town near there.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: And he was able to help you to escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Well, no.</span> <span id="s385">This was the one -- we went to Rotterdam -- we went to Holland and we were staying in a little town called Oss where my uncle, he worked for a big pharmaceutical company, Organon, which I think still exists because I've seen Organon at least several years ago in South AmericA:</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Medicines.</span> <span id="s388">But he was well established there and he and his wife lived there.</span> <span id="s389">He eventually was sent to a concentration camp but he was -- he survived it.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: So they didn't end up leaving the Netherlands?</span> <span id="s391">They --</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: No.</span> <span id="s393">They stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: They stayed there.</span> <span id="s395">A little bit earlier you referred to as an uncle saving your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Well, that was the other brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Of my father -- my father had two brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: And the other uncle was a resident in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: And he sent us the affidavits that we wouldn't be a burden to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: So we came to New York, actually, and we stayed here for a while, but that's -- that comes on later.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: That comes later.</span> <span id="s406">So the first -- the first leg of your journey out of Austria --</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Was to Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: -- was to Holland.</span> <span id="s409">And as you said before, your mother and father seemed to have that planned and ready when they needed it?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: I figured they must have, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s412">But you don't recall the plans or anything --</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: -- going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: I know that my mother insisted we got to leave and my father saying -- I mean, that I heard later, him saying that we don't need to leave because we had friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: But she convinced him?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: She convinced him.</span> <span id="s418">She was bound and determined that we should leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: She was right.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: She sure was.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: She was definitely right.</span> <span id="s422">And do you know if the Jewish community had any involvement in your papers or paperwork or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: I have no ideA: I wish I knew because I didn't even know she had all these papers for us.</span> <span id="s424">I had a passport, and I remember I had to sign it in cursive, and I had learned to write the German script which was different.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s426">I can't read it.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: I can't read it either, but at that time that's what I -- so I remember signing Eva Fisch.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s429">Just as a side note, the Holocaust Museum in our archives has the majority of the Jewish community's documentation on microfilm from about -- this is not exact, but something like 1937 to 1947, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: It's possible that that could be researched.</span> <span id="s432">I don't know how easy it would be, but it's possible that that could be researched.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Yeah, but I do have the passport, the actual passport, as I said.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s435">It's -- because of the way things were set up and operated in Vienna, often the Jewish community would become involved or people who had not been affiliated --</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: -- just might be --</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Yeah, but I don't --</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: No, no, I'm just -- for your --</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: And the worst thing is, there's nobody I can ask.</span> <span id="s441">I'm the only one still living.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s443">So when you left, did your grandmothers stay in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Yes, but they both ended up living somewhere else.</span> <span id="s445">My -- my grandmother Fisch actually went -- ended up going to Oss to be with her son.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: And she died before he was sent to concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: So she --</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Of natural causes?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Of natural causes.</span> <span id="s452">And my other grandmother went to South America to her son to Chile and then came to live with us.</span> <span id="s453">She died in Quito, Ecuador with -- at our house.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: But --</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: So that's good fortune.</span> <span id="s457">They were able to --</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s459">They were both able to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s461">So -- so your uncle in the United States provided the affidavit --</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: -- so that you could make the first part of the journey to the Netherlands, to Rotterdam?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: I -- I assume -- yeah, I assume so.</span> <span id="s465">Or while we were in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: We got the papers, again --</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Somehow?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: I'm not --</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: How long were you then in Holland; do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Three months.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Three months?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Do you have memories of that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Very little.</span> <span id="s476">I remember that I was -- I learned a little Dutch, but -- and now I can't understand a word of it, but we played with the kids that lived near where we were staying, but I don't really remember much about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: It was a short time and you were young.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: And so what was -- was your father -- I mean, was it always considered to be a temporary stop on the way?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s482">So he didn't start working --</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: -- there?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: No, he wasn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: And so what was the next leg?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: Well, then my mother, my brother and I left for the United States.</span> <span id="s488">My father could not come to the states because the United States had a quota system and they -- they put him on the Romanian quotA: As I said, he was born in this little town that was on the boarder of then Hungary and Romania, and the immigration authorities in their wisdom decided that he was Romanian and couldn't come in.</span> <span id="s489">So he went -- he left and I don't know how.</span> <span id="s490">He did not come with us on that ship.</span> <span id="s491">He went on -- he went to Canada, supposedly, to attend the medical congress and then he crossed -- he came to New York illegally and was caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: And then my uncle, who was a resident, started going from one consulate to another to see where we would end up; and then we all, including my uncle and aunt, went to Ecuador.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: The ones in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Oh, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: So we -- I mean, family helped each other in those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s499">So you and your mom and your brother --</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: -- took a ship from Rotterdam to New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: And there did you join up with this uncle and aunt?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s505">We lived with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Immediately?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s508">We lived with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: And how soon after was your father then able to go to Canada?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Well, he must have gone there about that same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: And we were -- we were in New York only six months, and then we -- but I had gone to school those six months.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: In New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: In New York.</span> <span id="s515">At first I was -- they put me in first grade because I didn't speak a word of English, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: And I was -- by then I was already eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: And I was tall for my age, and I was with these five- and six-years old and it was pretty bad, and I remember coming home the first day of school and saying I'm not going back to school.</span> <span id="s520">I'm going to go and get a job.</span> <span id="s521">And my mother convinced me that I should go back to school.</span> <span id="s522">And I remember my brother couldn't go -- they put him in his regular class because he was really big for his age and he wouldn't fit in the desks of the little kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: Did he speak any English?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: I think he had taken a little bit of English in -- he was in like fourth or fifth grade, and I think he had taken maybe some -- but he really didn't speak it either.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: What about your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: My mother spoke a smattering of English, but -- my father -- I guess they knew a little bit, but not enough to really do much about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s528">Did your aunt and uncle have children in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: No.</span> <span id="s530">The Fisch family, we were the only children.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s532">The only little Fisch?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: We were the only little Fisch.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: And so do you know anything about your father's illegal entry into the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: No.</span> <span id="s536">All I know is that he was caught and was told that he would be deported back to AustriA: And my uncle, as I said, got us visas to Ecuador.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Did the U.S. officials detain your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: They didn't detain him.</span> <span id="s539">He was -- he was -- but he was there for just a very short time.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s541">And so your uncle went to the different consulates looking for who could take you?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: Who would give us a visa, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: And did he run into the same problem that the other foreign consulates saw as Austrian quota and your father as Romanian or --</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: But many of them did not want us, but Ecuador -- we had to come in as industrialists.</span> <span id="s547">We were going to -- had that -- I mean, the girl -- the adults were going to set up a business, an industry in Ecuador.</span> <span id="s548">They wouldn't allow my father to practice medicine, but he did.</span> <span id="s549">That, again, is another story.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: That's coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: So you mentioned -- I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s553">I'm going back a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: But you mentioned that you were each able to take one suitcase and your father's was lost?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: And that you had no idea you were leaving so your mom packed the suitcase?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: And did you have any toys with you or any --</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: I think I had a couple of books with me, and I must have brought my doll, because I always had my doll.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: You kept her all the way to Ecuador?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s565">I still have it somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: That's great.</span> <span id="s567">That's nice.</span> <span id="s568">That's really nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Maybe I don't have it anymore.</span> <span id="s570">I haven't found it lately, but I brought it with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s572">So did you -- after a few months in New York, did you achieve a level of English?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s574">I was speaking perfect English by the time we left.</span> <span id="s575">In fact, they put me into second grade while I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: And I had -- yeah.</span> <span id="s578">I spoke it very well by then.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Did you, in that short time, make any friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s581">I had a boyfriend.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: And a boyfriend.</span> <span id="s583">Advanced for your age.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s585">I think his name was Richard, but I'm not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: We'll just call him Richard.</span> <span id="s587">So you in a quick time really --</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: -- got into American life.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s592">And so your memories, they're good of that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: Once you learned English?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: I learned English and I was fine.</span> <span id="s596">Then I found out we were going to South America and my brother and I were fantasizing we were going to go into the wild jungle with wild Indians and --</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s598">And another new language for you to learn?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: And another new language for me to learn.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: Do you remember your impressions of New York?</span> <span id="s601">Was it overwhelming or --</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: No.</span> <span id="s603">I mean, we lived in a little apartment with my uncle and aunt and -- and my aunt was an artist, and she had some very interesting friends and --</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: And is that -- well, I guess you passed your days by going to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: And being with family?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: And then your uncle found that Ecuador would take you --</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: -- on the condition that you say you were opening an -- some business?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: Industry.</span> <span id="s613">And what do you think made him and your aunt choose to come along?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: I guess they -- I've never quite -- you know, I just thought that families just helped each other and he -- they had the money.</span> <span id="s615">We didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Had they been in New York a long time?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: They had been there for a while.</span> <span id="s618">In fact, my aunt had just been offered a job, a good job with Vogue magazine, and she had had -- she was -- she had an exhibit of her paintings at the time somewhere in New York, but they left with us and we lived together for first few years in Ecuador.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: And so how did you travel from New York to Ecuador?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: The first part of the trip from New York to Panama we went on a banana boat, an empty banana boat called a melsha (ph) which was owned by the United Fruit Company.</span> <span id="s621">And it was a cargo boat, but they took a few passengers on the way to Panama, and then they loaded it with bananas to come back to the states.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Do you recall the trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: It was -- it was -- yeah.</span> <span id="s624">I remember that one because, again, there were very few people on board and my brother and I were the only children.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: And the captain let us come in and see the -- steer the -- ________ held the --</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: The steering wheel?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Yeah, whatever they call that, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s630">And how long --</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: And they spoiled us a lot during those few days that the trip took.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: So it was just a few days?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s634">I don't remember how long it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: Did anyone get seasick?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s637">Well, I know my mother got seasick on all those trips.</span> <span id="s638">But I didn't and my brother didn't, so we always ate everything in sight.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s640">That's actually a good point.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: And we even on the trip to New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Through this time, you always had enough to eat and --</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: -- food wasn't an issue?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: Food wasn't an issue, no.</span> <span id="s646">We always -- I've never been hungry in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: Me, too.</span> <span id="s650">We are lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s652">No.</span> <span id="s653">That's why I've always said, you know, I'm not sure if I can be considered a survivor because I really didn't suffer.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: But surviving doesn't --</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: It changed my life --</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: -- completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: You should never have been forced to leave your home.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: And you survived by escaping --</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: -- from the persecution.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Yes, I know, and, you know, that's what -- that's one reason I've never approached the Holocaust Museum until now.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: Well, whenever you feel it's time, that's fine.</span> <span id="s665">And I understand that many, maybe, people who lived in exile or refugees or those who escaped, however they --</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: -- term themselves, sometimes have difficulty with the word survivor.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: Well, I mean, you know, I never, thank goodness, was into a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s669">I never --</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: -- suffered the horrors that these people --</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: But you still should not have been forced to go through what you went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: No.</span> <span id="s674">I realize that, but, as I said, that's why I've always felt kind of guilty.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: Guilty?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: Survivor's guilt is right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s680">So you can feel or see that clearly in your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Do you think the rest of your family felt that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: I'm sure they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Sometimes people say there's no such thing as survivor guilt.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: I wouldn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: I wouldn't either, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: No.</span> <span id="s688">I mean, I feel -- I remember the first day I went -- many years ago -- several years ago I went to the museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: This is the Holocaust Museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s691">The Holocaust Museum, and there's a -- there's this great big picture of children waiting for the train to take them to concentration camp, and in the front of that -- among the first children there's a little girl there that looks just like me, and I saw that picture and it just hit me really --</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: Could have been you.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s694">I shouldn't have been --</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: That's okay.</span> <span id="s696">Gives more emphasis.</span> <span id="s697">Yeah.</span> <span id="s698">It could have been you.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: It could have been me.</span> <span id="s700">Yeah.</span> <span id="s701">Very easily could have been me.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: And so I --</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: And I think I --</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: I think I understand without being able to know it myself, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: I could see how that would feel.</span> <span id="s709">So to return to your family, on the banana boat to Panama --</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: -- it's mother, father, you and brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: And my uncle and aunt, yes.</span> <span id="s713">And we arrived in Panama, and we stayed a few days in Panama and then we got on a ship, an English ship called the OrdunA:</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Orduna?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: Orduna O-R-D-U-N with a tilted A, and we -- and there we went -- they had first, second and third class, and we were in third class; but some relatives of my aunt were coming from Europe, and they were in second class and they -- and they came with their two little boys and they would smuggle (inaudible) or something to my brother and me once in a while during that trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: So they met you in Panama, and then you took the next --</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: We -- we got on the ship that they were on.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: And, again, how that was -- I mean, that was my uncle and aunt had made those arrangements to -- with her family.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: But do you think each leg from New York to Panama, Panama onward was planned before you left New York or do you think they figured it out --</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: I think it was planned from New York, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: And so where did this next ship take you?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: That took us to Ecuador.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s727">And so that's when you --</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: -- arrived --</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: By the time we arrived in Ecuador, we arrived in a little Port of Salinas which is now a very fancy resort, but we arrived and we had to take these little boats from the ship to the landing because there was no pier there.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: And by then it was -- the six of us and my aunt's family, her brother, sister-in-law and two boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s734">So that's six --</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: So there was --</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: -- ten of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: Ten of us that arrived in Salinas, which when we stayed in Salinas maybe one or two days then we went to Guayaquil.</span> <span id="s738">Then we took the train to Quito.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: So was Quito always the final destination?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: So you were still making your way?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: Yes, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: So I wonder if I might ask to pause for a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Since we're now we're in Ecuador to your new life.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">[Interview was interrupted for a break.]</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s749">Thank you for that short pause.</span> <span id="s750">We've arrived in Ecuador, but before we go on, is there anything --</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: I'm trying to think, and I don't think so.</span> <span id="s752">I think -- unfortunately, my memory of those days is not that clear.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: Well, it's that of a little child, so, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: If someone asked me about when I was eight years old --</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: But if things come to you, like I said --</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: Yeah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: I'll keep us on track.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: But you --</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: -- stop and tell a story, whatever you want.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: So this trip from New York to Panama, then Panama to --</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: Ecuador.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: -- Ecuador, and then through Ecuador, you were at a couple of stops before Quito?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: Yes, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: How long do you think that whole journey took?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: Oh, like starting from New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: I would say -- I would think that about a week on the ship and we were in Panama a few days.</span> <span id="s773">I would say about two, three weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: And the land portion, once you were in Ecuador?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: It was hairy.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: Hairy, how is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: Well, we arrived on the coast.</span> <span id="s778">Quito is 9,000 feet and the trains were very primitive.</span> <span id="s779">I remember that.</span> <span id="s780">And the rails, there's a section of the rail going up the mountains where it's very steep and the train goes up and then it backs up and then it goes back up again, and the place is called La Nariz Del Diablo which means the devil's nose because it's very steep and very --</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: Was it scary?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: I would be scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: It was scary.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: And it took a long time to get there, at least 24 hours; but, again, I'm not sure about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Do you recall arriving in Quito?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: I know we got there -- oh, when we arrived in Salinas I remember, as I said, it was on these little boats that took us from the ship to the landing.</span> <span id="s789">The purse of one of the relatives fell into the water and some guys dove in and brought it up because it held all her papers and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: And somewhere I've seen -- I don't have it, but I've seen the manifest of that ship saying that it landed in Salinas and --</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: And that some -- and the people who disembarked.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: That could be something Bill --</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: That can probably be found, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: Found for you too.</span> <span id="s797">And -- and then you arrived finally in Quito by train?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s799">And we stayed for -- in a hotel -- oh.</span> <span id="s800">We arrived in Quito on June 8th.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: Oh, good.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: Which was two days before my 9th birthday.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: So there's a time schedule, because this was June 8th, 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: And we were in this very dark pension (ph) and somebody, some relative had sent me for my birthday, which was June 10th, a Spanish version of Anderson's Fairy Tails.</span> <span id="s807">And I remember on my birthday my father was sitting in this dark room with me and the dictionary trying to read the book to me.</span> <span id="s808">And I didn't want to stay there.</span> <span id="s809">I wanted to go out with my brother and some other kids who had -- some other refugee kids were playing and I wanted to go play with him, and my father insisted that we read that book.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: So were there other refugees there with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s812">We met some other people there.</span> <span id="s813">In fact, the pension (ph) where we stayed was run by -- I guess they were German Jews.</span> <span id="s814">It was called pension noeman (ph).</span> <span id="s815">And we were there a few days.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: Mension (ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: At the pension (ph) and then we moved into a house with my aunt and uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: Do you know how they found that?</span> <span id="s819">Just once they arrived they found it or --</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: They found a house.</span> <span id="s821">They said they had a lot of -- I remember them telling me later that they had found it was hard to find a house that had indoor plumbing.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: But we did get one with indoor plumbing.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: And do you know, were your parents able to take their savings with them or any assets with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: Not right then.</span> <span id="s826">Later we -- my grandmother who had stayed in Vienna before she went to Holland was able to send some of the stuff.</span> <span id="s827">I remember a doctor came to take our apartment in Vienna to take it over and he seemed very friendly to us, and so he said that we shouldn't worry, that he would make sure that all our stuff would be shipped to us wherever we ended up at; but when my grandmother came to insist on some of the things he said she better not come back or the Gestapo would be called.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: Oh, my.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: And I do know that they got some stuff sent to them.</span> <span id="s830">I remember the cabinet that had -- with silver knives and forks was there, was empty.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Do you think it was emptied in Vienna or emptied along the way?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: I think it was emptied in ViennA:</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: By that doctor, but I'm not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s836">So I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s837">I sort of skipped that detail.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: When you left --</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: Well, I'm sorry I just remembered that.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: No.</span> <span id="s842">That's perfect.</span> <span id="s843">That's why we record it so we can keep it.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: So part of the plans your parents had put into motion to leave included someone taking over his practice?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: I don't know if that was their decision or the government's decision.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: Because I think my father would not have been allowed to work anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: Not there.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: And so this non-Jewish doctor --</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: -- claimed he would keep your things safe and send them to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s855">And we did get some of the stuff.</span> <span id="s856">I did get -- I still have some of that stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: Do you think the doctor that is there today is related somehow --</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: -- to the other?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: I mean, this was 70 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: Well, I mean, maybe it's his son or --</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: I don't think so.</span> <span id="s865">I don't remember the name, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: But there is -- it's still a doctor's office there.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: So do you remember the -- so when you were in Quito and one day some of your things --</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: Arrived there.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: -- arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: With some things missing?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: That was after we moved -- no.</span> <span id="s874">That was while we were still living with my uncle and aunt, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: Probably if they were going to get something out it would have had to have been pretty soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s877">Yes.</span> <span id="s878">It arrived while we were still living together.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: Kind of surprising that even that made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: It was funny even when we were still in that pension (ph), word got around that there was a doctor and people would come to my father and he would say, no, I can't see you.</span> <span id="s881">I cannot see you.</span> <span id="s882">I cannot see you.</span> <span id="s883">I cannot work here.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: Because -- and then slowly he started getting people coming and he couldn't say no.</span> <span id="s886">One of -- and then while he was trying to get his -- he had to take all the tests of the medical school in Spanish, five years of tests and so he was studying at night and working.</span> <span id="s887">And while he was working illegally, he was the private physician of the president.</span> <span id="s888">Only in Ecuador.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s890">And eventually did he pass those?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: He did.</span> <span id="s892">He did.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: But it was several years later, but, no, he was -- I mean, he was a graduate of the Medical School of Vienna which was at that time the best medical school in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: And one of his professors was Freud, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s898">So the president heard about him?</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s900">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: And decided --</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s903">And, in fact, since my father could never send him a bill because he was working illegally, he went on a state visit to Mexico, the president and brought back a silver tea service which is in my house now.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: Do you have any of the other -- the furniture and things that went to

<p><span id="s912">Q: And so you mentioned that there were other refugees there too?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: Yes, oh, yes.</span> <span id="s914">And we became very active -- the family was very much involved with the Jewish community in Quito.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: And was it mostly German and Austrian Jews who had fled?</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: There were some --

German.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: Yeah, yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: And it was mostly older kids.</span> <span id="s920">I think I was one of the youngest ones in that group, but we were, you know, we did -- we learned about Zionism and about a little bit about our backgrounds and -- and we became very good friends and, in fact, we had a reunion a few -- about ten years -- about -- more than ten years ago.</span> <span id="s921">About almost 20 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: A reunion where?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: In Miami.</span></p> <p><span

eight or ten of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: That's nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: And we had all done well.</span> <span id="s930">We had all done really well in our lives, so that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: That's nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: That was good to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: Now that you bring up the Zionism again, I should ask, did your parents ever want to or try to go to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: No.</span> <span id="s935">They were -- but they were very Zionist.</span> <span id="s936">My father ended up being -- I don't think he was -- my uncle was the president of the Zionist organization in Quito, and shortly before I married I was the secretary.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s938">Did you ever think of going to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s940">In fact, I was planning to go.</span> <span id="s941">I was beginning to study Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: And I was all set to go to Israel and go to Kebut (ph) when I met (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: Yeah, those guys.</span> <span id="s945">They'll throw all your plans off.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: I met an American.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: How old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: I was 23 when I married.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s950">So wait.</span> <span id="s951">I don't want to skip too far ahead, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: That's --</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: First I want the love story, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: But I was planning to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s955">I was very much enthusiastic about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s957">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: And I've never been.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: You should go.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s964">Maybe wait for the

go.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: And I know I've been talking about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s970">Did you come to the 20th anniversary events?</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: But you came to the museum last month?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: I came after.</span> <span id="s974">No.</span> <span id="s975">I didn't think I should participate in this because, as I said, I hadn't --</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s977">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span

<p><span id="s991">A: -- in the trouble yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: So they could bring a lot with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: They were able to bring their money out at least, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: And so they had their own home?</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: And were all of those cousins, were those two cousins also involved in the Zionist group?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: No, they were not Jewish.</span> <span id="s998">They had been --</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: They had been baptized at birth.</span> <span id="s1001">I mean, they originally were Jews, but they had been -- they were not brought up as Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1003">So they didn't --</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1005">So they -- and we were close.</span> <span id="s1006">They were younger than we were and we -- and they had bought -- their father bought a big farm and we used to spend our vacation there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: Was it near Quito?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1009">Not too far.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: So your father even illegally started practicing medicine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: Did your mother work when you were in Ecuador?</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1015">They were able to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: No.</span> <span id="s1017">We did -- as I said, we were very, very lucky.</span> <span id="s1018">Our family did very well.</span> <span id="s1019">My father was loved by all his patients.</span> <span id="s1020">My aunt was an artist and she got really interested in the artist and folklore of Ecuador and she promoted Ecuador all around the world.</span> <span id="s1021">She -- the government of Ecuador, she decided to -- she would travel.</span> <span id="s1022">She had always been a world traveler and she traveled all over at Indian chiefs and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: And did it influence her art?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: It influenced her art very much, and she started designing rugs that were exported, and when the United Nations were founded, Ecuador donated a huge rug that had been made by -- designed by her and made in her shop.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: To the United Nations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: So I mean, the Fisch family name was very well known in Ecuador.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: And so as a newly turned nine-year-old, did you start school immediately or I guess it was summertime?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: It was summertime, so in October I started third grade in Quito.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: In Spanish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: In Spanish.</span> <span id="s1033">By then I had picked up a little bit of Spanish.</span> <span id="s1034">It wasn't as traumatic as coming to the states.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: Because I had made some friends and I had picked up some Spanish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: And what about your school there?</span> <span id="s1038">Were there a lot of other refugee children there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: There were several, yes.</span> <span id="s1040">And I was in a public school the first few years, and then when my parents got more money, I was sent to the American school where I relearned my English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: Did other refugees kids go to the American school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: Oh, yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s1043">In fact, all through my life I've been surrounded by Evas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: By Evas?</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: Eva was a very popular name in Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Austria and Germany.</span> <span id="s1046">And ViennA: My best friends -- I had three best friends and they were all called EvA:</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: Three Evas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: So there were four Evas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: The four Evas, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: And, in fact, the one friend was -- her parents and my parents went to this hiking club together and they were friends from before they got married, and we were -- and our mothers were pregnant at the same time and the other Eva was three months older than I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: Were all four Evas from Jewish families?</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: And were they able to escape as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1055">They all escaped -- this particular Eva came to the states and we renewed our friendship when we came to the states.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: Great.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: One went to -- and the other one went to New Zealand and the other one, I think they went to London, and her parents got divorced and her father ended up in South America in Utawi (ph) and I saw him once, but I didn't see the other two Evas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: Did she stay in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1062">We lost -- we lost contact with them, but Eva that came to the states, she died last year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: And we -- we renewed our friendship ended with like we had never been apart.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: That's so nice.</span> <span id="s1066">Where did she live in the states?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: She grew up in -- first they all arrived in New York, and then she was in Atlanta, but then she ended up in CaliforniA:</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: Not a bad place to end up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: And I visited her and she's visited me, and her husband and I were friends for -- I mean, we became friends when my husband was still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: That's so nice.</span> <span id="s1071">So you said through your life you've been surround by Evas.</span> <span id="s1072">Were there Evas in Ecuador, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: In Ecuador, the American school there were three Evas in my class, me and two others, and they both were from CzechoslovakiA: So, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: And there were other -- about -- oh, there were about -- through my school years I -- there were oh, always at least six or more refugee kids who --</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: And then the rest of the kids, were they international or were they Ecuadorian?</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: They were Ecuadorian.</span> <span id="s1078">One or two Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: -- whose fathers --</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: Diplomats' kids and things?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1084">And so is that the high school you graduated from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: Uh-huh, yes, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: And -- I mean, I don't want to skip anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: No, no, but, I mean -- no, we were very much involved in the Jewish life in Quito, much more so than we had in ViennA:</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: And so probably -- that probably was the first place you really started learning about your culture?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: Jewish culture?</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: In Quito?</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: Were there Ecuadorian Jews as well involved or was it all a refugee organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: There were no Ecuadorians.</span> <span id="s1096">I mean, we all became naturalized Ecuadorians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: At what age did you become naturalized?</span> <span id="s1098">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: I didn't -- I waited until I was 21 because my parents got naturalized while I was still in school, while I was still -- while I was like 14, but they didn't want to get us naturalized because my brother would have had to do military service.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: What an irony.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: And that was -- Ecuadorian Army life was not exactly what they wanted for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">A: So they waited until each one of us turned 21, and we each became citizens on our own.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1105">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: And I became an Ecuadorian citizen in 1951.</span> <span id="s1107">Then I married in 1953 and became an American citizen in 1956 because they waived the residency.</span> <span id="s1108">My husband worked for the U.S. government.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: So I didn't have to wait five years to become a citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: So you met him while he was on business --</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: He was working for the U.S. government in Ecuador in the same office where I was working as a secretary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s1114">I have to rewind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: That's way back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: So just back to your school years in Ecuador, did you -- did you mix with Ecuadorian kids too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1118">I had friends among the Ecuadorian kids, yes, very good friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: And what language did your family speak at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: At home we spoke German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: And in the neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: I spoke Spanish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: And at school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A: Spanish and English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: Spanish and English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: And when I went to the American school, but I had forgotten my English for the first few -- you know, I never had chance to practice until -- then I got it back when I went to the American school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: And I guess you hadn't studied it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: Or learned it as a kid learns in school or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: Well, I had learned to read and write.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: Uh-huh, but as far as grammar and all the crazy --</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: -- structures and things?</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1135">And then I really learned it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1137">And so you graduated from the American school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1139">And then I went -- I went to Chile and I went to secretarial school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1141">You needed to leave Quito to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: I didn't need to.</span> <span id="s1143">I -- my uncle came to visit us and he thought that I would have a better chance to meet a husband in Chile.</span> <span id="s1144">Which I didn't, but I was bailingwheel (ph) secretary.</span> <span id="s1145">I studied to be a bailingwheel secretary and I started working when I came back to Ecuador, and that's --</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: How long were you in Chile?</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: I was there two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">Q: And then back to Ecuador?</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q: And who did you work for in Ecuador?</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: I -- I worked for the -- what is now an agency for international affairs, but at that time it was the Inter-American Institute -- Institute Americano -- well, yeah, and their cultural section of the Inter-American Institute, the predecessor of AID.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: Sure, yeah.</span> <span id="s1153">And so actually I should ask before we get to 1951 or '53 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: -- I should ask, do you recall the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: Because you would have been 15 years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: Fifteen, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: Do you recall learning about the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: What do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: I remember -- oh, my father was the president of the free Austrian association or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: Free Austrian Movement, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: And the day that Vienna was liberated he was supposed to give a speech at that -- at their meeting and that was the day that Roosevelt died, Franklin Delano Roosevelt died.</span> <span id="s1165">And I remember he was in the shower getting ready for his -- to go to that meeting and I was listening to the radio and I heard that Franklin Roosevelt had died, and I banged on the bathroom door and told him.</span> <span id="s1166">I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: Did he go forward with his meeting?</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1169">And he made -- you know, but he changed his speech.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1171">This is maybe not a question for a childhood memory, so I understand if you don't --</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: But in some of the more -- how do I say this?</span> <span id="s1174">Some Austrian Jews who fled in earlier time and who were active politically in these different ways had different ways of viewing what had happened to AustriA: Do you recall -- not now.</span> <span id="s1175">We know now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: But at that time do you think that your family viewed it as an invasion in occupation by --</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: -- by Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: Yeah?</span> <span id="s1182">And do you think they really blamed Germany --</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: -- for what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: Do you remember discussions about that and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: Not specifically.</span> <span id="s1188">Well, as I said, my father was very active with the free Austrian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: There were -- and there were mostly Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1192">I know that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: But he was -- I mean, among his

with the Free Austrian Movement in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1205">Well, I'm sure that they were much more active.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: They were bigger and stronger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: In a sense geographically closer to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: There weren't that many Austrians

was very -- was pushing the idea of -- at least if it's the same organization, to some extent it was pushing the idea that Austria was the first victim of the Nazis and the first victim of Germany, and they wanted that recognition with the allies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: Yeah, I guess so -- I don't know.</span> <span id="s1215">It's hard to tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: Another thing that happened, I mean, after -- this happened, actually, just before my father died.</span> <span id="s1218">He was approached by Israel that they wanted to name him Honorary Council in Quito.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: Because he had been very active in the Zionist movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: But the appointment arrived after he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: Oh, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: He died of a heart attack.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s1226">How old was he when he died?</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: He was one month before his 61st birthday.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: Much too young.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: That's interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: So, I mean, he was -- he was quite a well-known person and very active.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: And so at the end of the war when you learned that -- so you learned that Roosevelt died and then you learned that the war, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: Ultimately the war ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: Well, at least Vienna had been liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1237">And did you -- did your family ever consider returning?</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: Not a question?</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: No, they didn't.</span> <span id="s1241">No.</span> <span id="s1242">They -- they were -- they were doing very well in Ecuador.</span> <span id="s1243">There was no -- they didn't want to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: And you?</span> <span id="s1245">Did you ever think of returning?</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A: No.</span> <span id="s1247">And when I went back the two times I went back, I felt like an outsider.</span> <span id="s1248">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: You didn't have any feeling of home or nostalgia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: I recognized certain things and, you know, but I wouldn't want to live there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: No.</span> <span id="s1253">Well, right now I'm happy in the states and I have my family here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: And so had Ecuador become -- Quito had become home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: Quito had become home very much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: And so not only did your family not consider returning to Austria, but they wanted to stay put?</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: They wanted to stay put, and as I said, I wanted to go to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: After the war, most of the young people of my generation, the ones that were a little bit older than I was, they all wanted to come to the states, and I didn't want to go to the states.</span> <span id="s1260">I went to Chile to go to school, and then I went back to Ecuador and then I was -- my idea was to go to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: And you said you were planning that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: I was very serious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: Studying Hebrew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: I was very seriously considering it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: I hadn't made any specific plans yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: I met somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1270">Happens to the best of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: I met somebody and he changed my life completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1273">How did you meet your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: At work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: Oh, that's right, yeah.</span> <span id="s1276">So you were working in the office that he came --</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1278">I was the secretary of his boss.</span> <span id="s1279">I was a bilingual secretary and he -- he was a flad (ph) pathologist and he was working in an experiment station in the jungle, and he came up to Quito and -- oh, and he came up to Quito and he stayed with friends of mine at one of the guys who was working there, an American.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: And he was sick, and so this guy said you should go see Eva's father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: And he did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: And he did and he would see my father in the morning and then date me in the evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: How did your father feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: Well, he didn't think much of it but he was there for -- and the day before when he was cured and he was going to go back to the jungle he asked me to marry him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: Wow?</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A: It was a very quick --</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1289">How long between meeting and engagement?</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: Well, I met on Christmas Eve and -- but he went back to the station then he came to Quito like on the 15th of January and we got engaged on the 27th of January.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s1292">And so what did your parents think -- so he was non-Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">A: He was non-Jew, and he was quite a bit older than I am, and he -- he asked me to marry him and I got home and I -- my parents were in bed and I told them.</span> <span id="s1294">I said Russ just asked me to marry him, and I was thinking they're going to say he's too old, he's not Jewish, we don't know him; and my father jumped out of bed, I'll never forget and said, you can't marry him; and I said why not?</span> <span id="s1295">And I was ready to throw my argument.</span> <span id="s1296">I sent him a bill and he already paid it.</span> <span id="s1297">How can I -- what do I do now?</span> <span id="s1298">He's going to be my son-in-law.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: Oh, that's sweet.</span> <span id="s1300">That's sweet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: So -- then we had to wait to get married because I had to get clearance from the U.S. government to marry a foreign service officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1303">And was he stationed in Ecuador for a period of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: He had been there several years and he had gone back to the states to get his Ph.D. and I met him when he came back from -- from that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: I didn't know him when he first -- when he had been there for -- he was there for nine years in total.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: And so you lived together -- you got married in Ecuador in Quito?</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1309">Yes we got married in Quito.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: And was that a special -- did you do a special kind of ceremony or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A: We got a civil ceremony, but it was -- it was at my aunt's.</span> <span id="s1312">She had a big store which it was very well known, and she emptied the shelves of the store and all the wedding presents were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: How nice?</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: And -- we had quite a reception.</span> <span id="s1315">There was a sitting president, the ambassador, the U.S. ambassador, several other dignitaries were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: It was mostly patients of my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: Like you said, you were very involved in the community.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: We were very much involved and we -- I always said if I ever write my life story, I'm going to call it lemonade.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: If life gives you lemons, you make lemonade.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: Sounds like you made some really good lemonade.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: We made some very good lemonade, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">Q: It really sounds like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A: No.</span> <span id="s1326">I was very, very fortunate.</span> <span id="s1327">I had a happy life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1329">How long did you and your husband live in Ecuador then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: We stayed another two years.</span> <span id="s1331">No, longer.</span> <span id="s1332">We got married in '54.</span> <span id="s1333">We left in '58.</span> <span id="s1334">Four years, and then we went to Costa Rica and lived there for ten years, then we went to Brazil.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: What an adventurous life.</span> <span id="s1336">How nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A: Then we went back to Ecuador and then we came to the states in 1972.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1339">And when you say to the states, to which --</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: To Washington -- I mean to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1343">He came to here and then he retired from AID.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: Was he from this area?</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: He was from Rhode Island.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1349">So these different moves --</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: But he was working for the predecessor organizations of the -- I mean, we underwent -- at the time we got married, we were going from -- they renamed the agency and it came under the state department instead of being under the department of agriculture which had been before.</span> <span id="s1351">That's why we had to wait until I got cleared to marry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">A: We had -- well, we got married in April, so it wasn't that long a wait.</span> <span id="s1354">He was down there in the jungle and I was in Quito.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: And did you continue working as a secretary in that office?</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">A: Until I got married, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: But I also did a lot of translating for my boss, and I'm now a professional interpreter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: In Spanish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1362">Spanish/English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1365">And did you have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: I have four children.</span></p> <p><span

good lemonade.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">Q: So when were your children born and where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A: My oldest son was born in Quito, but we were living on the -- at the experiment station, but I went up to Quito.</span> <span id="s1374">My father was still alive and Jimmy was born in Quito and my father died six weeks after that.</span> <span id="s1375">And my Mary Ellen, my daughter was born in Guayaquil where we had moved to after two years in the jungle.</span> <span id="s1376">We moved to the coastal city.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: And then I was seven months pregnant when we moved to Costa Rica, and I had twins.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: Wow.</span></p>

childhood years were spent --</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">A: Were in -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: And then after --</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">A: In fact, the funny thing is my twins were born on the fourth of July.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: And I had a cesarean, and we had just arrived two months before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">A: And we didn't know -- have too many friends, but I needed a blood transfusion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: And they didn't have a blood bank in Costa Rica at that time, so my husband called the picnic at the American embassy and told (inaudible) somebody to donate blood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">Q: And they got someone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">A: They got -- his boss came with some other people who -- they didn't -- I didn't know what my blood type was, so they had to take my blood type, and his boss happened to be my blood type.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s1398">What a nice gift.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: He told me that we should give him one of the twins as a payment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">Q: That is really --</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A: The 4th of July, for many years my kids thought their birthday party was given by their Uncle Sam.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1403">And all those fireworks were for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: Well, they didn't have fireworks, but they had a big picnic and we had Uncle Sam and he would always walk with them until they were about five or six by then after that they didn't anymore, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q: So what kind of school did your children attend?</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">A: They went to an American school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: To an American school?</span></p> <p><span

then he retired and then he died 17 years ago on June 8th, two days before my birthday.</span> <span id="s1424">June 8th has been a big date in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: How strange, yeah.</span> <span id="s1426">And so when you returned to the U.S. -- well, when you came and he returned --</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: -- it was to

id="s1435">A: No.</span> <span id="s1436">My father died in Ecuador, and then my mother came to the states.</span> <span id="s1437">By then I was an American citizen and I could sponsor her, although I wasn't living there, here.</span> <span id="s1438">When she went and lived with her sister who was in New York.</span> <span id="s1439">She had a sister who lived in New York who came about the same time that we -- when -- towards the end of our stay in New York in the '30s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1441">So she went and joined her?</span></p> <p><span

So I might become a great, great grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">Q: You could.</span> <span id="s1488">That's the way to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1490">I had three instant grandchildren, but then I've had seven new others.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">Q: That's wonderful.</span> <span id="s1492">With all of these moves that you made over your life from place to place and especially after really sort of rediscovering or discovering your Zionist feelings and getting into the Zionist activity --</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: Well, yeah, but then when I married --</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: -- that ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Q: That kind of ended.</span> <span id="s1497">Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">A: And now, now that I'm a widow, I have made -- sort of reconnected with the Jewish community here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">A: But not -- I don't belong to any temple or anything like that, but I have a lot of -- I joined the hadasa (ph) and I joined the benabiast (ph) for a while.</span> <span id="s1501">I've been sort of trying to reconnect.</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1503">To find your place in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">Q: Certainly lots of different ways to engage with the Jewish communities.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">Q: So you can find --</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">Q: Well, through all of these moves, at whatever level of identification you were with your religion or culture?</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q: Did you experience discrimination after Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: Yes, in Ecuador.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: There was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1515">Again, they would make an exception with my father and they tried to, you know, to -- but there was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">Q: Was that with Ecuadorians or with those Germans that you said?</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">A: Well, the Germans, we didn't really become really good friends, but, no, the Ecuadorians, there was -- a lot of ignorance about what Jews were.</span> <span id="s1518">I remember once one of my classmates asked me to take my shoes off to see if I had cloven feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s1520">How do you respond -- how does someone respond to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">A: I couldn't understand why she wanted me to show her my feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">A: And I know that like they didn't allow Jews in the tennis club and country club, but they kept telling my father he could join if he wanted, and he said I'm not going to be a token Jew.</span> <span id="s1524">So I never learned to play golf or tennis.</span> <span id="s1525">So there was -- wasn't -- we didn't -- as I said, my father was accepted but he always made a point of saying that he was Jewish and -- and I've always said I'm Jewish, and I moved, you know, with my husband.</span> <span id="s1526">We were involved with the embassies and things, and I have never -- I've never denied my Jewishness, but I haven't publicized it for a while where as now I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1528">Well, I think that's one of the nice things about Judaism.</span> <span id="s1529">There's a -- it's flexible and people move in and out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">A: And, I mean, my oldest son is married to a very devout Catholic and he became a Catholic, and so all my -- most of my great grandchildren -- I mean, in that part of the family and they have the most kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">A: Are Catholic and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">Q: What about these Germans that your dad was treating in Ecuador?</span> <span id="s1534">You said they were Nazis or Nazi sympathizers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1536">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">Q: What were they doing in Ecuador?</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">A: I think espionage, but I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s1539">I know that they had an airline that was traveling into Ecuador and -- and some of them actually, during the war, were sent to the states to camp, you know, to whatever kind of camps they had for the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">Q: Like POW camp or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">A: No, not -- it wasn't like that, but it was some sort of -- not as bad as the Japanese.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">Q: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">A: But they did have something, and I know that one of the girls whom I had met a little bit and then she went to the states and was hired in the same office where I was working with the AID because her English was much better than mine because she had lived in the states.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">Q: Yeah, but she lived in the states for that reason, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1546">But this was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">A: -- in the '40s and '50s, late, '40s and early '50s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">Q: And do you -- you said that they went to your father as a doctor.</span> <span id="s1550">Do you think that they were -- there were people who didn't pay attention to the race -- I say that in quotation marks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">Q: This crazy race stuff or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">A: Well, they just figured he was a good doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1555">They were just --</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">A: And he was better than the doctors they could go to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">Q: So a Jew from Vienna is better than a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">A: My father died it was really -- his funeral was really incredible because the new German ambassador had just presented his credentials and he came to the funeral in his, you know, very elegant to my father's funeral.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q: That's strange.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">A: And we had -- it was a Jewish funeral.</span> <span id="s1561">That was -- by then it was 1955.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1563">Had he had a relationship with --</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">Q: The --</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">Q: Was he one of his patients too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1571">He had a lot of people that were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Q: You mentioned before that you had been back to Vienna twice?</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">Q: Once with your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">A: With my husband, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">Q: And once with your daughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">A: One of my daughters.</span> <span id="s1578">One of my daughters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">Q: So when was the first time you returned?</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">A: 19 -- it was about 199 -- maybe '94, '95.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1582">And you said you recalled not feeling welcome?</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">A: No.</span> <span id="s1584">It was -- it was a little bit earlier than -- in the '90s, maybe 1990, '91.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">Q: And you recall -- how did you say it?</span> <span id="s1586">You said you didn't -- you felt like an outsider?</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">A: I felt like an outsider.</span> <span id="s1588">I remember it was very interesting.</span> <span id="s1589">I was -- we had a our ______ pass and we had been Salzburg and/or near Salzburg and we were on the train and a guy came and sat with us, and I started talking to him in German and this was when what's his name was the president of AustriA:</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">Q: Oh, Waldheim.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">A: Waldheim.</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: Oh, gosh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1594">And it was really funny because we were talking in German and my husband was very interested in all these old castles and things on the way, and so he kept asking what's that and the guy said this is Angs Schlossel (ph).</span> <span id="s1595">It's a castle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1598">Just -- and of course my husband didn't speak German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A: And I was talking to this man and as -- and, you know, and I was asking silly questions and like is this the Danube, is this the Vienna vault (ph) _________ and he said why do you ask.</span> <span id="s1601">I said, well, I was born here but I left when I was a little girl.</span> <span id="s1602">So he realized why I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">A: And he said we would never have elected Waldheim if the United States hadn't made such a stink about it.</span> <span id="s1605">I don't know if that's true, but that's what he told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1607">I think that attitude, and there's a suttle antisemitism there too because --</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">Q: United States, run by Jews, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">Q: And that seemed to have been the sentiment, if it weren't for those --</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">Q: -- Jews raising trouble, we would have --</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">A: So that was his -- and then it was funny because he said, but you speak like a native; and I said, well, I am a native.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">A: And by then I had been in Austria for maybe two weeks already, picked up -- picked it up again, but I haven't really spoken it in the last 50 some years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1620">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">A: That was, as I said, I think it was in the early '90s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q: Did you feel more comfortable just sort of as a tourist in Salzburg sort of revisiting Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">A: We went to different places.</span> <span id="s1624">In fact, we spent about a week in a little -- we had one of those exchange programs that we could stay for free in a hotel somewhere on the line near Salzburg.</span> <span id="s1625">I don't remember what it was called, and we would take day trips on the ural (ph) pass to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">A: We went to Salzburg, we went to Innsbruck, we went to different places and stayed at the hotel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">A: And then we took the train to ViennA: And we stayed another week or so, but we were definitely tourists --</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">A: -- in those days, but then in Vienna I -- we -- I looked at a street map and figured out how to get to see my -- the place where I used to live on Wolksenfeld.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">A: And I found it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">A: And I went there and found the place and looked from the outside, it looked just like I remembered it.</span> <span id="s1636">It was really funny and we -- and we went up to the third floor and I stood in front of that door and I was -- and I couldn't ring that bell, and he said -- and Russ told me, ring the damn bell.</span> <span id="s1637">And I just -- I was petrified.</span> <span id="s1638">I just couldn't.</span> <span id="s1639">And finally said let's go.</span> <span id="s1640">And then I went back with my daughter and I still couldn't do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">A: So I never went in.</span> <span id="s1643">But I found it both times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">A: And, you know, and I remember I was -- whenever I saw somebody in that -- when we were near there I would see people who were -- who looked older than I am and I say do you remember -- I wanted to see if anybody remembered my father, but I never met anybody that old, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">Q: Or maybe they realized and they didn't want to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">A: No.</span> <span id="s1648">I mean, I never -- no.</span> <span id="s1649">I would just ask.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">A: I didn't come out and ask them.</span> <span id="s1652">I would just say have you lived here long and they said no, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1654">But when you went there with your finger at the bell, you did intend to ring the bell but you just couldn't bring yourself to do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1656">I just couldn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">Q: Do you want to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">A: No.</span> <span id="s1659">Not anymore.</span> <span id="s1660">No.</span> <span id="s1661">I mean, now that's past now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">Q: You've had such a rich and interesting life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">A: I've had a wonderful life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1665">And I'm sorry about how it started, but the rest of it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">A: I made lemonade.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">Q: You made some really great lemonade.</span> <span id="s1668">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1669">You really did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">A: I'm trying to see if there's anything I forgot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">Q: Do you think that -- well, I have one more.</span> <span id="s1672">Do you think that your experiences affected the way you raised your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">A: Probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">Q: Did they -- did they ask you about it?</span> <span id="s1677">Did you talk about it with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1679">I've told them my story.</span> <span id="s1680">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1682">And of the four, are any of them religious or Jewish identifying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">A: Michelle, the daughter that I went to Austria with is probably the most -- they all -- they all know that they have a Jewish mother.</span> <span id="s1684">I mean, that's definitely, and they haven't really joined any religion except for Jim.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">Q: With his wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">Q: Did you ever have contact with -- maybe your young friends in Vienna were Jewish too, but you mentioned sleeping at a friend's house the night before you left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">A: That was this Eva that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: So you did reconnect with her and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1691">That has been a beautiful experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1693">How did you find her again or you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">A: Our mothers -- our parents kept correspondence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">A: They corresponded with each other and so -- and I know that about Eva and she knew about me, and so when I came to the states, I told her I was here and she had married -- she married a black guy who was a Tuskegee air man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s1698">And you said in Atlanta, in the south?</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">A: They didn't marry in the south.</span> <span id="s1700">She met him in -- when she moved to CaliforniA:</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">A: And he's -- he just oh, gosh, he just died also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">Q: Oh, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">A: Everybody's dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">A: But he was just a lovely person, and we had a great, great relationship with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">Q: That was the couple you and your husband became friends with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1709">And when Russ died, they called me every week to make sure that I was all right and things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">Q: That's so nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">A: And I've gone and spent some time with them and we were going to -- several times we were planning to go on a vacation together and never materialized.</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1713">That's really nice to reconnect.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">A: Yes, but it was -- they're both dead now.</span> <span id="s1715">Yeah, unfortunately most of my friends and relatives are -- except my -- the next generation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1717">That's got to be hard.</span> <span id="s1718">A hard part about --</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1720">About growing old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">Q: Growing old, yeah.</span> <span id="s1722">You want to keep your body healthy and strong but then --</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">A: It was so funny because my husband was 14 years older than I am, so I was always the youngest in our friends.</span> <span id="s1724">Now I'm -- all of the sudden I'm the oldest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s1726">Did you ever have any contact with non-Jewish Austrians or did -- any old friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">A: I've met some, but never -- I mean, I've gone to the Austrian embassy, some functions there and but not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">Q: Did you or your family ever -- was there even the responsibility to apply for any reparations or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">A: I'm getting Social Security from AustriA:</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">Q: Good.</span> <span id="s1731">Good.</span> <span id="s1732">That's --</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1734">I got --</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q: You should get everything that you can.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1737">I'm getting -- no.</span> <span id="s1738">That was so funny because there was some -- an article in the paper, oh, gosh, about 20 years ago that Austria was making some kind of reparation for people who had to leave before their -- and they had to be 15 by the day Austria was liberated, and I missed that deadline by about a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">A: I was one week too young to get that.</span> <span id="s1741">So one day I was going to the Austrian consulate, I don't remember what for, and I told the woman, you know, I heard that they're doing this but I'm one month or two weeks two young, and she said but you can apply the next year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">A: And so I applied and I have been getting 300 whatever a month and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">Q: Every little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">A: And it's in a bank in Vienna, and every once in a while they send me some money here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">Q: That's good that you get something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">A: And I put it in my will that my kids will get whatever's left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">Q: And was there any property that your family lost at that time or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">A: We didn't own the property.</span> <span id="s1750">It was state owned because, as I said, it was provided by the -- they had nationalized medicine there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">A: So.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">Q: So it wasn't a -- you didn't own anything else or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">A: They didn't -- we had a car.</span> <span id="s1755">Again, Bill, at the museum found.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">Q: Bill Connelly, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1758">There was -- it says somewhere that my father was supposed to get some kind of -- but it was like a thousand shilling or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">Q: Something for the car or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">A: I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">Q: Yeah.</span></p>
