<span id="s87">Were the Jewish already and they was talking about the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s88">We didn't know what Ghetto means.</span> <span id="s89">And we lived between Christian people...it was all together before.</span> <span id="s90">I had Christian friends.</span> <span id="s91">I had Christian students.</span> <span id="s92">We went together and uh everything was normal.</span> <span id="s93">My father paid the taxes and uh he buy a piece of land and worked very hard.</span> <span id="s94">I didn't know what happened.</span> <span id="s95">Then he stopped working.</span> <span id="s96">But the Russians...you couldn't work either, and he was uh a rich man by the Russians so he can work.</span> <span id="s97">so...</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: And you took the bus back to your home town?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Back to my home town.</span> <span id="s100">But but the Russia lie too, and so I..</span> <span id="s101">.</span> <span id="s102">my father was a wood cutter, not a farmer, so anyway I went home.</span> <span id="s103">I went home.</span> <span id="s104">I came home.</span> <span id="s105">Oh my mother was crying, kissing me.</span> <span id="s106">They said she don't understand why I came home.</span> <span id="s107">It's all old people.</span> <span id="s108">All the young people are running away, to Russia.</span> <span id="s109">Some of them went to Romania.</span> <span id="s110">They want to, you know, save themselves, but I said well, I came home.</span> <span id="s111">I was home about two, three weeks.</span> <span id="s112">Happy go-lucky.</span> <span id="s113">I put my uh hair in the curls.</span> <span id="s114">I was like a really teenager.</span> <span id="s115">Was very happy home.</span> <span id="s116">I knew all the people so we all...we were thinking that the Germans would be the same as Russia.</span> <span id="s117">They will let us work and do, you know, do...let us live, so what's happen when the Germans...one day they came to the community center and said we do...everybody go to the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s118">All the people.</span> <span id="s119">All the Jewish people and register to the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s120">We were lucky.</span> <span id="s121">Our house was standing in the Ghetto, so we didn't have to move, so all our family who lived scattered around the town, moved into our house.</span> <span id="s122">There was eighteen people in that bungalow of three rooms and one kitchen.</span> <span id="s123">No...the room was two, three and two.</span> <span id="s124">In Europe, you know, when you have two children, three rooms had one daughter and three of the other daughters, so later on they all leave.</span> <span id="s125">My father's two children marry and all together.</span> <span id="s126">This was his plan.</span> <span id="s127">Well, the Ghetto opened up...further they they put wooden...with wood they hammer the windows in the front.</span> <span id="s128">We couldn't go in the front.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Only in the back.</span> <span id="s130">School was out.</span> <span id="s131">Shopping in the store were from...were from ten to twelve, only shopping, what we needed and we were lucky.</span> <span id="s132">My mother had...we had, you know, corn and beet and potatoes, everything at home, so later on I..</span> <span id="s133">.</span> <span id="s134">one day I was cleaning.</span> <span id="s135">It was my time to clean.</span> <span id="s136">Then every week somebody else cleaned, and this were my week to clean.</span> <span id="s137">I was cleaning and then I hear some shots outside.</span> <span id="s138">I didn't know what.</span> <span id="s139">We came out.</span> <span id="s140">It was day time.</span> <span id="s141">They kill hundred and fifty people.</span> <span id="s142">Who was on the street they killed.</span> <span id="s143">Who was running...who was...they all killed.</span> <span id="s144">How many It was May the 3rd.</span> <span id="s145">I remember very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">So the next day everybody must help to clear out the dead, on the street.</span> <span id="s147">But my father and my, you know, the cousins, the men...in the house was nine men...and all of them uh picked them up in the streets.</span> <span id="s148">In the Jewish religion when you don't uh die of natural causes, you are not buried in the cemetery.</span> <span id="s149">You are buried in the in the side of the cemetery, so they make a big hole, a very big hole.</span> <span id="s150">There was a hundred and fifty people together in that hole.</span> <span id="s151">We went home.</span> <span id="s152">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s153">The night was beautiful, and I said God, where are you?</span> <span id="s154">I was thinking and looking up...I said oh God.</span> <span id="s155">What nice living could be.</span> <span id="s156">Why

citizens.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">We don't know why.</span> <span id="s162">Anyway, then was talking there will be aktion again because they were afraid, the people.</span> <span id="s163">The the men, the nine men start to dig a hole in the uh...not in the living room...in the bedroom, a hole.</span> <span id="s164">A big hole under the bed, so we can go in hiding under the bed.</span> <span id="s165">They finished the hole.</span> <span id="s166">Later on we saw our uh wood was...the the floor was the rest painted, so the paint came out and we was afraid maybe the German would see.</span> <span id="s167">Ah... the Juden.</span> <span id="s168">the Jew.</span> <span id="s169">Then they decided they will go in the store where the chicken koop, under the chicken koop.</span> <span id="s170">They open a big hole and they put the chicken, you know, on the big hole.</span> <span id="s171">They they cover up the hole with straw, nothing else, and they figure out.</span> <span id="s172">It was two o'clock at night they did this.</span> <span id="s173">Two o'clock.</span> <span id="s174">They carried the the the, you know, the sand and the the dirt all on the back yard, and they were for nothing.</span> <span id="s175">And we'll cover our back in the bedroom and we went again in the stall.</span> <span id="s176">In the stall we went...it was on a Tuesday...I remember very well...all of a sudden they say the German are here.</span> <span id="s177">The German are here.</span> <span id="s178">And we didn't know what's happen.</span> <span id="s179">We right away

here.</span> <span id="s183">We run away.</span> <span id="s184">So we spent from nine o'clock till five o'clock in the in the dark and one neighbor's daughter came.</span> <span id="s185">It was too late to take them in and she was...didn't...couldn't go into hiding.</span> <span id="s186">It was too late.</span> <span id="s187">We closed the the the hiding place, so she got killed from the from

or his mother...I don't know...I was afraid to do this.</span> <span id="s323">I could saved even my parents.</span> <span id="s324">Sometimes I think about it.</span> <span id="s325">Why not?</span> <span id="s326">was...my feeling, my upbringing .</span> <span id="s327">I couldn't do this.</span> <span id="s328">I didn't let him touch me even, touch me.</span> <span id="s329">Then I said I have a boyfriend, and he right away backed up.</span> <span id="s330">He was very...oh...he was looking like Robert Taylor (ph)...not in the mood.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: Then, all these girls, all one day all the Jews who lived all must come out again, on the same place, to the same time, go everybody in the same to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s333">We were afraid the Germans, but some Jews will live in small towns.</span> <span id="s334">Said everybody must go, so I was thinking maybe not to go.</span> <span id="s335">I don't know what to do...to go or not to go.</span> <span id="s336">So I started to think maybe I can...two or three days later I can prolong it.</span> <span id="s337">Maybe, maybe I can find something or maybe hide myself again, so at night came.</span> <span id="s338">I came to a to an older lady, and she said, It's night now.</span> <span id="s339">If you came in, and you can sleep over.</span> <span id="s340">I had a house, but couldn't go into the house.</span> <span id="s341">The parents were off in the ghetto, so I'm there, and I was just roaming around thinking maybe I could save myself.</span> <span id="s342">But when I was sleeping over...oh it was Easter time.</span> <span id="s343">I see people go to church.</span> <span id="s344">Oh, it was so beautiful...it was end of April, and what the sun was shining.</span> <span id="s345">Everybody's so nice so when I saw the people I was afraid.</span> <span id="s346">I went in a stall and hide myself where the horse, under the horse, you know, where the horse feeds.</span> <span id="s347">I hide myself till the people go back home so I can go again, see again, run again.</span> <span id="s348">I run again.</span> <span id="s349">I was...I was thinking I can go to my house and pick up some pictures, pick up something.</span> <span id="s350">I will think if I'll go to the back door...I'll go in the back door.</span> <span id="s351">A boy from twelve years had a bat in his hand, a stick.</span> <span id="s352">He hit me so fast.</span> <span id="s353">His mother would stay in the window and laughing, and he hit me so hard...it was...and I didn't have shoes.</span> <span id="s354">I was running barefoot and was .</span> <span id="s355">I was running, running good.</span> <span id="s356">I couldn't run right away.</span> <span id="s357">He didn't succeeded to hit me so much, so I was running.</span> <span id="s358">I say it's enough, to me, myself.</span> <span id="s359">I go to the to the center, and say take me to the biggest ghetto .</span> <span id="s360">You know, I went...I remember a horse and buggy and a man, the policeman, he went on a horse.</span> <span id="s361">He said oh, you shouldn't be worried.</span> <span id="s362">You are a young girl.</span> <span id="s363">You will save yourself.</span> <span id="s364">It happened to me the same thing in the war, he said, the 1st World War.</span> <span id="s365">You know, the serfs were He was running too.</span> <span id="s366">I don't know what he was running.</span> <span id="s367">You'll be safe.</span> <span id="s368">You will see.</span> <span id="s369">I say how can I be safe when I go with you on the big .</span> <span id="s370">You'll be safe.</span> <span id="s371">You will see.</span> <span id="s372">I came to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s373">I didn't saw my mother anymore.</span> <span id="s374">I didn't saw my father anymore.</span> <span id="s375">I was alone again.</span> <span id="s376">I went and I had a room, not a room.</span> <span id="s377">I sleep over in a in the room, so they next day, they say well, everybody, all the Jews must come and register to go to train, to go work, to work.</span> <span id="s378">I was happy to go to work and I will make some money.</span> <span id="s379">I didn't realize what work...we didn't have no papers.</span> <span id="s380">We

id="s386">And then I see in the corner?</span> <span id="s387">I see my friends from college, two girls, and I sit near them.</span> <span id="s388">Then a man came in and said I go with you, with all the girls.</span> <span id="s389">I go with you .</span></p> <p><span id="s390">He was only thirteen years old, and I saw my cousin over there, and she said oh, oh, she said, no food she says.</span> <span id="s391">I'm glad.</span> <span id="s392">I envy your mother what she went through with the vegetables, but she didn't...she's not here, and the next day they...the wagon came.</span> <span

piece of wood, the SS, and they count.</span> <span id="s395">They count everybody...one, two, three, four, everybody in the wagon.</span> <span id="s396">We came in the wagon.</span> <span

so I put on his shoes and he took my boots and in the train and they count out seventy.</span> <span id="s406">It was a beautiful day, and I say oh God, And I say will I live?</span> <span id="s407">Why, why?</span> <span id="s408">I couldn't imagine What would be it I couldn't imagine.</span> <span id="s409">The older people in a couple hours, pass out already.</span> <span

little air.</span> <span id="s414">Was night and everybody was and all the time was hitting people and other one would say well I was in the corner with three students, and was one day passed by.</span> <span id="s415">We didn't have nothing to to eat.</span> <span id="s416">The second day passed by.</span> <span id="s417">How long can you, so what we did, had our urine.</span> <span

Jewish people in the movie.</span> <span id="s969">They caught a Jewish girl, and everybody went out from the movie, and all standing outside, and I went with my cleaning and I go up and went, you know...I was walking home to Mrs. Niederman.</span> <span id="s970">I came home.</span> <span id="s971">I just fell apart.</span> <span id="s972">I was crying so much.</span> <span id="s973">I was

pass...passports.</span> <span id="s985">I didn't work long and for two, three months and I was afraid.</span> <span id="s986">And these people came from the Ukraine, and they came here to Radom, and they came on the police, and I was afraid somebody would recognize me.</span> <span id="s987">In the meantime in the police, I met a a girl from Black Forest and she was married and her husband born in the United States.</span> <span id="s988">He was a prison...in prison and he was working on the on the on the farm.</span> <span id="s989">The American soldiers took them in prison on the war, so we became very good friends.</span> <span id="s990">Listen, she says, Francisca, you know, I'm taking an apartment and I want you to go with me.</span> <span id="s991">Do you want?</span> <span id="s992">I said, yes, I will speak to my best friend where I live now, Mrs. Niederman.</span> <span id="s993">I came home.</span> <span id="s994">I asked her, and she says my dear, be very, very careful, and if somebody, somebody approaches never never tell where you are, who gave you the papers, who , who took you...never.</span> <span id="s995">One word...she said don't mention it.</span> <span id="s996">And she was a secretary in the SS .</span> <span id="s997">She was, on one side.</span> <span id="s998">.</span> <span id="s999">she was with them and one side she was with the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: Did your aunt pay Mrs. Niederman any money to help you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: I don't think so, you know.</span> <span id="s1002">I don't think so.</span> <span id="s1003">I don't know, you know.</span> <span id="s1004">I don't...maybe she did and maybe she didn't...I don't know.</span> <span id="s1005">Could be.</span> <span id="s1006">Could be not.</span> <span id="s1007">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1008">And then my aunt always prayed, once my only one paper in the family, one , you know, and she will be sure I am saved.</span> <span id="s1009">So I working for the police and I was living with a girl and I had a good time too...was living in a nice, beautiful apartment, not between the Germans, between everybody.</span> <span id="s1010">Downstairs was a dress shop.</span> <span id="s1011">Over night the dress shop is not here, and they said what's happened.</span> <span id="s1012">And they said well, the Jewish girl had a dress shop.</span> <span id="s1013">A Jewish girl had a dress shop, and the police came, pick her up.</span> <span id="s1014">She disappeared.</span> <span id="s1015">She a dress shop and she disappeared, so after a to the police, I say well, I'm looking for another job.</span> <span id="s1016">I want something better.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: Before we go on, let's...you need to describe more about your experience working for the police....who you worked for...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: No.</span> <span id="s1019">I worked for...I don't remember...the captain or something.</span> <span id="s1020">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1021">Q: What exactly did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: I do passports.</span> <span id="s1023">I assigned passports.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: When you talk say I worked for the police...</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: I worked for the police assigning passports, in this office.</span> <span id="s1026">That's all I did, and I met up a girl, German Even the pictures, you see, I and the Germans.</span> <span id="s1027">They were nice friends to me.</span> <span id="s1028">They didn't know who you are, who I was, but they was uh nice people to me, and uh I didn't work long.</span> <span id="s1029">The reason I didn't work long...three, four months...the reason I didn't work long is when the people came in from the Ukraine, from all over, and I was afraid somebody would recognize me, so I stopped working.</span> <span id="s1030">I just did another job.</span> <span id="s1031">I wanted more money to make.</span> <span id="s1032">I didn't make too much money.</span> <span id="s1033">So this was the reason I left the job.</span> <span id="s1034">I don't remember what the captain's name was, but he told me I go to Germany and marry a nice German boy.</span> <span id="s1035">I said yes.</span> <span id="s1036">That's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: Did he think you were a good worker?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1039">Yes, of course.</span> <span id="s1040">I think is the reason why I got a letter from Hitler.</span> <span id="s1041">Q: Tell us about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: The end...I finished this job.</span> <span id="s1043">I went on another job, to...for...I worked for a for a company like a , only for Germans, and in the meantime Mrs. Niederman came back again and she told me she will make uh do application for me to be German.</span> <span id="s1044">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1045">I must...a German...I must be German, to go to Germany.</span> <span id="s1046">She want me to Germany and the Russian was beginning '43 and the Russian was coming.</span> <span id="s1047">She was afraid, and those the reasons I was working later on in two firms.</span> <span id="s1048">was a Vienna firm, and I was working.</span> <span id="s1049">I was there uh .</span> <span id="s1050">And one day the manager saw me in cafe eating lunch.</span> <span id="s1051">He said I think you are Jewish, look Jewish.</span> <span id="s1052">And what I did, when he told me this, can you imagine how I feel.</span> <span id="s1053">I couldn't eat.</span> <span id="s1054">I couldn't sleep at night, and uh I lived already by myself.</span> <span id="s1055">I couldn't tell Mrs. Niederman.</span> <span id="s1056">I couldn't run to her every minute, so what I did I went home and I told the manager to give me another job, and they had another job in down under the , like suburbia, and I took this job, with seventy people and nobody bothered me.</span> <span id="s1057">Nobody .</span> <span id="s1058">I was there.</span> <span id="s1059">I was working and in the meantime I..</span> <span id="s1060">.</span> <span id="s1061">I don't know what's happened.</span> <span id="s1062">I didn't fight with my roommate.</span> <span id="s1063">I think...I went on my own and I took a a room for myself in a basement.</span> <span id="s1064">It was near to my job, and I took a room in a basement and I..</span> <span id="s1065">.</span> <span id="s1066">beautiful but a nice room and I always see

and she was recognized and she got killed.</span> <span id="s1079">That's all.</span> <span id="s1080">They took her away from him, right away, and probably they killed the SS man too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: When you worked in the uh police office, besides the fact you were concerned about people coming through, did you have any uncomfortable experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: No.</span> <span id="s1083">I didn't see nothing from the Germans.</span> <span id="s1084">The police had only, you know, passports, traffic tickets...no, no, no, no.</span> <span
