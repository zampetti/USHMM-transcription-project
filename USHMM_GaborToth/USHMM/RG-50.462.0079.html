Holocaust</span></p> <p><span id="s2">Survivors, Philadelphia, PA Tape one, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s3">BS: [unclear] very happy that he has been willing to give his story and share it with us, that it will be a history for all of us to have.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">NF: My name is Nathan Form.</span> <span id="s5">I was born in Kroscienko, Poland, near Krakow, on February the 28th, 1922.</span> <span id="s6">I went to Polish school and Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s7">In Hebrew school up to the age of 10, and the Polish school up to age 13.</span> <span id="s8">At the age, when I was 11 years old, my father died, and I had to help out my family to work.</span> <span id="s9">Just had my mother left, and two older sisters, and two younger ones.</span> <span id="s10">I was still going to Polish school, but many times I had to leave school after two, three hours and come home, help out, work.</span> <span id="s11">We had a leather factory.</span> <span id="s12">We also had a farm.</span> <span id="s13">In the, after age 13 I was working, full time in the factory, help support my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">BS: And what year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">NF: This was 1935.</span> <span id="s16">Then, from 1935 till '39 in Poland became already very hard for the Jews, as the antisemitism was growing more and more.</span> <span id="s17">Like the priests, the churches, they would say it to the Polish citizen, "You don't kill the Jews, but don't buy by them.</span> <span id="s18">Don't bother with them.</span> <span id="s19">They will starve from hunger by themselves."</span> <span id="s20">We was, in 1938, I remember when Daladier [phonetic], when Chamberlain went to Munich, when Czechoslovakia was taken away, the part of Sudetenland.</span> <span id="s21">And the Polish government, instead to go with the Czechoslovakian against Germany, they went with Germany against the Czechoslovakian people.</span> <span id="s22">My hometown was right on the borderline between Poland and Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s23">I remember I was a young boy like, on Saturday night in Sep--that time September, the Polish army moved toward the Czechoslovakian border to take away a couple of villages from the Czechoslovakian government, because Hitler enticed them.</span> <span id="s24">We, all Jews knew it was wrong.</span> <span id="s25">We knew that this is the prelude to the World War II because the Polish government that time should have gone with the Czech's government, against Germany, not with Germany.</span> <span id="s26">And after that, it was only a matter of time in the Spring of 1939, when the German government after taking away completely Czechoslovakia went and demand the port for Gdansk.</span> <span id="s27">And the German demanded from the Poles they said this is part of Germany.</span> <span id="s28">Then the Poles realized that the Germans are after them.</span> <span id="s29">In September of, 1, September the 1st, 1939, the war broke out.</span> <span id="s30">As we looked on the borderline between Poland and Czechoslovakia, that Friday morning, the Germans were massed on the frontier line in Czechoslovakia, behind our town.</span> <span id="s31">I was working that Friday morning--I remember like today--in that factory when the Polish policeman, the Captain from the Police, came running over--he lived in, nearby us--and said, "Get your things together and get out of the town because the Germans will be here in a matter of hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">BS: So they were being kind to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">NF: The Polish government, see, because they knew that the situation is hopeless.</span> <span id="s34">At that time, we had a farm, so I had a horse, and a wagon.</span> <span id="s35">I got, put things together, a horse and wagon.</span> <span id="s36">I took my mother and the four sisters.</span> <span id="s37">It was my father's oldest brother, my uncle and his wife.</span> <span id="s38">We put everything whatever we could, our belongings, on the wagon.</span> <span id="s39">We started to run out of the town.</span> <span id="s40">We ran toward western part of Poland.</span> <span id="s41">Fortunately we ran for three weeks time.</span> <span id="s42">As much as we ran, the Germans were always ahead of us.</span> <span id="s43">Their panzers, their tanks, always surrounding us.</span> <span id="s44">Till we came, it was the Jewish holiday, came Rosh Hashanah.</span> <span id="s45">It was that time I think it was end of, around the middle of September.</span> <span id="s46">And we came not far from a Jewish town we called L'vov/Lemberg.</span> <span id="s47">In that time my uncle, as he was very religious, he says, "The holidays are coming.</span> <span id="s48">We don't go no place.</span> <span id="s49">We stop over here and we wait.</span> <span id="s50">Whatever will happen, it's in God's hands."</span> <span id="s51">We stopped in a village over there.</span> <span id="s52">Some Jewish people were there, and there we stayed over the Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s53">Unfortunately over there, we had a lot of mishaps, as there were some, there was a Jewish fellow who was convicted for life in prison for killing people before the war.</span> <span id="s54">And when the war broke out, a German bomb broke off part of the prison, and he was free.</span> <span id="s55">He came back to that village.</span> <span id="s56">My uncle was telling the Jews that in the village where he comes he was a rich man; he had a big factory, some, some sort of factory and he has land and houses.</span> <span id="s57">So they right away said, "We have the Jews over here from Poland, from the eastern part.</span> <span id="s58">They are very rich, and they have a lot of money and gold and silver."</span> <span id="s59">And this way, that fellow who was in prison, he organized under, the mafia, and they went after us.</span> <span id="s60">One morning I come in to feed the horse.</span> <span id="s61">The horse is gone.</span> <span id="s62">Then, they start to bargain with us how much money we give them for ransom for the horse.</span> <span id="s63">Because they wanted to feel us out how much money we got.</span> <span id="s64">Two days later, I come in to look for the wagon.</span> <span id="s65">They took off two wheels, one front wheel, one back wheel so we couldn't go no more.</span> <span id="s66">So then I saw he got that, that's the end of us.</span> <span id="s67">If the Germans don't kill us, they will kill us.</span> <span id="s68">So I says to my mother and sister, "Let's get out from here."</span> <span id="s69">I was at that time 17 years old.</span> <span id="s70">I said, "Let's get out, even leave everything here.</span> <span id="s71">Because we not come out alive from here."</span> <span id="s72">We went, we bought a little horse, and two wheels for the wagon, and we started back home, because we had no where to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">BS: Did you go back to your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">NF: As, the Germans, they surrounded us.</span> <span id="s75">They occupied already that part of Poland already.</span> <span id="s76">Took us three weeks to go back to our hometown.</span> <span id="s77">When we came back to our hometown, everything was ransacked in our house.</span> <span id="s78">The Polaks, the Polish people, all of them stole our beddings, our different things, and we have to start all over again.</span> <span id="s79">Then, I..</span> <span id="s80">.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">BS: Did your uncle go with you back?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">NF: Yeah, he came back, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s83">Then, as I was, I start to work in the factory, the Germans came, they requisitioned every what we had leather in the factory, as they need it for the war machinery.</span> <span id="s84">I had to work for them, in supplying whatever; we had the leather for the Germans.</span> <span id="s85">In same way, it helped me out as, as also.</span> <span id="s86">Leather was very hard to get and the Germans decreed later on that any Polish peasant who has a cow, or a calfling, he's not allowed kill it for himself.</span> <span id="s87">He has to give it to the government.</span> <span id="s88">And they decreed if somebody's caught not obeying the laws, they can be k--the death pen--death sentence for it.</span> <span id="s89">So sometimes I used to get, buy from the Polish farmers a raw skin, work in the factory.</span> <span id="s90">Otherwise for, it was like a extra.</span> <span id="s91">The, they couldn't count, didn't know exactly how much we had.</span> <span id="s92">And I used to trade with the Poles, because money doesn't mean so much.</span> <span id="s93">They give us like flour and potatoes, for a piece of leather, a piece of skin.</span> <span id="s94">And this helped us a, we helped, we were able to help out other people in our town, as most Jewish people were, hardly anything left.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">BS: The people were...</span></p> <p><span id="s96">NF: The business.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">BS: Did the people stay?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">NF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">BS: Oh, so the people did stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">NF: Very few, yeah.</span> <span id="s101">This was, as a, we had potatoes, flour, everything else, so you should give out to other more, less fortunate people also.</span> <span id="s102">I had my aunt, my aunts and my grandmother--my mother's mother--lived in Krakow, in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s103">So we tried to send them over there food whatever we could.</span> <span id="s104">Because we had more over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">BS: Because you were farming your own?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">NF: Because, no from the...</span></p> <p><span id="s107">BS: And you were trading.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">NF: From the, I was trading, yeah.</span> <span id="s109">Then, in 1941, the Germans came, they took everything away, and they close up the factory.</span> <span id="s110">In order to survive, we had a cellar under the house.</span> <span id="s111">But we lived near a river.</span> <span id="s112">Every time the river got little full of water higher, the cellar was flooded two, three feet high in water.</span> <span id="s113">For me, in order to work over there, I had to go down in the cellar, work there at night.</span> <span id="s114">Was hardly any air, just a little, maybe a candle or a kerosene lamp to show me what I am doing.</span> <span id="s115">I stayed there like from 10:00 o’clock at night till 4:00 o’clock in the morning, in the water...</span></p> <p><span id="s116">BS: Doing your leather?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">NF: In heavy boots, yeah, up to my knees.</span> <span id="s118">In order to camouflage that nobody should know that there's, I have a little factory in the, hidden underneath.</span> <span id="s119">We had chickens, was a big, we built a big, like a chicken coop.</span> <span id="s120">In the daytime the chickens were sitting over there.</span> <span id="s121">At night, I moved away the dirt, I put the chickens one level higher up...</span></p> <p><span id="s122">BS: Mmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">NF: I opened, as big as a table, the platform, and I went down over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">BS: You were about 19 years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">NF: That time, yeah, I was around 19 years old.</span> <span id="s126">And I worked over there for a couple of months.</span> <span id="s127">During the night either my older sister or my mother kept guard.</span> <span id="s128">When somebody walked in front, especially when the Germans walked with the heavy boots...</span></p> <p><span id="s129">BS: Was it the S.S., or...</span></p> <p><span id="s130">NF: S.S. or the Wehrmacht, when they walked heavy, and tapped with their feet on the ceiling so I should be quiet, because there was no windows over there.</span> <span id="s131">Unfortunately, after a while, my eyesight start to go bad.</span> <span id="s132">So there was no doctor in the hometown.</span> <span id="s133">I had to go to another town, around six miles away, to examine me.</span> <span id="s134">That doctor saw something is wrong, but he didn't know what, and I couldn't tell him.</span> <span id="s135">So he says to me...</span></p> <p><span id="s136">BS: You were straining so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">NF: He says to me, "A lack of air.</span> <span id="s138">A lack of oxygen."</span> <span id="s139">He says to me, "Your eyesight is getting bad because of lack of oxygen.</span> <span id="s140">You work someplace where is not air, and a lot of wetness and dampness, and eventually you go blind."</span> <span id="s141">I was 19 years old.</span> <span id="s142">He asked me what I'm doing.</span> <span id="s143">Unfortunately, I couldn't tell him, because my life was in danger, and my whole family's life was in danger.</span> <span id="s144">I worked there for a while till there was, and I think in the Spring, or beginning of early Summer, it was either May or June, 1942, somebody denounced us that we doing some hidden work.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">BS: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">NF: One Friday afternoon, three Gestapo with machine guns came to our house.</span> <span id="s147">My mother at that time almost had a heart attack.</span> <span id="s148">My sister's, my future brother-in-law, the one who was engaged to my older sister, he ran away.</span> <span id="s149">He was not home that time.</span> <span id="s150">When he heard what's happened, he was hiding out by the town.</span> <span id="s151">They took me around.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">BS: They just took you?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">NF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s154">They took me around around the factory, and the factory was closed.</span> <span id="s155">They looked in the windows and said to me, "What's over there?"</span> <span id="s156">So I make believe I'm dumb.</span> <span id="s157">So I talk to him in Jewish.</span> <span id="s158">There's the holes where I used to have the leather softening over there.</span> <span id="s159">He says to me, "Yeah, but where do you have that hidden factory?</span> <span id="s160">The hidden factory?"</span> <span id="s161">I says, "I don't know what you're talking about."</span> <span id="s162">I make believe I don't understand.</span> <span id="s163">Till they f--till they start to come up, the factory was in the back of the house, they coming closer to the house.</span> <span id="s164">And then we had a lot of flour and corn and food and grain on top on the house in the oven.</span> <span id="s165">So one came up, he looked around.</span> <span id="s166">He says to me, "You're well-prepared for the war."</span> <span id="s167">He says, "How long do you think the war will last?</span> <span id="s168">Why do you have so much grain and everything?"</span> <span id="s169">So I says to him, "We had our little farm so I keep saving as much I can."</span> <span id="s170">Fortunately, one was looking in the grain.</span> <span id="s171">Another one was outside.</span> <span id="s172">The third one was someplace else.</span> <span id="s173">But all three didn't see how much we had the grain over there.</span> <span id="s174">But the worst part came when we came near that chicken coop, the entrance for the hidden factory.</span> <span id="s175">If they would found out, they would kill me right on the spot.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">BS: They didn't find it?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">NF: It was a miracle.</span> <span id="s178">I don't know why, I don't know how that I didn't fainted over there.</span> <span id="s179">I stood over there, they looked in, they saw the chickens in top over there.</span> <span id="s180">They took their boots and they tap on the thing.</span> <span id="s181">And I almost fell on the ground.</span> <span id="s182">But I figured if he lifts up that platform...</span></p> <p><span id="s183">BS: [unclear]</span></p> <p><span id="s184">NF: And he goes down, and he finds the raw skin, for, for hiding a raw skin, to have a raw skin, that was death penalty.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">BS: Mmm!</span></p> <p><span id="s186">NF: It was a miracle that somehow that they looked around, they still only step on top over there.</span> <span id="s187">So they're by, near to the boots.</span> <span id="s188">They looked around.</span> <span id="s189">I didn't say nothing.</span> <span id="s190">They all, all that they want to know is where I have that hidden factory?</span> <span id="s191">And they stay right on top of it!</span></p> <p><span id="s192">BS: That was great!</span></p> <p><span id="s193">NF: It was a miracle of, somehow they walked away from that, that opening.</span> <span id="s194">Then, they told me, they told me that I had to come, that six miles away was the Gestapo, S.S., the main office in another town.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">BS: They told you this at that same time?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">NF: Yeah, I had to go over there, to report over there.</span> <span id="s197">And there they start to interview me again, to quiz me.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">BS: To try and find the factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">NF: Try and find, ask more questions and more questions.</span> <span id="s200">I should reveal things.</span> <span id="s201">I should tell them where it is.</span> <span id="s202">And also, we had on top of the leather factory, we built a double wall, for the finished leather skins we had hidden there with a double wall.</span> <span id="s203">And every time I needed some money I used to take a skin and cut it up, and trade with the Polaks, the Poles, the farmers, for food and everything else.</span> <span id="s204">And also...</span></p> <p><span id="s205">BS: What did they use those skins for?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">NF: For the shoes, for cutting the shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">BS: They, the shoes...</span></p> <p><span id="s208">NF: To have made shoes to be able to walk over...</span></p> <p><span id="s209">BS: You didn't make the shoes, though.</span> <span id="s210">They made.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">NF: No, they bought the skins.</span> <span id="s212">There was like a shoemaker, and the shoemaker he made a special like twisted shoes, for the farmers.</span> <span id="s213">They used to wear the, these kind of shoes.</span> <span id="s214">And luckily, they stood by the double wall on top on the factory.</span> <span id="s215">There was a lot of hay over there.</span> <span id="s216">And they went, they were, somehow they were blind, didn't see that either.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">BS: Mmm, man!</span></p> <p><span id="s218">NF: How I came out from there alive, without having a heart attack or fainted, I don't know how.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">BS: How did you design that?</span> <span id="s220">Was that your idea or was that your mom and your sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">NF: We, my future brother-in-law and me, see we, later on, see he was, during the war, as we ran away from our hometown toward Russia, somehow he ran faster and he got separated from us.</span> <span id="s222">He was caught behind that part where now it's the Russia, eastern part of Poland.</span> <span id="s223">He was there for a couple of months, then he smuggled and came back to our hometown.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">BS: So he got back about the same time you came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">NF: No, he came back around four months later.</span> <span id="s226">We came back right in beginning.</span> <span id="s227">He came back later.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">BS: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">NF: Then we worked together.</span> <span id="s230">See then, he...</span></p> <p><span id="s231">BS: To design this, this was quite a..</span> <span id="s232">.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">NF: See, so we had a Polish carpenter, a Polish carpenter with whom we could trust.</span> <span id="s234">Because you couldn't trust everybody, at least cert--only certain, Polish people, certain neighbors you can trust.</span> <span id="s235">So we had that, build a double wall, cover it up with hay.</span> <span id="s236">And with a single board we slide it aside to get in, and take out.</span> <span id="s237">Everything was done at night in the dark so nobody should see.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">BS: And he helped you do the leather, or...</span></p> <p><span id="s239">NF: Who?</span> <span id="s240">My brother-in-law?</span> <span id="s241">Yeah, he used to help me out working.</span> <span id="s242">But later on, see, when we had that hidden factory, so most I used to do, because only one person--it was so small--it was just like a, maybe 12, 14 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet high.</span> <span id="s243">But there was so much water there I had to constantly work in the water, and lack of air.</span> <span id="s244">But afterward...</span></p> <p><span id="s245">BS: You kept doing it even after your eyesight was in danger?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">NF: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">BS: You went back to doing that.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">NF: I kept doing.</span> <span id="s249">He gave me medication.</span> <span id="s250">I applied the medication but I still kept doing it.</span> <span id="s251">But, that day, that Friday, in the Spring, or beginning of the Summer, '42, when the S.S. came, when they were there, and my life wasn't worth a hair.</span> <span id="s252">Then I said to my mother and sisters, "That's it."</span> <span id="s253">So, a couple nights later, I brought everything, there was the river over there.</span> <span id="s254">I took all the skins and everything and I throw it in the river to wash down there should be no sign.</span> <span id="s255">And I had to clean out the whole cellar underneath, all, broke all the barrels over there...</span></p> <p><span id="s256">BS: The equipment.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">NF: Everything.</span> <span id="s258">We had equipment.</span> <span id="s259">I throw it down the river.</span> <span id="s260">It didn't last, maybe a, then I was taken to forced labor in the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">BS: You were taken then?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">NF: Like it, for the day, it's, you go in the forest, or whatever the Germans need, loading coals for the S.S., like on the wagons to the trucks, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s263">Then...</span></p> <p><span id="s264">BS: How did you get to do that?</span> <span id="s265">Someone, they came and got you again?</span> <span id="s266">Or when you were at that meeting?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">NF: They, they requested by the Jewish mayor and so many people for the day, for certain work.</span> <span id="s268">And they used to assign certain people.</span> <span id="s269">As I was young, built strong, and I was used to hard work, so wherever it was, when a hard labor came along, I was always the right one to go.</span> <span id="s270">Same, in my hometown, same in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s271">And maybe, because of that...</span></p> <p><span id="s272">BS: And what was your brother-in-law, did he go with you to that...</span></p> <p><span id="s273">NF: Oh no.</span> <span id="s274">He got killed.</span> <span id="s275">He got shot.</span> <span id="s276">So, then, in, I think either in June, 1942 I was taken from our hometown.</span> <span id="s277">They requested a certain amount of people, and they ship by trucks to another town, a little bigger town, to work on the railroad, to Poland.</span> <span id="s278">From there, I was shipped that time to a camp named, the town is named Rabka, near Krakow.</span> <span id="s279">There we were around 200 young people.</span> <span id="s280">We were slave laborers.</span> <span id="s281">And we had to work.</span> <span id="s282">There they used to train young Germans to become S.S. and Storm Troopers.</span> <span id="s283">There we had to dig.</span> <span id="s284">It was a big forest.</span> <span id="s285">And we had to dig out, cut down the w--the trees, and dig out like a whole road.</span> <span id="s286">And there they built like a practice, shooting practice for the Germans, to prac--learn how to shoot over there.</span> <span id="s287">And the Germans used to come by us take the dirt and put on wheelbarrows.</span> <span id="s288">And from the dirt from there, what we took out from the, from that forest, we had to wheel it like a, two blocks long.</span> <span id="s289">And we built a place like a stadium where they had, there they used to practice to run.</span> <span id="s290">And they used to play tennis or different things.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">BS: Like a hall, a recreation hall then.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">NF: No.</span> <span id="s293">And this was right in front of the building.</span> <span id="s294">Many times, they also had Ukrainian soldiers who were their assistants.</span> <span id="s295">And they used to watch us.</span> <span id="s296">They had a, whips and dogs.</span> <span id="s297">So many times they used, we used to, if you didn't work fast enough, so they used to, when somebody wanted to fill up the dead with the wagon, and push the wagon up the hill.</span> <span id="s298">Many of them got weak, especially the older ones, who used to faint.</span> <span id="s299">So they used to whip with the thing, or let the dogs on them.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">BS: Mmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">NF: That's, they had, there's a forest over there, behind the big school.</span> <span id="s302">That forest, maybe there's around 1,000 people, Jewish families who we buried, that they killed, and buried, because they were Jews.</span> <span id="s303">Most of them, from the end of August, 1942, when they start to expel all the Jews from different towns.</span> <span id="s304">Some of the Jews were hiding out in the forest.</span> <span id="s305">Some were hiding out by Poles.</span> <span id="s306">As long as they had the money, the gold or silver, the Poles would keep them.</span> <span id="s307">After the gold and silver ran out, then the, they used to denounce them to the S.S.</span> <span id="s308">The first bad experience I had was in, I think it was in August, '42.</span> <span id="s309">In fact there is here, there is here a friend of mine from Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s310">He came over here to the Convention.</span> <span id="s311">He was that time with me.</span> <span id="s312">They came one morning, they picked us, six of us young fellows, strong built...</span></p> <p><span id="s313">BS: This was when you were in the work group.</span> <span id="s314">In the labor force.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">NF: And that Gestapo came.</span> <span id="s316">They took us over there to the forest, and they marked out like a place six feet long, six feet wide, and six feet deep.</span> <span id="s317">And they give us a time limit to dig that place.</span> <span id="s318">But we didn't know what we were doing.</span> <span id="s319">They told us that we're digging trenches, and the Germans had to practice in the trenches.</span> <span id="s320">But unfortunately it wasn't so.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">BS: They were graves.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">NF: It was, that particular trench was a grave for a Jewish family--a father and mother and a girl of 25 years old.</span> <span id="s323">They looked in, next town, in Rabka [unclear] over there.</span> <span id="s324">According what was told to us, the woman had some kind of disagreement with a Polish neighbor.</span> <span id="s325">So she said to the Polish neighbor, "Some day the sun will shine for us Jews."</span> <span id="s326">So the Polish woman, or her husband, went to the Gestapo and told them that a Jewish family said, "Soon the Russian army will come and kill all the Germans."</span> <span id="s327">The Gestapo sent a Jeep, with a couple soldiers.</span> <span id="s328">They picked up the father and mother and the girl and brought them to the Gestapo camp.</span> <span id="s329">They put them, there was a sort of like a bunker, it was like a cellar with metal bars, where they used to keep all the people over there in prison until they took them to the forest to be killed.</span> <span id="s330">That afternoon, we dug that hole, and there was a Ukrainian surgeon.</span> <span id="s331">That surgeon, he was in the Polish army, then he was in the Russian army, then he was in the German army.</span> <span id="s332">So you see how you can trust this kind of people.</span> <span id="s333">While we were working there, digging that hole, he watched on us, over us.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">BS: He was a surgeon?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">NF: He was a regular surgeon, but he was in three different armies.</span> <span id="s336">And you couldn't trust him ever.</span> <span id="s337">When the Russians were winning, he was talking to us nice.</span> <span id="s338">When the Germans were winning, he was against us.</span> <span id="s339">He was, every day he was swaying like the wind.</span> <span id="s340">And that particular hole, when we were digging the trenches, there was a big stone and under the tree.</span> <span id="s341">We couldn't get it out.</span> <span id="s342">So I, as I was used to work hard, I took the pick and shovel, and I put the pick under the stone to loosen up, I put it under my shoulder, and I broke the pick in half.</span> <span id="s343">And he stood up.</span> <span id="s344">He says to me, "Where are you from?"</span> <span id="s345">I told him, "I'm from the mountains, up nearby."</span> <span id="s346">He said, "I can see that you used to work for hard lab--hard work."</span> <span id="s347">Then he says to us, "You better speed up and get out from here, because the Rosenbaum, the Sturmstabführer, he will come, and he finds you here in the hole, he will kill you all."</span> <span id="s348">Then I couldn't realize what he was talking about.</span> <span id="s349">Cause he, I thought we're digging trenches.</span> <span id="s350">Then he says, he watch, he looked on the watch.</span> <span id="s351">He says, "By a quarter of three, get out.</span> <span id="s352">If you hear him, his voices, coming to the grave, just finish up and run out in the woods."</span> <span id="s353">Then wait a while.</span> <span id="s354">When you hear a whistle blow, come right back."</span> <span id="s355">As we are staying in the woods, we couldn't see the people, but we heard screaming and crying.</span> <span id="s356">They brought the father and mother and that daughter.</span> <span id="s357">They get undressed in front of the grave, and they killed them naked at the...</span></p> <p><span id="s358">BS: Right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">NF: Jumped down.</span> <span id="s360">When the whistle blew, a friend of mine--he is now in Israel--he unfortunately came the first to the grave.</span> <span id="s361">So the, the S.S. man showed me I should jump down in the grave, to turn over the bodies to see if somebody is alive.</span> <span id="s362">Otherwise they shot them again.</span> <span id="s363">When he jumped down in the grave, he fainted.</span> <span id="s364">Then he pulled out the gun and he wanted, he start to shout in German, "Make fast and do it, or I kill you!"</span> <span id="s365">Somehow, I don't know how, my, I, it occurred to me that I had the strength and everything.</span> <span id="s366">I jumped down after him.</span> <span id="s367">As I was young and strong, I was able to push my boyfriend out.</span> <span id="s368">We had to get undressed, only the top, take off our shirts on the top, that we're naked on top as we're working there.</span> <span id="s369">I jumped down after, I pushed him out.</span> <span id="s370">I turned over the bodies.</span> <span id="s371">And that woman, the girl, she was on the heavy side.</span> <span id="s372">That's all I remember.</span> <span id="s373">When I grabbed her hand to turn her over, her warm blood splashed over my head, my face, my body.</span> <span id="s374">I became like in a daze.</span> <span id="s375">How I came out from there, what happened, I don't know if I had nightmares, but day and night, that vision what happened.</span> <span id="s376">That was my first experience of seeing people being shot by the graves.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">BS: Where was your mother and sisters at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">NF: Now, I, when I was in that camp, once I went back home for a day and saw my mother and sisters.</span> <span id="s379">And then at the, it was the, I think it was the end of August that time.</span> <span id="s380">The Germans start systematic expulsion, liquidation of all the towns and ghettos.</span> <span id="s381">What they did, they invaded in this town, population 10,000.</span> <span id="s382">Was only Jewish, 100 Jewish families.</span> <span id="s383">So they ordered our death in the camp, in that Gestapo camp...</span></p> <p><span id="s384">BS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">NF: They told them to get together, one Friday morning, get everything together.</span> <span id="s386">And we start a march to the bigger town, towards Krakow.</span> <span id="s387">On the road as they're walking...</span></p> <p><span id="s388">BS: Your mother and...</span></p> <p><span id="s389">NF: No, my mother got shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">BS: Your sisters all together?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">NF: No.</span> <span id="s392">They're walking, but see, most older people were, let's say over 40 or something, they shot them on the road as they went along.</span> <span id="s393">The Germans were riding in the Jeep, and they were shooting like at random, left and right.</span> <span id="s394">I wasn't there, but I met later on in the camps, and he survived the war, he lived in New York, so he told me.</span> <span id="s395">And he was a mechanic, so he, the Germans kept cause he was fixing their cars.</span> <span id="s396">He saw his own wife and children go on that death march, and he couldn't do nothing.</span> <span id="s397">So he told me what's happened.</span> <span id="s398">But my mother was shot right on the road.</span> <span id="s399">My aunt.</span> <span id="s400">And my uncle was killed before that.</span> <span id="s401">They rounded up Jews one Friday they rounded up in our hometown in the Spring of '42.</span> <span id="s402">They put them against the wall and they shot 11 people in my hometown that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">BS: How about your sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">NF: So my sisters were taken from there to a bigger town, and then they were taken to Krakow.</span> <span id="s405">And there they were put in wagons and they were sent to Treblinka, to the death chambers.</span> <span id="s406">So we couldn't find out any more what happened.</span> <span id="s407">After that I never...</span></p> <p><span id="s408">BS: You never heard from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">NF: I never heard from them.</span> <span id="s410">I never went back to the town.</span> <span id="s411">And I worked in that Gestapo camp over there until either May or June, 1943.</span> <span id="s412">That's the reason why, or, or, I'll say it later cause I mixed up.</span> <span id="s413">From there, in 1943 in the beginning, I was taken on a transport ship toward eastern Germany, to another concentration camp named Gross-Rosen.</span> <span id="s414">This concentration camp was built in 1933, for German political prisoners who opposed Hitler.</span> <span id="s415">Later on, during the war they became like the foremans, or people in charge over us, in each barrack, these Germans political prisoners.</span> <span id="s416">When I came to that camp, a friend of mine who is in Israel now, yeah, we were to, we had to go, to get washed and every time they, we changed camps we had to change our clothes.</span> <span id="s417">Because as we came out from our hometown we had some money, some silver, some gold hidden.</span> <span id="s418">So then the Germans knew people had sewed in some things in their clothes at some, so they made sure you leave all your clothes before you went in to get washed, to take a shower.</span> <span id="s419">Some, many times when we came in to take a shower, we expected the gas to be on, because we heard that they were...</span></p> <p><span id="s420">BS: You really thought about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">NF: Because then, in 1943, '44, we heard that there is crematoriums and gas chambers.</span> <span id="s422">Before I didn't know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">BS: You did hear about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">NF: Yes.</span> <span id="s425">So especially in that Gross-Rosen, we, was a gruesome sight to come in to a place, in there, there's two ovens, the chimneys.</span> <span id="s426">So I saw the smoke in the chimneys coming out.</span> <span id="s427">There, I met a fellow, a Polish Gentile fellow from our hometown.</span> <span id="s428">He was doing, he was living in Warsaw Ghetto.</span> <span id="s429">He was doing some black market business, and he got caught.</span> <span id="s430">He was sent over there to that camp, Gross-Rosen, over there.</span> <span id="s431">So when he heard that the new transport came, so he was talking to us, it just happened he's talking to a friend of mine who's now in Israel.</span> <span id="s432">He ask him, "Is there anybody from Kroscienko, Poland?"</span> <span id="s433">So he says to him, "Yeah, I have a good boyfriend of mine, Nathan Form."</span> <span id="s434">See, in Krakow, so, no, I missed something, see.</span> <span id="s435">No, from Rabka, in 1942...</span></p> <p><span id="s436">BS: Stop one second [tape off then on].</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s438">BS: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">NF: In 1942, in June, when we were sent out in that Gestapo camp, one morning, 4:00 o’clock in the morning they surrou--they woke us up and put us up in a place they called Appell place where they counted us up.</span> <span id="s440">Then we had to march right in the front of the Gestapo building.</span> <span id="s441">There they put us on trucks and they shipped us.</span> <span id="s442">We thought that they're gonna take us with the trucks to the forest and kill us all.</span> <span id="s443">One fellow from my hometown, he jumped down the truck, he start to run toward the forest.</span> <span id="s444">They were shooting at him.</span> <span id="s445">They shot his hand.</span> <span id="s446">Somehow he was able to run away and he ran in the forest in the farms.</span> <span id="s447">At that time it was a summertime.</span> <span id="s448">The farmers were working on the farms, Polish farmers.</span> <span id="s449">He asked for assistance they should help him, give him some clothes, and to help him to hide.</span> <span id="s450">Instead, they tied him up with straw, what do you call that, like, they make the straw, they made like...</span></p> <p><span id="s451">BS: Twine?</span> <span id="s452">Hay?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">NF: Twine, twine, yeah.</span> <span id="s454">Tied up his hands and his feet.</span> <span id="s455">They put on a wagon and they brought him back to the Gestapo camp.</span> <span id="s456">Luckily see there was, the Gestapo camp, as they knew nobody was left there, so they shipped him to Krakow-Plaszów, in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s457">And there, luckily, they put him in a hospital.</span> <span id="s458">I went to see him during the hospital.</span> <span id="s459">And there they healed up his hand.</span> <span id="s460">This truck took us to the concentration camp in Krakow-Plaszów.</span> <span id="s461">Was in either May or June, 1942.</span> <span id="s462">There, I remained over till summer, I think either May or June, 1943.</span> <span id="s463">There I worked as, they ask you what profession, what profession you had.</span> <span id="s464">But they had the shops, like shoemaker shop, tailors, tanners.</span> <span id="s465">As I was, my profession was a tannery, so they put me to work in a tannery, there were fur, to work furs.</span> <span id="s466">Like they, a lot of the Russians got some in the Russian front, it's German soldier on the Russian fronts, and they were shot they need heavy clothes and heavy furs and wooden, the, what do you call it, coats.</span> <span id="s467">See a lot of them came back with blood and everything else.</span> <span id="s468">So you have to clean and wash them out.</span> <span id="s469">And repair them they should take them back to the front and give them for the German soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">BS: So that's what you were doing there?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">NF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s472">And there, we worked over, in that place over there, in Krakow, Plaszów, there was a big mountain over there, with thousands and thousands of men, women and children they shot over there and killed.</span> <span id="s473">Because that time, they were liquidating the Krakow Ghetto and they're shipping them to that concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">BS: And you saw the shooting in...</span></p> <p><span id="s475">NF: Many times over there.</span> <span id="s476">And I didn't have, there, luckily I didn't have to go and bury nobody, see, because...</span></p> <p><span id="s477">BS: You were busy.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">NF: I was working inside.</span> <span id="s479">But, from our window, when we were working, we could see that hill, up the hill, and the people were going up over there, and the German soldiers with machine guns, they stand around, and there was a big like, I don't know how to explain, it was like big, two mountains, and there was a big [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s480">BS: Like a valley?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">NF: Like a valley.</span> <span id="s482">And they used to shoot them on top and they used to fill in the valley and bury them up.</span> <span id="s483">Then from the--from Krakow, Plaszów, I was taken again as the Russian got some, start to advance on the eastern front towards Poland.</span> <span id="s484">So the Germans tried to take the, whoever was strong enough to work, for the camps, and ship them to Germany they should have free slave labor.</span> <span id="s485">So I was shipped from there by trucks and wagons.</span> <span id="s486">It was very hot.</span> <span id="s487">We were sitting in wagons for a couple nights and days.</span> <span id="s488">And we had hardly anything to eat and drink.</span> <span id="s489">We were brought by camp Gross-Rosen.</span> <span id="s490">That's in eastern Germany.</span> <span id="s491">There I met that fellow, like I said before, from my hometown.</span> <span id="s492">When he found out I'm from his hometown–he was there quite a while already there--he says to me, (In my hometown they used to call my name Nathan.</span> <span id="s493">They call it in Polish Nusiek), he says, "Nusiek, I'm your friend.</span> <span id="s494">You see the two chimneys?</span> <span id="s495">They work day and night.</span> <span id="s496">Just, any time they have a transport to get out from here, don't ask any questions.</span> <span id="s497">You get out from here.</span> <span id="s498">Because you don't come out alive from here."</span> <span id="s499">In that camp, if you did something wrong, they didn't punish you.</span> <span id="s500">All they did, they took a big stone, 100 pounds maybe, they tie up in back of your shoulders, and make you walk around the whole day with the stone, in the sun, without even any water to drink or something to eat.</span> <span id="s501">This was, people used to collapse...</span></p> <p><span id="s502">BS: And die.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">NF: And then they...</span></p> <p><span id="s504">BS: That was the end of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">NF: After he collapsed they took him to the...</span></p> <p><span id="s506">BS: To the oven.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">NF: Crematorium, to the oven.</span> <span id="s508">That was the end.</span> <span id="s509">I was lucky somehow that after eight days, I was only there eight days, and I was picked on a transport to be shipped out.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">BS: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">NF: And I was shipped there, they shipped us on wagons again.</span> <span id="s512">I was shipped to Germany.</span> <span id="s513">And it was more like a, in southern part of Germany, Wüstegiersdorf.</span> <span id="s514">It's near Bres--near Breslau.</span> <span id="s515">In Polish is Wroclaw.</span> <span id="s516">There I was lucky.</span> <span id="s517">And they shipped over there in the camp, it was a workman camp, and the guards were soldiers from the Wehrmacht, not S.S. And a lot of them were crippled.</span> <span id="s518">If one got shot on the Russian front, they couldn't use him on the front, so they brought him back and they should guard us.</span> <span id="s519">These soldiers were a little more easy with us, because they already went through plenty.</span> <span id="s520">And they were not trained S.S., so they put us to work.</span> <span id="s521">Unfortunately, one night, I had a terrible feeling, I couldn't sleep the whole night.</span> <span id="s522">And I had a dream that I was taken to the coal mines, to work in the coal mines and, I got killed in the coal mines.</span> <span id="s523">Sure enough, 5:00 o’clock in the morning they used to wake us up, and they used to put us in the Appell Platz where they, in the place where they count the people out.</span> <span id="s524">I was built strong.</span> <span id="s525">I was young, and tall.</span> <span id="s526">And most, the old people already shrunk men, weak, short, so I always overtowered the other ones.</span> <span id="s527">Wherever there was some big and hard labor, the hard work, I was the first one picked out.</span> <span id="s528">When they picked me out from the Appell Platz to the side, and I had to go to work in that coal mine.</span> <span id="s529">See there, what happened, as the Germans and the Russian army...</span></p> <p><span id="s530">BS: It was part of the same camp, though, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">NF: In that, no that...</span></p> <p><span id="s532">BS: The coal mine was...</span></p> <p><span id="s533">NF: That camp, yeah, it's part of the camp.</span> <span id="s534">It was like a work camp, not a Gestapo camp, a concentration camp, but like a work camp.</span> <span id="s535">But there were still electric wires around in that, towers, and watchmen over there.</span> <span id="s536">We were 2,000 Jewish prisoners, workers there.</span> <span id="s537">But they, we had to go over there.</span> <span id="s538">What we had to do, we had to dig in the mountains tunnels for the Germans start to make the ammunitions and hide things, because they knew the Russian are advancing toward Poland and they're coming toward Germany.</span> <span id="s539">So, and the Allies were bombing that time all the towns and the factories.</span> <span id="s540">So they start to use the forced labor to do, dig holes in the mountains to make safe for the, the Allies won't, or the...</span></p> <p><span id="s541">BS: They can hide.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">NF: Their position.</span> <span id="s543">They couldn't bomb the mountains.</span> <span id="s544">There, we were digging with machines, with pick and shovels, the stones to get in like we called bunkers what they would call it.</span> <span id="s545">There I was with my friends.</span> <span id="s546">I had two friends, somehow we sur--we were going from 1942 on.</span> <span id="s547">Wherever one was picked, all, two volunteered and we went together.</span> <span id="s548">Through that alive, we're together now.</span> <span id="s549">The two of them are in Israel.</span> <span id="s550">We survived the war.</span> <span id="s551">So we went to that camp over there.</span> <span id="s552">And I had to work that time from six in the morning till four in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s553">And maybe a half an hour before, I have to get up to work.</span> <span id="s554">A big stone loosened up from the top, and fell on me.</span> <span id="s555">Luckily, it hit my head and the side of my, on my back, and crushed a couple of my ribs.</span> <span id="s556">And I fell down.</span> <span id="s557">And the two friends of mine were together with me.</span> <span id="s558">So they put me like on a makeshift, what do you call, a stretcher.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">BS: Stretcher.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">NF: Stretcher.</span> <span id="s561">And they carried me down like 1,000 feet from the mountain down to the camp.</span> <span id="s562">Luckily, that in that camp wasn't a crematorium.</span> <span id="s563">Wasn't a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s564">They had the one barrack assigned for the sick people.</span> <span id="s565">And that...</span></p> <p><span id="s566">BS: You had a doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">NF: The one friend of mine, the one from Krakow who is now in Israel, he was working over there like a nurse.</span> <span id="s568">But the doctor, was a Jewish doctor from Tarnow, from a town not far from us, a Jewish doctor.</span> <span id="s569">So, between both of them they helped me to get a better, to be able to walk around.</span> <span id="s570">And they healed me up somehow my ribs should heal up.</span> <span id="s571">And I worked there for, I was there for a couple of weeks.</span> <span id="s572">But, the Chief from the Germans, from that camp, as the people, some of them they died out, some got sick from the work, and he had a shortage of labor in the tunnel, so every day he was looking out.</span> <span id="s573">Then one day he came around, he says he wants, he wants me back to go to the coal mines.</span> <span id="s574">While I was in the hospital I could walk around a little bit.</span> <span id="s575">They took me to go to work in the kitchen, help out people, take this and put in some soup, and do something.</span> <span id="s576">And this helped me.</span> <span id="s577">I was able to take some potatoes and things to eat.</span> <span id="s578">And at night I used to take, walk out during the night in the barracks and bring some potatoes and some soup to my friends...</span></p> <p><span id="s579">BS: To the rest of the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">NF: And put under their blankets nobody should see.</span> <span id="s581">I was lucky that somehow, day before, when I was supposed to go back in the mines, the man who was working the kitchen lighting up the ovens--there were four, twelve big ovens that they heat, put by coal to heat them, make the fire to make the soup for the 2,000 peoples (we had to get up 2:00 o’clock in the morning and go prepare everything so the people 5:00 o’clock in the morning had the food prepared)--somehow the Chief from the barracks took a dislike, and I think he caught him sleeping or something.</span> <span id="s582">And he fired him.</span> <span id="s583">He took that man, he shipped him in the coal mines.</span> <span id="s584">There was...</span></p> <p><span id="s585">BS: To have you in the kitchen?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">NF: And then there was a, the chief cook over there in the kitchen, he was a very good friend of, to the chief of the camp.</span> <span id="s587">And he knew me from my hometown.</span> <span id="s588">He knew my father and my family.</span> <span id="s589">So he go, he went over to the chief of the poli--from the camp, he says to him, "I want Nathan he should come and take over the job and work in the kitchen over here as, light the ovens and do all that."</span> <span id="s590">This was a very hard work.</span> <span id="s591">I had to get up 2:00 o’clock in the morning...</span></p> <p><span id="s592">BS: But it was better than the mines.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">NF: Better than the mines.</span> <span id="s594">So I stayed over there.</span> <span id="s595">And I took over the job.</span> <span id="s596">I had to get up 2:00 o’clock in the morning and would heat up, clean up the ovens, light up the coals, and make sure that the soup and the coffee is prepared for 5:00 o’clock in the morning, for the 2,000 people.</span> <span id="s597">Well that helped me to eat.</span> <span id="s598">And I, this way I gained weight and I helped out also my other, all the friends, other ones, with the food.</span> <span id="s599">There we were till end of January, 1945.</span> <span id="s600">Then the Russian army advanced already on Poland and almost, they took over Poland almost and start to go in in Germany.</span> <span id="s601">Then they took us.</span> <span id="s602">They liquidated the bar--that camp.</span> <span id="s603">And they sent us, they put us, yeah, we had to march in the snow and ice in the winter time.</span> <span id="s604">That's in the Alp, in Austria, to Austria, for a couple, maybe for two weeks, day and night.</span> <span id="s605">We marched that time...</span></p> <p><span id="s606">BS: How many of you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">NF: From that time we marched out 3,500.</span> <span id="s608">Every day, at least 100, 200 people died out from not eating, from the cold, from the trouble with their stomachs...</span></p> <p><span id="s609">BS: Exertion.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">NF: Diarrhea and everything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">BS: How many made it there?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">NF: We didn't get to a camp.</span> <span id="s613">Then, they took us, we walked on that march, we call it like a death march.</span> <span id="s614">We marched like this for a week or two and we slept in barns on the ground, in the cold, in the winter time, was below 20 degrees in freezing weather.</span> <span id="s615">Then finally they brought us to a place--I don't remember the name--they put us in cattle wagons.</span> <span id="s616">They put us in cattle wagons.</span> <span id="s617">And there we sat, 120 people in one wagon, one pushed on top of the other one.</span> <span id="s618">We had no room to move.</span> <span id="s619">And it was open.</span> <span id="s620">Lucky thing, because the wagons were open; we had no too much food or water to drink, so we had, the snow was coming on top of us, so we ate the snow.</span> <span id="s621">And we were shipped from there, were shipped to Austria, to the camp Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s622">So we left, it took us around six weeks to march, and in wagons till we got over there.</span> <span id="s623">When they opened the wagons, may--maybe from each wagon, from 120 people maybe 50 survived.</span> <span id="s624">Most of them, everything was, pulled out, like, like bodies.</span> <span id="s625">We only had a blanket to cover us up.</span> <span id="s626">If that wasn't enough yet, we came to the Mauthausen there.</span> <span id="s627">It was snowing terrible, it was the March in the Alps, was bitter cold, and snowing.</span> <span id="s628">So we had to sit a whole night, to go in, again, to be washed over there.</span> <span id="s629">We didn't know if we're going to a gas chamber, or to get washed around.</span> <span id="s630">And it was bitter cold.</span> <span id="s631">So we sat together in one, was ten, twelve together, we put our blankets around, and we hoped to get through the night.</span> <span id="s632">By the time they called us in to go to, change, wash and change our clothes, from each group, half of us died in, in, frostbitten...</span></p> <p><span id="s633">BS: Sitting there, oh...</span></p> <p><span id="s634">NF: From the cold and from the, from the [unclear] from malnutrition.</span> <span id="s635">I, at that time I was so weak I didn't have my mind to work to go [unclear].</span> <span id="s636">I was very weak.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">BS: Your friends were with you too, still?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">NF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s639">Still together.</span> <span id="s640">So we went you know that place.</span> <span id="s641">We get washed around.</span> <span id="s642">They give us these striped uniforms with wooden shoes.</span> <span id="s643">And here we are in the mountains, in bitter cold, in winter time, beginning of March, in the snow and ice.</span> <span id="s644">Somehow we went through the night.</span> <span id="s645">In the morning we got washed around, and we got a new, the new uniforms, the striped uniforms.</span> <span id="s646">And they gave us something to eat.</span> <span id="s647">And we went in to the barracks.</span> <span id="s648">Then they found out there were, camp Mauthausen was overcrowded.</span> <span id="s649">They had no room.</span> <span id="s650">So they made us again march over there in the snow and ice to another camp nearby, Ebensee.</span> <span id="s651">And there we had the same thing trouble again.</span> <span id="s652">We have to sit and wait to get in and get washed and things like that over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">BS: They made all of the same people leave again?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">NF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s655">But that was, whoever is...</span></p> <p><span id="s656">BS: Whoever came...</span></p> <p><span id="s657">NF: They systematically, every time was less and less.</span> <span id="s658">From the 3,500 that marched out from, that time, from that work camp in Germany, maybe 150 survived.</span> <span id="s659">So in Ebensee in that camp we were there.</span> <span id="s660">There we had to walk every day, work again in the mines, dig tunnels for the ammunition over there.</span> <span id="s661">And the water was coming on top on us.</span> <span id="s662">There was 180 steps to walk down.</span> <span id="s663">The steps were made from stone, so we dug out in the mountains stones to walk down over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">BS: At that point how old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">NF: In that time I was a, around twenty--twenty-three years old.</span> <span id="s666">It was before the liberation.</span> <span id="s667">Then one day, I met over there in that camp a boy from my, from my hometown.</span> <span id="s668">He was over six feet tall, very strong.</span> <span id="s669">So then, we had often, we had the Allied Air Force used to come over there, [unclear], and they start to bomb around the, because it was a lot of military installations there, in Ebensee.</span> <span id="s670">So, what they used to do, when the Allies, when they had the air raids, they made us jump out from the barracks, because like we were working night shift, so we had to stay in the day time in the barracks.</span> <span id="s671">If you work day shift, so we stayed at night in the barracks.</span> <span id="s672">It was like a twelve-hour shift.</span> <span id="s673">So they make us, force us to walk back in the coal mines, only they, we start to walk up and down.</span> <span id="s674">I could hardly walk already.</span> <span id="s675">So he says to me, he says to me, "Nathan, when the air raids go, goes on, don't go to the barracks.</span> <span id="s676">Go with me."</span> <span id="s677">He jumped out the window.</span> <span id="s678">And the barracks were built like on wooden stilts, like three, four feet above the ground.</span> <span id="s679">Because the water used to, when we washed the floors the water used to go down.</span> <span id="s680">So we only could crawl in them.</span> <span id="s681">We couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s682">So we crawled underneath and we hide ourselves.</span> <span id="s683">Unfortunately, the guards saw us when we jumped out the windows and went over underneath.</span> <span id="s684">When the air raid was over, they surrounded the barrack.</span> <span id="s685">They says, "Come on out."</span> <span id="s686">When they come us out they put a big box in back of the barracks, one took a long pipe like from the washing machine, a hose, and one took a big stick, and lined us up, and they kept on beating us on the back.</span> <span id="s687">That boyfriend of mine he was very tall.</span> <span id="s688">He was almost like a skeleton.</span> <span id="s689">So, to protect himself they shouldn't break his spine so he put his hand in the back and they broke both his wrists.</span> <span id="s690">They broke, broke his wrists, he couldn't work no more.</span> <span id="s691">So they put him in the barrack where the sick people are.</span> <span id="s692">And once you are in the barrack where the sick people are, they gave a needle...</span></p> <p><span id="s693">BS: And that's the end of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">NF: And he died maybe eighty [unclear] ation.</span> <span id="s695">I got beaten up.</span> <span id="s696">I count to twenty, twenty-five and I passed out.</span> <span id="s697">All I felt was one of the S.S. kicked me with his boot, and I fell, I fell down and I crawled from that barracks there was a toilet from the barracks just about twelve feet to the toilet.</span> <span id="s698">I was so sore that I couldn't sit on this toilet seat.</span> <span id="s699">I was sitting sideways.</span> <span id="s700">Luckily my two boyfriends who are now in Israel, this is what I said to them, "Please, don't leave me in the barrack.</span> <span id="s701">Help to take to go to work.</span> <span id="s702">Maybe I can work carrying."</span> <span id="s703">They came, they put their shoulder, their hands around me and they carried me to the barracks to work.</span> <span id="s704">There we had, the overseer was the Russian prisoners.</span> <span id="s705">They were assigned there because they were very strong.</span> <span id="s706">They were like overseers of us of the work, and they used to beat us if we didn't work enough.</span> <span id="s707">So I had a couple of cigarettes.</span> <span id="s708">See, they used to give us cigarettes.</span> <span id="s709">I used to smoke.</span> <span id="s710">But when I saw the people used to give away the last piece of bread for a cigarette, so I saved a cigarette and hid in there, under the mattress, in the straw.</span> <span id="s711">So, when I couldn't work and that Russian foreman start to beat me, I says to him, "Please, I didn't want to tell nobody, but the Germans already, so now, I don't feel good.</span> <span id="s712">Please leave me sitting inside little bit till I'll be able to go through."</span> <span id="s713">And I gave him a cigarette.</span> <span id="s714">So he leave me alone.</span> <span id="s715">And for a couple of days, this way, my friends carried me back and forth to work.</span> <span id="s716">I didn't want to, because I knew once I stay in the barracks...</span></p> <p><span id="s717">BS: That was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">NF: That was the end of me.</span> <span id="s719">Lately, in, I was liberated May the 6th, 1945, by the American army.</span> <span id="s720">I think it was Eisenhower's Eighth Army.</span> <span id="s721">But, the last couple days my mind didn't work.</span> <span id="s722">I was very weak, and I could hardly walk.</span> <span id="s723">A couple days before the liberation, the Germans wanted to get rid of us nobody should, they were, we were 17,000 people there.</span> <span id="s724">We were maybe ten or twelve different nations--there were Greeks, Poles, Russians, Jews from different countries, and there were also some German political prisoners also among there.</span> <span id="s725">They were in charge of us, but they knew in case they're gonna liquidate us, they'll liquidate them also.</span> <span id="s726">So they pull us together on a big place they call Appell Platz where they count us out.</span> <span id="s727">We used to get up every, 4:00 o’clock in the morning they used to gather us together to count us.</span> <span id="s728">Every day each German guard, they took our group, it's a 220-50 people to work.</span> <span id="s729">If you brought back 20 or 30 less, he was rewarded for it that he got rid of a certain amount of people.</span> <span id="s730">Because he, they died on the way to work or from work.</span> <span id="s731">So a couple days before the liberation, was maybe beginning of May--1st, or May the 2nd, they call us to go down at noontime at the Appell Platz.</span> <span id="s732">And they tell us, "For your own safety, so the Allies won't come and bomb all the barracks, and everything else, we want you, you should go to the coal, to the mines, where you are working.</span> <span id="s733">And there, you will hide out, and be safe."</span> <span id="s734">But we are lucky these German prisoners found out that they had put mines in these tunnels.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">BS: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">NF: The mines, all the...</span></p> <p><span id="s737">BS: All the coal mines.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">NF: All the mines, coal mines, see the mines [unclear] tunnels.</span> <span id="s739">They mined the tunnels.</span> <span id="s740">So once we go in...</span></p> <p><span id="s741">BS: That would have been the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">NF: Put up the mines, and everything would have disappeared.</span> <span id="s743">So luckily, they start to say us, everybody in own language, in Polish, in German, in French, in Russian, holler, "No!</span> <span id="s744">No!</span> <span id="s745">We don't want it!</span> <span id="s746">We wanna stay in the barracks."</span> <span id="s747">So he, in that time the Germans was scared because the S.S. ran away, only they had like they surround the militia, guarding us.</span> <span id="s748">And they had not so much power and they knew the Allies are very close by.</span> <span id="s749">So we start to holler, "No!</span> <span id="s750">We don't want to go!</span> <span id="s751">We want to stay here.</span> <span id="s752">Whatever will happen will happen."</span> <span id="s753">So he says, "If that's so, then I don't be responsible for you.</span> <span id="s754">So you take your own responsibility in your hands."</span> <span id="s755">And he let us go, and we went back to the barracks.</span> <span id="s756">We went in, we stood in the barracks for well, I think, two or three days.</span> <span id="s757">And we to work.</span> <span id="s758">We had no food and nothing...</span></p> <p><span id="s759">BS: No food.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">NF: It was, was everything was like disarray already.</span> <span id="s761">There's no control, no nothing.</span> <span id="s762">See with me there was a Jewish fellow.</span> <span id="s763">He was a very religious man.</span> <span id="s764">His name was Abraham.</span> <span id="s765">The shochet of the town.</span> <span id="s766">That man, he had so much faith, so optimistic.</span> <span id="s767">I told him, "You're crazy."</span> <span id="s768">He says to me, "Maybe."</span> <span id="s769">So he says to me, "Before we, [unclear] should pretty soon be liberated.</span> <span id="s770">The Americans gonna be here, the Jews, they'll come over here and get throwing out all that [chuckling] chocolate.</span> <span id="s771">They give us food, everything else.</span> <span id="s772">You'll see how good it will be."</span> <span id="s773">I said to Avrum, in Jewish I says to him, "The, maybe before, before this will happen, we will not be alive."</span> <span id="s774">Because, my mind didn't work.</span> <span id="s775">I was very weak.</span> <span id="s776">I couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s777">And I was there, I knew that that's the end.</span> <span id="s778">I couldn't believe that...</span></p> <p><span id="s779">BS: You just didn't have any more faith.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">NF: No, I couldn't believe that this will happen.</span> <span id="s781">And sure enough, all of a sudden we heard some commotion one Saturday night.</span> <span id="s782">So they, some of them, the prisoners, they walked strangely especially the Russians, they start to go after the militia they were guarding us.</span> <span id="s783">They killed some of them, and especially after the, they call it Kapo, the overseers from the barracks.</span> <span id="s784">Each barrack there lived so many people.</span> <span id="s785">There is a barrack, 19, another one, that was terrible.</span> <span id="s786">It was like extermination barracks.</span> <span id="s787">Over there if you did something wrong, there was a barrel of water, they used to bend down, put your head down the water there and hold you as long till you couldn't catch no breath, you came out, you were suffocated, that's all.</span> <span id="s788">This is in the barrack, terrible things.</span> <span id="s789">So, we were in the barracks, and Sunday morning, I was there.</span> <span id="s790">I couldn't move hardly.</span> <span id="s791">I couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s792">My friend what's in Jerusalem, the (?)</span> <span id="s793">, you met him?</span> <span id="s794">Hertzl?</span> <span id="s795">You met him.</span> <span id="s796">Hertzl.</span> <span id="s797">He looked like a skeleton.</span> <span id="s798">He was 30 years old.</span> <span id="s799">He was in, some...</span></p> <p><span id="s800">BS: Your friend that's in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">NF: Yeah, there's two of them.</span> <span id="s802">One's from Krakow, and one's from Lodz, Ghetto.</span> <span id="s803">He looked like, all you could see two big buck teeth, with a big nose.</span> <span id="s804">He looked like a skeleton.</span> <span id="s805">Somehow he had enough strength to walk out, he walked to Appell Platz and he saw the German, the planes, were American planes.</span> <span id="s806">And the Americans, so when they saw him, they got scared to see a skeleton like this.</span> <span id="s807">Now you, if a kid look like a 13, 14 years old.</span> <span id="s808">But the unfortunate thing what they did, they gave him chocolate, with, gave him salamis and things.</span> <span id="s809">He brought that back to the barracks and he start to eat.</span> <span id="s810">Two days later he almost died from dysentery, from diarrhea.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">BS: He almost died?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">NF: He almost died.</span> <span id="s813">See, I, somehow, I don't know why in that friend of mine, the other one, he says I couldn't eat too much because I shrunk, stomach was shrunk maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">BS: But he didn't realize it?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">NF: Not to eat.</span> <span id="s816">So he was saying while he was there, when he gave it to me he grabbed me and he ate it.</span> <span id="s817">The day we got liberated we stayed in the barracks.</span> <span id="s818">Then, it took a couple days till they start, the Red Cross start organizing people and they start to look out for these people around.</span> <span id="s819">And I start to gain a little strength.</span> <span id="s820">Then I saw my, the boyfriend.</span> <span id="s821">His name is Michael.</span> <span id="s822">And he start to cry.</span> <span id="s823">He says, "I survived the war.</span> <span id="s824">I'm liberated.</span> <span id="s825">And now I'm dying.</span> <span id="s826">Help me!</span> <span id="s827">Help me!</span> <span id="s828">Help me!"</span> <span id="s829">So I went to that other friend of mine.</span> <span id="s830">We take him on a stretcher and we took him to the Red Cross over there they should take him to the hospital.</span> <span id="s831">So, they took him to a truck.</span> <span id="s832">So there was a truck over there and there was the American soldiers, there was one over there, they wanted the Americans to think, I don't know if he was a priest or what he was, a Gentile.</span> <span id="s833">So we start to talk to him.</span> <span id="s834">I knew German, a little bit, a few words of English, because my mother used to talk, teach my sister English.</span> <span id="s835">So I picked up a few words, so I understood.</span> <span id="s836">And he says to me, "If you promise me that you'll convert, to Catholicism, I will take care of you, I will see that you should come to a standing health."</span> <span id="s837">That time I got very mad and I told him, I says to him, "What difference it is?</span> <span id="s838">The same God liberated us, the same God helped us survive.</span> <span id="s839">So what difference is which God it is?"</span> <span id="s840">And luckily there was a Jewish officer also, and he understood Jewish.</span> <span id="s841">He was listening to it.</span> <span id="s842">He came over to me.</span> <span id="s843">He asked me in Jewish, "What's the, what's about?"</span> <span id="s844">So I told him, I says, "This is my boyfriend who is survived three years in concentration camps, and now he is dying.</span> <span id="s845">Please do something."</span></p> <p><span id="s846">BS: Help him.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">NF: So he took care of him.</span> <span id="s848">And he took me on the truck and they took him around thirty miles away to a German hospital.</span> <span id="s849">That Jewish officer, he told him--Michael told me--when he came in, he told the German nurses, "First of all," there was Germans, soldiers, wounded.</span> <span id="s850">"Push all of them out, and put them on different floors."</span> <span

three nights not allow him to touch him, because they had to wash him and bathe him and give him some intravenous that his stomach should come, because it was [unclear] and blocked.</span> <span

then...</span></p> <p><span id="s891">BS: And Abraham?</span> <span id="s892">Did he get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">NF: The friends, see, one of them met a girl in the camp, up at that camp.</span> <span id="s894">And she had a brother in the Israeli army.</span> <span id="s895">And then him, and the other friend, they went to Israel.</span> <span id="s896">And later on a boat we got caught.</span> <span id="s897">That time with the, the boat they got caught, the, what do you call this?</span> <span id="s898">Outside seven.</span> <span id="s899">The boat caught on Cyprus?</span> <span id="s900">Exodus.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">BS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">NF: They went the boat before that, and they came in near Haifa and they got caught but luckily the Israeli brigade came at night with little boats.</span> <span id="s903">They had to jump in the water and they smuggled them over there.</span> <span id="s904">I remained over there because I found out, I knew I had family in America and I knew I had family in Paris.</span> <span id="s905">So, I looked for my family, to go over there.</span> <span id="s906">Now, if you want I’ll

id="s913">BS: Your friends are in Israel in this one.</span> <span id="s914">So now go back to where you were in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">NF: I was in Italy in the camp in the southern part of Italy.</span> <span id="s916">The name of the camp was Santo Deseria [phonetic].</span> <span id="s917">I lived until October, 1947.</span> <span id="s918">Then an uncle in Paris made out papers for me and he paid for my trip to come to Paris.</span> <span id="s919">As, see he is, he was a manufacturer for ladies' clothes and sorts, so he made out papers for me to come to work for him as a tailor.</span> <span id="s920">I couldn't work in my profession as a tanner in the tannery, because the French laws forbid for a foreigner can change trades.</span> <span id="s921">So I worked for him.</span> <span id="s922">I lived with his family over there, till 19--from October 1947 till October, '51.</span> <span id="s923">There I learned the trade from the tailoring and the clothing line and became a cutter, a clothing cutter and a clothing marketer.</span> <span id="s924">While I was there, my family from America, the uncles, aunts, and cousins, they wanted very badly I should come to the United States.</span> <span id="s925">I wasn't sure what to do.</span> <span id="s926">So my uncle told me, "Why don't you go over there and see how things are?</span> <span id="s927">If you have any problems, you come back."</span> <span id="s928">When I arrived to Paris from Italy, the HIAS helped me to get the papers to stay in Paris.</span> <span id="s929">I got such a good papers from my uncle requesting that right away they let me stay for three years.</span> <span id="s930">So the girl in the HIAS asked me, "Whom do you know in Paris who made out such a good papers for you?"</span> <span id="s931">After that I got papers for ten years to stay there.</span> <span id="s932">When I came to the United States I made a visa for one year to stay over here.</span> <span id="s933">And in case I want to go back to France, I could.</span> <span id="s934">I came to the United States.</span> <span id="s935">Unfortunately, in the beginning, times were very bad for me.</span> <span id="s936">I couldn't find work in my trade.</span> <span id="s937">That time was a lot of seasonal jobs.</span> <span id="s938">I worked a little bit then I got laid off.</span> <span id="s939">I didn't have enough money to keep myself going.</span> <span id="s940">And I was very disillusioned.</span> <span id="s941">And I was about to go back to Paris.</span> <span id="s942">Well, at that time, I was three months in the United States when I met my wife [chuckling] and somehow I moved from New York to Philadelphia, and I found a job in the needle trade.</span> <span id="s943">I was making out better making a living myself and I decided that I should stay over here.</span> <span id="s944">And within 15 months after I arrived over here, October 29, 1951, in May of 1953, we got married in the Bronx, New York.</span> <span id="s945">And luckily, see, then I moved to Philadelphia permanently, as the life was a little quieter than in New York.</span> <span id="s946">And I was blessed later on to have a son, born in '55, Jacob Sidney Form.</span> <span id="s947">And in 1958, I was blessed to have a daughter born, named Sharon Marlyn Form.</span> <span id="s948">And I'm very thankful that I am able to come here, to make a living, to become a family, and continue a normal life.</span> <span id="s949">[weeping] Therefore, I feel in the beginning I was very against tell stories as my survival has brought me a lot of agonies, a lot of nightmares.</span> <span id="s950">And I didn't want to talk too much about the happenings during the war, that I survived, and how things were happening.</span> <span id="s951">Many times my children used to ask me I should tell them things.</span> <span id="s952">Because also they studied in school about it and they want to know about it.</span> <span id="s953">But I tried to avoid because I don't want to bring the bad memories of my experience into their lives.</span> <span id="s954">But as I was now and get older, and a lot of the survivors are dying out, and within another couple of years be very few left, of us to tell the stories what happened to us.</span> <span id="s955">Therefore, I'm, I decided I should tell my horrible experiences for the future generations to come that they should know what the Nazi, Nazis, what atrocities they did to the human people, how hu--how one human being should become a beast, not inhuman toward other people.</span> <span id="s956">The things that I saw, and that I survived were, well, I had to do.</span> <span id="s957">There is one episode stands out in my life.</span> <span id="s958">When I was in the Gestapo camp Rabka in 1942, they brought a whole family over there, maybe 18 people, women, children, and other woman.</span> <span id="s959">And we had to dig a grave for them.</span> <span id="s960">And I was standing aside watching them.</span> <span id="s961">And they had to cross a little ditch to go to the forest, to their graves.</span> <span id="s962">And they knew that they're going to be shot.</span> <span id="s963">There was a mother, with two small children.</span> <span id="s964">One, one she was holding in her arms and one she was holding with her hand.</span> <span id="s965">There was a young girl, maybe 17, 18 years old.</span> <span id="s966">As she crossed that ditch, she was singing and laughing as she was going to the death.</span> <span id="s967">So the German S.S. man says to her, "Do you know where you are going?"</span> <span id="s968">She says, "I know.</span> <span id="s969">You're gonna kill me."</span> <span id="s970">He says, "Why you so happy?"</span> <span id="s971">She says, "I want to show you how a Polish girl, a Jew, is going to her death."</span> <span id="s972">And I was standing around 30 feet away and I heard all this was around, all this commotion.</span> <span id="s973">Then I had to go down in the grave.</span> <span id="s974">Here I saw them alive, and ten minutes later I had to go down and bury them.</span> <span id="s975">And this episode stays with me [weeping] for the rest of my life.</span> <span id="s976">That's the reason in 1964 I was called from the German Consulate to come to the German Consulate over here in Philadelphia Twelfth and Arch Street.</span> <span id="s977">They sent a German lawyer to interview all the survivors from that Rabka Gestapo camp.</span> <span id="s978">And he asked me questions.</span> <span id="s979">He showed me pictures from that forest, from the graves.</span> <span id="s980">And he wanted to see if I was actually there.</span> <span id="s981">So he showed me pictures from that, that murderer Rosenbaum.</span> <span id="s982">Unfortunately, I didn't recognize him, because he was a handsome young man around 25 and he was that time there in uniform.</span> <span id="s983">And so many years later, my memory faded.</span> <span id="s984">But the rest of the places, I remember exactly where everything was.</span> <span id="s985">And while he interviewed me I almost passed out from when I saw all these things.</span> <span id="s986">And I felt very bad.</span> <span id="s987">We had a recess then he came back for me after lunch.</span> <span id="s988">He says to me, "They caught him and he is in prison.</span> <span id="s989">There'll be a trial.</span> <span id="s990">We would like very much you should come to Germany to testify against him.</span> <span id="s991">Otherwise they'll let him free."</span> <span id="s992">I said to him, "You see how I feel now.</span> <span id="s993">It reacts very bad on me on my nerves and my own condition.</span> <span id="s994">I would rather not go back over there, bring back all these memories that I survived, that I witnessed, in that camp and someplace else."</span> <span id="s995">Then the German lawyer says to me, "How will you be able to live the rest of your life with your conscience, if the German government sends me around to Israel to [unclear] to Australia to find survivors?</span> <span id="s996">You are such important witness.</span> <span id="s997">As Rosenbaum denied that he ever had a gun in his hand to ever kill them, anybody.</span> <span id="s998">You saw him holding a gun up on your friend and he jumped on the grave and want to kill your friend."</span> <span id="s999">He says, "Can you let go by like this, things like this?"</span> <span id="s1000">Then I told the lawyer, "I'll leave it up to the German court to decide whatever they feel I should do."</span> <span id="s1001">In 1968, in April, my son was Bar Mitzvahed.</span> <span id="s1002">A week later I got a letter from the German court, from the judge.</span> <span id="s1003">They pressed me I should come to the trial, to Germany.</span> <span id="s1004">I wrote to the judge, "I'd rather not go, as to bring up terrible memories from the back and face the murderers and all these things."</span> <span id="s1005">But, I leave it up to him, to his discretion.</span> <span id="s1006">If he feels that my testimony is so important that he should be convicted and pay for this, all these terrible things what he did over there and other places in the world, then I'm going to go.</span> <span id="s1007">Three weeks later I got a plane ticket, the reservations over there to come to Germany to apply.</span> <span id="s1008">And I was the first witness at that trial.</span> <span id="s1009">That Rosenbaum was sitting a couple of feet away from me, in civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s1010">Unfortunately I didn't recognize.</span> <span id="s1011">I didn't know if he was.</span> <span id="s1012">He interrogated me.</span> <span id="s1013">He cross-examined me, as he had all the dates, the dates from the weeks, the months, and the years.</span> <span id="s1014">I had only vague memories.</span> <span id="s1015">And he contradicted me, going to show that I was not actually at these particular times in that time.</span> <span id="s1016">When I came to the trial, the pressure for the Germans what's for they asked me, would I like to speak in German or in Polish or in English.</span> <span id="s1017">I told them I'd rather speak in English.</span> <span id="s1018">As I understand German, when they were talking back and forth, I had time to think over and to realize what I should say.</span> <span id="s1019">I didn't realize that he was cross-examining me.</span> <span id="s1020">I didn't, so I told the judge, "The only time I knew about the time, when it was snowing then it was winter time.</span> <span id="s1021">When the snow melted and the leaves start to come and the grass out, it was spring.</span> <span id="s1022">When it was very hot it was summer.</span> <span id="s1023">When the leaves fell down from the trees it was fall.</span> <span id="s1024">We lived like animals over there.</span> <span id="s1025">We didn't know the days, the months.</span> <span id="s1026">Therefore I couldn't say exactly which day of the month.</span> <span id="s1027">If some in my testimony of the dates are not correct, according to contradiction, I don't have the exact dates."</span> <span id="s1028">When I, when the recess, in the trial, lunch time we had a recess.</span> <span id="s1029">I went down the hall way.</span> <span id="s1030">The Jewish [unclear] come over to me.</span> <span id="s1031">He says, "Nathan, how do you allow that murderer Rosenbaum to cross-examine you?"</span> <span id="s1032">I says, "To whom you talking about?"</span> <span id="s1033">He said to me, "Don't you know he's sitting six feet away from you!?</span> <span id="s1034">This is Rosenbaum!"</span> <span id="s1035">Then I got very mad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">BS: So he was cross-examining you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">NF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1038">Then I was very mad and almost didn't want to testify any more.</span> <span id="s1039">But then the prosecutor took me aside and told me, "If you'll start to act hostile towards him, then we have to cross out all your testimony.</span> <span id="s1040">As according to the German court, German law, a guilty person is allowed to cross-examine the witness."</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">BS: Hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">NF: So he said, "It's a good thing you didn't recognize him, either that you didn't refuse to testify against him.</span> <span id="s1043">Otherwise your whole testimony would be null and void."</span> <span id="s1044">Then, when they started to cross-examine me, at the episode about that particular point what I had mentioned before, when he had, when he had the gun and he want to shoot my friend, when we had to bury the father and mother and daughter, he, and his lawyer, tried to pin me down to a testimony.</span> <span id="s1045">He asked me, "Do you remember what color hair the girl had?"</span> <span id="s1046">When I heard that, I start to cry and I fainted, and I couldn't talk for ten minutes.</span> <span id="s1047">Then I says to him, "If you were in my place, would you remember what happened?</span> <span id="s1048">When I went down, got in and pushed my friend out, and I had to turn them over, I was in a daze.</span> <span id="s1049">I didn't know how I came out from that grave and how I was, remained alive."</span> <span id="s1050">And after three days' testimony I was, I finished over there, some older Germans came over in the hallway, took my hand, shook my hand, and says, "Thank you for coming over here.</span> <span id="s1051">It's such a painful thing that you tell us.</span> <span id="s1052">We didn't know that our people could be such, do such a horrible things," the older German people told to me.</span> <span id="s1053">Yet we had the feeling over there, when I was in Germany, that somehow, whoever turned on the, I don't know, maybe this girl's father was S.S. Maybe her brother was S.S.</span> <span id="s1054">But the feeling so I want to get out from there as soon as, as soon as possible.</span> <span id="s1055">He was kept eight mo--eight years in prison before the trial.</span> <span id="s1056">After he was convicted to life in prison, he made an appeal to the ju--World Court in The Hague for inhuman treatments that they kept him eight years in prison before the trial.</span> <span id="s1057">Yet, he was, his name was on the list in Yad Vashem as one of the most wanted murderers.</span> <span id="s1058">And that's the reason why, why he was convicted.</span> <span id="s1059">Cause they wanted...</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">BS: So he started the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">NF: And they wanted me I should come to testify because he denied he ever had a gun and he would shoot anybody, that whatever he did, he was, had orders from above to do these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">BS: And he served eight years?</span> <span id="s1063">That's it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">NF: No he, after that, he was, he served eight years before the court in 1960.</span> <span id="s1065">Yet, the, when the German lawyer was here, in, in the Consulate, he says to me, "If you would met him, so when he came right back after the war he never changed his name.</span> <span id="s1066">He remained with the name William Rosenbaum.</span> <span id="s1067">And he got very, became a successful businessman, became a church-going person."</span> <span id="s1068">He says, "You could see the rest on, eat with him, talk to him, you'd think he's the nicest person that can be."</span> <span id="s1069">And they would, he could live out his life and nobody would know about him.</span> <span id="s1070">But unfortunately he became very greedy.</span> <span id="s1071">In 1958 or '5--'60, [unclear] government, they treated all German prisoners who were wounded in the war, they allowed to file for compensation as a, how you say, a reparational, like a..</span> <span id="s1072">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">BS: Oh I, I know it, what was that called?</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">NF: What's the word?</span> <span id="s1075">[someone: "Pension?"]</span> <span id="s1076">For pension yeah talk--for a pension, for a pension as a..</span> <span id="s1077">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">BS: Reparations is the word.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">NF: Pension because he was wounded in the war.</span> <span id="s1080">Because after the camps were liquidated he was sent to the Russian front, in '44 he was shot in his leg and he was limping.</span> <span id="s1081">But he was greedy for the money.</span> <span id="s1082">When he came, applied for the pension, they took his name and his history.</span> <span id="s1083">So he applied, "S.S. Sturmführer Wilhelm Rosenbaum."</span> <span id="s1084">They start to look up the files and they send a copy of that to Yad Vashem.</span> <span id="s1085">Right away, the Israeli governments in Yad Vashem sent back to the German government in Hamburg, "He is the most wanted criminal for the atrocity what he did in that camp.</span> <span id="s1086">Please don't let him go."</span> <span id="s1087">When he came back the second time he filled out more papers, and he still is, didn't know that, that the German prison is waiting for him.</span> <span id="s1088">He says, "Come with us."</span> <span id="s1089">And that time they put in prison there.</span> <span id="s1090">They was afraid, they were afraid that once he goes away, he finds out that all the suspicion, they'll never catch him anymore, like the rest of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1091">And this way he got caught.</span> <span id="s1092">And, and probably, I hope he's still in prison, paying for all these atrocities what he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">BS: [unclear].</span> <span id="s1094">O.K.</span> <span id="s1095">We come now, we're, Mr. Form is living in America and as you know has a nice family and a grandson.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">NF: Now you want my son to say something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">BS: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">NF: He should say something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">BS: Excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">NF: Do have some, some, other questions you want me to ask?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">BS: I think that's the end of our interview for right now.</span> <span id="s1102">I want to thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">NF: I want, I want to say I'm thankful [weeping] to the American government and the people who, [unclear] to be, a wonderful country, America, to be free over here and to be able to live in freedom and have a family and enjoy the rest of my years over here in freedom, and my wife and children and my little grandson eight months old.</span></p></body></html>
