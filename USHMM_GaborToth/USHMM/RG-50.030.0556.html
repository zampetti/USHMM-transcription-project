id="s15">Can you tell me where and when you were born, and what your name was at birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: I was born in – in Horodenka, Poland, which is now the Ukraine, and I was born on April 25th, 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s18">And what was your name at birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: Rena Koch.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s21">And what was your family like?</span> <span id="s22">What did your parents do for a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: My father owned a textile store, my mother was with him in the business, and we had the housekeeper at home.</span> <span id="s24">And I had an older brother, who was four – four years older than I was, and we – basically, she took care of us at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Was your family religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Well, my father went, you know, in – in Europe basically most people were religious, at least that’s what I was aware of.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Mm-hm, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: My father did go to temple, and prayed every morning and did go to temple on Saturdays.</span> <span id="s29">Of course, kept kosher.</span> <span id="s30">And I wasn’t really aware of that much more of what religious meant; I thought all Jews were religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: So you celebrated the holidays, and – and –</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: Yes, oh, definitely, this was part of –</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: – and Shabbat, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: – Shabbat, yeah, that was a-all part of life and I felt that that’s the way it has to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: So, how old were you when you s – did you start school where you –</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: I never started s –</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: You never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: – I never went to school until after we were liberated.</span> <span id="s39">So basically, at that point I was almost nine years old before I went to school, without knowing how to read or write.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: So, when the war started, you – you were on the Soviet side, or you were on the Polish side?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: We were on the Polish side, and then the – the Soviets came in in – I guess in 1940, maybe, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: And tha – and of course, and then the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s44">The Soviets, we were a little bit afraid of the Soviets, not to be taken to – my father was afraid that they’d take him to Russia, whatever.</span> <span id="s45">And we thought that maybe ca – jer – he thought that maybe ki – when the Germans came in, they didn’t – they weren't going to harm Polish Jews, only their own Jews, you know, maybe in Germany.</span> <span id="s46">But of course we discovered very quickly otherwise.</span> <span id="s47">And after awhile, which I don’t really remember how long, they formed a ghetto in my hometown, and everybody from all the villages and different neighborhoods – our house was in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s48">And many people came to live with us, and there was a lot of starvation.</span> <span id="s49">Cause I remember people basically dying, I don’t know how long it took after the ghetto was forming, but on our doorstep there would be dead people that have – from hunger, you know.</span> <span id="s50">And they were looking in garbage cans for potato peels or onion peels.</span> <span id="s51">And we basically, since we were in our hometown, I imagine my – my parents may have stored some food, so I don’t remember being hungry at that point.</span> <span id="s52">Maybe I was too young to remember hunger, you know, and then we had three acti – akcjas they call it, you know.</span> <span id="s53">The first one we – we had relatives outside of town, they – we went there, to outside of town.</span> <span id="s54">My father, I think, remained in town, but my grandfather, when we came back, we discovered my father’s father was killed, right across the street.</span> <span id="s55">He was shot right across the street from our house.</span> <span id="s56">And then the second one, we went into hiding someplace outside of the city.</span> <span id="s57">But the third one, my father brought us to a Christian family, and he – they said that all workers should come and register, and he felt that he was young and strong, and he was going to register.</span> <span id="s58">And after a day or two, he will come and get us.</span> <span id="s59">And it took about a week and he never came back.</span> <span id="s60">So my mother worried, she took us out and we started walking out – out of the – their – wherever they hid us, in their barn.</span> <span id="s61">And they were shotti – shooting after us, you know, when we – they saw that we were, you know, Jews, I guess.</span> <span id="s62">And we went back to our home, but eventually this akcja must have stopped, or whatever, but they came into our house and they chased us out.</span> <span id="s63">Out of the house.</span> <span id="s64">And I was, you know, very young, but my mother told me to grab – she had a – her girdle, which she had gold dollars sewn into it – to take that.</span> <span id="s65">As a child I was able to sneak by with that.</span> <span id="s66">And this is basically – that eventually saved our life.</span> <span id="s67">And then they made Judenfrei, our town was Judenfrei, but my grandmother on my father’s side had survived, and then an aunt, my father’s sister.</span> <span id="s68">And we went into the woods, and we – I guess my mother must have known that across this river, was called the Kinester(ph), there were Jews, were still Jews there.</span> <span id="s69">And you – you were able to get there.</span> <span id="s70">So we were in the woods right acro – from the river, and hiding in there, and a young student came across.</span> <span id="s71">He knew my mother, and he said, you hide, he says, but during the night when the water gets shallow or whatever, he says, I will come and – and take you across.</span> <span id="s72">He carried me across, because I was the youngest one.</span> <span id="s73">My brother, my mother, my aunt and my grandmother, they walked across with packages, if they had – whatever they had.</span> <span id="s74">And we came to a little town, Potok Złoty, and before we know it, you know, a couple of days later, they made Judenfrei over there.</span> <span id="s75">And we went on to Buczacz, and in Buczacz we lived with a family that was in the ghetto, there was a ghetto there.</span> <span id="s76">And there were also many akcjas and I remember that we always had to watch at night, people were watching.</span> <span id="s77">And I would go out during the day, of course, and play with other children.</span> <span id="s78">And right after the akcja I’d come out and they’d say, the children are dead, they’re – they’re gone.</span> <span id="s79">Or – and one day I came out and I saw a wagon full of dead children, with bleed – blood coming out of the – the wagon.</span> <span id="s80">You know, when – so I was always ready, I was afraid I’d be left behind, being the – the youngest one.</span> <span id="s81">So as soon as they – I’d be – at night or whatever, I’d be the first one to get dressed and hold onto my mother to go into hiding.</span> <span id="s82">And basically after this – you know, after – I’m – I’m not sure of how much time passed, they made that town Judenfrei, and my – and we had an-another little town, my ki – father’s relatives, cousins were there, and they – I don’t how they communicated with my mother, but she decided to go there.</span> <span id="s83">And we went to Kopyczynce was that name.</span> <span id="s84">And we went in – we stayed with them.</span> <span id="s85">And of course then it started over there; the – the killings started over there.</span> <span id="s86">And my f – relatives’ son, they – he was 17 or 18 years old, with other boys they built a bunker from that house that we lived in to under the street, and we felt it was very safe, you know, in the basement it was camouflaged, in the basement, and we were there.</span> <span id="s87">There were a couple of akcjas there, but this was like the last one.</span> <span id="s88">We we – all went into this bunker, we were 30 some odd people that went in there.</span> <span id="s89">And they must – they built a air – you know, some type of air, to give us air in the street.</span> <span id="s90">And either the noise or whatever, they discovered that we – that there was a – that we – there was a bunker under there, so they started digging from the other side the street and came in that side.</span> <span id="s91">And then they realized that there had to be an opening in a – in the house, you know, that we – how we got in there.</span> <span id="s92">So they discovered us on both sides.</span> <span id="s93">They pulled everybody out, and they started throwing hand grenades into the bunker.</span> <span id="s94">And basically, I don’t know what happened to my mother, she either, you know, went to another part of the bunker, whatever.</span> <span id="s95">A – but I was holding onto my brother.</span> <span id="s96">And people died, and the dead bodies fell on top of us.</span> <span id="s97">And when it had quieted down, people came to rob, you know, the dead, to see what was there.</span> <span id="s98">And they hit my brother over the head with an axe, you know, to tr – they thought that he was still alive.</span> <span id="s99">But I was covered with bodies, so they pulled my foot, and they pulled off my shoe.</span> <span id="s100">And basically, I survived with that one shoe on, through the war.</span> <span id="s101">And then we – we – when – after we were discovered, we were the only ones, they thought we were already dead, or whatever, they were all dead people.</span> <span id="s102">At night we snuck out of there, went into a – into another building, out onto a roof.</span> <span id="s103">We stayed there for a long time without any food.</span> <span id="s104">Being the youngest one, my mother worried, you know, my – my throat was closing up from not eating or drinking.</span> <span id="s105">But there was like a – a – a rusty tub, or whatever with the – with the water was leaking from the roof.</span> <span id="s106">And she found a straw and made me drink the water with a st – through a straw, because it was feathers and dirt in that water.</span> <span id="s107">And then we were discovered there.</span> <span id="s108">But if – they only robbed us.</span> <span id="s109">There were some other people from the bunker that survived, another three men, I think wi-with us.</span> <span id="s110">And – you know, and they let us – they – they told us, this is the end, they’re gonna – going to keep killing until all the Jews are gone, he says.</span> <span id="s111">But there is a labor camp outside of – of – that some Jews are working on the labor – in the labor camp outside of town.</span> <span id="s112">To us, of course, it was a strange town, we weren’t there very long.</span> <span id="s113">It was a ghetto – walled ghetto.</span> <span id="s114">But we – these two men that were with us on that roof came down with us and looked for a place to go over the wall.</span> <span id="s115">And they found like an old couch or a chair, I don’t know what it was, and my mother was able, and my brother, to get over.</span> <span id="s116">They threw me over the – th – over the fence, and we started running away from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s117">And it was – a man was leading a cow, so he told the guards at the – the gate, the Jews were escaping, and they start – they shot after us.</span> <span id="s118">Well, we were able to get to – I think one of the man got – you know, was shot, but we were able to get into the fields, and there was – the wheat was very high, and we hid there for a couple of days in – my mother had the feeling that we were heading towards that labor camp where Jews were still working.</span> <span id="s119">We got there and we – we s – we got there at night and there was nobody, the Jews used to run away at night.</span> <span id="s120">They were always afraid that at night they’d come and get them.</span> <span id="s121">We were in a building that wasn’t quite finished yet.</span> <span id="s122">They came to rob us again, and they – my mother had – at this point she had slipped the gold dollars into her shoes, she wore a high, like a boot, and they touched her boot that it was there.</span> <span id="s123">So they hit her to get off the boot and she refused.</span> <span id="s124">She said, we’ll scream.</span> <span id="s125">They were allowed to kill Jews, but they weren’t allowed to rob.</span> <span id="s126">So they got scared and ran away.</span> <span id="s127">And then morning came, and my mother went into the camp, into that labor camp and ta – find out if she could work there.</span> <span id="s128">And the man that was in charge of labor – my mother happened to have been a beautiful blonde woman, so he picked her she could wash the floor in her – in his office.</span> <span id="s129">And he started talking to her, and he said, you know, you could pass as a Polish woman.</span> <span id="s130">So she says, but I have two children.</span> <span id="s131">So he said, two children, he says, do you have a – so she says, I have a son and a daughter.</span> <span id="s132">Says well, no son, I cannot help you with a son, but with a daughter.</span> <span id="s133">But a couple of days later he said to her, I – if you have any money left, he says, if you have any money, I have a friend that would be willing to hide you outside into – in a – outside in another farm.</span> <span id="s134">And my mother said she didn’t – she was afraid to say that she had the money with her.</span> <span id="s135">But she said, I have money in the ghetto, and I will sneak back in the ghetto and dig it out.</span> <span id="s136">She wanted to make sure that he meant it.</span> <span id="s137">And sure enough, he did have a friend, he sends a worker from that other farm to pick us up, you know, to – to take us – he wanted gold dollars, he didn’t want – so we were very lucky to have gold and not paper money.</span> <span id="s138">And they took us to this other f – to this other farm, or to – you know what – what it was, it was – was a lot of people working for him, he was like the boss.</span> <span id="s139">And they put us in the room, they – it was an empty building.</span> <span id="s140">And there was a man that was assigned to bring us food or take out our waste, or whatever.</span> <span id="s141">And he – the man didn’t tell us that he was Jewish passing himself off as a – he was the bookkeeper on that farm.</span> <span id="s142">But he was a Jew, and he passed himself off as a – you know, as a non Jew, but he was the one to provide us whenever he could.</span> <span id="s143">I mean, mostly it was potatoes.</span> <span id="s144">And being the youngest one after we were there for eight months, and then they started – rumors were he ki – brought back rumors saying that the Russians were coming, that the Russians were winning the war, and they were coming closer.</span> <span id="s145">And the partisans were in the woods, we were hoping we’d get liberated.</span> <span id="s146">But eventually, of course, the – the war came closer, and I think that they – that somebody must have discovered that there may be Jews in there.</span> <span id="s147">So they moved us to a still.</span> <span id="s148">But the – and the still in – these big barrels in a still, and – and then we went up to the – the roof, I don’t – and they were going to bomb the Germans when they were leaving, they were going to bomb that buildings because they didn’t want the Russians to get ahold of the liquor that was in there.</span> <span id="s149">And we heard them talking outside, you know, that this is next, they were going to [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s150">And then the bombs started falling all around, they ran away.</span> <span id="s151">And we didn’t really know if we were – if the Russians were coming, if the rai – so we stayed there for quite awhile with no food or anything, because they – they couldn’t bring it to us over there.</span> <span id="s152">Eventually they came and they told us you’re liberated, you’re free.</span> <span id="s153">And at that point I was swollen, my stomach and my feet were swollen.</span> <span id="s154">And we got outside and we hitched a ride with the Russian soldiers as they were advancing to the next town.</span> <span id="s155">And – and that town they were – some Jews started coming out of – you know, there were a couple of families came out of hiding, and we stayed there.</span> <span id="s156">So basically, that was our liberation.</span> <span id="s157">And then we started running because the war was going on right near us.</span> <span id="s158">We tried to go closer to the Russian border.</span> <span id="s159">And other people were coming out of labor camps, and they had typhus, and my mother and I both got typhus.</span> <span id="s160">And we – that part is completely like way – vague in my mind.</span> <span id="s161">I know that I couldn’t walk, that I lost my hair.</span> <span id="s162">But I, you know – and eventually, as it quieted down, we worked ourselves back to our hometown, hoping that there would somebody be left, somebody would be – you know, we didn’t know what – the fate of my father, we just –</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: – knew that he didn’t come back, and my mother’s sisters, grandmothers, everybody.</span> <span id="s165">You know, so we came back to town and some Jews finally unfil – you know, came back.</span> <span id="s166">Some of the Jews that – we stayed there for awhile, and that’s when the first – when it got a little bit – they wanted the children to go to school –</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: – so that was my first experience to go to school.</span> <span id="s169">And it was a Polish school at that point –</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: – but it was the Russians – within weeks they changed it to Russian school.</span> <span id="s172">And then we ha – we – since we were Polish citizens, we – we were able to get – go to Poland, since this became Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Mm-hm, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: And they got us onto trains, you know, we got into a train, you know, all the Jews, and we were – went to Poland.</span> <span id="s175">And in Poland we were in Bytom, in a town Bytom.</span> <span id="s176">And without having schooling, and I was – guess there was no food, my mother put us in an orphanage in – in Poland.</span> <span id="s177">I forgot the name of the town.</span> <span id="s178">But next – ex – actually, the next [indecipherable] there wasn’t much food in that orphanage.</span> <span id="s179">The next town, and the next, it – we went to an orphanage in Zabrze, and the – and stayed there, but th-the funny part is, when I went to Houston, I – some people came and they were searching for people, they fa – had – had a picture of – when they didn’t remember of why they were there –</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: – of what they were there, and I was in the picture with them.</span> <span id="s182">So actu – there’s one woman here, Ida from Chicago, who we found each other in Houston through one of these meetings.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Oh wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: And there was another man, George Hoffman, he’s not here today, we were in that orphanage.</span> <span id="s185">And eventually we left, of course, for Germany.</span> <span id="s186">And I was in the DP camp in Bad Reichenhall in Germany.</span> <span id="s187">Went to a school as – there was Zionist organizations formed, I was really hoping as a – as a young child to go to Israel, you know, I wanted to be – to be a soldier or whatever.</span> <span id="s188">But my mother put is in the – in the orphanage Preen(ph), which many children it was like a transit thing to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s189">So as the – of the orphans quota we – I came in 1949, I came to the United States, and was sent to Minneapolis as a foster child.</span> <span id="s190">And I lived with a Jewish family until my mother came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: And was your brother with you, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: My brother was with – with me all this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: So you two were together the whole time.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: He was – together, thi – that time, yeah –</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: – we were all together at that point, just my brother and I.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: There are a lot of people here that have been to Preen(ph) yeah, which was – yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s200">Did you ever find out what happened to your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Eventually, yes, a man in our hometown who survived, he was with my father in th – in that camp where they gathered them all when they discovered that it wasn’t really a work thing –</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: – that they were to register, but they were going to take them to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s204">My father was 41 years old, a strong man, so he s – looked out the window and he saw two policemen, Ukrainian policemen that he went to school with.</span> <span id="s205">So he spoke to one of them and he said, I have two watches with me, I’ll gladly give you my watches, and I’m gonna jump out the window.</span> <span id="s206">He didn't do it, but he pointed him out to the next man, and as he was running out the window he was shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Did any of your other family survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Basically, you know, my mother was one of seven sisters.</span> <span id="s209">I-I have one cousin.</span> <span id="s210">We were – on my mother’s side, we were 19 cousins.</span> <span id="s211">Wa – one cousin survived, he s – he lives in Florida now, too.</span> <span id="s212">And now my mother has died, my f – brother has died, and I – I have my children, that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s214">I want to go back a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: I guess this would probably be pre-war.</span> <span id="s217">What was the first thing you really – what’s the first memory you have as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Basically going visiting – to visit relatives.</span> <span id="s219">In the summertime going out to the country, and you know, all wonderful, wonderful memories, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s221">And when the war started, I guess I’m wondering –</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: I went also to pre-school at one point, and it was a Hebrew – it was a Hebrew, I guess, a Hebrew pre-school, and I was – the thing I remember is they taught us on the blackboard, you know, they made like – and they said sus(ph), so they made a – a – you make a – a – you make a circle, you make a – a straight, you know, a – a line, and a little dot, and another circle.</span> <span id="s223">And that’s sus(ph) and that means horse, that’s – that’s the extent of my education.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: That’s a good – I like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: That’s great.</span> <span id="s227">Do you remember your mother – I-I guess I’m just – you were such a young child, what – I mean, that was only, really the only life you really knew for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Do you remember your mother just being – she sounds like a very strong woman.</span> <span id="s230">Do you remember her just being terrified all the time?</span> <span id="s231">How were you – she was always looking out for you and your brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: Always looking out for – for us and –</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: – you know, fo –</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Did you get the impression that she was scared?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: [indecipherable] we were all scared –</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: – we were all scared, so I’m really not sure where the fear came out of, but the fear was constant, you know, that’s constant, of being discovered, of being you know, seen, of being left behind, of being killed, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: In fact we – in that Buczacz, in the town where I had seen these dead children on the wagon –</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: – there were some relatives of ours that were there too, and they had a baby.</span> <span id="s243">You know, they had – had a baby.</span> <span id="s244">And right after one of these akcjas my mother sent me and my brother there, to see if they’ve survived, and when we came in there, their baby was in the crib, de-dead in the crib, shot in the crib.</span> <span id="s245">You know, so that’s constantly fearing that I was youngest one, that maybe, you know – you also heard that parents ran away, left their young children.</span> <span id="s246">They wouldn’t let them into a bunker, because you may cry.</span> <span id="s247">In Buczacz we were in bunker, there was a baby that cried at us, we – they were searching and we heard them.</span> <span id="s248">The mother put a pillow over him, and he died.</span> <span id="s249">It was a baby of – six weeks old baby.</span> <span id="s250">Was – was – you know, choked right there in that bunker.</span> <span id="s251">You know, so it was always that fear of, you know, of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Was that the – I mean, was the biggest fear losing your family, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: I don’t – you know, this is so very strange that I don’t have – I was just speaking to a friend of mine who’s also – who is my age.</span> <span id="s254">She interviewed yesterday and she said, I don’t remember, did I miss my mother, father, my sisters?</span> <span id="s255">She says, how did I feel?</span> <span id="s256">I feel the same way, did I really?</span> <span id="s257">All I remember is years later, you know, if I was angry at my mother I was – always felt my father’s gonna come, he’s gonna come back.</span> <span id="s258">You know, an-and for many years actually, I was already an adult, I – knowing already that he had been killed, I always thought maybe it was wrong, he’s gonna come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: So you came to the United States and you lived with a foster family.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Fa-Fa-Family in Minneapolis.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: And how was – I mean, did they –</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: They did it mostly for money, it wasn’t, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: – they – I don’t know if they were in great need, or whatever, but they took –we were not the first set of foster children that they had taken in from this – I – I think it was the group, the Joint or the HIAS, or whoever, sent us there.</span> <span id="s265">When we got to New York, actually, they asked us if we had any family in the United States, if we wanted to stay; we had nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: So I – and it was very, very hot.</span> <span id="s268">I came from Germany in a wool outfit with wool socks, and it was like 98 degrees and humid, I had never experienced humidity before.</span> <span id="s269">And I said, just send us away, as far away from New York as possible.</span> <span id="s270">So they sent us to Minneapolis.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Did you – what language are you speaking at that point?</span> <span id="s272">Were you only speaking –</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: I – Polish and Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Polish and Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: And yeah, of course I understood maybe German, you know, wa – this is part of, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: So when you got –</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: And no English –</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: No English.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: – no English at all.</span> <span id="s282">And I remember going with my foster mother to the supermarket.</span> <span id="s283">As a child I must have been learning very quickly.</span> <span id="s284">And a man approached and asked me something, and I understood, and she was so excited that I understood what he asked me.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: So, what language were you speaking with your – with your foster family?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Yiddish –</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: – probably Yiddish, yes.</span> <span id="s289">I think Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: I have this friend of mine here and I said, you know, who – I know her from the DP camp.</span> <span id="s292">And I said, what language did we speak?</span> <span id="s293">She says, Russian.</span> <span id="s294">I says, I di – never spoke Russian, so you couldn’t have been speaking to me in Russian.</span> <span id="s295">So we m – stis – we discovered it must have been Yiddish too, that we spoke to each other, but I thought we spoke Polish, you know, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s297">And so you started going to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: I started going to school –</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: – of course they made – advanced pretty quickly.</span> <span id="s301">They put me in – in Minneapol – of course, I went to – in the DP camp, I went to school in DP camp.</span> <span id="s302">And that was a – really an accelerated course.</span> <span id="s303">So when I got to Minneapolis, I think it was sixth or seventh grade that they put me in immediately.</span> <span id="s304">I’m not sure of how well I did, but I was there.</span> <span id="s305">But coming back then later, when my mother arrived and we came back to New York, I went into ninth grade in junior high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: And there was a Jewish teacher and he must have been very – and I remember writing for Thanksgiving, it was my first Thanksgiving in the u – you know, maybe second Thanksgiving –</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: – in the United States.</span> <span id="s310">And I wrote my story in my broken English or whatever, but he praised me so much, it gave me so much courage.</span> <span id="s311">He thought that I did so well, you know, of what I was thankful for.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Yeah, that must have been – that must have been kind of – I don’t know, I guess –</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Very, very hard, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Yeah, culture shock, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Every ti – culture shock.</span> <span id="s316">Every time they call on you in class –</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: – or they put me in the – and this was in the Bronx, there was a – everybody was taking Spanish at that point.</span> <span id="s319">I had never heard Spanish before, but they handed me a book.</span> <span id="s320">And of course, reading was very easy because it’s the same as you would Polish.</span> <span id="s321">You know, I read – the teacher didn’t discover that I didn’t know any Spanish, probably for weeks.</span> <span id="s322">She just thought I was very – I read very well, better than the American children, because I – it’s the way you – phonetically.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: It was so easy for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: So you – so you went to school.</span> <span id="s326">Did you go – did you want to?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: And then I went on – then I went on to, you know, into high school, in Taft High School in the Bronx.</span> <span id="s328">But I got married, of course, very young.</span> <span id="s329">I was 17 years old when I got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s331">And how did you meet your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: I needed a dental for – for school.</span> <span id="s333">They wouldn’t give me – they wouldn’t – you had to go – you know, you wouldn’t get a grade in gym, unless you got a dental.</span> <span id="s334">So I went – my mother took me along to a dentist, and he spoke Yiddish, and that’s why my mother, of course, chose him.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: And he was a young man, and he said, if – I’ll only give you a dental if you’ll meet my cousin.</span> <span id="s337">And this was his cousin, and eventually I married him.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s339">You hear a lot of stories like that, it’s – it’s so neat, and how everybody was matchmaking through – throughout New York.</span> <span id="s340">Did you – did you eventually grow to like New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: I never really got to liking New York.</span> <span id="s342">I mean, of course I di – eventually, we lived in the Bronx and I had children and everything.</span> <span id="s343">But I was very happy when I – when we moved away.</span> <span id="s344">We moved away to – first to Rutland county, and eventually we, for many years we lived in Poughkeepsie, New York.</span> <span id="s345">I was very happy outside of – I also didn’t mingle that much with – because there weren’t that many survivors, you know, my husband was American, so I didn’t mingle that much with, you know – but I was happy, I blended – I thought I blended in, I – I n – I never admit it.</span> <span id="s346">If they didn’t ask me, I never said I was a survivor unless they asked me.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s348">And so you don’t really remember di –</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: What –</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: You know, that’s always – always one – something I – I wonder about is, how did you explain it to people when they did ask, who didn’t know about it, necessarily?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: People knew, but I – I basically never told my children never told my husband.</span> <span id="s352">This is – today is the first time that I’m ready to speak about it.</span> <span id="s353">I – when they called me from Spielberg, when they would come to town, three times I cancelled my appointment.</span> <span id="s354">I never – I still don’t feel very comfortable, and my children know it.</span> <span id="s355">They’ve never asked, because they felt it was painful for me.</span> <span id="s356">But now I have one of – little grandson, who – he lives in Houston.</span> <span id="s357">He – I think his parents came back of seeing a movie about the Holocaust, and th – we discussed it, and he realized that it was me.</span> <span id="s358">So since then he’s been prodding me, when can you tell me the story?</span> <span id="s359">I always tell him, not today, hi – I’m not – not today, some other time.</span> <span id="s360">And every time I come to town, or he comes, he says, I – is – is this the time yet?</span> <span id="s361">And I always say not yet –</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: – it’s not – the time is not yet.</span> <span id="s364">In fact, I remember going to a Seder one time, and one of the young – the – asked me, knowing that I was a survivor, asked me some questions, and I – and I told him a couple of things that had happened to me, and my husband sat there and he was amazed that he had never – after many years being married, he had never heard this from me.</span> <span id="s365">And he also never questioned me of what I went through.</span> <span id="s366">My mother did a little talking, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: – and she spoke to my children too, but I –</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: When you ra – and did your brother talk about it?</span> <span id="s370">Did you and your brother talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: My brother – my bro – no, we never spoke about it.</span> <span id="s372">The two of us to – to – to each other, we never spoke about it.</span> <span id="s373">But I think my brother was a little bit more affected by it, whatever.</span> <span id="s374">He was a little depressed, he was – he got married, he had a family, but he definitely had a lot of the syndromes that I see in survivors.</span> <span id="s375">He was – he was four years older than I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: He was definitely, I felt, more affected by it.</span> <span id="s378">In fact, I don’t even like when people, you know, whatever is wrong with me, when people thi – say, you know, oh, it must be due to the Holocaust, I don’t like to –</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: – blame this on the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: And you never experienced any kind of like nightmares or anything like that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Oh yes, yes, yes, they – to this day I get, you know, and I’m amazed that after many years, you know, I find myself running, or you know, or – or shooting, yes, I – I do.</span> <span id="s383">The nightmares have never really stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s385">I – I want to go back a little bit to moving from town to town.</span> <span id="s386">You were – you said you were ready at any moment to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: To go or to hide or whatever, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: To hide, to hide.</span> <span id="s389">It – if it – do you remember at any point just getting tired of – of moving, or wanting, liking a particular place where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Oh, yes, yes, every time, every time we would get settled as a child, you know, if we had a room, I was, in my little ways, I would take a – a kerchief and cover the table, I wanted it to be ours, you know.</span> <span id="s391">Like to set the table, to do something to decorate it, to make it ours, because we never – never experienced that, definitely.</span> <span id="s392">Every place that – if we stayed for long period – a longer period of time, eva – I wanted this to be my home, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Do you remember how long you stayed in the – in the – the longest time you stayed in one place?</span> <span id="s394">Do you –</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Well, once we started running, it wasn’t really – I can’t – I don’t really –</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Right, right, so young.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: – I can’t tell the time, I can’t tell the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: But it was just –</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: I know that, you know, over – from 1942, basically to the last month – to the – to the – we were liberated in March, the end of March of 1940 – ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: So we were in all these places, but I can’t – I don’t know of how long in each place, I really can’t tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s403">And did you have – did y – were you la – allowed to bring something that was yours –</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: I never had a toy –</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: [indecipherable] Never had a toy.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: – never had a toy.</span> <span id="s407">Never had – basically, most times we didn’t have a s – didn’t have a pencil.</span> <span id="s408">And so when we were hidden, you know, my mother tried to, you know, take a straw and try to, like do something with me, or – or teach me numbers, you know, talk to me about numbers.</span> <span id="s409">I never learned the alphabet, of course, until after we were liberated, or learned to read.</span> <span id="s410">But she tried to – numbers, you know, addition, subtraction.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: She tried even the multiplication tables, you know, to teach me.</span> <span id="s413">This was all because most of the time, nothing.</span> <span id="s414">I never had –</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Do you remember any of the people that you were hidden with?</span> <span id="s416">Have you – have you gone back to Poland to look where they were, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: No, I’ve never been back to that part of Poland</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: You’ve never been back.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: I’ve been back to Warsaw, but I – Warsaw was not a – you know, for me, no meaning, it’s just because I took a tour, and it went through –</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Right, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: – Warsaw, I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: But you – have you –</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A:

easy, whatever else –</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: – but there are people from my hometown in Israel who said at one point they were going to make a trip, and I said that I would love to go to.</span> <span id="s429">But I don’t think it ever happened.</span> <span id="s430">They may have gone individually, but that’s never happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: And the people that you were in hiding with – well, I went back to this –</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Well, I –</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: – to this – to the farm.</span></p>

<p><span id="s436">A: I – yes, my mother – my father’s cousin, whose family – whose son had built a bunker for us, his family at that point got killed too, and he was with us, and he’s the one probably that helped us jump over that fence –</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: – or to ma – he was hidden, and eventually my mother married him, after the war, my mother married my – married him.</span> <span id="s439">And he was a first cousin of my father’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s441">And the other families that were working on the farm, were they – were they –</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Oh, we never saw –</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: You never saw –</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: – we never saw,

people who were in the bunker, do you have memories of any of the people who you were hit – hidden with, in some of the larger places, or were you always just separated out when you were in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: No, no, we were with o – with other people –</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: – but they didn’t survive, you

speak all this time that has passed, and I have not spoken.</span> <span id="s469">And this is why I am here today to tell my story as best I can.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s471">Is it because you never talked about it with your family, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: I f – I felt guilty, I’ve been feeling guilty about it that I can’t talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: It’s not that I am trying not to talk –</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: – about it, it’s just that I can’t do it.</span> <span id="s477">I couldn’t – and yet I feel guilty that I should pass it on to my children, and now the gr – my grandchildren are getting older and they should know
