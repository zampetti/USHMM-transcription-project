interview with Mr. Norman Belfer, conducted by Arwin Donohue, on March first, 2000.</span> <span id="s14">This is tape number one, side A, and this is a follow up interview to a videotaped interview that was conducted with Mr. Belfer, in 1995.</span> <span id="s15">So, let’s begin by -- I’m just going to correct a mistake, it was -- the first interview with Mr. Belfer was done on May 31st, 1996, on videotape.</span> <span id="s16">Okay.</span> <span id="s17">I wanted to start by asking you a little bit more, going back to before the war.</span> <span id="s18">I wanted to ask you about your hometown, Wodzislaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Answer: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: Is that how you pronounce it?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: And I wanted you to say, first of all, something about your family’s history in that area.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: We live in that town, my aunts, and my -- not only my parents, my grandparents were born there.</span> <span id="s24">And we were ver -- respected citizens of that town.</span> <span id="s25">My grandfather, and my father were running a business, and eventually my brothers helped also, alongside.</span> <span id="s26">The business was a processing of feathers, and down, which they exported from Poland to the United States, and -- and several European countries.</span> <span id="s27">And during the peace time, that town was a very small -- I’m not certain how many people, but less than 10,000, and primarily Jewish.</span> <span id="s28">And I -- I lived there for my first, let’s say 12th -- 12 years or so.</span> <span id="s29">Subsequently, I moved to Kraków.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: I -- I’m sorry, I’m going to interrupt you a little bit --</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: -- because I don’t want you to feel like you have to repeat what you talked about in the video.</span> <span id="s33">My -- the reason that I asked you about Wodzislaw is that I wondered -- your -- your family had a long history in the town.</span> <span id="s34">I wondered if you -- after the war, you felt a sense of connection with the place, if you ever visited again.</span> <span id="s35">Anything more about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s37">The only connection about that town was that I went back to Poland only one time.</span> <span id="s38">This was a dozen years ago, more or less.</span> <span id="s39">I think maybe more.</span> <span id="s40">There was a first march of Holocaust survivors and their children from -- to -- to Auschwitz a-and Birkenau, The March of the Living.</span> <span id="s41">And I -- I was one of them, and there were many others from United States, and Canada, even Australia, South Africa.</span> <span id="s42">There were about 2,000 young people.</span> <span id="s43">College -- college or high school age.</span> <span id="s44">And it was a very moving experience.</span> <span id="s45">There were very -- dignitaries from Israel, and the former president, Ithzrak Navonne.</span> <span id="s46">He ray -- he was s-speaking, you know, to us about it, and it’s -- was extremely moving, and very, very upsetting, of course.</span> <span id="s47">Wi-With me went our -- one of our sons, Andrew went wi-with me on that trip, and also one nephew, Ben Belfer, and two c-cousins.</span> <span id="s48">And we were received by the Polish government, extremely well.</span> <span id="s49">They had all kinds of preparations, invited us to the Senate building, gave a couple parties, you know, cocktail parties, where we me-met Russian ge -- Russian generals.</span> <span id="s50">One of the Russian generals spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s51">And also they per -- had a -- performed a Jewish show in one of their Senate -- what do call them there, Senate building, it was a theater there, a theater building.</span> <span id="s52">The show was all done ba -- mostly in -- in -- in Yiddish, Jewish, and some in -- in the -- in Polish.</span> <span id="s53">During intermission, I went over to the person who, I was very impressed with her singing.</span> <span id="s54">And I ask her how did she learn that, she was quite a young person.</span> <span id="s55">She says from -- there was a cantor, before World War Two in Poland, and he -- he survived the war, and he had a lot of records, and she learned it from the records, you know.</span> <span id="s56">The Polish government gave a special reception, because the following day, I remember, after the -- after they had that big performance, we had -- they invited about 40 people, I was one of them, to the -- the assistant to -- General Yarowzelski, and he gave a whole speech about the Jewish people should come back to Poland, they lived there for a thousand years, and since the Jewish people left -- most of them left, they were -- culturally, and business-wise, and -- and in many other aspects, you know, were completely eradicated, you know.</span> <span id="s57">There’s no -- no industry, the -- and they had -- a matter of fact, ask everyone what type of profession or business, and when I told them what my parents used to do, say, “Why don’t you come back, we will build a plant, we’ll do this and that.”</span> <span id="s58">So after he gave a whole big speech, the former president of Israel, Ithzrak Navonne said, “Too little, too late.”</span> <span id="s59">He spoke very fluent English.</span> <span id="s60">He said, “What happened,” and give all kinds of dates, “when the Jewish people came back to Poland, as they came to their hometowns, what happened to them?”</span> <span id="s61">He said, “Oh well, it’s a different regime.”</span> <span id="s62">He asked, during certain dates, you know, so the -- there were all kinds of ordinances, you know, and if people came to the town, they would -- they were either shot, or they had to flee town, because their homes were occupied by Polish people, and they didn’t want to -- they felt they may want to reclaim their property.</span> <span id="s63">So they had to flee.</span> <span id="s64">As a matter of fact, a school-mate of mine, he and two other people came back to town.</span> <span id="s65">Their house was all mostly demolished, but they had no place to stay, they stayed there.</span> <span id="s66">So one late afternoon, they knocked at the door, and my friend opened the door, and they shot him.</span> <span id="s67">So the other two left, you know.</span> <span id="s68">So my memories about it, is I would never want to go back there again.</span> <span id="s69">As a matter of fact, yes, I still remember, when I was there, with my son -- in -- in Wodzislaw, my son and my nephew, my cousins, we -- we rented a -- a car, you know.</span> <span id="s70">And we escorted to the cem -- I didn’t remember where the cemetery is -- the Jewish cemetery is.</span> <span id="s71">We went to the cemetery, and there was not o-one tombstone [indecipherable] not at all.</span> <span id="s72">And there was a -- young kids, who were -- they saw a car there, they saw, you know, they saw people dressed differently, whatever.</span> <span id="s73">They came over and started -- I said -- you know, we asked him what about the cem -- what happened to the cemetery.</span> <span id="s74">They were teenagers, actually.</span> <span id="s75">Oh, well they were demolished.</span> <span id="s76">And they -- you want to see res -- where the tombstones are?</span> <span id="s77">They were -- they made walkways out of them, they made stables [indecipherable] floors, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: You had family, I assume -- you had family who was buried there, I assume?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s80">I had f -- my grandparents were buried there, and other relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Did you -- while you were there, did you see any people -- any Gentiles you had known before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: No, but I did meet some pe -- a couple who helped -- that couple -- these were children of people were -- my parents and three sisters, and two children were -- were hiding for a couple months.</span> <span id="s83">And the parents were not alive, but I’ve been in touch with the daughter of -- and the son-in-law.</span> <span id="s84">They came to visit me, to Warsaw, and we met in the hotel.</span> <span id="s85">Of course, I was very warm to them, and I gave them a certain as -- cert-certain -- in Poland, it was a substantial amount of money.</span> <span id="s86">So a -- they appreciate it, and they -- they do write, send me a Christmas card, or -- or write to me from time to time.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: You mentioned this family in your first interview, and -- and you also mentioned that they had -- they had disappointed you and your family by really not -- by asking for more and more money when they were hiding, and -- and behaving somewhat --</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: -- less than honorably.</span> <span id="s90">I’m wondering how you felt about meeting with them after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: I still f -- had a -- I would say a warm feeling for them, because they did risk their lives by helping, and the money, obviously, ha -- we had -- i -- if I -- I do remember that, we had a manager in one of our plants in Kraków, you know, manager who managed the feather and down business.</span> <span id="s92">He would go every two weeks to the place, and make sure how -- how my parents are, and my -- and the -- and the -- and the sisters, and s -- and the children.</span> <span id="s93">And he would give money to that family for food, and other things, whatever.</span> <span id="s94">I don’t know how much.</span> <span id="s95">My father felt if he has a money with him [indecipherable] the money wasn’t so much valuable any more, but they would keep some jewelry, or some gold coins, or whatever, just for emergency.</span> <span id="s96">He was afraid that if he gives it all in one time, maybe the guy -- they were na -- she was always so -- they weren’t sure, maybe, he would get tired of us.</span> <span id="s97">And it became also, very impossible to live there for a couple of months.</span> <span id="s98">Was in November, was very cold, they were in -- actually hidden in a bunker, in an orchard garden.</span> <span id="s99">And two little children, they were tall -- they were taught not to speak, and not to cry or anything.</span> <span id="s100">It was quite a horrible scene.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: I had a question about the manager, too, who had been helping out your family.</span> <span id="s102">Was he non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: He was non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s104">He was a Christian.</span> <span id="s105">He worked for us for many years, was a very loyal person.</span> <span id="s106">But right after the war, the German put a trustee, you know.</span> <span id="s107">They took out all the inventory and shipped it to Germany, you know.</span> <span id="s108">But certain materials, they wanted to be processed there, so that manager worked there.</span> <span id="s109">He taught them.</span> <span id="s110">And subsequently, one of my brothers worked there.</span> <span id="s111">That -- he felt if he helps them and -- and so on, he will survive -- it’ll be easier for him to survive the war, you know.</span> <span id="s112">But it didn’t help.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Did you have contact with him after the war, an-and what was his name, with the manager?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s115">Yes, but we lost con -- he must have passed away after.</span> <span id="s116">We did write to him, and a matter of fact, we -- from -- at that time we lived in Italy, and we send him packages, you know, of certain delicacies, you know, which was not available in Poland.</span> <span id="s117">But then we st -- we couldn’t hear from him.</span> <span id="s118">His name was Sh-Sh-Trzyna -- T-r-z-y-n-a.</span> <span id="s119">I don’t remember the first name.</span> <span id="s120">I used to call him Mr. Trzyna -- Mr. Trzyna, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: I’m -- I’m wondering, obviously, it was extremely disappointing how little the -- y-y-you had had -- you mentioned in your first interview that your family had had good friends before the war, who were non-Jewish, and that they didn’t, for the most part, help during --during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Didn’t help at all.</span> <span id="s123">None of them helped.</span> <span id="s124">The only one is that manager who tried to help as much as he could.</span> <span id="s125">And that family who were hiding our parents.</span> <span id="s126">But they did it also for money, because before we vacated -- before we knew it’s going to be very tragic, because we heard wa -- also, there were very little communications, we had no radio, no newspapers, nothing.</span> <span id="s127">Couldn’t travel to one village to the next.</span> <span id="s128">But there were rumors that -- and there -- some towns, it was very -- the Germans came in, and took a lot of people out, or most of the Jewish people, because they killed some officer, some soldiers, which was just an excuse, you know.</span> <span id="s129">But we heard all this.</span> <span id="s130">My parents arranged to -- with these Gentile friends, they said, in case of a problem -- that we have a problem, we want to -- we w -- would like to hi -- you to help us, we would like to hide there.</span> <span id="s131">And they gave him a lot -- a lot of silver, and anything that was valuable in the house.</span> <span id="s132">S-Special linen, flatware, you know, stuff like this.</span> <span id="s133">Whatever they could take out, even some art.</span> <span id="s134">We emptied everything out.</span> <span id="s135">So this was like a compensation.</span> <span id="s136">In addition, we made sure we paid them for the f-food, and we pay -- also f -- whatever else he asked for, you know.</span> <span id="s137">It -- but still, wi -- I feel with all that, he was a decent human being.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: I wanted to ask you, regarding that -- that experience of -- of real disappointment with the fact that these people who had been your friends before the war, really abandoned you and your family, an-and so many others.</span> <span id="s139">How do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Right.</span> <span id="s141">I had school friends, from high school, you know, in Kraków, and none of them really cont-contacted me, I mean even when still was pretty quiet, they all stayed away, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: How do you -- do you feel trusting now, of -- I mean, after having that experience, do you feel that -- that as a Jew, you can really trust -- as a Jew living in America, and as a minority --</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: -- a member of a minority --</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: -- an -- do you feel you can trust the majority to do what’s right?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: Positively, I wa -- I -- I am -- definitely would trust -- it’s a different system, you know, in the United States, it’s a democratic system, and every citizen has it’s rights, and the Constitution protects every cit-citizen.</span> <span id="s148">S -- but in Poland, although the Jewish people lived there over a thousand years, as a matter of fact, there’s -- in that small town, Wodzislaw, there’s a synagogue which was over a thousand years old.</span> <span id="s149">But during the war years, it was -- made a stable out of it, the Germans, you know, kept horses there, and so on.</span> <span id="s150">And everything was destroyed.</span> <span id="s151">As a matter of fact, I was told it’s being rebuilt now, they want to attract tourism, and so on, different parts of Poland, yeah.</span> <span id="s152">The -- the Polish people in particular are very, very anti-Semitic, and I -- and how can I -- I can explain it is, my own family and I had an experience, although we were very respected citizens.</span> <span id="s153">When the Germans came in, the first day they came in, they knocked at every -- they were shooting in front of your house, and there were a lot of screaming, and s -- and so on.</span> <span id="s154">We were -- we were hiding in a warehouse that we owned.</span> <span id="s155">And finally they came to our door, they were steel doors, they were banging and shooting, and -- and calling in German, “Get out, you [indecipherable] get out.”</span> <span id="s156">You know, and eventually we had to get out.</span> <span id="s157">They were beating us, and we had to run to a square.</span> <span id="s158">And then, they shot several people, put some houses on fire.</span> <span id="s159">So people didn’t come out, they put them on fire.</span> <span id="s160">And we are all this -- on that square they [indecipherable] on us, several -- maybe it’s couple thousand, or several thousand people.</span> <span id="s161">Then they left.</span> <span id="s162">So once they left, my parents felt th-these were the first ones coming in, they were -- had tanks, you know, that we heard.</span> <span id="s163">So what -- my parents said, “Let’s go to the church, there’s a church nearby.”</span> <span id="s164">And we were there only minutes, I don’t know, less than a half hour.</span> <span id="s165">The priest himself, in charge, he said, “You Belfers, you zhid -- you Jews,” you know, “get out.”</span> <span id="s166">And actually pushed us out, you know.</span> <span id="s167">Said, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s168">So we ran to -- we had an uncle, you know, who lived outside -- a little far out -- outs -- outside town.</span> <span id="s169">We stayed there for overnight, a couple nights, I don’t remember, a few days, you know.</span> <span id="s170">I t calmed down, so we went back to the house.</span> <span id="s171">We got -- we got no help, really, to speak of.</span> <span id="s172">Not only that, I know of cases who were -- some people that I knew were hiding in the area, but if a neighbor would know, or found out, that they being hidden, they would report them, you know?</span> <span id="s173">And the people, not only the Jewish people got either shot, or sent to a concentration camp, or whatever, but also the Gentile.</span> <span id="s174">But there was no -- there were -- the Germans got only cooperation from everyone.</span> <span id="s175">The church leaders in particular, and it was a bad, bad time, and I can’t explain it even nowadays, why there should be such hate in a -- in some people’s mind towards the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s176">The Jewish people have contributed a lot, not only in -- in Poland, everywh -- everywhere they lived, in -- in many fields, whether it’s medicine, or whether it’s engineering, or -- or -- or so many other important fields.</span> <span id="s177">But obviously it goes back so many years, it goes back to -- it goes back to a thousand years, claiming that things that we did to Christ, which is a lie, and even the ner -- the -- the New Testament is not very accurate.</span> <span id="s178">Even the Pope recently stated that.</span> <span id="s179">And as far as Jesus, he was a Jew, he died as a Jew, and he was not killed by the Jewish people, he was killed by the Romans.</span> <span id="s180">He may have -- may have -- he may have wanted to do some reforming, or whatever.</span> <span id="s181">But why they -- why -- it’s 2,000 years later, why is this being taught, or when -- or when -- that’s why there’s that hate builds up, from childhood.</span> <span id="s182">They go to churches, they’re [indecipherable] Jews, or other references to Jew, although it has been removed now from the liturgy, I -- I hope that futu -- future generations will not ever have to experience difficulties and obstructions in -- of justice and everything, because they have one religion, or another religion.</span> <span id="s183">I don’t -- I don’t believe one religion’s better than the other, they’re all the same, they all teach you to be a better person.</span> <span id="s184">They don’t teach you to hate.</span> <span id="s185">And that’s -- that’s my message, in a way.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Norman, how did it feel to be back in Poland, after all those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: I’ve -- I’ve f-fell -- I couldn’t sleep nights, I was so upset, you know.</span> <span id="s188">With all they tried to do for us, it’s amazing, they even send someone to the hotel, one officer of the government.</span> <span id="s189">He introduced himself, and I had met him at the cocktail party.</span> <span id="s190">He showed me a -- gave me a card, I may have it even, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s191">He says, “Why don’t you come back to Poland?</span> <span id="s192">You built the industry.</span> <span id="s193">We need you people, we need more culture, we need -- we need help.</span> <span id="s194">You were born here,” he says, “I understand you -- your parents, grandparents, great-grandparents all lived in this country.</span> <span id="s195">Why do -- why don’t you come back?”</span> <span id="s196">I said, “Why not come back?</span> <span id="s197">They -- everyone was killed.</span> <span id="s198">None of them survived, except myself and two brothers.</span> <span id="s199">One brother was in America at that time on a business trip, and that’s why he never came back.</span> <span id="s200">Only I and a brother of mine survive.</span> <span id="s201">And yid,” I said, “what help did we get?</span> <span id="s202">What did we get when we got back -- came back?”</span> <span id="s203">And so on.</span> <span id="s204">“Oh, was a different regime, was dif -- it’s different now.</span> <span id="s205">As a matter of fact,” he said, “that time, you know, we are not like in Russia.</span> <span id="s206">In Russia,” he says, “the government dictates what the people should do, and in Poland, the gover -- the people dictate, not the,” -- which we all almost laughed, they were under Russian regime, and -- but we felt, how can they even say that, not being afraid to say it, but they probably felt nobody’s going to go tell the Russians what they said.</span> <span id="s207">But only --</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: What -- what year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s210">Must be 12 - 14 years, something like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: So, it was before the --</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: [indecipherable] the Russian regime was still the ware -- already talking about -- maybe a year or two later that -- that broke away completely, yeah.</span> <span id="s213">It could be one year later, I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Norman, I wanted to ask you about your -- your family, and your siblings, because in the first interview you -- you mentioned that you had, I believe, four sisters, and two brothers, but I wondered if you would name each one of them, and -- and say what their ages were relative to you.</span> <span id="s215">And also say specifically what the fate was of each one, just so that we have the names connected with -- with a -- with what happened to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: My oldest sister, her name was Bluma, which is actually in Yiddish, or German, it’s flowers, yeah.</span> <span id="s217">And she had I think three children -- I’m not po -- I believe three, either two or three children, I’m not positive any more, and a husband.</span> <span id="s218">Her husband, [indecipherable] was a watchmaker, and he had a lot of friends, Christian friends, too.</span> <span id="s219">And one day, when we heard what’s going on, he said he -- he made arrangement with some good friends of his, next town maybe 10 -- 10 -- 12 kilometers from Wodzislaw, to the town called Jarlnoveeitz.</span> <span id="s220">It -- it -- this friend came with a big wagon, and -- and horses, you know, in the middle of the ni -- one night, and they loaded up s-stuff, personal belongings, and so on.</span> <span id="s221">And while they were traveling out of -- outside Wodzislaw, maybe a -- one kilometer outside Wodzidslaw, the German SS, or Gestapo, whatever, intercepted them.</span> <span id="s222">And they shot them all.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Was that in -- around 1940 - ’41?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Jus -- let me just think.</span> <span id="s226">This must have been 1942, right.</span> <span id="s227">When the wa -- it was in the fall of ’42, in the fall time, fall season, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: How much -- how much older was Bluma?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Bluma must have been 17 years older than I.</span> <span id="s230">About 17 years.</span> <span id="s231">So I -- at that time, in -- in 40 -- 40 --’42, I was 19 or 20 years old, you know, tw -- actually I -- about 20 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: And your next -- the next oldest, after Bluma?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: The next oldest is Arthur, my brother.</span> <span id="s234">He was 16 years older than I.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: And we know what happened to him --</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: And he went United States --</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: -- he came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: -- on a business trip, yes.</span> <span id="s239">My next one was my sister Mindla -- Mindla, they call her Manya, you know, Mindla, yeah.</span> <span id="s240">And s -- she -- let’s see, was two years, or one year younger than Arthur, yeah.</span> <span id="s241">I would say, she must have been 15 years older, or 14.</span> <span id="s242">14 or 15 years.</span> <span id="s243">Then I have a brother Maurice, who survived the war wi -- with me.</span> <span id="s244">But he -- he passed away, unfortunately, let’s say about -- almost 20 years ago, yeah.</span> <span id="s245">He was much more affected from the war years than I was.</span> <span id="s246">He -- his wife and a child, the child was only three or four years old, maybe three years old, was in hiding near Kraków, also some Christian friends.</span> <span id="s247">And one day she went shopping to -- for groceries, you know, with the child.</span> <span id="s248">She didn’t look specifically Jewish, you know?</span> <span id="s249">She spoke very fluent Polish, and all that, like -- like a native, of course.</span> <span id="s250">Somebody reported to the police while she was walking out of the store.</span> <span id="s251">They waited for her, and shot her right -- right there, because she started to cry and protest.</span> <span id="s252">The child, we don’t know.</span> <span id="s253">There -- there was a witness that we met, after the war, told us that he was -- he didn’t -- he -- he didn’t actually see it, but he was in the same town, hiding, and he -- he was told that the child had just walked away, or whatever.</span> <span id="s254">Somebody may have taken the child, they don’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s255">I’ve done a lot of investigation, we can’t find any trace of it.</span> <span id="s256">And the reason I -- we did some investigation, in po -- in Warsaw, there's a hotel called Belfer.</span> <span id="s257">I thought, maybe, you never know, you know.</span> <span id="s258">I -- through the Red Cross, then through friends of mine who were in Poland.</span> <span id="s259">When I was in Poland, I didn’t -- I wasn’t aware of that.</span> <span id="s260">May have been built after, when I was in Poland with that mission, you know, to [indecipherable] I was told by the Re-Red Cross in a letter, and also by some friends subsequently, that the reason the hotel is called Belfer, Belfer in poli -- in -- i -- they -- in school, they called it Belfer like a nickname.</span> <span id="s261">Professor they called a Belfer.</span> <span id="s262">It’s a pension fund for teachers, and they have investment there, and that’s why it’s all -- called Belfer.</span> <span id="s263">There’s no relationship.</span> <span id="s264">I was about to s-s -- aba -- was Maurice, and I had a -- a sister called Sheindla, or Sheindo.</span> <span id="s265">Schein means pretty, beautiful, you know, it’s -- and sh -- she must have been eight -- seven or eight years older than I am -- than I was.</span> <span id="s266">She was a very beautiful girl, very, very intelligent, and very high marks always a s -- in school, she always was the top of the class.</span> <span id="s267">Then I had another si-sister, Helena, or Hya.</span> <span id="s268">She -- she must have been only two years older than I am.</span> <span id="s269">Two or three, I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s270">She also was a lovely, lovely girl, and they all are actually -- what -- what tragically happened to my sisters, they -- the three sisters, they were in camp wi-with -- with my parents, an-and me, and -- and Maurice, in Plaszów -- in Kraków, the concentration camp, Plaszów.</span> <span id="s271">And after being there a year, more or less, they were -- all the women were taken out.</span> <span id="s272">We didn’t know where or what.</span> <span id="s273">My mother, and my sisters.</span> <span id="s274">And one child of -- of -- of my sister Mindla, she -- her name was Sarah, the little child, and she was maybe eight years old, or so.</span> <span id="s275">First they took -- there were several hidden children, she was one of them.</span> <span id="s276">First they took the children out, then the women, we didn’t know where, what, you know.</span> <span id="s277">They always would tell you, “Oh, they’re going to a much better camp, and much easier ts -- it’s overcrowded here.”</span> <span id="s278">They had all kinds -- they had a -- schemes developed to fool y -- us.</span> <span id="s279">We had not -- we tried to believe, we had no choice, you know?</span> <span id="s280">But not believing was worse.</span> <span id="s281">But after the war, when we were liberated, we tried to contact -- we met different people in different areas, in different camps, you know, we went to Salzburg, and -- and it’s in my tapes, I went to Italy, but I came -- from Italy, I went back to Munich.</span> <span id="s282">I heard in Munich there were big gathering of survivors, you know, from all over Germany, you know, Austria.</span> <span id="s283">And when I came there, I met some people.</span> <span id="s284">And they told me that they all were sent to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s285">But subsequently, maybe a -- months, or a year later, was a woman who was a sis -- a friend of my younger sister Helena, and she said, “I was with your three sisters in Denya -- Diensk -- that -- Polish ports, one is German, one is Polish.</span> <span id="s286">Your sisters were there, and I was there, and only days -- ma -- a week or less before the Russians came into that section of Poland, they put -- they told the people they -- they had pr -- factories, they were the -- sewing uniforms, they told them that they going to be exchanged for German prisoner of war in Sweden.</span> <span id="s287">They gave everybody a piece of bread, and tried to calm -- this was a way of calming, you know?</span> <span id="s288">Put them -- loaded them on boats, very a -- packed them in like in cattle cars, you know, the same way.</span> <span id="s289">And they say going to Sweden, but they torpedoed all the boats.</span> <span id="s290">We don’t know, there could be 10,000 of them.</span> <span id="s291">Only about a hundred were left to clean up, and th -- one of the hundred was that friend of my sister, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: How did you find her, or how did she find you?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: In Milan, also, were, at that time -- this was almost a year after the war, there was a place where [indecipherable] where displaced people would stay.</span> <span id="s294">It used to be a -- a military pl-place, you know, a caserba, you know?</span> <span id="s295">And I would -- we already had an apartment in Milan, we -- that we rented, yeah, my brother and I.</span> <span id="s296">So we used to go there, daily almost, just -- just meet some people, see who -- who -- what -- always new people coming there.</span> <span id="s297">Many of them were -- intended to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s298">Th-They stopped there for some reason.</span> <span id="s299">Also to look for other people.</span> <span id="s300">She heard -- she was talking to people that the Belfers are here in town, because she met some other pe -- so, one day we came there.</span> <span id="s301">She met us, you know.</span> <span id="s302">And she told us the whole story, you know.</span> <span id="s303">My mother, however, did -- did perish in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: How did you find out about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Because that’s -- that was obvious because the -- the trains from Plaszów all went to Auschwitz, and they segregated the people.</span> <span id="s306">Young people looked fit, they put on one side, and my mother that time was a -- in the 50’s -- maybe 50 -- 56 or 57, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: So were you sure -- after the war, and you were in Italy, were you sure that your mother had perished in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: Y-Yes, because the whole -- most of the women were per-perished -- ya -- only young, fitting w-women they kept.</span> <span id="s309">The others were gassed.</span> <span id="s310">They told them they going to get -- have to shower, the delousing, they called it, they give them new clothes, and they gas them, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: I wanted to talk more about that period in -- in Italy, right after the war, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: So you, at that time -- well, you mentioned a little bit about that time in your first interview, and you mentioned how you had first gone to -- from Salzburg to Modena.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Mo -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: And I wondered if, in Modena were you living in a DP camp, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: In a DP camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s319">Also was -- I emptied out some military building, and we lived there, yes, for about si -- five, six weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: And were you getting help from -- from any organization like the JDC, or -- the Joint Distribution --</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: UNRRA -- UNRRA.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: UNRRA?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: UNRRA would send packages and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: However, I believe I mentioned in the prior tapes, you know -- video -- video tapes, while we were there, one American officer, some -- I could speak some E-English, because I studied English in high school, I -- he took an interest in me.</span> <span id="s326">So I told him, you know, I have a brother in -- in New York, but there is no mail, you can’t -- there was no mail there, no official mail -- military mail, where they could help me.</span> <span id="s327">He says, “What is his name, where does he live?”</span> <span id="s328">I say, “I don’t know.”</span> <span id="s329">My other brother Maurice was with me, he says he -- he -- he used to stay at Hotel Broadway in New York, but he doesn’t know where he is now.</span> <span id="s330">This officer wrote to Hotel Broadway in New York, and asked whether or no -- whether a name by the -- Arthur Belfer, his name was Artur, but he changed it to Arthur, you know.</span> <span id="s331">So, a letter came back, and it -- but -- I wrote the letter, and I told him, we are here, we are -- we survive, we’re -- and we don’t know whether anybody else survived.</span> <span id="s332">We -- we are afraid to -- I’m afraid to say that no one else survived except me -- I and -- and Maurice.</span> <span id="s333">And Maurice wrote a few lines.</span> <span id="s334">He s -- he wired us 500 dollars, to a bank.</span> <span id="s335">I didn’t even -- I didn’t even tell him anything.</span> <span id="s336">So, the bank knew displaced people, so they walked around with a sign Belfer, sent somebody over.</span> <span id="s337">So I went over, and I sp -- couldn’t speak to this guy.</span> <span id="s338">I tried to speak to him in German, I was -- I was fluent in German.</span> <span id="s339">He couldn’t speak English, I couldn’t spe -- he couldn’t speak Polish, he couldn’t speak Hebrew, so I couldn’t -- so he said -- in Italy, they say come, they say like this.</span> <span id="s340">I didn’t know [indecipherable] what it -- what it means.</span> <span id="s341">Finally he said -- so we went to the bank.</span> <span id="s342">My brother and I, then we had a few friends walk with us, too.</span> <span id="s343">We went in -- my brother and I went into the bank.</span> <span id="s344">They were [indecipherable] waited outside, I said, [indecipherable] I didn’t know why, but I -- I assumed there was someone.</span> <span id="s345">So the manager spoke German.</span> <span id="s346">He says, “Hebert kinder,” you know.</span> <span id="s347">He was very, very -- w-we have money for you, you know, 500 dollars.</span> <span id="s348">Said okay.</span> <span id="s349">“But, I ca -- I am not going to give you the money now, come after three o’clock.”</span> <span id="s350">So, my brother and I say, “Why after three o’clock, I want the money now.”</span> <span id="s351">He says, “Leave it kinder,” you know, you’re children, [inaudible].</span> <span id="s352">“It’s much better come later.</span> <span id="s353">I’ll give you now te -- 10 dollars Italian money, you know?”</span> <span id="s354">And when we came after three, he told us, you know, the Black Market is -- no -- is a -- a thousand lira per dollar, and officially it’s a hundred lira, and he paid us out of the Black Market.</span> <span id="s355">He saw the way we looked, you know.</span> <span id="s356">So he had some compassion, yeah.</span> <span id="s357">So after we had all that money, we went -- all the -- the friends, we had [indecipherable] we went to a restaurant, and we -- they displayed in the window there, looked like chicken, but a-after we bought it and start eating it, it was rabbit.</span> <span id="s358">We had a -- we bought wine and bread.</span> <span id="s359">We had a big party, yeah.</span> <span id="s360">We stayed there another several weeks.</span> <span id="s361">They said -- because we -- the reason we went to Italy -- I wanted to go to Israel, and they told us then, the UNRRA had offices of people, you know.</span> <span id="s362">People like you who he -- look healthy, and young, you most likely will be intercepted by the British, you know, and the -- when you go by boat, and they send you to Cyprus, because they -- they send a lot of people to Cyprus.</span> <span id="s363">So my brother and I stay from one camp to another camp.</span> <span id="s364">So then we decided we’ll go to Milan.</span> <span id="s365">We atch -- actually hitchhiked to Milan, because we didn’t know where a railroad -- we didn’t know any -- couldn’t -- nobody understood anything pr -- pr --</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Before you go into detail about Milan, I just wanted to ask a couple other questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Surely.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: What were the conditions like in the DP camp in Modena?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: It wasn’t too bad.</span> <span id="s370">What we were used to wasn’t too bad, you -- they had -- you could shower there, you could -- they had bathrooms.</span> <span id="s371">We still were wearing a milit -- the -- the -- the British and the American army gave us work clothes, you know.</span> <span id="s372">The shirts we were -- during the war you didn’t change it for a few years, so can you imagine?</span> <span id="s373">There, we changed it every two weeks.</span> <span id="s374">So, it was a big --</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: A big step up for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s377">A tremendous sh -- luxu -- luxury.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: By comparison.</span> <span id="s380">They key -- the Italians were -- treated us, I have to say, perfectly fine.</span> <span id="s381">If you w-went to Israel, it wouldn’t have treated us nicer.</span> <span id="s382">They were very -- when I lived in -- I fell in love with the Italian people, really.</span> <span id="s383">I would have never come here to the United States, because my broth -- my older brother encouraged me, he needed me, he -- whatever he -- he was sick, and so on.</span> <span id="s384">Other that that, I would have never come.</span> <span id="s385">We had establish a business there and so on.</span> <span id="s386">So we went to Milan.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: One more question before Milan.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: Fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Did -- did you have a -- a passion for going to Israel, or wh-what was involved in that decision?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: I had a passion -- a passion to go to Israel, yes.</span> <span id="s391">Yeah, I spoke Hebrew that time, and I was -- I just felt we were -- we were so brutalized, and lost everyb -- thing, and every -- lost my entire family.</span> <span id="s392">We just felt -- my brother and I -- but anyway, we came here.</span> <span id="s393">But w-went to Milan, we a -- we didn’t know what -- we had money, we didn’t know where to go, we -- we were -- way we were dressed, they probably wouldn’t let us in a decent hotel.</span> <span id="s394">We slept on the railroad station.</span> <span id="s395">One of -- one of the Italian people, we ask him, you know where we can stay, in -- in German, you know.</span> <span id="s396">Many business people in Europe spoke German.</span> <span id="s397">This -- like now, everybody speaks English in Europe, but they used to speak German especially business people, yeah.</span> <span id="s398">He said why don’t -- the -- he said the railroad station were benches covered -- had -- covered th-those, if it rains, or whatever.</span> <span id="s399">The next morning, we ga -- went to a public place where you can wash up, and shaved.</span> <span id="s400">We went out and bought clothes, and we called -- my brother, remembered we have some business friends in Milan, Italian people.</span> <span id="s401">He remembered the name, we looked up the name.</span> <span id="s402">We called e -- the name was Guardini, and Fachikani.</span> <span id="s403">They had a lot of -- many stores, poultry stores, you know?</span> <span id="s404">All over, not only Milan, outside Milan, many city -- many cities or towns.</span> <span id="s405">We -- they used to ship feathers to us, to Poland.</span> <span id="s406">So we call up, they say, “Pronto, pronto.”</span> <span id="s407">I don’t know what [indecipherable] even I couldn’t -- I said -- I started s-speaking in German, they didn’t understand, so I hung up.</span> <span id="s408">So my brother and I said, “How do we talk to her?</span> <span id="s409">Let’s go buy a dictionary.”</span> <span id="s410">Bought a dictionary, we wrote out padrona, you know, going on.</span> <span id="s411">“Bolea polari con padrona,” said, and yeah -- so we called again, and afa -- and I asked for Mr. Guardini, you know, Senor Guardini, padrona.</span> <span id="s412">He came to the phone, and he spoke fluent German.</span> <span id="s413">He says, “Why don’t you visit us, please come up, come up for lunch.”</span> <span id="s414">So, we took a taxi, we went up.</span> <span id="s415">We tal -- he knew what was going on, but didn’t know -- we told him about our experience.</span> <span id="s416">He says -- they took us out for lunch, and during lunch they said, “We know you have a brother in New York, because he was in correspondence before.”</span> <span id="s417">When the war broke out, the first year or two, Italy was not so aligned later with Germans.</span> <span id="s418">So, they were in touch from New York -- from -- from Milan, to New York, you know, these people.</span> <span id="s419">They said, “You know, we have a lot of feathers and down accumulated.”</span> <span id="s420">During the war years you didn’t do any exporting.</span> <span id="s421">“So why don’t you take some samples and send it to your brother?</span> <span id="s422">And this way you can make some money.”</span> <span id="s423">[indecipherable] I said, “Be happy.”</span> <span id="s424">She, “Come tomorrow morning [indecipherable] there.”</span> <span id="s425">And ship me -- that’s how we started making money.</span> <span id="s426">Then we became -- we organize a firm, we hired some people.</span> <span id="s427">Now, we did some processing also in Milan.</span> <span id="s428">We set up equipment, and we bought feathers.</span> <span id="s429">We traveled all a -- that’s probably what takes me out of depression, you know, trudigu -- faster.</span> <span id="s430">We went to Czechoslovakia, to -- we went to Hungary, Yugoslavia we went.</span> <span id="s431">We went -- bought as much feathers as we could get because there was a shortage in the United States after world -- during the -- World War Two, they used up all f-feathers and down, only for military use, for sleeping bags.</span> <span id="s432">And there was very little for public -- for private, yeah, people.</span> <span id="s433">So a big market for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: How did it feel to be traveling in -- in countries that -- in H-Hungary, or in Czechoslovakia, or Yugoslavia where -- where there had been so much destruction, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Was just -- we felt -- we want -- you know, I wanted to prove to the world, and I -- that’s -- that’s probably why I’m -- we are -- I’m successful, that we are not stupid people, that we have ambitions, and we have knowledge, and -- and underst -- we have intelligence, and whatever -- ever did it in my life, after World War -- I did only things -- not just to make the money, to -- to show that I’m a decent human being, you know?</span> <span id="s436">I’ve never -- I -- I ca -- I -- I be frank, I have a big resentment with the Germans.</span> <span id="s437">Maybe more for the Germans than the Poles, although the Poles were pretty bad, of course.</span> <span id="s438">And the resentment would have been -- lasted much longer if I ever went back to Poland, you know, which [indecipherable] nobody there, or any other.</span> <span id="s439">The Italians, for some reason, were so friendly.</span> <span id="s440">You know, even when I couldn’t speak English.</span> <span id="s441">I remember the first time we asked -- we wanted to go to cort -- coursa teachanase, how we go there?</span> <span id="s442">The Italians would say, “Go straight here, make a right turn.</span> <span id="s443">Oh no, made a mistake.”</span> <span id="s444">They showed us, or they took us there, you know?</span> <span id="s445">They very, very friendly.</span> <span id="s446">We just -- and I had some friends there, eventually.</span> <span id="s447">We loved Italy, because we were used to deplorable treatment, so anybody who was nice, we found aba -- w-we fell in love with them.</span> <span id="s448">I had -- I really loved Italy, and we go there every so often.</span> <span id="s449">I -- I love Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: What about being in -- in Hungary, for example?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: We dealt only with the government there.</span> <span id="s452">There was no private industry, or Yugoslavian.</span> <span id="s453">Strictly, you know, how many pounds do we have this, that, they made a whole list.</span> <span id="s454">We negotiated privately, [indecipherable] on this -- you know, this.</span> <span id="s455">We had -- if we wouldn’t have done this, I think we would have been lost more.</span> <span id="s456">I -- we had a one -- yeah, brother-in-law who survived the war.</span> <span id="s457">One of my sister’s -- my sis -- Mindla.</span> <span id="s458">And he survive, and he -- he never was himself.</span> <span id="s459">He was such a wonderful, nice guy, brilliant.</span> <span id="s460">But he was so damaged, he lost two children and a wife, he could never come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: His name was Motl, li -- li -- Motl, like in motel.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: That was his last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: Sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: His last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Yeah, Finkenstein.</span> <span id="s467">Yeah.</span> <span id="s468">He was a -- he was a broken man, and he was such -- he came to visit us in Italy, we encouraged him to s -- he say that he couldn’t -- he just couldn’t function too much.</span> <span id="s469">He went back to Poland after the war, and he -- and from him we know for sure, he -- he says, “There’s nobody, nobody.”</span> <span id="s470">Eve -- from the same town, only two people survived.</span> <span id="s471">No, nobody.</span> <span id="s472">Besides his wife and -- and kids, he lost his whole, entire family, no one else survived.</span> <span id="s473">His brothers, and others.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: You were -- so you’re -- you’re in Italy after the war, and you’re just starting to learn -- I think you said in the first interview that you -- you were not aware during the war, of Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: No, I wasn’t aware of any camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: S-So, when you started to learn about what had happened, and the scale of the killings that -- the murders that had taken place, after the war, do you remember the -- how you learned about that, and the effect that it had on you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: You know, I’m not sure whether I understood you, yeah -- will you -- I just was thinking of something else.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: Could you please repeat it?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s481">After the war, when you were in Italy, and you started to hear about the camps, and what -- and the -- what had happened there, and how many -- h-how many Jews had been murdered -- Jews, and others too, ho -- do you remember the effect that that news had on you when you learned about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: When I learned about it, I did not know about any -- I mean, I learned about camps subsequently there were many, because I went back to Munich to look for my -- I thought maybe my sisters survived.</span> <span id="s483">And there were people [indecipherable] some of the camps.</span> <span id="s484">We didn’t know there was organized there.</span> <span id="s485">We thought maybe just this happened here, just happened in [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s486">They were so organized, they did town by town, village by village, and there was no communication at all, because peop -- there was no radio -- ra -- for ra -- if you had a radio, a death sentence, like arms, or radios.</span> <span id="s487">No newspapers.</span> <span id="s488">Didn’t know, didn’t know what’s going on.</span> <span id="s489">They kept many things so secretive.</span> <span id="s490">This way, there was no uprising to a degree.</span> <span id="s491">If we knew how they -- be more uprising, even if we had no arms, nobody helped us.</span> <span id="s492">Eve -- if anybody had arms, had to -- they were afraid to keep them, they turned them in, se -- except in Warsaw, they had uprising, and that’s the only wa -- place.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: So when you -- when you s -- after the war, and the information is flowing more freely, were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: -- were you shocked, or -- to find out what had happened, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: I was very -- of course, very, very -- I was very depressed about it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: This is tape number two, side A, of an interview with Norman Belfer.</span> <span id="s499">Wer -- were you -- did you have much personal contact with people who were coming from the camps while you were in Italy, and -- and was -- did you form friendships, for example?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Yes, I did make personal contacts with a number of people.</span> <span id="s501">Most people left -- migrated to the United State, to Canada, to Australia, to -- even some settled in Italy, which I still have one particular friend who lives in Italy, in Milan, and there may be more living there, but I’m not f -- f -- I don’t know them.</span> <span id="s502">They all had to s -- make a living, so they all looked for jobs, they looked for some profession, and some even went back to school.</span> <span id="s503">I knew a doctor, and -- in Great Neck, New York where we live, part time, who went to -- became a medical -- who became a physician, went to medical school in Italy.</span> <span id="s504">I knew an engineer, very brilliant guy, he’s deceased now, and he went to engineering school in Munich.</span> <span id="s505">So there are -- these are only a few individuals that I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: And did you talk together about what had happened during the war, or did -- were you more focused on the future?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: We talked, but very little.</span> <span id="s508">We -- we -- we would say where we were, what we lost.</span> <span id="s509">We -- we didn’t -- it was too painful, still, to talk, you know?</span> <span id="s510">As a matter of fact, my brother Maurice, who lost a wife and -- and a child, he remarried, you know, in Milan.</span> <span id="s511">And he never told his wife, and the -- all -- and his children, that he lo -- he had a wife before, and a child thas -- because it was too painful to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: He never told them?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Never told them.</span> <span id="s514">How I know is, after he passed away, I wa -- I was discussing it.</span> <span id="s515">He may have told her that he had a wife, and a child, but the children, you know, they’re in their 20’s, didn’t know.</span> <span id="s516">He wouldn’t talk about his experiences.</span> <span id="s517">Was too painful to him.</span> <span id="s518">My children, I did tell, over the years, yes.</span> <span id="s519">Little by little, yeah.</span> <span id="s520">They ask questions.</span> <span id="s521">But he never told his children.</span> <span id="s522">He -- if the children would ask him, he would say, “I don’t want to talk about it, it’s too painful for me.”</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: That must have been --</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: I think since “Schindler’s List,” -- you know, that movie, a lot of survivors, for some reason, that I -- that I know, you know, in the -- in New York area, have been talking more openly, for some reason.</span> <span id="s525">I don’t know, I mean it’s -- many years past, obviously, from ’45 to now, you know?</span> <span id="s526">It’s 55 years.</span> <span id="s527">But people in the last few years, you see, are more -- talk more about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: Are -- is it important to you to have friendships with survivors, people who have been through something similar to what you’ve been through?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Only some, obviously.</span> <span id="s530">Not too many.</span> <span id="s531">Cause the area we lived weren’t any, really to -- that I know of.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: In Great Neck?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: In Great Neck.</span> <span id="s534">Th -- if there were any, I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s535">In New York I had -- in New York City, you have Brooklyn, and you know, the Bronx there was some people.</span> <span id="s536">And especially I got to know them after -- in the last 20 years, Yad Vashem became very active, and I’m one of the -- I’m the international vice-chairman of Yad Vashem.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: I want to hear more about your work with Yad Vashem, and -- and the museum, but first -- maybe we should do that a little later --</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Surely.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: -- and -- and stay with -- I wanted to ask about Maurice’s -- you mentioned in the first interview that Maurice married in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: And he married a German woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: She was German Jewish, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: German Jewish, Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s545">Actually more in the -- more French than German, she c-came from a town, S-Sowerbriken.</span> <span id="s546">I don’t know the English way of --</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: It’s on German- French border.</span> <span id="s549">She spoke French and German, and Italy -- and Italian, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: And also, regarding -- you mentioned a little earlier that -- that you’ve -- that it’s been difficult for you to forgive the German people, or that you -- you don’t want to forgive them.</span> <span id="s551">Have you had to -- in your business, have you had to deal with Germans, or is --</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: I never wanted to deal with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: And y-you haven’t had -- had to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: As a matter of fact, one time si -- I was building a major project in New Jersey, on the Palisades, and I was working -- Citibank was my sub -- bank, and one of the officers from Citibank said, “There’s some Germans who would be very much interested in buying your project or become part of this.”</span> <span id="s555">I said, “Tell them that I would never deal with Germans because of my background.”</span> <span id="s556">I -- just simply not -- and the same -- Arabs approach me, over the years, I don’t want to do any business.</span> <span id="s557">It’s not just making money, it’s -- I wouldn’t just sell myself because to make money, you know?</span> <span id="s558">I’m still very hurt about it, obviously, but I -- I -- I try -- I don’t think about it, I try not to.</span> <span id="s559">I’m a very, very disciplined person, you know.</span> <span id="s560">I ha -- I learned how -- things that are not important, I -- I never think about it.</span> <span id="s561">I try to get it out of my mind.</span> <span id="s562">Otherwise I couldn’t -- I couldn’t live properly, I was -- as -- or do anything the ri -- you know?</span> <span id="s563">If you’re filled with all kinds of emotions, you couldn’t make decisions, you couldn’t be successful in any type of profession or -- or business, or -- or teaching, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: When you were in Italy, did you travel around much in Italy --</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: -- were you interested in the culture?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: Yes, I -- I -- I remember the first time I went to Rome.</span> <span id="s568">And we went -- with my brother, Maurice, and we went to the Vatican, and was so impressed with the grandeur, with all the -- the art, and everything so impressive.</span> <span id="s569">Very imp -- I was -- had a -- I never expected this to be so -- so interesting, and when I wa-walked out, there were mothers with little -- with children, begging for a penny, you know?</span> <span id="s570">That I couldn’t stand to see, the richness of the Vatican, all -- even gold jewelry, and all this, and couldn’t support these poor mothers, you know?</span> <span id="s571">And you saw two, three year olds, five years olds running around on that square, and some would tr -- even had maybe 10 year old boys, or maybe 12, they were selling pornographic pictures, you know?</span> <span id="s572">I tr [indecipherable] I -- I couldn’t understand that.</span> <span id="s573">But we also traveled you know, and I loved Florence, and Venice very much, and also some [indecipherable] you know.</span> <span id="s574">Shallite, and I like Kromo, near the Swiss border, you know?</span> <span id="s575">That beautiful hotel there, and Straza, and Terrona.</span> <span id="s576">I know a lot of it.</span> <span id="s577">And southern Italy, there.</span> <span id="s578">I knew Ispia, and Capri, and Naples.</span> <span id="s579">I-I -- I made a point, the first few years, you know, the fir -- after a couple years I said to my brother, “Y -- we have enough money now to -- we don’t have to work so hard.</span> <span id="s580">Now, let’s do some traveling, and so on.”</span> <span id="s581">And we didn’t have a lot of money, but to us it was a -- a lot.</span> <span id="s582">We had 10,000 dollars, we -- we were millionaires in Italian liras, you know?</span> <span id="s583">10,000 dollar was like 10 million liras, you know?</span> <span id="s584">So -- so [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s585">So we traveled a lot.</span> <span id="s586">We had a -- made a lot of nice friends, some Italians, and non-Italian.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: Did you practice Judaism at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: Did I what?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Did you -- did you practice Judaism at all?</span> <span id="s590">Did you go to synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s592">Not really at all.</span> <span id="s593">Not at all.</span> <span id="s594">Also, I be -- I was interested, and during high holidays I would go to a temple there.</span> <span id="s595">It was like a Reform temple.</span> <span id="s596">But I -- I was angry about this whole thing, you know, other religions.</span> <span id="s597">It -- however, it’s -- you get older and older, you start thinking maybe -- I don’t understand, I can’t explain it, but where is God?</span> <span id="s598">Why have you punished?</span> <span id="s599">And so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: Y -- we didn’t hear anything about your religion, or your religious education before the war.</span> <span id="s601">I know that your father was Orthodox, but were -- did you have any natural inclination or interest in -- in religious issues, or -- or natural faith as a -- as a young man?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Yes, I was -- as a young man, I was very -- I would say very observant.</span> <span id="s603">But I was not a f -- never was a fanatic, you know.</span> <span id="s604">Neither was my father, he was a very Orthodox, but he was -- he di -- but he was active in the business world, and so on.</span> <span id="s605">But I went to Yesh-Yeshiva, you know, before -- til ma -- maybe I was 13 years old, you know?</span> <span id="s606">And then I went to Hebrew high school.</span> <span id="s607">That’s where I learned spa -- I knew -- I knew Hebrew, but I didn’t know it was a spoken language [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s608">My family all were very learned you know, and very broad minded.</span> <span id="s609">And I must have had a very strong background, or whatever.</span> <span id="s610">They gave me a lot of -- they brought me up right, obviously.</span> <span id="s611">I love people, I trust people, I -- I can read people.</span> <span id="s612">Maybe that developed a little [indecipherable] too.</span> <span id="s613">I can read who is sensi, who isn’t, you know?</span> <span id="s614">I lo -- now I say I lost a little bit of it, but I -- I don’t, know, I can read people.</span> <span id="s615">It’s amazing how well.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: You think that you could do that during the war, as well, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s619">Do you think that helped you to survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: Must have, yes.</span> <span id="s621">I always kept a straight face, I don’t know [indecipherable] such horrible things, I would not -- some people got very upset, and they would be part of that they were -- they didn’t survive after that, you know?</span> <span id="s622">They would cry and scream, or whatever.</span> <span id="s623">You had to be made of iron.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Can you say something more about -- about the -- about your religion now, a -- your faith now?</span> <span id="s625">It sounded like y -- it’s developed.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: I am -- I am, I would say, Conservative.</span> <span id="s627">In other words, I go to temple only on high holidays, and also when I have -- you know, Yahrtzeit, what -- what it means?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: Remembrance?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: Where you go -- yeah -- you -- we -- we approximate our dates when I lost my parents, then I go to temple, or my sisters [inaudible].</span> <span id="s630">The one th -- there’s a date, and they -- it’s a memorial day for that person, whatever, I would go.</span> <span id="s631">Otherwise, I don’t go.</span> <span id="s632">What I found interesting, I don’t know, very few people know that, when I lived in Italy, I had a girlfriend.</span> <span id="s633">Her fa -- I met her father, the father was Jewish, the mother was Gentile.</span> <span id="s634">And she was a lovely girl.</span> <span id="s635">She told me she’s Christian because her mother’s Christian, and her brothers are Jewish, because the father is Jewish.</span> <span id="s636">It’s -- it’s the only place I’ve heard of is in Italy, yeah.</span> <span id="s637">They will go to church, all of them, let’s say Christmas, and high holi -- Jewish high holidays all go to temple, to synagogue.</span> <span id="s638">That’s -- and -- and it was very, very normal there, it wasn’t -- there were a number of families like this.</span> <span id="s639">I’ve never heard of it in any other place.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Does that -- how do you feel about that now?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: I think -- I think it’s better than hating each other.</span> <span id="s642">It’s a very good compromise, its’ a very good compromise.</span> <span id="s643">Because very often I hear you intermarry, and when something goes wrong, they right away pick on religion, yeah.</span> <span id="s644">They don’t blame, because he -- you don’t -- well I don’t focus on -- on it, you don’t understand it, but I -- people get angry.</span> <span id="s645">[indecipherable] call you -- you’re a Jew, or you’re this, or you’re that, you know?</span> <span id="s646">Had nothing to do with the religion.</span> <span id="s647">What I was in -- what amazed me a bi -- the reason I loved Italy so much, there was no -- I couldn’t feel any anti-Semitism, none whatsoever.</span> <span id="s648">I told people, they ask me, yeah, I say -- I’m a -- a brayer who is Jewish, you know.</span> <span id="s649">Some even -- I had some Christian friends that we made over the years.</span> <span id="s650">I met them during -- in the hotel, you know, when you’re on vacation, became friendly.</span> <span id="s651">So they ask me one time, “Where you going for Christmas night, where you going?</span> <span id="s652">Which church do you go to?”</span> <span id="s653">I said, “I told you I’m -- I’m a -- a brayer, I’m Jewish.”</span> <span id="s654">He said, “You’re Jewish?</span> <span id="s655">But you poli -- you come from Poland.”</span> <span id="s656">They don’t understand.</span> <span id="s657">Poland all Christians.</span> <span id="s658">I say, “Yes, but there were some Jews there.”</span> <span id="s659">And they don’t -- didn’t matter at all.</span> <span id="s660">[indecipherable] years after.</span> <span id="s661">As a matter of fact I have one guy who’ve send me a present last ti -- last year.</span> <span id="s662">We exchange presents occasionally.</span> <span id="s663">Sent some shirts with the name Belfer.</span> <span id="s664">There’s a company, you know, in Italy, they make very fancy sports clothes, and he sent my wife and me shirts with Belfer and Belfer, printed in, some logo.</span> <span id="s665">So he found it in a store in Milan, so he felt he has to send it to me.</span> <span id="s666">We’re going to see him this summer, too.</span> <span id="s667">It’s -- th-th-the Catholic church actually is the major -- all of the maj -- the major, the pope, and all the cardinals, and all this, all operate from Rome.</span> <span id="s668">And I couldn’t understand why there’s so little anti-Semitism in -- in Italy, and so much in -- in other parts of the, in Europe.</span> <span id="s669">I couldn’t understand that.</span> <span id="s670">They weren’t preaching it, maybe, at their home base.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Di -- have you had any -- how do you feel about Catholicism in general, I mean, having lived in a Catholic country, do you think that -- that most Catholics are anti-Semitic, and it was just the Italians who weren’t, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: It’s -- it goes by country, so it’s almost -- like Czechoslovakia let say, I know it from people that I knew, and I traveled after the war to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s673">There was no -- not quarter as much anti-Se-Semitism as in Poland.</span> <span id="s674">Maybe because in Poland, there were -- the Jews were there longer, for over a thousand years, and there were more Jews there.</span> <span id="s675">I don’t -- we don’t know.</span> <span id="s676">And also, they were less educated.</span> <span id="s677">The Poles were not very well -- there were many illiterates, it -- maybe than other countries.</span> <span id="s678">But see, let’s -- but at the same time, look at the Germans, very -- they’re very -- the most educated people in Europe, they were, and what they did, you know.</span> <span id="s679">They did it, I think, because the whole world, nobody actually protested, nobody came to help.</span> <span id="s680">All -- by -- by being silent is like acquiescing.</span> <span id="s681">And some even helped.</span> <span id="s682">Like a small country like Denmark, they told them the -- you know, to wear -- the Germans told them to wear these Star of David, you know, on their clothes, or whatever.</span> <span id="s683">They said no til the king himself put it on.</span> <span id="s684">And more s -- more over Bulgaria was a country where they told the Germans, “If you co -- if you take one of our citizens out, there’s a war.”</span> <span id="s685">They never went in.</span> <span id="s686">Other countries let them in.</span> <span id="s687">And the worst, I feel, was Hungary, you know.</span> <span id="s688">They were occupy -- the Russians occupied most of Poland, all Poland.</span> <span id="s689">They were close to their borders, they were -- still was -- only a few weeks before the war, the entire war was over, they were still sending people in April.</span> <span id="s690">The war was over, let’s say, in some parts was over already, they were sending Jewish people to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s691">I mean, that’s unheard of.</span> <span id="s692">They just [indecipherable] us.</span> <span id="s693">It’s -- it’s painful to think about it.</span> <span id="s694">Why would you do that to another human being?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: I wanted to ask you, you had, as a young man, your education had been interrupted.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: I never finished high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Did you ever have the desire to -- to go back to school, to continue your edu -- your education, or did you ever do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: I did go -- I di -- I had private tutoring in Milan, you know, especially wanted to learn Italian.</span> <span id="s701">I also started -- took some business courses, and when I came to the U.S., I went to -- I became interested in real estate, you know.</span> <span id="s702">I -- I attended NYU, New York University, you know, has classes for j -- for drawings, and construction methods, and so on.</span> <span id="s703">And -- and also American history.</span> <span id="s704">I took courses night -- at night.</span> <span id="s705">That’s -- and I self educated myself.</span> <span id="s706">I -- I read as -- I -- when I have free time, I read, about everything that’s going on, you know.</span> <span id="s707">The New York Times specifically, I read from all cover to cover, in a way.</span> <span id="s708">And my wife is very -- she’s very intellectual.</span> <span id="s709">As a matter of fact, she is a founding chairman of Fellowship of Christian Jews, in Palm Beach.</span> <span id="s710">She been the f -- she’s a -- she can -- this organization’s only about maybe six, seven years old, you know.</span> <span id="s711">She’s on the board, and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s712">And Palm Beach itself was very anti-Semitic y-years ago, but it much, much, much less now.</span> <span id="s713">We have -- once a year, we have a big ball, you know, and [indecipherable] the Breaker’s Hotel, where many Christian Jews come, sit at the same tables.</span> <span id="s714">In -- in general, the -- the atmosphere is much, much better than it used to be there, because we have a dialog, they see we are not different than they are, really.</span> <span id="s715">We have -- here, we have a number of very Christian friends, very lovely people.</span> <span id="s716">I hope they think of us as much as [indecipherable] very lovely.</span> <span id="s717">I -- I don’t know, that’s why I can never understand the hate it build up.</span> <span id="s718">That -- that put a -- it bothers me, because if you’re not going to be aware of it, like in history, if you’re not aware of it, it’s doomed to repeat itself.</span> <span id="s719">In other words, if you don’t learn from the history.</span> <span id="s720">So you have to try to correct whatever is possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: Maybe we should talk about how you came to the United States.</span> <span id="s722">Do you want to say something about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: Surely.</span> <span id="s724">My brother Arthur would come to Milan, Italy because we lived there, and he wanted to buy more and more feathers, so he came every -- every year for awhile, see what we doing.</span> <span id="s725">And we had -- we were well established, and he was on the -- on a weekend, he went to the Lido Hotel in Long Beach -- Long Island, you know, he would -- he would go there always in the summertime, he and his family.</span> <span id="s726">He was swimming, and the undercurrent, he almost drowned.</span> <span id="s727">He, and a couple of other people, I -- I believe one of them drowned, or -- or two, I’m not sure, really.</span> <span id="s728">And he -- they operated on him be-because he had the lung -- they had to cut part of one of lung off -- he was -- so he asked me to come, he wasn’t doing well.</span> <span id="s729">Took awhile to get all better.</span> <span id="s730">I couldn’t refuse, so that’s how I came.</span> <span id="s731">I didn’t like it, really.</span> <span id="s732">I went back a few times, just for a short time, to visit my other brother.</span> <span id="s733">And finally I met Eleanor, see.</span> <span id="s734">And when I met her, so -- of course, we got engaged, and awhile later, and then we got married, so they went to Italy, and I stayed there.</span> <span id="s735">We stayed there for five weeks, my brother was calling me after two weeks, when are you coming back?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: So he really needed you?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s738">When are you coming back?</span> <span id="s739">So we star -- I he -- you know, that time, Eleanor [indecipherable] her parents heard that you going to Italy, going to Italy, and I’d say that they were not very sophisticated about Europe, you know.</span> <span id="s740">Oh.</span> <span id="s741">They said, “Why would you go to Italy, so many places in the United States.”</span> <span id="s742">I said, “I like it.”</span> <span id="s743">But Eleanor loved it, too.</span> <span id="s744">I was considering staying back in Italy, coming back.</span> <span id="s745">But I had s -- a feeling for my brother, and we got married, and I -- we settled here, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Can you say something more about why you didn’t like the United States, or why it didn’t appeal to you as much as Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: First off, when I arrived at the piers in New York, the screaming, and the yelling, and the taxi drivers.</span> <span id="s748">You have to wait to get a taxi, everybody was trying to get taxis.</span> <span id="s749">And the noise, and the overhead west side highway, you know?</span> <span id="s750">And there were so many people in the streets, and all types of people, and I just took me -- took me time to get used to it, simple as that.</span> <span id="s751">Not I didn’t like it, but I -- I didn’t like the food, either.</span> <span id="s752">However, my brother and his family took me out to a steak house, they gave us steak for three people, you know?</span> <span id="s753">I remember [indecipherable] I couldn’t -- I wasn’t used to this type of food, I liked Italian food.</span> <span id="s754">And little things, nothing.</span> <span id="s755">Once I learned more about th-this -- the American system in amer -- and the way things are done here, I started to love it.</span> <span id="s756">It took me -- it took me a short time, it took a couple of years.</span> <span id="s757">Then I became more used to it, you know.</span> <span id="s758">I love it now.</span> <span id="s759">I’m very proud to be an American citizen [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s760">I do anything that is proper there to any citizen, I don’t care whether they’re -- or what color or what religion I-I’m not this way.</span> <span id="s761">As a matter of fact, when I came am -- to the United States, I never saw Black children.</span> <span id="s762">Where -- I could see Black people aft-after the war, because in Poland, never -- I never saw a Black person, never.</span> <span id="s763">In Italy, you see th -- I saw some, and Germany, cause soldiers, you know still were after the war.</span> <span id="s764">But I never saw a child, or a woman.</span> <span id="s765">A woman I saw, only in a film, where that -- the, “Gone With the Wind,” had that -- I remember distinctly.</span> <span id="s766">I used to go to English movies in Milan, I wanted to improve my -- my English.</span> <span id="s767">So I ha -- I -- I had no prejudices.</span> <span id="s768">I mean, that’s how I was raised, obviously, it comes from childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: When did you become a citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: I became a citizen in -- let’s see -- in ’52, I believe, 1952.</span> <span id="s771">I believe you have to be -- if you’re married to a -- an American citizen, I believe after two years -- is it two or three years, I’m not sure, you become -- I got a passport, yeah.</span> <span id="s772">And if you are not a -- if you’re not married to an American, it’s -- takes five years to get a citizenship papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: And by that point, did you feel very loyal to this cou --</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: -- or really interested in this --</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: There’s certain things I didn’t like.</span> <span id="s777">People were -- some people were -- I find European people -- and I’m talking about Italy, I cannot -- I cannot speak about Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: Their behavior -- the behavior was more refined in Europe than in the United States.</span> <span id="s780">It may have change now, you know.</span> <span id="s781">Matter of fact, American used to dress differently, you know.</span> <span id="s782">In Dearborn, I -- I remember, I had the custom made suit for coming to America.</span> <span id="s783">I thought I want to look proper, you know?</span> <span id="s784">And they -- the first thing my brother says, “You look like a greener.”</span> <span id="s785">You know what a greener?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: Like a greenhorn?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: Greenhorn.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: And this American says, “Why don’t you come and buy some suits?”</span> <span id="s790">He wanted to go -- this was around the year end.</span> <span id="s791">So he wanted to go a hotel in the Catskills, he says, “People don’t dress like this.”</span> <span id="s792">I said, “Okay, let’s go.”</span> <span id="s793">I tried on -- everything was so big -- I’m sorry -- big, and -- I d -- as -- I couldn’t find an-anything, but that -- so I bought some -- one suit, but I don’t want to buy any more.</span> <span id="s794">But also ties, at that time they were big ties, and very loud.</span> <span id="s795">I was not used to it, so -- anyway.</span> <span id="s796">But I feel in the United States, you don’t have this -- you still have some resentment, and -- but it’s more civilized.</span> <span id="s797">It’s a ver -- if there is a resentment -- in Europe they were all open, you know, and -- and I continued, it’s -- it was a continuous problem, you know, whether you’re Jewish, or non-Jewish, German, or Italian, or this.</span> <span id="s798">Even then -- between nations, they were hating each other.</span> <span id="s799">That’s why they had wars every -- every 25 years, or twen -- every -- a new war.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: I wanted to ask you just a little bit more about Israel, or wa -- Palestine, wa -- your plans to go, and did -- was it difficult to disc -- to change your mind about that, or did -- how did -- how did your -- how did that desire to go --</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: I definitely intended to go, I definitely wanted to go there, and so did my brother.</span> <span id="s802">We felt that we have been abused, and -- and murdered, you know, and we just wanted to be in a Jewish state, you know?</span> <span id="s803">It was not a state yet, but we hoped.</span> <span id="s804">We will fight, we were ready to fight, and do anything, to have a -- a sovereign Jewish state, because we felt then, and now, if we had a Jewish state, this would have never happened.</span> <span id="s805">Maybe people would have been killed, but not by the -- by the millions.</span> <span id="s806">Nobody he -- you know, even the United States, th-they could have helped, they didn’t help.</span> <span id="s807">None of the European countries helped, and -- nobody helped us.</span> <span id="s808">And nobody gave us weapons.</span> <span id="s809">If anybody had weapons, had to turn them in, in the beginning, you know?</span> <span id="s810">The first two years, you hear they would shoot somebody, or put you in jail for nothing, [indecipherable], but then gradually became harder and harder.</span> <span id="s811">They fooled you in such a way.</span> <span id="s812">Very little was known, what was going on.</span> <span id="s813">And even the best of your neighbors, some of them, they want -- if they, let’s say, wanted to help, were afraid to help, see?</span> <span id="s814">But they’re very few.</span> <span id="s815">As a matter of fact, I was in -- at Yad Vashem, it’s going to be two years in j -- this Ju-June, yeah, where [indecipherable] the 50th anniversary of the state of Israel.</span> <span id="s816">I believe that’s when it -- yes, ’48, yeah.</span> <span id="s817">Yad Vashem invited 60 families from Europe who helped -- Righteous Gentile, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: You mentioned -- we were talking a little bit about -- about Israel --</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: Is there anything else you want to say about that?</span> <span id="s821">Maybe w-was it -- have you always followed closely the -- the political situation there?</span> <span id="s822">For example, when the sic -- six day war came along in -- in 1967, was that an -- was than an important event for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: It was extremely important, because we -- we felt -- I felt that they liberated the land that th-the -- that the Arabs felt is their land, but if you go back in history, a lot of it belonged to Israel.</span> <span id="s824">And even now, the dispute about the Gaza Strip, and other areas, you know, that belong to Israel, but Israel is not a state.</span> <span id="s825">It’s Palestine, and -- there’s a conflict, of course, and I hope they -- they will have a peace tre-treaty, and try to live together, and they’ll be much better off by -- they don’t have to love each other, but at least they should co-exist.</span> <span id="s826">By co-existing, the Arabs would definitely benefit, and I think even Israel would benefit, having peace, not have to arm itself, and lose people, you know, and -- which is completely a waste of human life.</span> <span id="s827">They can -- but what is -- what is bad in -- in -- in -- in these Arab countries, like Saudi Arabia has all the money, and other, and Iran, and all this, they all -- they hate each other to -- they don’t hate only Israel, they hate each other.</span> <span id="s828">Iraq, you know?</span> <span id="s829">They depressed -- they oppressed the people, and they live like -- all the leaders in these countries li-live like kings.</span> <span id="s830">You see them when you go to Europe, in some hotels, I’ve met some -- I was in Switzerland maybe 10 years ago.</span> <span id="s831">They take entire floors, they come with a whole crew, you know, they all -- a cook, and help, and what they love most, I’ve seen, they go to gambling casinos.</span> <span id="s832">They gamble maybe thousands, or millions, who knows?</span> <span id="s833">They just -- the disgrace of their own people; instead of building them up, they build themselves up, the leaders themselves.</span> <span id="s834">It’s unfortunate.</span> <span id="s835">Also the market, let’s say, the Arab -- because of the standard of living there, their wages are so low by comparison to Israel, or by com -- comparison to European’s standards.</span> <span id="s836">And even s -- Far East -- the Far East was -- China, or any of these countries, exporting a lot of goods to the United States, because their labor is extremely -- 10 cents an hour.</span> <span id="s837">In the Arab countries some ma -- don’t make more, they’re making less.</span> <span id="s838">They could build up their economies, like Japan did after World War two, and others, with the help of the Israelis, but they -- their leaders are fighting, not even knowing what their -- they want, and every [indecipherable] they make, they don’t live up to, you know, it’s -- it’s a constant problem.</span> <span id="s839">I hope the new generation will understand that better, be more educated, more broadminded, and there’ll be peace in that area, and by having peace in that area, will be peace also in many other areas, because we are interrelated in a way, one country with a -- with another.</span> <span id="s840">I hope th -- Iraq, in particular, and Iran, that they have some new governments, you know, which are more for the people, not for themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: When did you first travel to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: I went to Israel, I -- I believe the first time in -- in the late 50’s, early six -- yeah, 1960 I know I was there, you know, 1960 [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s843">That was a time which was very unusual.</span> <span id="s844">That -- Adolf Eichmann, at that time, when we were in Israel, was brought from Argentina, or whatever, and was a big, big celebration, in a way.</span> <span id="s845">Sort of tragic, but -- that they caught him and brought him to justice.</span> <span id="s846">And I was -- the streets were full of people, and s -- and was so much excitement about it.</span> <span id="s847">Was very -- I wa -- we were very happy to be there, to be -- to have been there, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Did you follow the trials closely, the Eichmann trials?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: To a degree, yes, yes I have, definitely.</span> <span id="s850">As a matter of fact, we were in Israel the two years ago, I started to tell you about the -- I don’t know whether I finished it.</span> <span id="s851">Yad Vashem invited 60 families from Europe.</span> <span id="s852">These 60 families, whose -- who were -- helped Jews, they didn’t have to be the -- they could have been children, or grandchildren of them, the whole families were invited for the -- they were put up in the Hilton Hotel, a very fine hotel.</span> <span id="s853">Made big dinners, and we were -- the big ceremony at Yad Vashem, and the many -- there were dignitaries from different countries, and -- and there was a discussion, one of the speakers said, I’m -- I’m not sure whether it was Netanyahu, or somebody else, during the war, World War two, there were 400 million people in -- in Europe, and how many do you think -- Gentiles -- helped Jewish people?</span> <span id="s854">Under 14,000.</span> <span id="s855">A fraction of -- less than one -- a fraction of one percent, you know.</span> <span id="s856">In other words, that’s -- that tells a lot.</span> <span id="s857">The people who -- who were invited, were given special medals, like [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s858">They were treated royally, they were invited to the -- to the president’s house, and that really -- they -- they were so -- so amazed, and some of them say they want to come and s -- and retire there.</span> <span id="s859">They were so -- so amazed, yeah.</span> <span id="s860">Yes, what I wanted to say, we met yes -- we met an elderly lady wi-with her son, from Holland.</span> <span id="s861">No -- not -- not from Holland, from Austria.</span> <span id="s862">She was put in a camp in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s863">She was a German physician -- Austrian physician who helped Jewish people -- or Jewish friends, you know?</span> <span id="s864">She helped them, something, she was put in -- into Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s865">And she said that she worked under Mengele, you know?</span> <span id="s866">And he experimented with human lives, and so on.</span> <span id="s867">He gave and she was supposed to give him certain pills to take, you know, make sure that they swallow, and so on.</span> <span id="s868">A lot of them she did not distribute, she di -- she disposed of it, you know, she -- and so on.</span> <span id="s869">Certainly she -- and she even said what -- what the drugs were, certain drugs.</span> <span id="s870">She was a very elderly, and she wasn’t in good health, she was wearing a -- sh -- with crutches, you know.</span> <span id="s871">But her son was very intelligent.</span> <span id="s872">Nice man.</span> <span id="s873">And he explained the whole -- what meng -- what Mengele, what he did to the prisoners, you know.</span> <span id="s874">He kept them out nude in that na -- in the -- in the freezing weather, to try -- how much you can stand.</span> <span id="s875">There all kind of experiments.</span> <span id="s876">Whatever she could help avoiding, she would -- she was risking her own life, but she said she couldn’t say one hu -- why one human being could do this to another.</span> <span id="s877">And many of these Christians who were invited, they were very loving people.</span> <span id="s878">They say what they did to -- to you.</span> <span id="s879">They call us brother, and you know, they said -- they even said, you know -- I remember he said, we are brethren, beca -- we -- we believe in Jesus, and Jesus was a Jew.</span> <span id="s880">They even brought up, why would I hate the Jews, you know?</span> <span id="s881">He actually -- the Jews with the 10 commandments, all kinds.</span> <span id="s882">We tried -- they tried to explain their reasoning, tried to find why would this happen.</span> <span id="s883">It’s -- this was quite interesting, and moving, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: Maybe this would be a good time for you to talk more about your role with Yad Vashem, and -- and with the US Holocaust Museum, and how you --</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: What -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: -- how you became involved with helping.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: I -- I couldn’t hear the last.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: How you became involved with helping to develop these --</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: -- organizations.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: I ha -- I have some friends in New York, and this happened, I mean, 30 years ago.</span> <span id="s892">They said, you know, the Yad Vashem -- they built -- the government actually supporting it.</span> <span id="s893">But Israel at that time was not in finan -- well, not in very good financial status, and they wanted foreigners who have some means, to help, and w -- they formed an organization New York, and I was invited to come and -- and I took an active role in -- you know, at meetings and so on, and I became a vice-chairman.</span> <span id="s894">Also went to Israel, and to the museum on many occasions, to have meetings there s -- and that’s how I got involved.</span> <span id="s895">And once a year we have a meeting in -- in New York, where there are over a thou -- 1200 people show up, you know.</span> <span id="s896">More, on account of it’s -- the -- this is the largest room in New York, the Hilton Hotel, it’s -- that can accommodate up to 1200 people, otherwise there would be more.</span> <span id="s897">It’s not only survivors, many Americans will come there, and I’m -- I’m active in that organization, I’m active in many other -- several others, there.</span> <span id="s898">But that, primarily.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: I was wondering whether I -- I saw in your first interview that your mother had told you s -- before she died, that she -- she had told you to talk about -- to survive, and to talk about what had happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: And I’m wondering how much that -- those words stayed in your mind, and influenced your -- your work, after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: This -- the words stuck in my mind very -- and still now, you know.</span> <span id="s903">Especially during the war years, there was a time at the end of the war year days, the last week of the war years, w-we went through hell, and I -- I could not -- I wanted to give up, I couldn’t give up.</span> <span id="s904">I -- I mean, I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s905">I couldn’t walk any more.</span> <span id="s906">I just -- but I was thinking of my mother, I have to survive and tell the world what happened.</span> <span id="s907">She -- that’s what she told me.</span> <span id="s908">She told me, you’re the youngest -- and she told it to Maurice, too.</span> <span id="s909">Wa -- say -- to me, she says, “Remember, you are the youngest, you are the -- you look strong and healthy.</span> <span id="s910">You never -- y-you always have been healthy.</span> <span id="s911">You eat right, [indecipherable]” -- you know, after it happened to my father, you know, the -- they shot my father, that’s -- that’s the time she told me.</span> <span id="s912">“You have to tell the world what happened, because this -- this is a tragedy that is going to go down in history for -- for hundreds of years, wh-what we see, what they doing to us here.</span> <span id="s913">And do your utmost to survive.</span> <span id="s914">I am,” she said, “I am old.”</span> <span id="s915">She was, that time 55 - 57, something that -- I’m not sure, maybe 57, or fi -- or 55.</span> <span id="s916">And that -- that always has been in my head, you know?</span> <span id="s917">So when I have an opportunity, we have some Christian friends here in Palm Beach, even they talk about -- talk to me, they -- they indirectly find out I -- I’m a survivor, or -- or Eleanor would say, you know, “I -- I’m European, and I am survivor of the war.”</span> <span id="s918">So, they want -- some want to know.</span> <span id="s919">I showed some of the films, the videotapes, they can’t believe it, you know.</span> <span id="s920">They say it’s mindboggling, you know, it’s -- but that’s -- that’s -- that’s how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: When did you start to speak about your experiences during the war?</span> <span id="s922">Di -- when you met Eleanor, did you talk to her about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: I told her a little.</span> <span id="s924">I told her that I was in a concentration camp, but I didn’t tell her that much.</span> <span id="s925">Gradually, I would tell her more and more, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: Was sh -- did she encourage you to talk about it, or discourage you?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: Did she encourage you to talk about it, or did she discourage you from talking about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: I would say she -- she would ask questions, but I -- I never wanted to elaborate too much.</span> <span id="s930">I felt it was too upsetting to me, and it upsetted her, you know.</span> <span id="s931">She’s very se -- very sensitive, you know, about th-this, you know.</span> <span id="s932">She can’t understand why these things should have happened.</span> <span id="s933">And a lot of it could have been avoided, but nobody cared.</span> <span id="s934">It’s as simple as that.</span> <span id="s935">Nobody cared.</span> <span id="s936">Y-- with the boats, you know, came to the American shores, and sent them back.</span> <span id="s937">Most of them perished.</span> <span id="s938">And now, anybody wants to come to America, comes in.</span> <span id="s939">Including criminals can come in.</span> <span id="s940">Nobody stops them, to -- the way they stopped civilized people, educated people, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Did -- was there a point where it became important to you to talk about your experiences, and what had happened, or is it still --</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: I would tell -- yes, I was honored by Yad Vashem, I would tell my story.</span> <span id="s943">As a matter of fact, only a couple weeks ago, I was honored here by American Jewish Committee, and they wanted me to talk about it, and I did, yeah.</span> <span id="s944">And they said they never had such -- so many people came, and so many money.</span> <span id="s945">They raised ever -- they never raised as much money.</span> <span id="s946">Was a fundraiser.</span> <span id="s947">American Jewish Committee, you know, they -- they fight bigotry, anti-Semitism, racism, all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: Where did you say that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: American Jewish Com-Committee.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: And -- and that took place here, in --</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: In Palm Beach, yes.</span> <span id="s952">They have a -- usually a dinner, or a -- every year, you know, or cocktail reception.</span> <span id="s953">And it’s like ADL, you know, Anti-Defamation League is the same thing, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: And y-you felt -- was there a time when you -- when you felt like you couldn’t talk about it, and that you were able to later, or how -- how did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: I -- I never encouraged it, you know, I never, unless somebody asked me, yes, I would have.</span> <span id="s956">But I would never start that.</span> <span id="s957">There are many friends who know me for 40 years, they -- they ju -- and they just found out last year, or two years ago, whatever.</span> <span id="s958">But it became more among survivors, after “Schindler’s List,” I notice they talk more openly, everybody talks more openly.</span> <span id="s959">There was -- not they didn’t talk because they were -- they didn’t ha-ha -- crimes they didn’t want to, it was too painful to them to talk about it, because it’s -- it’s -- it’s very hard, you know, God forbid if people lose a whole, entire family.</span> <span id="s960">Parents, sisters, nieces, nephews, friends.</span> <span id="s961">It’s just -- it’s -- what I’m saying it, I -- I don’t understand.</span> <span id="s962">I -- it’s -- it’s painful, I don’t understand it.</span> <span id="s963">But that’s -- that’s -- that -- that is life, it happened.</span> <span id="s964">We have to make sure it does not happen again, and that’s why I’m active in that, every organization who fights, bigo -- bigotry, and anti -- not only anti-Semitism, anti-Black, anti-thi --whatever.</span> <span id="s965">I am strongly against.</span> <span id="s966">I support every organization that I -- this is no -- no rhyme or reason for it, except, I would say -- I would say ignorance.</span> <span id="s967">Plain ignorance, and stupidity.</span> <span id="s968">We can live in a much better world, why fight?</span> <span id="s969">Yes, we may have disagreements, or dis -- different approaches to different si -- certain problems, but you -- we discuss it.</span> <span id="s970">You --you compromise, or you convince the other person.</span> <span id="s971">Why -- that’s one thing, I never -- since World War -- since I was liberated, after the World War two, I never had a fight with anybody.</span> <span id="s972">Never sued anybody, never a -- nobody sued me.</span> <span id="s973">Except when I had -- about 10 years ago, I had some guy here in Palm Beach -- not Palm -- west Palm, whatever, a builder, who -- who took advantage of me, anyway.</span> <span id="s974">Financially [indecipherable] nothing, you know.</span> <span id="s975">He forged statements and stuff like this, so -- I’m bigger and better, and I blame myself, I’m very trusting, you know.</span> <span id="s976">And this person was recommended to me by my attorney, is why I felt he can trust -- but -- but I -- I say, material things are -- I’d never -- ha-have never been a problem to me, I could somehow managed.</span> <span id="s977">Whatever I did -- I -- I -- I did almost to perfection, you know?</span> <span id="s978">And people like to deal with -- with me.</span> <span id="s979">My reputation is ses -- is great, and -- and I -- I hope the future generations will be free of all these prejudices, and mistreatments, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: Let me ask you so -- clearly, you’re -- you’ve had a great deal of success with -- with your undertakings in -- in life, and -- and I think that’s not a -- many Holocaust survivors have been very successful after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: And you don’t -- you -- I might think -- one might think that after what Holocaust survivors have been through, that -- that it would be very difficult to -- to achieve so much --</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: -- after the war.</span> <span id="s985">Do you have any explanation for that, any person --</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: But ma -- yeah, the majority did not achieve anything.</span> <span id="s987">You know, a lot of them -- a lot of them I know are poor, and depend on help wi -- from others.</span> <span id="s988">You only -- the -- the visible ones, are the ones who have been successful.</span> <span id="s989">Because they travel, they go around, and they see them at charity dinners, and so on.</span> <span id="s990">I think the rea -- I can explain my -- and I believe I mentioned it before.</span> <span id="s991">And I f -- I find every survivor who’s successful, is he wants to prove that he’s not treated like an animal, you know.</span> <span id="s992">That they’ve been so mistreated, they want to prove to the world at large, that they are decent human beings, they’re productive in soc -- in society.</span> <span id="s993">They’re knowledgeable about their work, whatever -- whether it’s professional or otherwise.</span> <span id="s994">And even as employees, you know, many of them, they try harder, they have to work harder, they had to work, first of all, by starting with -- with nothing, you had to work hard to get up the ladder a little, you know, and it’s very hard to make a living.</span> <span id="s995">I was successful because -- and my brother, because we had some contacts -- business contacts before one -- most of them didn’t have any.</span> <span id="s996">Had to -- had to work very hard.</span> <span id="s997">I know people with two jobs, you know, for years.</span> <span id="s998">But eventually, they started to make money, and -- and try to live better, and -- and di -- build some trust among business people, or professional people.</span> <span id="s999">I know some survivors who are wonderful architects, bright as -- or engineers I work with.</span> <span id="s1000">But we never discuss any of it, that stuff, unless I meet them at some of our dinners where they discuss, you know, Holocaust matters, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: This is tape number three, side A.</span> <span id="s1003">You mentioned in your videotape interview, you -- you said at one point that -- that you -- that during the war, you became numb to the violence after awhile.</span> <span id="s1004">And I -- I wonder if you could say how you became sensitive.</span> <span id="s1005">I mean, you’re obviously a very sensitive person.</span> <span id="s1006">Was -- was it a long process to kind of get -- move from being numb, to being more sensitive again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: The way I felt, obviously, it was -- every bad incident, you know, were -- it like multiplied, worked on you, and you -- you -- you had to feel a l -- that it -- almost, you don’t see it, you know?</span> <span id="s1008">You had to make believe you don’t see it, because otherwi -- it was -- it -- it was so painful, you had to give up, you know?</span> <span id="s1009">There were times y-you felt, you know, you’ll jump on one of these SS men, you -- even if he kills you later, you want to kick him in his -- some places, you know, and do whatever.</span> <span id="s1010">But that’s what I mean, you get -- you get so -- you get numb, because you can’t do anything.</span> <span id="s1011">You can -- y-you, it’s not only they’ll kill you, the rule was there, let’s say one prisoner disappeared.</span> <span id="s1012">Because, we had to line up every morning with the same people, and the same -- you know, to march, you know, there were four or five of us, in width.</span> <span id="s1013">If one disappeared, 10 people were shot.</span> <span id="s1014">So, we had to police each others, nobody should disappear.</span> <span id="s1015">Some people even wanted to give up, they would lay down, they rather, instead of running away, they just sat down on the floor, and later they killed them, and put them on a truck, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1016">So you become -- that’s what I meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: Yeah, okay.</span> <span id="s1018">I under -- I understand that, I -- I think, and I just wondered if -- if it was difficult after the war, to -- to come back from that -- that experience of having -- having to numb yourself so that -- so that you wouldn’t g -- ex -- so that you’d be able to just control yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: But I’m wondering, a-a-after the war, how did y --</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: I must have been very, very strong, you know, mentally strong.</span> <span id="s1022">And if I could have seen such atrocities that -- I don’t think -- I don’t want to think about it.</span> <span id="s1023">If it comes to my mind, I try to shut off my mind at -- about it.</span> <span id="s1024">It such -- just -- in-incomprehensible, you know?</span> <span id="s1025">I don’t know how I did it, I just did it.</span> <span id="s1026">You know, it’s just -- maybe it’s -- I had that mission from my mother.</span> <span id="s1027">I had the -- also the anger, to get even with these criminals, you know?</span> <span id="s1028">And -- and ulti -- mayb -- I wanted to prove to myself, after the war, that I am -- I am a decent human being, and I’m better than -- than most of them.</span> <span id="s1029">And I’m going to show it to the world that I -- I’m a good person.</span> <span id="s1030">Why would the people who were l-like me, or better than me, had to -- had to -- had to die because of being one religion or another religion, or -- it’s -- it -- it’s -- it’s -- it’s a crazy, crazy world.</span> <span id="s1031">Crazy, and no sensit -- without any hearts, without any sensitivity.</span> <span id="s1032">They may have had a mind, but not a heart at all.</span> <span id="s1033">To be a good person, you have to have -- not only you have to have a good heart, above all, and a mind, too.</span> <span id="s1034">That’s all I really can say about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: Why don’t we go back to after you arrived in the United States, and you -- maybe you can say something about how you -- you established your business.</span> <span id="s1036">You -- you told the story on the videotape about how you -- you met Eleanor, and h-how much that turned you around, and -- and your willingness to -- to settle into life in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: What -- what else happened in those early years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: When I came to the United States, I came at the invitation of my brother, who wanted me to work with him.</span> <span id="s1040">At that time, my brother was in the feather and down business, but when I came, we bought a building on Staten Island, a-and it was formerly Wrigley chewing gum building.</span> <span id="s1041">And since there was a shortage of feathers and down still, we went into -- to manufacture foam rubber.</span> <span id="s1042">We hired some engineers from Firestone, I believe Firestone company, and chemists, and we built a plant.</span> <span id="s1043">Then the Korean war broke out, and there was a shortage of latex.</span> <span id="s1044">We had to buy latex via Europe, where there’s other cu -- via Canada.</span> <span id="s1045">We had the -- then they established quotas.</span> <span id="s1046">So we worked for several years, then we had to sell the plant, you know, for a -- maybe two, three years later.</span> <span id="s1047">[indecipherable] company [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1048">At that time, my brother and I, we started investing money in the oil business, in -- in Texas, and Wyoming, and so on.</span> <span id="s1049">I invested a certain amount of money, and he had most of the money.</span> <span id="s1050">It didn’t go too well, and then I met Eleanor, and I -- around that time, and my brother Maurice came to the United States, about three years later.</span> <span id="s1051">And he said, “Why you -- ano -- you have been losing money there.</span> <span id="s1052">Why you stay in the oil business?”</span> <span id="s1053">The first -- so, and -- I was more close to Maurice, he was close in age, and went through together all the -- all the war years.</span> <span id="s1054">So, I went back to the feather business, but my brother Arthur stayed in the oil business, became very, very, very affluent.</span> <span id="s1055">Was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and so on, became a public company.</span> <span id="s1056">And I then went into real estate, into -- used to buy some buildings, renovate them, then I went into -- I had a -- a structural engineer, and -- and a architect.</span> <span id="s1057">I had a -- a partner who was an architect.</span> <span id="s1058">We started building -- put up some buildings, and -- and I became successful with real estate.</span> <span id="s1059">And my other broth -- Maurice was -- still in the feather and down business, until he passed away about 18 or 20 years after [indecipherable] -- about 20 years, yeah.</span> <span id="s1060">So his son came in, he was running it, and we sold it only a couple years ago.</span> <span id="s1061">So, I was involved in these two businesses.</span> <span id="s1062">Did I answer -- I hope I answered the question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: It seems that your family stayed very, very close.</span> <span id="s1064">The -- those who survived, and maybe -- d-do you want to say anything more about your relationship with Maurice, and -- after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1066">I was much closer to him, yes.</span> <span id="s1067">My brother Arthur was 16 years older, and he has his ways, a certain way and I didn’t always see it his way, you know?</span> <span id="s1068">He was more -- I was more conservative, he was more -- he -- he would take chances, and so on.</span> <span id="s1069">But he -- he succeeded, you know.</span> <span id="s1070">And he -- he passed away only about six years ago.</span> <span id="s1071">He was 86, then, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: Did your relation -- I mean, you had been so -- through so much with Maurice during the war --</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: -- di -- was your relationship with him very important to you, afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: Yes, I would say so.</span> <span id="s1076">I don’t know, if I had Maurice, say -- or if Maurice had me there, whether we would even have survived, you know?</span> <span id="s1077">It just -- just helped each other.</span> <span id="s1078">A matter of fact, he wasn’t well, I would give him my food, you know, he didn’t [indecipherable] food, and vice versa, you know, so on, it’s -- and we always said, we must survive this, and we will -- we will show them.</span> <span id="s1079">We’ll take revenge on them, what kind of revenge, yeah.</span> <span id="s1080">No, we’ll never go to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: Did you ever talk, beyond that, about your -- about your experiences, or reminisce together, or was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: Wi-with Maurice, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: With Mauri --</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: We did, but not too extensively, but we did talk about different -- about the family, about different -- other different things, yes, over the years.</span> <span id="s1085">We did.</span> <span id="s1086">We were very close.</span> <span id="s1087">Was close to Arthur, too, but different.</span> <span id="s1088">He didn’t go through the war years, h-he was -- he was more of a free person, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: You mentioned the Korean war starting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: 1950, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: Did -- did you -- did -- did -- did you have a -- a strong feeling about th-the Cold War, about politics in the United States at that time, was that something that you took an interest in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: I -- I only was ups -- upset, and I should say, whenever I heard every day, so many Americans were killed, and so many were killed that I was very upset about it.</span> <span id="s1093">But I didn’t think of politics, took me quite awhile.</span> <span id="s1094">And I didn’t understand much about the system.</span> <span id="s1095">I knew it’s a democratic system, but I didn’t understand the standard, to what extent.</span> <span id="s1096">It took me awhile to -- to recognize every -- everything.</span> <span id="s1097">And once I recognize it, I -- of course I read about it, and spoke to people about, you know, different happenings.</span> <span id="s1098">See, you get -- you get enlightened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: Was there anything that you can recall that -- that held a particular interest for you?</span> <span id="s1100">I me -- maybe the Civil Rights movement, or McCarthyism, or anything that you can think of?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: I remember about McCarthyism, yes, that I took an interest, and I’ve -- I’ve felt that it is a -- I don’t know whether it’s the right expression, demagogue, you know?</span> <span id="s1102">He also accused people of being Communists without having any knowledge, or enough to prove th-that they’re actually Communists.</span> <span id="s1103">He -- he was a -- I think he was a disgrace to the ga -- to -- to the United States, and yeah, I -- I still feel that, if I think about it, h-he wa -- he was doing more harm than ever did good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: When were your -- when was your first child born?</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: My first child was born in ’53.</span> <span id="s1106">His name is Andrew, and he’s an attorney, but he works wi-with me in real estate development.</span> <span id="s1107">We had another son, James.</span> <span id="s1108">Unfortunately, he -- he -- he drowned.</span> <span id="s1109">He went on a vacation -- not actually on vacation, he went to fee -- Eleanor -- Eleanor, my wife, Eleanor has a sister in Phoenix, and she had -- she has two sons, they were -- and -- and James, and Andrew were very close to their sons, they were a similar age, only a couple years -- the others were a couple of years younger.</span> <span id="s1110">When their son George was accepted at University of Colorado, and Eleanor’s sister called up Jim, he was very -- George was very close to Jim, he said, “You know my -- my husband George,” senior, okay, “would like to take little George,” they call him, “to -- to college, but he has business appointments, and it’s difficult for him to go away.</span> <span id="s1111">But like Jim, let Jim take him, because he likes Jim, so how about Jim?”</span> <span id="s1112">Eleanor was hesitating for awhile.</span> <span id="s1113">She said, “I’ll let you know.”</span> <span id="s1114">She call, ask Jim.</span> <span id="s1115">Jim would love to go.</span> <span id="s1116">And he -- he said when geor -- when they were here -- during Christmas season they were in Palm Beach, and they talked about it, ef -- that he would take him to college.</span> <span id="s1117">So he went.</span> <span id="s1118">One day, Jim called us up on Friday night, to tell us that -- when he’s coming back from Colorado, which plane on -- on Sunday, because he had to start school, you know?</span> <span id="s1119">He went to University of Pennsylvania War-Warton school.</span> <span id="s1120">He was a year ahead in school, you know, very bright.</span> <span id="s1121">Come [indecipherable] on Saturday, at four -- four o’clock or so, we got a call from Colorado, or from Phoenix.</span> <span id="s1122">From Phoenix, probably, that Jimmy drowned.</span> <span id="s1123">What happened is, Jim took George to college, to the university.</span> <span id="s1124">Then th-they rented bicycles, and they drove to a waterway nearby, a few miles away.</span> <span id="s1125">The waterway had coves for swimmers, and the buoys, you know, that separate the waterway from the coves were not -- weren’t there, because there was a storm a coup -- few days before.</span> <span id="s1126">So a boat -- while Jimmy went swimming laps around the cove, a boat came in.</span> <span id="s1127">There were -- there were other kids swimming, a little further, he may have been 20 yards, 10 yards, I don’t know, away from, cause you know, he was an a -- he was on the swimming team, as a matter of fact, at the University of Pennsylvania, so -- boat came in, he saw the boat coming in, he took a dive.</span> <span id="s1128">When he heard the boat passed, he came up, so that he didn’t realize that the skier -- the skier was a woman, she hit him in the head, and he -- he drowned.</span> <span id="s1129">They thought he took another dive.</span> <span id="s1130">And the boat never stopped.</span> <span id="s1131">And he drowned.</span> <span id="s1132">And you asked -- we had depositions, we asked the husband and wife.</span> <span id="s1133">First of all, on that waterway, they had to sign a statement that they can be only in the waterway, they cannot go into the coves.</span> <span id="s1134">He violated that.</span> <span id="s1135">Then, we were in a conference room, I would say less wide than this room, about a little longer, but narrower.</span> <span id="s1136">We’re sitting at a conference table, and there was a -- a pic -- a painting on the wall.</span> <span id="s1137">So my attorney asked her, because she was wearing thick glasses, “Can you tell me what you see in this picture?”</span> <span id="s1138">She said no.</span> <span id="s1139">“Okay, are these reading glasses?”</span> <span id="s1140">She said, “No, these for distance, and sum -- I can’t read with them, they’re mostly for distance.”</span> <span id="s1141">“You cannot identify the picture?”</span> <span id="s1142">“No.”</span> <span id="s1143">“Did you wear these glasses while you were skiing, while you on the skis?”</span> <span id="s1144">She says no.</span> <span id="s1145">“Why didn’t you wear the glasses?”</span> <span id="s1146">“I would lose them, they would fall off.”</span> <span id="s1147">She thought it was a dog swimming.</span> <span id="s1148">She killed him, actually, you know.</span> <span id="s1149">And that’s the story about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q: Was sh -- was she prosecuted in any way, or did you press charges?</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: We press char -- we spent a fortune in legal fee, couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1154">They wouldn -- didn’t want to make a criminal case out of it, because they have too many cases for killing people.</span> <span id="s1155">Colorado’s a funny state.</span> <span id="s1156">You know the maximum you get for killing a young person is only 10,000 dollars.</span> <span id="s1157">We spent maybe 60,000 dollars in legal fees.</span> <span id="s1158">[indecipherable] come there many times, and always they couldn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s1159">We even had witnesses, you know, that -- we hired a detective to figure out -- our lawyers hired one to -- the whole report, but didn’t -- it was nothing.</span> <span id="s1160">They say it was not intended -- the -- the intention was not to kill, but whatever.</span> <span id="s1161">We couldn’t -- we couldn’t get -- there was no cooperation by -- even by the court.</span> <span id="s1162">The ti -- it’s an accident, they say.</span> <span id="s1163">And the kids -- his cousin was standing in -- looking at where Jimmy was swimming, and so on, but he didn’t realize it, he’s not going to come back.</span> <span id="s1164">And the boats left, couldn’t -- you know, it took several days to find him, we had to hire -- we had -- it’s very deep water there.</span> <span id="s1165">We -- we had to rent a -- from California, the s -- a special -- what do you call it?</span> <span id="s1166">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: Special boat of some sort, a net --</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: Un-under the water, yeah, the boat, the -- pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: -- net -- net -- with a net, or with a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: No, it’s -- no, no, it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: Oh, a submarine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: It’s a little -- small submarine, to find him.</span> <span id="s1173">Took three days.</span> <span id="s1174">And that’s something we can never, never talk to Eleanor about it, or the people ask how many children, and she breaks down at times.</span> <span id="s1175">[indecipherable] Yeah, doesn’t want to -- she doesn’t want to say we have three, not four, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: Yeah, he s -- was such a wonderful, bright guy, sweet and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: How old was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: 20.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1181">I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1183">Strong.</span> <span id="s1184">He was one of the best, one the best swimmers at the university.</span> <span id="s1185">Even in -- even in high school, he loved swimming.</span> <span id="s1186">Good athlete.</span> <span id="s1187">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: And your other children?</span> <span id="s1189">You -- you mentioned --</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: They’re wonderful, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: -- you mentioned Andrew, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: And Lauren is -- works -- she was married for a short time, she’s divorced.</span> <span id="s1193">She works in my office as an executive.</span> <span id="s1194">And then I have Carol, and she is married.</span> <span id="s1195">She’s the youngest, and sh-sh-she has three children, two boys and one girl, they just were visiting us here during school vacation.</span> <span id="s1196">They just left this past Sunday, yeah.</span> <span id="s1197">They have a boy of 12, and a boy of 10, and a little girl of five.</span> <span id="s1198">All lovely, beautiful children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: When did you move to -- I’m forgetting the name of the town in New York where you lived?</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: We lived in Forest Hills.</span> <span id="s1201">No --</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: You lived at first in Forest Hills, when you first moved to New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: When I -- when I moved -- yeah, I lived in Brooklyn with --</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: Brooklyn?</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: -- my brother, yes.</span> <span id="s1206">I shared a room with one of my nephews for a few months.</span> <span id="s1207">They did want me -- I wanted to go to a hotel, but they felt it’d be lonesome, so on, so I stay there.</span> <span id="s1208">But then I moved to a hotel, Saint George Hotel, in Brooklyn, was an old hotel.</span> <span id="s1209">And subsequently, we moved to s -- we built a plant on Staten Island, so I moved to Staten Island, rented an apartment there.</span> <span id="s1210">And then we got married, we moved to Forest Hills.</span> <span id="s1211">And we lived in Forest Hills for about five years.</span> <span id="s1212">We got married in ’52, and then ’57 we moved to Great Neck, we bought a house.</span> <span id="s1213">And we still -- we don’t have the house any more, we sold it in ’79, so about 21 years ago, yeah.</span> <span id="s1214">But we have an apartment in Great Neck, yeah, and an apartment here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: I -- you ma -- I don’t think you mentioned on tape, but something that I was interested in -- in hearing you talk a little bit more about, you said when you first moved to Palm Springs, that there were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: Palm Beach, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: Palm Beach, I’m sorry -- that -- that -- that there was a lot of anti-Semitism here --</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: -- and that it’s changed.</span> <span id="s1220">Would you say something about that?</span> <span id="s1221">How you noticed it in the beginning, and how it’s changed?</span> <span id="s1222">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: Because we were told then that the Breaker’s Hotel, 30 years ago, na -- maybe 25 years ago, actually did not permit Jews, you know?</span> <span id="s1224">Some people say about 30 this -- but I remember 25 years ago, that was the case.</span> <span id="s1225">I know even a person who wanted to check in with his wife, they said no you -- you can’t.</span> <span id="s1226">Also, the people in -- if you went to stores, and so on, you look like you are -- you don’t belong here.</span> <span id="s1227">They gave that feeling.</span> <span id="s1228">They were not friendly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q: You personally had that feeling when you went to stores sometimes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: I didn’t have it as much, but people talked about it.</span> <span id="s1231">Maybe I’m more tolerant than others, you know?</span> <span id="s1232">And you just sense it.</span> <span id="s1233">You know, wherever you went, it was -- they didn’t treat you politely.</span> <span id="s1234">It was an -- little edge, you know?</span> <span id="s1235">They didn’t want Jewish people to come to Palm Beach.</span> <span id="s1236">Obviously it used to be, very -- almost no Jews.</span> <span id="s1237">But as the Jewish people came more and more s-successful, and so they -- they used to go to M-Miami, and the sometime Miami too busy, they came here.</span> <span id="s1238">And now they say many of the Gentiles moving out.</span> <span id="s1239">They go more north, you know.</span> <span id="s1240">Some of them, yeah.</span> <span id="s1241">They don’t -- that’s the story.</span> <span id="s1242">But we never were insulted by anybody, any -- but they were cold to us, you know?</span> <span id="s1243">I didn’t feel any particular pressure, but some people did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: And how -- how did that change?</span> <span id="s1245">What -- what made that change?</span> <span id="s1246">Can you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: I think we became very active in the hospitals, two hos -- Saint Mary was the Christian hospital, and Good Samaritan was more like a private estate operated -- Jewish people, I would say, made major contributions to the hospitals.</span> <span id="s1248">And eventually the two hospital merge.</span> <span id="s1249">Many Jewish doctors came from -- from New York, or wherever.</span> <span id="s1250">Chicago, and so on.</span> <span id="s1251">And Christians.</span> <span id="s1252">The hospitals became much more staffed better.</span> <span id="s1253">They bought equipment, you know.</span> <span id="s1254">Here, you need a major operation, you couldn’t -- you had to go to Miami or New York, or wherever else.</span> <span id="s1255">Now, the hospitals are very well staffed, very good medical research they’re doing, and they are connected with New England Hospital, in Massachusetts someplace, and also Mount Sinai, New York.</span> <span id="s1256">Videotape -- they can videotape operations, and there -- there’s a big, big, big change.</span> <span id="s1257">People, when they took sick, they used to go to their hometown, back to their own doctor.</span> <span id="s1258">Now, they don’t do it.</span> <span id="s1259">Plus, we also helped building the Kravitz Center, which is a -- a place where they -- they have operas, and they have shows, and -- and all that, and I -- I think it was mostly Christian and Jewish, but a big -- I -- I -- I would say at le -- more than half the money came from Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1260">There’s a little more -- more culture.</span> <span id="s1261">I would say they contributed money to the -- to small museums, and s -- and now the Jews, and the Gentiles work together in all these places, so it’s -- it’s a very good relation.</span> <span id="s1262">Once a year they have a ball for the -- for the hospital, you know?</span> <span id="s1263">You have -- we have many fine Christians, and fine Jewish people meet, and also the Kravitz Center, they meet, have special gala nights, you know?</span> <span id="s1264">So at least once, or more than once a year, different artists come from all over -- from all over the -- the country, and -- and Europe.</span> <span id="s1265">The Moscow orchestra recently, and the -- some French theater -- what do they call, I forget -- artist performing, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: You -- you mentioned -- oops, I’m going to flip the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: You mentioned Eleanor’s involvement with the -- what was the name of the organ --</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: [indecipherable] Christian and Jews.</span> <span id="s1270">She was the -- the first person, with a few other, with some Gentile friends, to start this organization, and sh -- and she was the education chairman.</span> <span id="s1271">She knows a lot about Holocaust, and about general inter-religious, you know, differences.</span> <span id="s1272">And so she’s very, very knowledgeable, and she served for a couple years in the -- they wanted her to stay.</span> <span id="s1273">I discouraged her from staying long, I said, “Give somebody else a chance,” and -- and so on.</span> <span id="s1274">[indecipherable] felt very dominating, you know?</span> <span id="s1275">So the one attorney took over, [indecipherable] or Brian, what is it?</span> <span id="s1276">I can’t remember his name, he’s very good, but he also, after two years, he starts his third one now.</span> <span id="s1277">Christian, lovely -- they all -- tell you a -- I find it may be my -- I -- I hope I’m not wrong, I find the -- the educated people relate more, cause the Jewish educated people, yeah, they have something in -- in common.</span> <span id="s1278">The uneducated are -- are more hateful, for some reason, on Jews, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1279">Ignorance.</span> <span id="s1280">And that probably is everywhere.</span> <span id="s1281">They don’t understand that we -- we are people, we are good and bad in every religion, every race, I find they have good and bad people.</span> <span id="s1282">People who contribute to society, and people who don’t.</span> <span id="s1283">People who try to make it a wor -- a better world, and people who don’t care, or obstruct.</span> <span id="s1284">But that’s society, that’s -- who knows how many years this will take, how many generations, you know, for this to improve and vanish?</span> <span id="s1285">We all want a better -- better -- better world for our children, grandchildren, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: Yo-You mentioned in your videotape, you -- you told of two dreams that you had during the -- during the war.</span> <span id="s1287">One during the war, and one after the war --</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: -- which were very important in some way, and I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: I was wondering if you have any -- if you feel -- do you have a strong -- do you believe in -- in intuition versus rationality, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: I -- I tell you, I don’t -- I don’t know whether I believe in intuitions or not, but I ha -- I really don’t know, but I know that was a dream.</span> <span id="s1293">It was not just imaginary, it was 100 percent dream, that I was -- I -- if your may -- shall I repeat the story, or you know the story?</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">Q: You can if you want to, but we do have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: I will brief -- I’ll make it brief.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: In my dream was a l-lady who was a neighbor of ours.</span> <span id="s1298">She was childless, and she, when I was young, as a child, maybe even when I was seven, six, seven, she always liked to play with me, and see what I’ve done in school, you know, she wa -- she was like my second mother.</span> <span id="s1299">She was -- she just li -- we were next door neighbors.</span> <span id="s1300">I woke -- and she [indecipherable] she called me Nockmush.</span> <span id="s1301">My name was Nochman, my Hebrew name, and she called me Nockmush, you know?</span> <span id="s1302">“Nockmush, Nockmush, don’t go there.</span> <span id="s1303">Don’t go.</span> <span id="s1304">Listen to me, don’t go,” she told me.</span> <span id="s1305">“Don’t go to meet these people.”</span> <span id="s1306">She told me several times.</span> <span id="s1307">I woke up.</span> <span id="s1308">I was suppo-posed to meet these two individuals.</span> <span id="s1309">I was -- I was -- I don’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s1310">I said, “I’m not going.”</span> <span id="s1311">I didn’t go, and these two guys, one was Christian, one was Jewish, they -- they had all people getting out of -- from Poland, young people, military age.</span> <span id="s1312">They -- they must have bribed some Italian who were in charge of -- they went by -- in Kraków they used to stop, for some reason or another.</span> <span id="s1313">So what they would do, they would get uniforms, and bandaged up, let’s say like -- a guy like me, they put [indecipherable] bandaged up, and make believe you can’t talk.</span> <span id="s1314">They put you on the train, you know?</span> <span id="s1315">Take drove you up there, put you on the train, and you can’t [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1316">That’s what I -- my parents and my brother felt, let somebody at least get out, so they -- maybe you’ll be able to get in touch with Arthur in the United States, and so on.</span> <span id="s1317">Something -- do something.</span> <span id="s1318">But I didn’t go.</span> <span id="s1319">So, now I lived in Italy, and after I was there maybe a year, I had a very strong desire to go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s1320">And -- and my brother Maurice, too.</span> <span id="s1321">He di -- I was hesitating a little bit, for one reason, but he definitely wanted to go.</span> <span id="s1322">I wanted -- what we wanted to do is, we wanted to -- we -- we marked up where they shot my father, and they -- they left him there, and then we buried him.</span> <span id="s1323">We -- we measured how f -- how many feet from that tree to this tree, to this location, that location.</span> <span id="s1324">And there were two other men [indecipherable] put them in that burial place, not just -- so my father came to me, he said, “Don’t come.</span> <span id="s1325">I -- we were all burned, you won’t find any -- you won’t find any ashes even.”</span> <span id="s1326">All burned.</span> <span id="s1327">What they did, they excavated men from wher-wherever they were buried, and they put them in fa -- put them in one group, and burned them.</span> <span id="s1328">So I don’t want -- the other reason I didn’t want to go, right after the war, I le -- I learned in Munich, if you go back to Poland, they draft you -- if you -- in the 20’s, you know, from 19 to 28, or to 30, I don’t remember exactly.</span> <span id="s1329">They draft you in the Russian army, they put you.</span> <span id="s1330">So I was that time 22 years old, so I didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s1331">That’s one of the reasons why I never went back to Poland.</span> <span id="s1332">I don’t want to go in the ar -- in the Russian army after all this.</span> <span id="s1333">And my brother felt -- he’s nine years older, he -- he -- him they don’t want to draft.</span> <span id="s1334">He looked a little frail, too, that time.</span> <span id="s1335">He -- they probably wouldn’t ha -- but I -- I -- I felt pretty -- for all that I -- pretty healthy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: Did you ever have any other dreams in your life that were important to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A: No.</span> <span id="s1338">These two [indecipherable] these are the only two.</span> <span id="s1339">I believe there is something to do it.</span> <span id="s1340">I have other dreams, similar, not -- not as strong.</span> <span id="s1341">I -- because I don’t even remember.</span> <span id="s1342">I know I had certain dreams, but I don’t remember them.</span> <span id="s1343">My sisters came to me [indecipherable] like -- like not -- I would see my mother or my father in my sleep, just like it was, you know, 50 years ago.</span> <span id="s1344">But they don’t usually talk to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Q: They just appear?</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1347">But this, actually were words.</span> <span id="s1348">I -- I’m convinced something must be superhuman, to -- to -- to have -- to witness that, to experience that.</span> <span id="s1349">But it happened.</span> <span id="s1350">Maybe somebody’s watching over me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: Why don’t you tell again, how -- you said it in the videotape, but it might be more complete if you said how you found out about what had actually happened to your father’s body.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: It came in my dream.</span> <span id="s1353">He came and told me that they burned all of me, and the two others.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q: But didn’t you have a brother-in-law who -- who had told you that -- cause he -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: Oh, that’s right.</span> <span id="s1356">When my brother-in-law came to Italy then, subsequently, I ask him, did you -- because he returned to Poland, and he was not of military age.</span> <span id="s1357">And he stayed in Poland for maybe a year, or less.</span> <span id="s1358">At least six months to a year.</span> <span id="s1359">And I -- we ask him, did you go to -- because he was with us in that brush factory, you know, the -- and he saw when they took my brother out and two of his, you know, friends.</span> <span id="s1360">Whoever buried him, he was part of it.</span> <span id="s1361">Did he ever go back to Plaszów to see about our father, you know?</span> <span id="s1362">He said, “Yes, I went several times.</span> <span id="s1363">I found out they ex -- they excavated everybody, and they burned them.”</span> <span id="s1364">The whole -- they -- when they liquidated Plaszów, before the Russian came, there were couple hundred people to clean up.</span> <span id="s1365">Course, what they did there, I -- I think they -- they killed tens of thousand of people there, from med -- I -- I would say mostly Gentile.</span> <span id="s1366">They brought in from outside the camp.</span> <span id="s1367">I don’t know for what charges, whether -- they mostly young people.</span> <span id="s1368">They were -- they brought them on open trucks, because they -- they brought it up to a hill there.</span> <span id="s1369">And what -- what they did is they beat them, and they had to undress, and they were all -- they -- during the day, they -- every -- they were excavating trenches, you know?</span> <span id="s1370">Maybe a hundred people excavating the -- prepare for loads, and then they buried them, covered them up.</span> <span id="s1371">So that wa -- they excavated the -- again, and burned them, you know?</span> <span id="s1372">That’s what I was told by my brother-in-law, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: How did your -- how did Maurice respond when you had that dream?</span> <span id="s1374">Did he -- did he take it at -- at -- did he believe that it was true, or how --</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">A: He believed it was true.</span> <span id="s1376">Because the fact is, that two people were killed.</span> <span id="s1377">He said, “You -- you -- you were told, you were gi -- were given a warning by -- how to explain that?”</span> <span id="s1378">Believe in -- believe in God, or -- or -- or some superpower?</span> <span id="s1379">I -- We don’t know.</span> <span id="s1380">If -- if you’re religious, it’s a message from God, if it’s -- or, they can explain it many other way.</span> <span id="s1381">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1382">I would say if -- after the war, I did not believe in God.</span> <span id="s1383">It took me a number of years, and I do believe in God.</span> <span id="s1384">But can I prove things?</span> <span id="s1385">Of course not.</span> <span id="s1386">Certain things, but it’s -- but you have to accept it.</span> <span id="s1387">Eleanor, not having all this experience, she doesn’t believe much in God.</span> <span id="s1388">She says why -- especially since we lost Jimmy.</span> <span id="s1389">Says why, why, why, was such a wonderful boy.</span> <span id="s1390">We -- we all did things -- right things, and so on.</span> <span id="s1391">And -- and I suffered so much, and [indecipherable] you know?</span> <span id="s1392">So it’s hard to -- I -- I keep telling her I don’t want to hear that, that she shouldn’t discuss it.</span> <span id="s1393">I believe in it.</span> <span id="s1394">Why I believe in it, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1395">Just -- I feel it’s easier maybe on your -- on your mind, and your spirit to believe than not to believe.</span> <span id="s1396">Because otherwise it -- the whole thing is nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: Do you have any interests or hobbies, or pash -- passions, outside of your work things, that you love to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: I love the work that I do.</span> <span id="s1399">I really do.</span> <span id="s1400">I like to build buildings.</span> <span id="s1401">The reason I like it is I see in front of my eyes, take a piece of land that nothing [indecipherable] mud or grass, and -- and you build something that is pretty, that people want, and people are happier, you know?</span> <span id="s1402">Whatever we build, one the biggest pr-pr-prize is revenue.</span> <span id="s1403">I -- only the best that can be done.</span> <span id="s1404">It’s my nature, and I like to play golf, but I not -- only on weekends, I play golf.</span> <span id="s1405">And I swim, walk, you know, when I have time.</span> <span id="s1406">I have a treadmill here.</span> <span id="s1407">I don’t -- I walk more on the treadmill.</span> <span id="s1408">And I am in good shape.</span> <span id="s1409">I got -- except for hearing.</span> <span id="s1410">I’m in such good shape, doctors don’t believe.</span> <span id="s1411">Anyway, I’ve never been to hospital, sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s1413">Wow?</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A: I never had a cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: I don’t get flu’s or colds, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: Great.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: Never.</span> <span id="s1419">I don’t know, maybe the immune system built up there, I don’t know, you know?</span> <span id="s1420">They -- they can’t believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q: That’s good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1423">I don’t tell anybody that.</span> <span id="s1424">Very few people I tell that I’ve never had a cold.</span> <span id="s1425">[indecipherable] this a problem, that -- this problem, that problem, I said no.</span> <span id="s1426">I used to have b-big problem with my hands, I couldn’t, I’d say, I could never hold even a cup of coffee or tea, had to hold with both hands.</span> <span id="s1427">But I was talking to my fingers not to bother me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: And they listened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: I really said, “Give me a break, don’t bother me.”</span> <span id="s1430">I used to soak in hot water, in the morning, and at night, you know, that what I -- and massage it, all this.</span> <span id="s1431">And it -- over the years
