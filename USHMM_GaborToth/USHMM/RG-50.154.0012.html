your family background, where you were born and how many children in your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s3">A: We were five sisters, my mother, father, and my grandmother lived with us, my father’s mother.</span> <span id="s4">On June 1944 we were put in a Ghetto for about a month… whatever we had, the little things we were able to take but not really everything just our belongings more or less.</span> <span id="s5">We stayed there for about a month and then they took us to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Q: Where was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s7">A: Rumania.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Q: How many sisters and brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A: Well I had four sisters and me.</span> <span id="s10">Five.</span> <span id="s11">We were five sisters.</span> <span id="s12">And I was born in Rumania.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: How many Jewish people were there in the town that you lived in?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: Well, it was a fairly nice sized population.</span> <span id="s15">I don’t really know how many.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Was it a hundred families?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: No, no, no more, probably about 25,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: How old were you at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: I was close to sixteen, I wasn’t exactly sixteen – fifteen and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: And they took your whole family?</span> <span id="s21">Your mother?</span> <span id="s22">Your sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Yes, my sisters, my mother, my father, my grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: What were the economic conditions at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: Well, the city itself wasn’t a poor little city but we were comfortable, not rich people.</span> <span id="s26">My father taught Hebrew and Jewish education and that is how he made his living.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Were there any experiences of Anti-Semitism before that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: Oh yes, I remember times when they like closed up the water and we only could take water, drinking water, from the water well.</span> <span id="s29">And my father wore a beard, because we were kind of religious, and a couple of kids, they were like teenagers, and they attacked him when he went to bring water, attacked him and he was beaten from the kids because they knew he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s30">And that much I remember.</span> <span id="s31">I don’t remember too much, because you know we were still young kids, my oldest sister was twenty-one.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: How about in school, for yourself?</span> <span id="s33">Did you have any experiences of anti-Semitism in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Well I went part-time, I went to a Jewish school and a little bit which I don’t, again I don’t really recall myself, but I know that there were anti-Semitics, because of my… you know when you saw Jews with the passes then you just couldn’t go out already in later months… before we went to camp of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: What situation led to their taking you to Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s36">How did that come about?</span> <span id="s37">I mean did they just come into your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: No, as I said before they took us to a ghetto.</span> <span id="s39">All the Jews were put in one part of the city.</span> <span id="s40">All barricaded behind fences and we couldn’t go out.</span> <span id="s41">They let a couple of people from time to time just to go to pick up something to survive.</span> <span id="s42">But you had to wear the Jewish stats and a band with a Jewish star on it so they knew you were Jews.</span> <span id="s43">You know we were like… just certain times, we were able to leave the place, not myself but, an older person they let out from time to time.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: How long were you in this Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: We were there for about a month, three weeks or a month, something like this.</span> <span id="s46">And after they just said that we had to leave and they put us in cattle cars and that’s how they took us to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: How far was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Well, we were traveling a couple of days.</span> <span id="s49">Exactly how long, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Did you have any idea where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: No, I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: They just said, “Let’s go”.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Yes, they just took us and they not say anything.</span> <span id="s54">My parents maybe knew, I can’t say I knew, because I did not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: And then you got to the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: And when we went to Auschwitz and when we got there, and the cattle car stopped.</span> <span id="s57">So the first thing they did, they took the men separate.</span> <span id="s58">My father was the only man in our family and we never saw him after that anymore.</span> <span id="s59">He just left us and we just don’t know what ever happened to him.</span> <span id="s60">And then they started to select us.</span> <span id="s61">My older sister was put to the right and two other sisters went to the right and then they selected my mother and my younger sister to the left.</span> <span id="s62">Anyway, somehow I remained to the last.</span> <span id="s63">And when they put my mother and my younger sister - and of course was my grandmother, she was also with us too, she was also selected to the left and I wanted to go with my mother.</span> <span id="s64">And our (officer), who selected us, was Mengele which I’m sure people heard plenty about him.</span> <span id="s65">He spoke Hungarian.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Yea, Mengele.</span> <span id="s67">So I told him I want to go with my mother, but I did not know what that meant left of right, I just know I wanted to go with my mother.</span> <span id="s68">Especially in Europe the kids when you’re fifteen and a half, you still want to stay with your mother.</span> <span id="s69">And then they say, you can not go to the left.</span> <span id="s70">So they almost attacked me with heavy machine guns, they were holding at me and says you can not go there, and you got to go to the right.</span> <span id="s71">And I just didn’t even realize that my sisters were there already, I just did not care.</span> <span id="s72">So I had no choice, I had to go to the right and that was why I survived which we had no idea about that.</span> <span id="s73">And then of course they took us in like they said we were going to take a shower or they were going to give you clothes and they do whatever, but then they cut our hair down all completely bald.</span> <span id="s74">I did not recognize my own sister and she was standing next to me and I had no idea who she was because it came as a surprise to us that they crop us completely bald.</span> <span id="s75">And we had to throw down all our clothes or whatever we had.</span> <span id="s76">They gave you their own clothes which were striped uniforms, little striped uniforms.</span> <span id="s77">And that’s what we had.</span> <span id="s78">Then they took us, how far exactly to the camp, I do not even know, but they put us in bunk beds, for awhile we had beds.</span> <span id="s79">We were like five people in one bunk.</span> <span id="s80">And me and my four sisters actually, we were still alive.</span> <span id="s81">But already… No, how should I word this…I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">(Break)</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Okay, you were saying you were with four sisters… How did they treat you?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: So they gave us very little food, we had like a loaf of bread which I don’t know how we just ate a loaf of bread for five people, so we got like four pieces of that one loaf.</span> <span id="s85">And one of my sisters got very sick, we don’t know what happened to her, she just had a high fever, and there was a lady surgeon said she was a doctor, said “if you got her some sugar, I’m going to try to saver your sister.”</span> <span id="s86">So there was no way we could get sugar so next to our lager, they called it lager, was a family lager, said maybe over there they’d have little kids who might get sugar.</span> <span id="s87">So we were able to talk through a fence.</span> <span id="s88">And one woman said, bring me your bread, I’ll give you sugar.</span> <span id="s89">So, but there was no way that you could really legally through there, because there was a gate and they had the SS standing in the middle of the gate.</span> <span id="s90">But some people already dug holes under the fence to go through the other camp.</span> <span id="s91">And I was like the skinniest and somehow the youngest and I don’t know, I guess the bravest whatever you call it.</span> <span id="s92">So my sister says maybe you can go through that hole, try to get – her name was Enid – the sugar.</span> <span id="s93">But I just didn’t get the sugar.</span> <span id="s94">So eventually I had to come back through the hole.</span> <span id="s95">So I came back through the hole and they saw me.</span> <span id="s96">The SS caught me coming back, so they kept waving, come over here.</span> <span id="s97">I made believe I didn’t hear.</span> <span id="s98">So they kept saying again, come here.</span> <span id="s99">So I had no choice, I had to go.</span> <span id="s100">So I go to them and he says what did you do on the other side.</span> <span id="s101">And I said to him I wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s102">So he says, but I saw you, you were there.</span> <span id="s103">So he says, “You know I could shoot you now.”</span> <span id="s104">They always were ready with the guns there.</span> <span id="s105">And so I said, “What can I do?”</span> <span id="s106">I kept saying I wasn’t there so he gave me a slap so that my teeth was… were in my mouth and I came back to my sisters.</span> <span id="s107">They saw my face was all swollen up and no sugar.</span> <span id="s108">And they asked what happened and I didn’t want to tell them so I said, “Nothing, nothing, nothing, but I just couldn’t get the sugar.”</span> <span id="s109">So finally, they saw that my face was swollen so my oldest sister said that something must have happened to you so I told her what happened.</span> <span id="s110">But I survived it you know, what can you say.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: How long were you in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: We were there about eight months, or something like this.</span> <span id="s113">And then from Auschwitz we had to walk about ten days to… We went to Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: They didn’t tell us why.</span> <span id="s115">They just said one day you got to go and you have to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: By this time, how many…So were you still together?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: We were still the four sisters.</span> <span id="s118">One of my sisters, whom we lost, she had a little heart problem already (at) home and every time we had to walk, so she just did not want to go, she wanted to give up.</span> <span id="s119">So we tried to drag her because they would see her… that she was limping.</span> <span id="s120">Anything like this forget it, they shoot you down right there.</span> <span id="s121">You can not move anymore.</span> <span id="s122">So we convince her finally and we got to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s123">But she was sick, over there too.</span> <span id="s124">And they said even if she would have remained alive, she wouldn’t be okay.</span> <span id="s125">But we don’t really know what happened to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: That’s the sister that died at Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: She had…she was also like two years older than I.</span> <span id="s128">She was seventeen actually, seventeen and a half.</span> <span id="s129">We had no means to help her.</span> <span id="s130">And I always think, and my older sisters that, I think, they took her out alive, and she was still alive.</span> <span id="s131">They took her out and just piled up the people they called the muselmanns.</span> <span id="s132">They did not care if she was sick or not.</span> <span id="s133">They said that she was dead and we never saw her anymore.</span> <span id="s134">And we don’t know exactly what happened to her… 100 percent.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: What would be interesting to know is, how did you occupy your time whilst you were in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Well they took us out to work… so we also had the apell… they woke you up like 5 o’clock in the morning, they put on the lights.</span> <span id="s137">In the morning you had to go outside and stay in line.</span> <span id="s138">I don’t know how you would call that…like in the army…</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Drill?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Yes, like every morning, you had to stand, they call it apell…command…and even in there the sister, which one is still alive, thank God, she’s in Israel, so she had…she wasn’t really sick, but she looked sickly, very skinny and pale.</span> <span id="s141">And every time they saw somebody like this they were selecting, every morning they were selecting.</span> <span id="s142">If they saw somebody they didn’t like, they pulled them out of the lines and my sister was pulled out two times from the lines because they said she was sick, and we were like panicky.</span> <span id="s143">Cause we didn’t want to loose her.</span> <span id="s144">We knew already, by that time you know already, once they pull you out, you don’t come back anymore.</span> <span id="s145">You go to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s146">They we know already.</span> <span id="s147">So we tried to snitch her back.</span> <span id="s148">Then they noticed that she came back and they selected her out again.</span> <span id="s149">So, second time they was the kapos, they call themselves kapos, the people they were under the SS, second-hand to the SS.</span> <span id="s150">So she came with them, with one of those rubber…and what do you call those things policemen use…?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Clubs?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Yeah, rubber clubs and smacked her across her hand.</span> <span id="s153">So her little finger was raw meat.</span> <span id="s154">So then we know already that we’re going to have a harder time to sneak her back again.</span> <span id="s155">So we begged some people who were alone, because we were four sisters, so we begged them, said please go in that line and let my sister come back for us.</span> <span id="s156">But nobody wanted to change because already, more or less, people knew what the other lines are.</span> <span id="s157">So…we’re still lucky we got her back again.</span> <span id="s158">She was suffering with her finger because they like clipped her finger off.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: What kind of work did you do in the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Pretty much what they made to do…carry bricks… for buildings and what they were doing, like roads, and all kinds of… That was really our job, the people in my time, who came to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s161">That’s what they did.</span> <span id="s162">Carried bricks.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: To build?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Building something, you don’t know really what.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Roads or houses or…I don’t know…</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Did you work almost all day?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Yeah, they kept us there to about four in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s169">And that’s the time when they gave us a little soup and a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s170">And that’s what we go on living on, every single day.</span> <span id="s171">We had the same thing – soup and a piece of bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: What happened in Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Well in Bergen-Belsen, we didn’t really work too much anymore because almost everybody got sick over there.</span> <span id="s174">Most of the people they had typhus and they just took us to drills everyday still, and we just came back to the barracks and, you were just hanging around doing nothing for awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: How long do you think you were in that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: We were there three months.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: What happened at the end of the three months?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: After three months, we got liberated…We heard rumors that we’re going to be liberated, and of course we were just thrilled and we were hoping that we were going to find our parents – which was a very slim chance really to have, but we thought maybe…maybe.</span> <span id="s179">More or less we know that we don’t have them, but you don’t give up hope…My two older sisters after liberation they went back to Rumania, and I met my husband already, so I stayed in Germany.</span> <span id="s180">They both went back home, for hopes they going to find somebody from the family, my father’s family, or my mother’s family… but they really didn’t find anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Who were the liberators?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: England.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: What happened when they came into the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Well they just came in and they said you are liberated and brought trucks.</span> <span id="s185">And you saw the English soldiers…it was so unbelievable, we just didn’t want to believe it…that it’s true.</span> <span id="s186">And they said that you are liberated and don’t worry, everything (is) going to be okay now.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: And what happened to the Germans at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Well, they disappeared actually, before we even realized it.</span> <span id="s189">But the English, they took care of them, they pulled them, they destroyed some of them…oh yeah.</span> <span id="s190">They got what… They will never get what…</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Did they put them in camps too?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Some of them, and they had to drag the dead people because we had plenty of people sick during liberation…typhus.</span> <span id="s193">Lots of people.</span> <span id="s194">We lost lots of people already, even after the liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: You mentioned you met your husband in the camp.</span> <span id="s196">And when you were liberated, what did you do then?</span> <span id="s197">How did you get to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Well I had family from my father’s side.</span> <span id="s199">My father had three brothers and a sister so they send us…send me my sister’s papers.</span> <span id="s200">We were happy that we are going to go to America.</span> <span id="s201">We had heard so much about America as young little kids.</span> <span id="s202">And we were very happy to be here and still are.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">(Break) …1949 – and we got married the same year 1949, a month later or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: You never found out what happened to your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: I just know they separated us and we never saw them anymore.</span> <span id="s206">Rumors were going around, they said that they were here… there…but nothing…nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: When you came to this country, did you meet with any other friends or family when you came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: You mean my family from before the war?</span> <span id="s209">No.</span> <span id="s210">We literally did not have really any relatives after the war…most all perished.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Who helped you when you got here?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: In America?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Yes, I presume you didn’t have any belongings or anything.</span> <span id="s214">Did you have anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: The Jewish Federation helped us… they gave us clothes.</span> <span id="s216">Yes, we got clothes from them…we got jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: They helped you get adjusted?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Once you came here, you were able to start a new life?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Yes, we did.</span> <span id="s221">We both went to work right away… Because we didn’t want to stay on the (Jewish Federation’s) neck.</span> <span id="s222">So when ever they gave us jobs, we went.</span> <span id="s223">We got paid very little, but we were happy, it was ours.</span> <span id="s224">We got married, took a furnished room, and lived with a family for about a year or so and then we got our own place.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Wrap-up: I appreciate your taking the time to go back and giving us the story because we’re hoping that people who hear about these things will understand better what happened and work toward achieving peace and something like this will never happen again.</span></p></body></html>
