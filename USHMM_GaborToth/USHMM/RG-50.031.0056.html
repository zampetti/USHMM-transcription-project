antisemitism [during school years] ?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Ilsa: Yes, but I would say prior to 1933 it was not prevalent.</span> <span id="s14">Although we at home used to listen secretly (because officially it was not allowed) to the radio and we kind of heard what was going on with persecution, and uh how should I say, non-friendly gestures towards Jewish people at the time of the Kristallnacht...</span></p> <p><span id="s15">01:3:54 Interviewer: What was the relationship like between you and the other students?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Ilsa: Well, up until the time Hitler came to power we had a good relationship.</span> <span id="s17">Of course it goes without saying that we the Jewish people were in the minority.</span> <span id="s18">I went to an all girls school.</span> <span id="s19">It was a private school ....</span></p> <p><span id="s20">01:4:29 Interviewer: And so you were ten years old when Hitler came to power... do you recall any of the anti-Jewish boycotts?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Ilsa: Yes there was always a fear.</span> <span id="s22">Of course it was very much hidden by my parents who didn't want to worry us children.</span> <span id="s23">I had a younger brother--five years younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">01:05:05 Interviewer: And so they tried to keep on life in a normal way?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Ilsa: My father used to go down every morning...there was [sic] antisemitic signs nailed to the building and they used to say "Jews lived here, let's get rid of them" and every morning at 4 am - it was like a ritual with him, he used to go down and tear the signs off and so most of us, specially us children did not know about it that time...tried to spare us the grief...</span></p> <p><span id="s26">01:05:55 Interviewer: Did your parents every think of leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Ilsa: Yes, we tried.</span> <span id="s28">We tried to get visas to different countries but were denied.</span> <span id="s29">.</span> <span id="s30">this was later in 1938... after Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Interviewer: But prior to Kristallnacht… Ilsa: No before many of us considered ourselves still German unfortunately…of course then came the fear of this neighbor and that neighbor in brown uniforms...radio started to give us the fear.</span> <span id="s32">.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">01:08:40 Interviewer: Did your friendships undergo a change?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Ilsa: Yes, plenty took me aside telling me they were a little afraid--but many stood by me.</span> <span id="s35">My brother was confiscated in Cologne and then put in a camp near Cologne.</span> <span id="s36">He was a personal friend of Adenauer.</span> <span id="s37">He was a friend of the family and he got special privileges.</span> <span id="s38">He got out of the camps earlier then I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">01:16:00 Interviewer: Did you ever see the synagogue in Cologne after Kristallnacht?</span> <span id="s40">What had happened to it?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Ilsa: Yes, well, it was destroyed.</span> <span id="s42">Quite a bit, but frankly we did not go too often because we were too scared then and avoided a lot of those places.</span> <span id="s43">My father was not Jewish therefore he had a few more privileges....</span></p> <p><span id="s44">01:16:58 Interviewer: But your parents did want, after Kristallnacht, they still tried to get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Ilsa: Yes we tried, we had visas, we tried to get visas to the States and we found out that the relatives in the States had to guarantee such a big lump sum that a lot of them were afraid, unfortunately that is how a lot of people perished.</span> <span id="s46">The government wanted such a big guarantee that we would not be a burden to the state, that 's what it amounted to.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">01:18:50 Interviewer: How long did you remain in that office [job after Kristallnacht]?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Ilsa: Well I remained until 1942 when at four in the morning the Gestapo came and picked me up and I was deported to Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">01:19:15 Interviewer: So you remained for quite some time.</span> <span id="s50">Was one of the reasons was that they had classifications and since your father was not Jewish...?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Ilsa: I wasn't going to bring this up...I am by birth full Jewish.</span> <span id="s52">I wasn't going to mention it, see you brought this out -- they found it out by my birth records...and therefore I was the first one to go from my family...every Jewish female was named Sarah and every Jewish male was named Israel and one day the letter came Ilsa Sarah Schmidt that was my birth name--we tried to fight it... they came at four in the morning and picked me up.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">01:20:19 Interviewer: And when you were arrested and picked up what happened to your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Ilsa: My brother was also picked up separately and my parents decided to go separate ways for the sake of hiding, but they were together, this was just easier than two people.</span> <span id="s55">They had different friends and they would meet on the weekends secretly.</span> <span id="s56">It was very difficult because of the rationing cards, you know the friends had a hard time.</span> <span id="s57">And then one day they were both caught and they were put into a locker... and they were able to bribe the policeman and they lived underground during the rest of the war... my brother lived in Cologne.</span> <span id="s58">Because of his connections he was let free but was always in hiding --got rid of their valuables...and thus they survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Interviewer: And your parents lived in Cologne?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Ilsa: No, no, they had to go from place to place...they went to a very dear friend of mine...she helped me escape the night of my confiscation and she helped them...</span></p> <p><span id="s61">01:22:15 Interviewer: But you were deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Ilsa: I was deported.</span> <span id="s63">I went away -- I had help.</span> <span id="s64">We were all put into a private apartment.</span> <span id="s65">A former teacher of mine came to visit me to say goodbye (she somehow was notified).</span> <span id="s66">I am a very impulsive person -- my parents were upstairs in a community room and I said to my mother, "Don't ask any questions just go home with dad" see I've never talked about this before --and people had to show their ID when they came to visit and when this teacher of mine came to visit I told her, "Don't ask no questions open the door."</span> <span id="s67">They were busy looking at her ID and she opened the door and I ran out with her and I went to her house and she said I can't stay here they just looked at my ID - because she was a teacher, that's a governmental job - she says I tell you what, I've got a sister ... I come to the corner of the street - a girlfriend of mine I never knew she was Jewish, and the Gestapo was looking for her and she was smart enough to give another than her home address and she was notified they were looking for her ..."let's go"...ran to the teacher's house ...she gave us her sister's address...my God, I haven't talked about this in so long...there was an air raid on top everything else...it was in October ‘40- and we went to a station of all the buses and trains I don' t recall anymore and she said everybody deserted her...she didn't know she was Jewish...we went to the teacher's sister house and we got there at two in the morning and her husband was a postal employee which was also a governmental job, and she told us not to tell him what happened because he would never allow us to stay there.</span> <span id="s68">So I remained until four in the morning and at that point my father came (there was no more public transportation at this hour) my father came walking, he must have walked eighty miles and he said, "you do whatever you want but they picked up mother and they are beating her something terrible so I said I'm coming back with you because I will survive it but mother won't.</span> <span id="s69">I went back and they beat me all night long on the train.</span> <span id="s70">The Gestapo wanted to know who helped me--they had forgotten and I said nobody I did it on my own and I stood fast so then I was in Theresienstadt for two and half years until liberation in May of '45, the 8th of May.</span> <span id="s71">But I would say the Kristallnacht was the beginning of the end it really escalated from then on.</span> <span id="s72">.</span> <span id="s73">it got worse because it was so publicized and official.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Interviewer: After you were deported your parents went into hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Ilsa: Yes, we had certain rules in the camps.</span> <span id="s76">We were allowed to write, and I told my parents if I wrote in Latin then it's not so bad but I always wrote in Latin in order not to frighten them ... our camp was one of the last liberated; by the Russians.</span> <span id="s77">I saw the death march.</span> <span id="s78">It all came through--our camp was basically a transit camp but - I don't mean this in conceit - because of looks and strength, not necessarily in that order we were picked and that saved our lives - they needed us - I shoveled coal, we unfortunately helped the people in the trains to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">29:23 Interviewer: At any time before the end of the war did you know what Auschwitz meant?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Ilsa: No, no they always had different rules...one day it was all children , another time it was veterans that were injured, selected groups all the time we saw them leave but no we did not know Auschwitz - they were rumors of all kinds but we did not have that much outside information coming in.</span> <span id="s81">We lived in bunk beds I think about a dozen per room we made the best of it - we were always led by an SS man...</span></p> <p><span id="s82">01:32:49 Interviewer: You were never revealed who helped you ?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Ilsa: Eventually they just left me alone...</span></p> <p><span id="s84">01:33:15 Interviewer: After the liberation you came back to the city?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Ilsa: Each city picked up their former citizens - the Jews that cane from x amount of cities there was a huge truck we were in the truck for four days one of my neighbors saw me and she fainted.</span> <span id="s86">They all thought I was dead--took a friend home with me who lost her whole family...</span></p> <p><span id="s87">01:34:13 Interviewer: Where your parents there before you came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Ilsa: Yes they were already back and the city of Cologne had been occupied by the British and the British gave the most beautiful apartments to the Jews from former Nazis - I couldn't find them at first...</span></p> <p><span id="s89">01:35:26 Interviewer: But there was never any thought of staying in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Ilsa: No, we wanted to leave to the upset of my parents I put in my quota to come here unfortunately my father died of starvation shortly after I came home and I brought mother over here...</span></p> <p><span id="s91">01:36:13 Interviewer: But your father died of malnutrition?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Ilsa: Yes.</span> <span id="s93">We were unable to find a casket - we cleaned a used casket with the stipulation that he could keep it.</span> <span id="s94">I went back to Cologne In 1971, My feelings were mixed I went back for business restitution - I was a little homesick - but I got it out of my system - I visited the people that stood by me....</span></p> <p><span id="s95">01:39:17 Interviewer: Once again on Kristallnacht, with all the experiences you have had, many people managed to get out but with your experiences ...?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Ilsa: It was an extremely bad experience and it was the beginning of the end but it didn't compare with the concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">02:00:50 Interviewer: Do you recall any antisemitism as a student?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Ernest: There were some I remember in school...it got worse and worse as it approached the year 1938.</span> <span id="s99">After Hitler came to power ...I lost my job in June 1938... and then I awaited my emigration to the United States but I couldn't get right away I had to go England first.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Interviewer: But before the Nazis took over Austria did you ever think of leaving; did you think of yourself as an Austrian?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Ernest: Yes I never thought of leaving - no until March 1938 when Hitler came to power.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">02:03:00 Interviewer: As far as relations with non-Jews did you have non-Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Ernest: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Interviewer: So, the antisemitism didn't feel that it was such that it would make you want to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Ernest: Not until Hitler came to power...cousin from US sent the papers but there was no quota available I could not go right away so I had to go to England...
