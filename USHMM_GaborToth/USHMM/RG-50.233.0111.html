<html><body><p><span id="s1">Interview with Henry Robertson</span></p> <p><span id="s2">A: My name is Heinz Rosenberg.</span> <span id="s3">I was born September 15, 1921 in Gottingen, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Q: How big is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s5">A: Gottingen was a university city, very famous for the universities, students.</span> <span id="s6">It was a very old city, a very prosperous city and we lived in a beautiful home.</span> <span id="s7">My father had a linen factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Q: A linen factory?</span> <span id="s9">Is that like a textile factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: A textile factory, which was confiscated by the Nazis already in 1933 because Gottingen was one of the high spots of Nazism, like all the universities, Heidelberg, Gottingen, Partabon , all of these cities with big universities became the symbol of Nazism.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: Is this Gottingen, is that in Bavaria?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: No Gottingen is between Hanover and _____ in the middle of Germany.</span> <span id="s13">I can show it to you on the map.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: Can you tell me, you said you had a brother and a sister, so there were three children.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: We were three children at home.</span> <span id="s16">I had a brother who was born 1915 and a sister who was born 1917.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Do you remember their birthdays?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: Yes, my brother was born, I will have to look it up, one second.</span> <span id="s19">My brother was born June 4, 1915 and my sister was born June 16, 1917.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: Did your mother help out with the business also?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: No, no, my mother was strictly a housewife.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Did Gottingen have a very sizeable Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: It was a very lot of Rosenbergs and Grosenbergs intermarriages.</span> <span id="s24">I would think there were about, the city was about 40,000 people when I was a child.</span> <span id="s25">I imagine there were about 2,000 Jewish people there.</span> <span id="s26">All were well off.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Some of the German Jews I talked to said they weren’t very religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: We were not religious at all.</span> <span id="s29">Not religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Were there many religious people?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Yes, there were also.</span> <span id="s32">We had a very beautiful synagogue in Gottingen and my father also went to the High Holy days, but I personally was not and I am still non- religious I must say.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Did you attend private school or public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: No I attended public school and we had to leave.</span> <span id="s35">We were thrown out of Gottingen in 1934.</span> <span id="s36">The factory was confiscated and the owner of the house came with SR men and told my father if you are not out by next week, we throw you in the furnace or out of the window.</span> <span id="s37">Which they actually did to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: This is of your house or of your business?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s40">The business was confiscated in 1933 by the city of Gottingen.</span> <span id="s41">This was the house we lived in.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: When they confiscated the business, was there a reason given?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: The reason was given that in 1928 and ’29, there was a world depression and like many businesses the business went bad and so the city of Gottingen said we need the business and the Jews cannot do it anymore so we just take it over.</span> <span id="s44">And they renamed it from S &amp; R Rosenberg to Gottingen Linen _____ which means the City of Gottingen Linen Factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: After that your father was no longer involved in the business at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Well my father was permitted, because he always traveled as a salesman to Hamburg and the first three years he could still do a little bit of work, but the companies in Hamburg did not accept a Jewish salesman anymore.</span> <span id="s47">So it died out by itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Can you describe a little bit when they came and made you leave your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: I was too small .</span> <span id="s50">I only know what my father told me that one morning the owner of the house came with three SR men which is like SS people, and put a gun on the table and told him, if you Jew are not out within one week we throw you and the furniture out of the window.</span> <span id="s51">That’s all I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: So a week later they came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: No, no, then my father told them, look it cannot be done in a week, I have to find a new apartment first, but within four weeks we moved to Hamburg because my mother was born in Hamburg and my father who was a very old German couldn’t believe what was happening said this will pass.</span> <span id="s54">And Hamburg was a much better city, it was not such anti-Semitism as it was in Gottingen.</span> <span id="s55">So we bought a beautiful apartment in Hamburg and we moved to Hamburg, and we were hoping, my father was hoping, that this would pass and he would get everything back in Gottingen.</span> <span id="s56">My father was in the First World War like all other.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: He was a veteran?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: My whole family.</span> <span id="s59">Many were killed in the First World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Did he get another job in Hamburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: He couldn’t get a job in Hamburg, but my brother worked and my sister started working and we got some money from a very rich uncle in Hanover.</span> <span id="s62">So we could survive.</span> <span id="s63">I also started working.</span> <span id="s64">I was thrown out of school.</span> <span id="s65">I was an apprentice.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: When were you thrown out of school?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: I was thrown out of school when I was 14 years old in 1935.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: And that was in Hamburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: In Hamburg, yes.</span> <span id="s70">No more Jews could go to German schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Were there private Jewish schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Yes, but we didn’t have the money so that I could go there.</span> <span id="s73">I became an apprentice in a Jewish export and import company.</span> <span id="s74">You couldn’t get a job in a gentile business so you had to be in a Jewish business.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: What did you do there?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Export and import.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Did you do like clerical work?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Clerical work, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q?</span> <span id="s80">Where did your brother and sister work?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: My brother and sister worked at two big Jewish department stores as salespeople.</span> <span id="s82">One was called Gabruder Robeson and Gabruder Heft, but that’s not important, and my brother, by the way, was taken in 1938 from that particular store to the concentration camp of Sachsenhausen in ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Did they both finish school before they took these jobs?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: They were also thrown out of school?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Not thrown out.</span> <span id="s87">We moved from Gottingen and my father had no more money, it’s very simple.</span> <span id="s88">We had to work.</span> <span id="s89">They were older than I was.</span> <span id="s90">My brother, in 1933 was already much older, 18 or something.</span> <span id="s91">He became an apprentice.</span> <span id="s92">In Germany you have to be an apprentice for three years before you can call yourself a full- fledged salesperson.</span> <span id="s93">Here you start without anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about when they came and took your brother away?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: They didn’t come to us, he was working.</span> <span id="s96">That was the Kristallnacht when all the Jewish stores were demolished.</span> <span id="s97">We don’t know how he was taken, we only got a telephone call from somebody who had left in time and told us that all Jewish employees men had been taken to prison.</span> <span id="s98">That’s all we know.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: That’s all they said?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s101">Then we heard from all over the same stories and we didn’t know where he was until one day we got a postcard from him.</span> <span id="s102">They were permitted to write one postcard, that I am well off in Sachsenhausen for a short time.</span> <span id="s103">It wasn’t a short time he was there until February or March 1939.</span> <span id="s104">He was very badly beaten and sick when he came out.</span> <span id="s105">He had something with the leg, I don’t remember what it was, they had beaten his leg.</span> <span id="s106">I don’t remember these things.</span> <span id="s107">He couldn’t work any more and then he went, the British opened the Kitchener camp for young Jews who had to get out.</span> <span id="s108">He got a red stamp on his passport that said if you don’t leave Germany within three months you go back to camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Did he ever describe to you what Sachsenhausen was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Well he told us exactly how it was.</span> <span id="s111">Yes, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: What did he say?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: It was a tremendous camp and the Jews were beaten and mishandled and treated the worst.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Were there other people there besides Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Jews were the minority.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Who else was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Anti-German, anti-Nazi, homosexuals, people who didn’t want to work.</span> <span id="s118">All different types of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Were there Communist people there also?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Plenty of Communists.</span> <span id="s121">But you see, these people who have been there already three or four years and survived, they were already the kapos.</span> <span id="s122">You know what kapos are?</span> <span id="s123">They were the leader.</span> <span id="s124">You see the SS only was the guard, while the prisoners themselves were the people who did all the work inside the camp.</span> <span id="s125">And these few Communists who were there since ’33 and had survived, they were now the _______ commandos and the SS of course did the beating and the killing.</span> <span id="s126">But many of these kapos were more brutal than the SS.</span> <span id="s127">You see the SS used the difference of the nationalities or religions against each other in the prison camps.</span> <span id="s128">You see?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: So basically, the Jews were treated the worst of the people there?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Oh, yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: So political prisoners would be of a higher level.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: If they survived.</span> <span id="s133">Many did not survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Were they taken to work out of this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: At that time there was no work so they had to shovel sand from one mountain and build a new mountain to be busy.</span> <span id="s136">The work was at that time in the concentration camp yes, they made streets inside the camp and they worked from six in the morning until six in the night.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: But they just made them work to keep them busy.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: To exhaust them.</span> <span id="s139">While in other camps like Neuengamme they built tremendous big channels and things like this.</span> <span id="s140">It was a different camp.</span> <span id="s141">But the real work that the prisoners were put to work started after 1939, after the war started.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Did your parents try to get in contact with him after he sent the postcard or tried to go there?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: My father went to the police station in our neighborhood and tried, we tried to send packages we do not know if he got it or not.</span> <span id="s144">I was a small kid and basically couldn’t do anything at all.</span> <span id="s145">We do not know if the packages arrived or not and my mother wrote a letter, after the first postcard, it said Rosenberg, number so and so, and we do not know.</span> <span id="s146">He later told us that he got three letters.</span> <span id="s147">My mother wrote every week.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: But not the packages, you do not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: He got one or two packages for Christmas, or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: What did they tell your father at the police station?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Nothing, we don’t know anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: They didn’t say anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: No, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Can you describe to me Kristallnacht?</span> <span id="s155">Do you remember anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Yes, exactly.</span> <span id="s157">I was already working at that time.</span> <span id="s158">I started working as an apprentice at the export/import company of Artur Cohen in 1936 and this company was taken over after the Kristallnacht by an SS officer.</span> <span id="s159">When Kristallnacht happened, I think there were only Jewish owners there who were taken to prison from their homes, Dr. Cohen and Mr. There were two _________ two assistant Jews, the others were already all gentiles and I was an apprentice and for whatever reason, they were not interested in me.</span> <span id="s160">I didn’t go home, I tried to stay away from home because I heard the rumors and I went home late at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: This was in November?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: November 8, 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: So you stayed late at your office.</span> <span id="s164">And SS officers came to your place of work?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: They came and took away the two assistants.</span> <span id="s166">Dr. Cohen has been taken away already from his home, he was a very famous man because his father was a senator before him.</span> <span id="s167">Both of the brothers were taken.</span> <span id="s168">They moved later on to South Africa.</span> <span id="s169">I still have a letter from them after the separation.</span> <span id="s170">When I came home I heard from my mother that my brother was taken to prison and when my father went to the police, this is an interesting story.</span> <span id="s171">You know, in Germany every year you have different police departments in different parts of the city and when my father came there and he asked by sheer coincidence the officer in charge was a former comrade in arms from World War I, and he said, Fritz Rosenberg, come in here for a minute.</span> <span id="s172">And he told him what are you doing here, are you crazy to come here?</span> <span id="s173">I have orders on my list to bring you in.</span> <span id="s174">But he said look we fought together in World War 1, so I said, look, I tell you what I do, you go out this door and don’t go home before tomorrow morning so if somebody comes there you are not home.</span> <span id="s175">And that’s what my father did.</span> <span id="s176">He went to my aunt who was a lady and there was nobody living there, lived in the neighborhood and he stayed there all night.</span> <span id="s177">You see.</span> <span id="s178">And that German police officer because he was by sheer coincidence a former comrade in arms from World War 1 saved my father from prison.</span> <span id="s179">Most probably he wouldn’t have survived anyhow.</span> <span id="s180">My brother was young, that’s a different story.</span> <span id="s181">But many people didn’t come back from Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s182">They were beaten already when they got into the camp and the German SS would you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Did the police come to your house that evening?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: No, my mother said nobody came.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: So when did you get home?</span> <span id="s186">The next morning?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: I also went home.</span> <span id="s188">At that time we could still go out anytime we want.</span> <span id="s189">I had a girlfriend, a young girlfriend.</span> <span id="s190">I went to her house and I called my parents and I said, look I’m staying with, I forgot her name.</span> <span id="s191">I am sorry to tell you, Eva.</span> <span id="s192">I’m staying with Eva.</span> <span id="s193">She was transported to Riga and murdered there.</span> <span id="s194">Everybody died somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Now, let see, do you remember what damage was done?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: All synagogues, all Jewish business was destroyed, windows broken, stolen merchandise.</span> <span id="s197">It looked like a hurricane.</span> <span id="s198">Many Jewish apartments were destroyed when they came in the SS people or SR people at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Did you go back to work that next day?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: I went back to work the next day, yes.</span> <span id="s201">You see, you have to understand, our German upbringing, even though I am Jewish my basic upbringing, unfortunately you have to go to work.</span> <span id="s202">Everybody looked at me and said, oh it was terrible.</span> <span id="s203">These people in the export company the Germans were not Nazis because they worked with Dr. Cohen.</span> <span id="s204">You see I can’t tell you about later on, but this company was on November 9 was confiscated by the city of Hamburg and an SS officer was put in and took over the company.</span> <span id="s205">I have his name somewhere.</span> <span id="s206">I have to look in my papers, I forgot the name right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: So you lost your job?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: No, he permitted me to finish my apprenticeship which was finished in ’39, April, ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: What did you do after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: After April 1, ’39, I had to report to the unemployment office for Jews, which was a special section and when this SS man who was in charge there saw me, he said I have a very good job for you, he said.</span> <span id="s211">You go to ______ to dig channels for water.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: And this is near Hamburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Well, it’s about by train an hour and a half.</span> <span id="s214">It was swamp.</span> <span id="s215">And it was barracks and there were about fifty Jewish men there and we had not SS guards around us but they just came every day and counted.</span> <span id="s216">And we had to dig a certain amount.</span> <span id="s217">I don’t remember how many meters.</span> <span id="s218">For me, I was very young, it didn’t mean much.</span> <span id="s219">But for the older men when they couldn’t do it, they told us right away that if you couldn’t do it we send you to a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Did they do that to some people?</span> <span id="s221">Were some people sent away?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s223">You know if you’re not used to this type of work, if you’re young it’s easy.</span> <span id="s224">I got very sick the end of September and then I was sent home.</span> <span id="s225">I got a terrible stomach.</span> <span id="s226">I was sent home.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: In September 30.</span> <span id="s228">Was that before or after the war with Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: This was still before.</span> <span id="s230">No, maybe it was after.</span> <span id="s231">I cannot remember now.</span> <span id="s232">It was approximately, I cannot recall, maybe it was end of August.</span> <span id="s233">These dates, I cannot recall, maybe it was end of August.</span> <span id="s234">These dates I don’t remember exactly.</span> <span id="s235">I think I was home when the war started.</span> <span id="s236">But I had a terrible stomach, you know the food was terrible and the cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Did you go back and forth from Hamburg or did they have a campo out there?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: No, barracks.</span> <span id="s239">Very primitive.</span> <span id="s240">Later on they brought in Polish POWs.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: After the war started?</span> <span id="s242">Can I backtrack a little bit?</span> <span id="s243">Talking about Hamburg and you said something about you could still on November 30th go out.</span> <span id="s244">Were there restrictions?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: September 1, 1939 we had to wear the Jewish Star and we could not go out on the street after 8:00 or 9:00 at night.</span> <span id="s246">I cannot remember right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Were there any other restrictions?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: No telephones.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Did you turn them in to the authorities?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: No, they picked them up.</span> <span id="s251">And no radios, as far as I know, and I think cars were also taken away, as far as I know.</span> <span id="s252">We had no car anyhow.</span> <span id="s253">But I heard certain things.</span> <span id="s254">And then you see there’s another thing, the November action started because of the murder of the German Ambassador, and at that time Jews had to pay three billion marks, or something.</span> <span id="s255">And when the war started we had to give up all our silver and gold.</span> <span id="s256">That I remember too.</span> <span id="s257">We didn’t have much any more because it was all sold already, you know.</span> <span id="s258">There were other restrictions.</span> <span id="s259">You couldn’t go to German movie houses any more and theaters and things like this.</span> <span id="s260">You couldn’t go to restaurants because it said, in most places they had the signs, no Jews permitted.</span> <span id="s261">You couldn’t sit on a bench in the park only on a yellow bench for Jews.</span> <span id="s262">There were certain things, but you know, I was young and I don’t recall everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: This is quite a bit, though.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: So after the war started, what were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: I told you.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: Oh, yes, you were working in the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Then when I came home, there was in the house of Otto Menke, there was a young man who sold fruit juices.</span> <span id="s269">I was visiting Otto and Otto’s father told me, Heinz, he said, A and S company downstairs is looking for strong men because all the people were drafted now to move these big cases ___________.</span> <span id="s270">You are strong.</span> <span id="s271">So I went there to him and I said Mr. Capolsky, or whatever his name was, yes I have a job, but I have to go to the Jewish unemployment to get the permission for you.</span> <span id="s272">So he said you go there with your bicycle and I give you 24 bottles of the best juice, you bring it to him with best regards from so and so, and this letter.</span> <span id="s273">So he looked at the letter and he yeah, yeah, he said, I ordered that.</span> <span id="s274">You’re O.K. And I worked there about one year.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: What were you doing there, you were just delivering?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: No, no I couldn’t leave.</span> <span id="s277">I was just unloading and loading these cases with bottles of juice and things like that.</span> <span id="s278">I have the name of the company somewhere.</span> <span id="s279">It was very nice people.</span> <span id="s280">There were no Jewish businesses.</span> <span id="s281">Germans.</span> <span id="s282">After one year I had to stop there because there were also German women working and somebody must have said how can you let a Jew work with German women together.</span> <span id="s283">So I had to stop.</span> <span id="s284">Then they sent me to a place to unload shoes and confiscated merchandise from Belgium and France that raided during the war.</span> <span id="s285">These came in with tremendous trains and they were used for the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: Where was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: In Hamburg.</span> <span id="s288">Also this was a warehouse.</span> <span id="s289">I cannot tell you the street.</span> <span id="s290">Hamburg is a big place, you know.</span> <span id="s291">And I had worked there until one morning on November 7th, my mother, we didn’t have a phone but she got word to me that I better come home there was an order from the Gestapo to be deported tomorrow and we were the second transport from Hamburg.</span> <span id="s292">The first one.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: You said November 7, this was 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: 1941.</span> <span id="s295">1940 I worked in the shoe factory, not factory, a leather one.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: You said that you were in shoes,?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Warehouse.</span> <span id="s298">About a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: And this was seized from Jews ---- not Jews from the population in France and Belgium ----</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Stuff that had been gained through the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: Confiscated by the Germans for their own good.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: And then, November 7, 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: My mother got word to me and to my sister, who was also working, this was not work on your free will, you were just told to work there, you understand.</span> <span id="s304">Forced labor.</span> <span id="s305">Got word to her or to the company that whatever she did, maybe a gentile neighbor called, I don’t remember, if we would come home, because we were deported to the East.</span> <span id="s306">We did not know where we would go.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: You said she got word to you.</span> <span id="s308">Were you still living at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: So it was during the day that the notice came and she had to contact you?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: The letter came by mail and she called my sister and me and told us to come home immediately, stop working.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: And all the letter said was that you were being deported to the East?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: I have the copy _______ Alexander, we also get a surname when the war started.</span> <span id="s314">Every Jew had to call himself Heinz ______ and the women Elsa _______.</span> <span id="s315">This was also in ’39, I just remembered this.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: And they said you were going to the East to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: No, they didn’t say, they said you would be deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: That’s all?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: I have the letter here.</span> <span id="s320">I can give it to you later, a photocopy of the letter.</span> <span id="s321">I have a photocopy of the letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: O.K.</span> <span id="s323">Did it give you a time frame as to when you would leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: We had to report the next morning at 7 0’clock, 8 o’clock at the former Jewish lot in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s325">With one suitcase and fifty pounds.</span> <span id="s326">And it said you have to leave the key from the home at the police station and the home must be left in perfect condition.</span> <span id="s327">Ad my mother cleaned before we left.</span> <span id="s328">You see, typical Germans, you wouldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s329">If I think about it today, as I cry terrible to leave everything behind.</span> <span id="s330">You walk out, same as I would have walked out of here, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: What did you take, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: Well, we took, I was lucky.</span> <span id="s333">I had a gentile girlfriend living in my house and she brought me boots and warm stockings and everything and my mother took, we figured it would be to the East because the first transport went to Litzmannstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: So you already knew of one transport leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: We didn’t know where they went to, but we through the grapevine you heard it went to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: How long before your transport did that first one leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: A month later.</span> <span id="s338">I have the date, if you want it.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: No, no it’s not terribly important.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: I have the date.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: But you knew that people had already been deported before?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s343">The very first transport went in September, right away there was Polish Jews, they shipped them to the Polish border and then the second transport was in October, I think of ’41, it went to Litzmannstadt, we learned later on.</span> <span id="s344">And ours was a second transport from Hamburg and we were the first transport that arrived in Minsk.</span> <span id="s345">And then another transport came later and we saw 500 people from Bremen and Hamburg together, 500 from Bremen and 500 from Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: This is a question you probably can answer from information afterwards.</span> <span id="s347">I’m sure you didn’t know this then.</span> <span id="s348">Do you know why they sent these people to Minsk?</span> <span id="s349">Was there a reason that your transport went to Minsk and not somewhere in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: No, you see the Germans, I read from this book here from Mr. Kohl, the Germans heard that the cities in Poland and Russia, they figured the Jews would be put there in the beginning.</span> <span id="s351">It was no idea of killing them immediately, they wanted the Jews to work, and because they couldn’t send all these people now to one spot.</span> <span id="s352">They distributed them among different cities.</span> <span id="s353">Litmanstadt, Riga, Lithuania, Minsk, a lot of cities.</span> <span id="s354">You see, the transport went from all parts of Germany and Czechoslovakia and Vienna and to Litzmannstadt, to the East.</span> <span id="s355">The trains were running all the time.</span> <span id="s356">We were only one transport.</span> <span id="s357">Our luck was that we were the first transport that came to Minsk and was unloaded.</span> <span id="s358">Because only the first seven transports in Minsk were unloaded.</span> <span id="s359">The other 28 were gassed on arrival.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: They went straight to the gas chambers?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: There were no gas chambers.</span> <span id="s362">Minsk didn’t have a gas chamber.</span> <span id="s363">Minsk, they would bring these people from the railroad station in moving vans, which were ___ with a chimney and windows painted on it and they said we bring you to our farms to work here.</span> <span id="s364">And the minute all the people were pushed in, maybe 100 or 200 people, I wasn’t there, but I read in the book, they would close these big doors and the exhaust pipe would run, this was the first experiment with gas and they would bring them to about 8 or 10 kilometers out of Minsk and by the time they got there the people were dead.</span> <span id="s365">It took one hour, one hour and a half for the people to die.</span> <span id="s366">And then later on they started with different type of gas.</span> <span id="s367">In Minsk was actually the experiment with gas.</span> <span id="s368">Started in Minsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: And this was like carbon monoxide?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A” We were the first transport to arrive.</span> <span id="s371">When we arrived the Germans had just killed 30,000 Russian Jews to make space for the German Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: In Minsk?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: In Minsk.</span> <span id="s374">When we arrived the bodies were still there.</span> <span id="s375">Not all of them, but in the houses.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: This was November still?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: We arrived, we traveled three or four days.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Can you describe the train trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Our train were old passenger cars, not new ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: They weren’t cattle cars, they had seats?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: No cattle cars, they had seats, toilet, everybody had a seat and, now let me go before when we came to the point where we had to, where all the thousand people had to report.</span> <span id="s382">The SS would first look at your passport picture, or your ID card and rip it up then you were to open your wallet because you were only permitted to one hundred marks with you, then you had to give them all the jewelry you had, including your wedding band, you had no other jewelry because it had been already confiscated, and then you had to sign a paper that I, the Jew Heinz Rosenberg, will be deported because I am an enemy of the fatherland.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: You had to write this out?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: No, no, it was already written, we had to sign it.</span> <span id="s385">And, one more thing I forgot, then you got in and it was a tremendous hall or house, an old Jewish lot, it was a community house, and there were already many, the mood was not bad, because they said, well finally we get there where we will work and after the war we will come home.</span> <span id="s386">People just could not understand.</span> <span id="s387">It’s the same as they would take today one hundred thousand American people from Queens and say, you’re going on a little vacation.</span> <span id="s388">Normal person cannot understand.</span> <span id="s389">But some people committed suicide.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Some people did?</span> <span id="s391">There?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Not there, in their homes.</span> <span id="s393">There were about 30 people and therefore my girlfriend, Erica could come because she was on the list.</span> <span id="s394">But because 30 people didn’t show up, she was permitted to go there.</span> <span id="s395">It had to be thousand people, Germans are exact, they have to be exact.</span> <span id="s396">We left the next morning, at the Jewish Community in Hamburg delivered soup and the Jewish leader in Hamburg told us, don’t worry you go to work and we loaded the cars with sewing machines and equipment for you, and with food and you will be well taken care of, I have the guarantee from the SS and so on.</span> <span id="s397">Where will you go, we go to the East.</span> <span id="s398">Well it took four days and when we arrived in Minsk in the evening we were surrounded by very heavy SS guard.</span> <span id="s399">We were not permitted to get out, it was November, but we saw across the our train a train with Russian prisoners, in open cattle cars, and we saw how one or two German soldiers would throw in one bread in each car and these people were starved to death , would start fighting and the minute they would start fighting, then SS said mutiny and would take their machine guns and Brrrrrrr.</span> <span id="s400">It was the first impression for me.</span> <span id="s401">And then the next morning, now I was made a so- called runner from car to car with a yellow ribbon because there had to be some kind of communication when we stopped.</span> <span id="s402">- We stopped three or four times on the way.</span> <span id="s403">Some people got sick, we had no doctor, but we had a nurse with us, a Jewish nurse.</span> <span id="s404">It had to be somebody who could run fast and I was very young.</span> <span id="s405">So I had a much better idea what was going on in the different trains.</span> <span id="s406">I was only with two more people, we could go from outside, the SS would open the door, and we would try to bring these people to the car where the nurse was.</span> <span id="s407">There was no medical things there.</span> <span id="s408">But when we got to Minsk, I was also there and Dr. Frank, who was the leader of the transport, a former German officer, a lawyer, the ex-commander of Minsk was standing there and said, where is your leader from the transport?</span> <span id="s409">So Dr. Frank, who had one of these Spanish little things on his head, you know, said Sir, and he saluted him I have one thousand Jews men and women and children from Hamburg and that was the first impression, then that SS man took his whip and “slap” to his face and he fell down.</span> <span id="s410">You dirty Jew when you speak to an SS man, take your hat off.</span> <span id="s411">You see, that was the first impression of Minsk.</span> <span id="s412">And then, you want to continue, or is that too far?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: No, no go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: And then we had to go to the ghetto of Minsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: So there is already a ghetto established there?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: From the Russian Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: You said something about when you got there that they had to kill many Russian Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: We didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s419">When we got there the SS people taught us we walked, cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: This was November?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Cold and many old people couldn’t make it up the hill.</span> <span id="s422">I remember this.</span> <span id="s423">And we got there and we saw this red house, this used to be a former school and the white house, also a school, is for you.</span> <span id="s424">The red is not for you.</span> <span id="s425">So we got into these houses, Dr. Frank and the first young man, because the others took much longer time to get there, the food was still on the table, whatever little food they had, these people were already pushed into the school buildings.</span> <span id="s426">The dead bodies were still there.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Inside the houses?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Inside the two houses.</span> <span id="s429">So Dr. Frank said we have to clean up before we let the people in.</span> <span id="s430">So we tried very hard to clean up.</span> <span id="s431">There were not that many bodies, maybe thirty, forty.</span> <span id="s432">They had taken everybody away, these most probably were in hiding and when the SS went through the building saw them.</span> <span id="s433">And then we learned, it was a few days later, there was a big fence between the Russian and the German Jewish ghetto.</span> <span id="s434">The SS put a big fence there.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: So you were kept apart from the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: They had built it to keep us separate.</span> <span id="s437">And when we came to the fence, first we were not permitted to go to the fence, but later on you couldn’t always, you know the guards couldn’t be all over.</span> <span id="s438">They told us that thirty thousand Jews had been killed in the last three days to make room for the German Jews.</span> <span id="s439">For the Yekkas (?)</span> <span id="s440">they called us the “Yekkas”.</span> <span id="s441">The Yekkas is a typical German Jew.</span> <span id="s442">So I didn’t speak Yiddish at that time, I spoke German and these people spoke Yiddish, so you had, Yiddish is a turned around German.</span> <span id="s443">So we couldn’t touch them but we could talk to them at least.</span> <span id="s444">And we learned about the tragedies that every day there actions, every day there killings and there were about one hundred thousand Russian Jews, but every day they would kill some of them.</span> <span id="s445">We didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s446">My father said, come on.</span> <span id="s447">My father was typical law abiding citizen and they made Dr. Frank the leader of the German part of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s448">About three days later the next transport came from Dusseldorf already and we didn’t know where to put these people.</span> <span id="s449">And two days later a transport from Frankfurt, all with thousand people.</span> <span id="s450">And then the SS commander came and said well you can move into the small houses.</span> <span id="s451">These were not real houses, these were little from can you imagine in the country you have, where you go for the summer, a little summerhouse.</span> <span id="s452">It was not very big, with wood, and there was a stove inside and tiny rooms, you know, like this, but we did not have furniture and so on and it was cold.</span> <span id="s453">But my family and my mother, father, and my sister, we moved together with other family, Blywise and Himmelstein to one of these little houses.</span> <span id="s454">Then after awhile, after about four weeks about seven or eight transports arrived all together and then the transports stopped.</span> <span id="s455">The last one came from Yanof.</span> <span id="s456">Then it stopped.</span> <span id="s457">And then we started to work, we were picked up in the morning by heavy guard, twenty men, or twenty women.</span> <span id="s458">I worked in the German soldiers homes.</span> <span id="s459">I had a very good job, I mean, I had plenty to eat, much more than the people in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s460">I was permitted every Sunday to visit my family.</span> <span id="s461">SS guard would bring me and pick me up the next morning.</span> <span id="s462">But most commandos only worked during the day and went home to the ghetto at night.</span> <span id="s463">But certain commandos stayed on the job because it was impossible to transport them back and forth.</span> <span id="s464">I was very lucky, very lucky.</span> <span id="s465">First I worked in the German hospital and the hospital was later made into a German home for soldiers so I compared to others and I was able to bring little things to my parent.</span> <span id="s466">Sometimes extra soup, if I wasn’t searched.</span> <span id="s467">If you were searched and they found something, they would (sound effect).</span> <span id="s468">I came with an SS guard already and the guard would look the other way they didn’t expect me to bring anything in.</span> <span id="s469">That was about all together about eight months.</span> <span id="s470">The officer in charge his name was Breimeier who for whatever cockeyed reason was very good to me, he killed other Jews, but I was his pet for whatever reason.</span> <span id="s471">These people were abnormal, abnormal people.</span> <span id="s472">And there’s another interesting story, if you want to hear it.</span> <span id="s473">One day he told me, he said, Heinz, tomorrow morning we expect some German artists to entertain the troops and I want you to help them with the luggage.</span> <span id="s474">So when I went up there this one German man said to me how come you speak such a perfect German, are you a Russian Jew?</span> <span id="s475">I said no, I am a German Jew, I’m from Gottingen.</span> <span id="s476">He said, from Gottingen, ______ and this was a girlfriend of my sister’s, they went to school together.</span> <span id="s477">So I said, Sir, I’m sorry I cannot talk to you because I am a prisoner here.</span> <span id="s478">Come on, how can you be a prisoner, then he saw the Jewish Star and the big cross (?)</span> <span id="s479">here.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Side 2, Tape 1 He didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s481">And she was the first one who taught me.</span> <span id="s482">(blank space on tape at this point) She said, I have heard and been told by SS people that this camp will be eliminated.</span> <span id="s483">She knew already.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: And this was still in ’41?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: ’42.</span> <span id="s486">This was in ’42, that’s why I bring it up.</span> <span id="s487">They knew already that the camp would be eliminated.</span> <span id="s488">Now in summer of ’42, was another big action where thirty thousand Jews were killed in three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: These were mostly Soviet Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: German Jews too.</span> <span id="s491">They killed all the Viennese, all the Czech Jews, all the Frankfurt Jews, all the, there were only about two thousand or three thousand people left from the German Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: You said you were working at this hospital and then became a German soldiers home.</span> <span id="s493">What did you do there?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: I was in the steam room.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: You were in the steam room, you cleaned up?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: No, no, we had to heat the place.</span> <span id="s497">But not with coal or oil but with Toff, what is toff, something that burns very fast, you know when the trees decompose it becomes like (sound effect) this is a tremendous building so you had to focus there.</span> <span id="s498">We were a twenty-four hour shift.</span> <span id="s499">They brought in wood too, but it was very hard work.</span> <span id="s500">We had two shifts, two men each, to heat the big place.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: Again who was the person who told you they were going to eliminate the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: She was a German girl from Gottingen.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: What was she doing there, was she Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s505">She was an actress.</span> <span id="s506">The actors came like here you have the American troops are entertained.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: Oh, like the USO?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: The same thing.</span> <span id="s509">The Germans did the same.</span> <span id="s510">She came with this group to Minsk and because I worked in the Soldiers Home that’s where they performed.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: And she knew your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: She went to school together.</span> <span id="s513">She was our best friends in Gottingen as little children.</span> <span id="s514">She knew my family, she knew my home.</span> <span id="s515">All coincidence in life, you know.</span> <span id="s516">But she was the first one who told me that this camp would be destroyed.</span> <span id="s517">And nobody believed us, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: You said in the summer?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: Then came 1942, they killed every day, 100 people, 50 people, 10 people of the Russian Jews.</span> <span id="s520">But then in July 1942 there was a mass action where we who were outside on commandos could not go back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s521">Three days.</span> <span id="s522">And they killed thirty five thousand Jews in three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: Do you know what method they used to do this, were they gassing them?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Whatever they could transport with their gas vans, they would transport them out.</span> <span id="s525">The people had to stand in line and waited to be loaded and the others they would shoot them.</span> <span id="s526">They also brought these people to, this is interesting in the book from Mr. Kohl, he describes exactly where the killings took place.</span> <span id="s527">These people had to lay down, not only just jump into the graves they were digged before, but they had to lay down orderly, one with the head here, the other one with the head there, so it would take less space.</span> <span id="s528">Then the soldiers would come with the machine guns and Brrrrrr.</span> <span id="s529">Then the next people…</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: So they shot them when they were on the ground?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: In the grave.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: So they made them dig the grave?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: No, they were digged before.</span> <span id="s534">Other prisoners who were also killed and then when these people came they had to line up and they had to jump into the grave, but not just anyway you wanted it, no one had to lay this way and the other one this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: And then they shot them after they lay down?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: The first layer and then the next layer had to jump in.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Was this in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: No, this was outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Where they took them out to the woods?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Yes, they were in a so- called farm.</span> <span id="s541">- I have the names in the book from Mr. Kohl if you need the names, I give you the names.</span> <span id="s542">This book is fantastic because we didn’t know these things.</span> <span id="s543">I only learned about these details now from this book from this German reporter.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: This book is in German?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: Yes in German.</span> <span id="s546">A fantastic book an unbelievable book.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: I would like to look at it.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: This is unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Did you know, did you see these people.</span> <span id="s550">You were not in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: I was in the Soldiers home.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: So did you know when you came back what had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s554">We knew from the Russian people who worked in the Soldiers home.</span> <span id="s555">They came in and could not look into my eyes, the Russian people.</span> <span id="s556">I worked together with Russian people too.</span> <span id="s557">I asked them.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: These were non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: Non-Jews.</span> <span id="s560">I asked them what is happening?</span> <span id="s561">And some spoke German and they said nisht goot.</span> <span id="s562">nisht goot, __________ ghetto kaput.</span> <span id="s563">So for three days.</span> <span id="s564">But Breimeier, my German officer in charge, I had to go every night and bring his beer from the canteen, as a Jew I had to go to the German soldiers’ canteen and say “das beer bitta for officer Breimeier.”</span> <span id="s565">They knew me already.</span> <span id="s566">Everybody looked at me, here comes the Jew.</span> <span id="s567">He liked me because his wife was saved by Jewish doctors.</span> <span id="s568">He killed other __________ because he had two potatoes (?)</span> <span id="s569">You know, these people you couldn’t explain it you know.</span> <span id="s570">For example, when _______ came she came back after two weeks and I said to her when she left, she said what can I do for you?</span> <span id="s571">I said, you know, I would love to send a note to my aunt in Hamburg, who is still there.</span> <span id="s572">Certainly, Heinz, certainly.</span> <span id="s573">When she came back I did not know.</span> <span id="s574">There again was all the SS staff standing there on the Soldiers’ Home.</span> <span id="s575">All these SS people wanted to have affairs with the German girls.</span> <span id="s576">And she looked out of the bus who rode in and I was standing there with Breimeier, I was supposed to, she said Heinz Rosenberg, I have a package for you from Hamburg.</span> <span id="s577">That would have been automatically death penalty.</span> <span id="s578">Any communication was death penalty.</span> <span id="s579">The SS most probably didn’t hear or they didn’t know because there were German soldiers standing there and others, Heinz Rosenberg could also be a German.</span> <span id="s580">But Breimeier he looked at me, he didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s581">But at night when he called, I had to be up there every night at 6 0’clock to bring his beer, he said I want to talk to you.</span> <span id="s582">I said what happened, sir.</span> <span id="s583">I had to address him as sir.</span> <span id="s584">What was that with a package?</span> <span id="s585">What package, I said.</span> <span id="s586">He said, come on don’t give me that story.</span> <span id="s587">He was a man of about 45.</span> <span id="s588">He said this lady called out.</span> <span id="s589">I said, well, what can I tell you sir, she offered to send a note to my aunt in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s590">I tell you one thing, if you want to have anything written or done, you come to me, don’t go to strangers.</span> <span id="s591">You couldn’t make these people out because he could have said at the same minute “bang out”.</span> <span id="s592">It meant nothing.</span> <span id="s593">So, I was his pet for whatever cockeyed reason, I cannot tell you why.</span> <span id="s594">He would sit and drink his beer and tell me you know, my wife, she was helped by this Jew doctor, what a beautiful person.</span> <span id="s595">I have nothing against the Jews , but he kills them, you know.</span> <span id="s596">You can’t make them out.</span> <span id="s597">So that __________ I met her again after the war in Berlin.</span> <span id="s598">She died of cancer, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s599">She was a hero, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: You met?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Lila _______ when I went to Germany the first time.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: The woman who helped you send the package?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: Yes, she died.</span> <span id="s604">So this was May.</span> <span id="s605">So we had this action in July, I think, 26th or 29th where they killed thirty-five thousand Jews in one clip.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: Now can you tell me, you were talking about this man who was, you worked for and got beer for and everything.</span> <span id="s607">Were German Jews treated differently than Russian Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: No, you see, what it was, and this I read also in the book here from this Kohl, that F commander of White Russia General Kula or whatever, I give you the name, he has the biggest fight with Berlin because he said I don’t want anything to happen to the German Jews.</span> <span id="s609">I don’t mind if you kill all the Russian Jews, but the German Jews are good people, they work, they’re qualified, I want to keep them.</span> <span id="s610">And he was overruled by the German high command.</span> <span id="s611">Either you do it or you’re out.</span> <span id="s612">So he had no choice.</span> <span id="s613">But he was in the beginning fighting for, as a matter of fact, there is one German Jew who was in the war with the Kaiser’s son and he was sent back to Germany and I have his book here, “One German Jew”.</span> <span id="s614">And this SS man went to him in person and said, look, you’re the only one.</span> <span id="s615">I will make a personal request from Hitler that you will and he was sent to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s616">So you see that SS he was later blown up by the Party friends of Russia.</span> <span id="s617">Because he hated the Russian Jews.</span> <span id="s618">He hated the Russians.</span> <span id="s619">But for some other reason he thought he wanted to save the German Jews, he wanted to send them back after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q” Did you see some of this like this treatment in Minsk?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s622">You have to understand something.</span> <span id="s623">When we came to Minsk, you have to understand the German Jews basically were much softer than the Russian Jews or Polish Jews because they lived a much harder life already,.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Soft, you mean physically?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: Physically, more, better homes, better life, all lawyers, all doctors, all businessmen.</span> <span id="s626">Jews who lived in Poland, Lithuania, Russia were locksmiths or carpenters, they had more trades.</span> <span id="s627">And they could live more easily from what they had.</span> <span id="s628">Unfortunately, the German Jews in a certain way, especially the Western Jews, were already much more used to the easier life.</span> <span id="s629">That’s why they died easier too, and faster.</span> <span id="s630">They couldn’t take the cold, they couldn’t take the snow, they couldn’t take the hardships of life.</span> <span id="s631">The Russian Jews wouldn’t have died if Hitler wouldn’t have killed them.</span> <span id="s632">And the German Jews wouldn’t have died either, not all of them, if Hitler hadn’t killed them.</span> <span id="s633">But the German Jews and the French Jews and the Viennese, especially, or the Czechs, they were much softer, it’s the same here.</span> <span id="s634">A man from Park Avenue will not survive than a man from Harlem.</span> <span id="s635">It’s nothing against the Jews from other parts, you understand, I love anybody, I only bring it out that we were not used to thirty below zero.</span> <span id="s636">They lived there, it was nothing for them.</span> <span id="s637">They were _______servants in the morning and my father was dying little by little.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: After July 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: There were two more actions.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Two more actions, when were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: I cannot remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Was this the first large action, large scale action?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: This was the last, after we arrived, they had killed at that time thirty-five thousand.</span> <span id="s644">This time they killed thirty-five thousand German, Viennese, Czech and Russian Jews.</span> <span id="s645">From the so-called Wonder ghetto, we were in the Sunder which was called the Extra ghetto, Sunder is Extra ghetto.</span> <span id="s646">They eliminated one part.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Of your ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Of our so-called German ghetto of seven thousand people.</span> <span id="s649">And after this action everybody had to move to the part where the Hamburg, Bremen and Frankfurt Jews used to be, the people from Dusseldorf, I don’t remember which ones.</span> <span id="s650">And the others were closed already.</span> <span id="s651">And there only were some survivors, and some of them went crazy, some of them just couldn’t understand, there was nobody left when they came from work.</span> <span id="s652">The whole families completely wiped out, you go out, you say goodbye, you come back and there is nothing left.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Your family was still there?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: My family, we lived in the Hamburg part.</span> <span id="s655">We were lucky.</span> <span id="s656">My family was still alive when I left.</span> <span id="s657">I was very lucky, I tell you honestly.</span> <span id="s658">But I was also very young, very strong, I could lift a horse by myself, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: So what happened after this?</span> <span id="s660">This first large scale?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: They were every day.</span> <span id="s662">Mr. Gruber, the SS commander of Minsk, Mr. Gruber, he was not all over in charge, but he was the one in charge of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s663">Every day he would take five or ten people or one with more children and send them to death.</span> <span id="s664">He would kill them himself on the cemetery.</span> <span id="s665">We didn’t know, because if you were there I wouldn’t be here.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: But did you know people were leaving, nobody knew people were dying except for family members every day lie that?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: You saw it, you saw it.</span> <span id="s668">You just couldn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s669">He would go through with the Latvian SS men and just say you come with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: Whoever they found on the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: Whatever reason, if they would find them on the fence, or they would find them, --- One day there was a beautiful girl who worked together with my brother, Marion Barrow and she had painted, she was a painter, a sign painter, new sign, Largo ____ a beautiful sign.</span> <span id="s672">Who made this beautiful sign?</span> <span id="s673">So, at that time we had already the third Jewish man in charge of the ghetto, two were killed already and he said oh that was Marion Barrow (?)</span> <span id="s674">He said why don’t you call her.</span> <span id="s675">This is very nice.</span> <span id="s676">And he called her, and took her to the cemetery and killed her.</span> <span id="s677">And now when I was in Hamburg I met the daughter of her sister who lived in Israel and the sister had died a week before we came and she wanted to know the story.</span> <span id="s678">And it’s very hard for me to tell a family member what happened.</span> <span id="s679">There were two more actions.</span> <span id="s680">I don’t know, the Russian ghetto actions were every day, and our ghetto there were two more actions, I think, I cannot tell you the amount of people that were killed.</span> <span id="s681">But I only know one thing, that on September 1, 1943, there were only two thousand five hundred German Jews left and about the same amount of Russian Jews.</span> <span id="s682">That was from a camp of one hundred and thirty five thousand men, women and children.</span> <span id="s683">Within two years they had killed about one hundred and thirty thousand people.</span> <span id="s684">We’ll have to make it short, otherwise we’ll never come to an end.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: You said there were two other actions?</span> <span id="s686">They would be between July ’42 and September ’43?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: Yes, every day were actions.</span> <span id="s688">Gas ones came in all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: You never did any of these gas vans?</span> <span id="s690">Were they all staffed by the SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s692">You see the vans would come in and the people were forced to jump into them.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Did these people know what these vans would do?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: Of course they knew, by now it wasn’t the beginning.</span> <span id="s695">The people who arrived in the transports, they saw these big moving vans with the chimneys.</span> <span id="s696">And the SS didn’t threaten them, they were very nice, they said you know we bring you to our farms, because they have been told that if you are nice to people they will listen to you.</span> <span id="s697">And they are there to undress and they said we are going out to a thing and by the time they got there they were already dead.</span> <span id="s698">September 1, 1943, the ghetto, our German ghetto was completely surrounded by SS during the night.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: So we’re talking, was there still a division between Russian and German Jews at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: Yes, there was always.</span> <span id="s701">Heavy guards.</span> <span id="s702">We knew something was going on.</span> <span id="s703">It was 5 o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s704">And then Gruber gave order that all Jews had to assemble in one open place we had there in a ____Platz (?)</span> <span id="s705">that is a place to and he said all healthy men step forward and he sent back my father who was already old, and other old men he sent back.</span> <span id="s706">But left were about 250 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: Who stepped out?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: He put them separate and he said, I give you exactly half an hour, pack a small knapsack, you go on a special work commando.</span> <span id="s709">Nothing will happen to you, you will be treated very well and say goodbye to your family, but you will come back and there is no problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: What happened after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: So after half an hour we said goodbye and very heavy SS guard came.</span> <span id="s712">I’ve never seen more SS people in my whole life.</span> <span id="s713">We were 250 men, there must have been 100 SS people with machine guns, everything and we were marched out of the ghetto to a small camp which recently used to be a prisoner of war camp for the Russian prisoners.</span> <span id="s714">A small camp in the city.</span> <span id="s715">I didn’t know the name, we didn’t know it existed.</span> <span id="s716">We didn’t know anything because we couldn’t walk around.</span> <span id="s717">There was four barracks, actually barracks for horses, and there were already some people there, some Jews.</span> <span id="s718">They said we come from Smolensk.</span> <span id="s719">And we got in and there was another SS commander.</span> <span id="s720">We were only borders to them.</span> <span id="s721">And he said, well you will be here until your transport leaves.</span> <span id="s722">We asked where are we going?</span> <span id="s723">I do not know, I cannot tell you, you will get food and if you behave properly nothing will happen to you.</span> <span id="s724">And one person made a question, I don’t know what he asked, what about our wives?</span> <span id="s725">I tell you about your wife, he took his gun and bang.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: And shot him?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s728">You see.</span> <span id="s729">So, we were there, there was no straw, no nothing.</span> <span id="s730">Bare wood.</span> <span id="s731">Of course, we were worried and we didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s732">We could ______ soup.</span> <span id="s733">It was a small place, we were 500 prisoners and these people from Smolensk told us that the ghetto in Smolensk has been closed.</span> <span id="s734">These were the last people they took out.</span> <span id="s735">Come on, this cannot be.</span> <span id="s736">Yes, he said.</span> <span id="s737">Over the two years and then we realized this time it will happen to our people.</span> <span id="s738">But after three days, Mr. Gruber, the SS commander came and sad I have very good news for you, you can each write a note to your loved ones in the ghetto, and if you have wives, if they want to join you, they will be permitted to join you here.</span> <span id="s739">So I wrote to my family, a small piece of paper we had, we got, we didn’t have it and the pencil, I wrote I do not want Erika to come because this to me looks very bad.</span> <span id="s740">I wrote in French and English, because I spoke a little English and French at that time because we didn’t figure if they would read it.</span> <span id="s741">And two days later I got a letter back from home from my family and Erica.</span> <span id="s742">And Erica wrote, I am coming together with Hannah Lou’s sister who was married to Herman Haupman who lives now.</span> <span id="s743">We are coming.</span> <span id="s744">And honestly, after six days about 50 women arrived all from the married men.</span> <span id="s745">Also with the little knapsack.</span> <span id="s746">And we said it cannot be so bad if they permit the women here.</span> <span id="s747">Maybe nothing to eat, probably, maybe nothing to sleep probably.</span> <span id="s748">But when you are in such a state, just to have somebody is already comforting.</span> <span id="s749">And that went on until September 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: So you were there two weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: With a wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: So Erika came, she was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s754">And very early, on September 14, 1943, the SS commander of this camp told us to get ready for transport.</span> <span id="s755">It was 5 in the morning.</span> <span id="s756">We all packed our little bag what we had, we went up we were not permitted to take anything with us, the men and the women.</span> <span id="s757">And he said the men to the left and the women to the right.</span> <span id="s758">And he said, first we bring the men to the railroad and then the women so you can prepare already at least.</span> <span id="s759">And again under very heavy guards we were taken to the railroad.</span> <span id="s760">That’s the last time I saw Erika or my parents.</span> <span id="s761">The women never came.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: They never came with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: Never.</span> <span id="s764">But when we went through the cities of Minsk with this transporter, it was an SS van or whatever it was, we passed the ghetto.</span> <span id="s765">And they must have heard something or seen and I saw the people still standing in the ghetto and greeting us.</span> <span id="s766">We couldn’t see them in person, but I saw them saying hello.</span> <span id="s767">I don’t know if my parents were there or not, you couldn’t look that far.</span> <span id="s768">So the ghetto was still alive on September 14, 1943, 2,500 people there.</span> <span id="s769">If the Russian Jews were still there, I do not know.</span> <span id="s770">We didn’t pass by there.</span> <span id="s771">And we were taken to a cattle car now.</span> <span id="s772">No heat, no straw, nothing, no food.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: They didn’t give you any water either?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s775">I think we were in the transport two or three days.</span> <span id="s776">I honestly can’t remember right now.</span> <span id="s777">The doors were never opened.</span> <span id="s778">They gave us one little pear, but you know a hundred people in a car that pear went over right away, you know.</span> <span id="s779">And then we stopped, we couldn’t look out, but all night long they would move that car back and forth, like a football, you know, the people got completely, what should I say, it was abnormal, you know, you were pushed back and forth by tremendous force.</span> <span id="s780">They would (sound effect) and push.</span> <span id="s781">Then early in the morning the SS opened these cattle car doors and they were standing there with the German shepherds and with the kapos and they shouted “Get out you dirty Jews, get out, run, run, run, get out, get out, run.”</span> <span id="s782">And we saw a gate and it said Treblinka.</span> <span id="s783">And it said “Arbeit Mach Frei, the work will make you free.”</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: And this was the middle of September?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: This was probably the 17th or 18th of September, 1943.</span> <span id="s786">And we came to this camp, we had to run.</span> <span id="s787">It was a terrible sweet smell.</span> <span id="s788">A terrible smell.</span> <span id="s789">We didn’t know what Treblinka was, we had no idea.</span> <span id="s790">And we saw prisoners pulling tremendous loads, a wagon with shoes and with clothes.</span> <span id="s791">And we were put separate on one spot, the 200, some had died, I don’t remember how many made it or not.</span> <span id="s792">About 240 most probably.</span> <span id="s793">And there were kapos and there were Dutch Jews and they told us where you from?</span> <span id="s794">I said we’re from Minsk.</span> <span id="s795">They said this is the ______ commando that meant this is the commando to heaven.</span> <span id="s796">I said what are you talking about?</span> <span id="s797">Well, you will see, this is the commando to heaven.</span> <span id="s798">Do you have anything good with you?</span> <span id="s799">I said why?</span> <span id="s800">I need this.</span> <span id="s801">You don’t need it anymore.</span> <span id="s802">They were one hundred per cent sure, these kapos, we would be gassed too.</span> <span id="s803">So after a while, we were standing there about three hours, not permitted to go to the toilet, there were no toilets.</span> <span id="s804">After three hours an SS delegation came and said, are there any carpenters here?</span> <span id="s805">Yes, three carpenters.</span> <span id="s806">Any locksmiths?</span> <span id="s807">Yes.</span> <span id="s808">Any plumbers?</span> <span id="s809">Yes.</span> <span id="s810">Any electricians?</span> <span id="s811">Yes.</span> <span id="s812">Get out, get out, get out.</span> <span id="s813">And I, my friend Herman Hoffman was an electrician, he said to me, if they ask for locksmith next time, get out too.</span> <span id="s814">Locksmith?</span> <span id="s815">Yes.</span> <span id="s816">I knew about it, I was in the steam room.</span> <span id="s817">I got out too.</span> <span id="s818">We took Otto Menkin with us and Herman and about hundred people went out.</span> <span id="s819">And they said are there any gardeners?</span> <span id="s820">Yes.</span> <span id="s821">Everybody went as a gardener.</span> <span id="s822">The gardeners we never saw again.</span> <span id="s823">But we were pushed on the side and we went to a barrack and we had to undress.</span> <span id="s824">We had still not prison uniforms but we had old clothes marked with ___.</span> <span id="s825">So we had to undress.</span> <span id="s826">The little thing we had, here, here, here.</span> <span id="s827">Nothing.</span> <span id="s828">We were searched from top to bottom.</span> <span id="s829">Then we went into a shower room.</span> <span id="s830">We didn’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s831">And we got out and then we came to a room where they gave us each one a new uniform and wooden shoes or something like this and then they said you will stay here and you will be transported to Deshov.</span> <span id="s832">So the kapos said to us, that kapos, you are the first group that came in and goes out of here alive.</span> <span id="s833">So we still didn’t know what Treblinka was.</span> <span id="s834">I never heard about Treblinka before, you know.</span> <span id="s835">But we heard the smell and he said this is a death factory.</span> <span id="s836">But you know, even getting from the ghetto in Minsk, even seeing everything, we didn’t know what a death factory was, you know.</span> <span id="s837">We didn’t know, we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s838">So in the evening they put us back on a cattle car to Puchine which wasn’t too far away.</span> <span id="s839">Because the next morning we got there.</span> <span id="s840">In Puchine was a work camp, a concentration work camp, a very small camp.</span> <span id="s841">And we worked for the Heinkel factory.</span> <span id="s842">This was taken over by the, this used to be Polish airplane factory, taken over by the Germans and we got there was a small camp and this camp was, there were about 250 Polish Jews and women there.</span> <span id="s843">And just before we got there, the SS had executed all the children there by beheading them.</span> <span id="s844">And the grave, you know the mothers and fathers had to watch, there were about fifty children.</span> <span id="s845">So we got there, the Polish Jews did not like the German Jews, they called us the Yekkas.</span> <span id="s846">There was always friction, but they were in command.</span> <span id="s847">And we were put to work there in Puchine in one camp and then the next camp.</span> <span id="s848">This lasted about, I would think, four or six months.</span> <span id="s849">I can’t remember I have to look it up in my book.</span> <span id="s850">If you wait a minute I can get it.</span> <span id="s851">You want me to make sure of the dates?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: It was from September 17 to April 21, 1944, in Puchine.</span> <span id="s854">Puchine was then closed down because the Russians came already near, you see, and we were shipped to another work camp called Scechochw, and this was from April to July in 1944.</span> <span id="s855">These were all work camps for the Heinkel factory.</span> <span id="s856">But the Russians came closer again and when the train left the machine guns hit the last car of the train, but they got the Jews out.</span> <span id="s857">You see we were one hundred per cent sure that we would be liberated, but they got us out just before they got there.</span> <span id="s858">As a matter of fact the SS commander, two or three Polish Jews escaped that night or ten people.</span> <span id="s859">In the morning we thought we would all be killed, there was already machine guns around.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: Because they had escaped?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s862">He said how many escaped?</span> <span id="s863">Ten, that’s all, I thought more.</span> <span id="s864">He has no guts, you know, he was already sick and tired of this, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: Now what did you do in the first work camp in Puchine?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: We worked.</span> <span id="s867">I worked as a locksmith.</span> <span id="s868">I don’t remember exactly what I did.</span> <span id="s869">Because I was very strong at the end.</span> <span id="s870">First we had to transport in the beginning this was a work force to repair the tanks and we have to move these things and the equipment and, of course, they took the young men to move these things.</span> <span id="s871">And only later on did they try to put us really in places to work.</span> <span id="s872">But nothing was ever accomplished there, nothing.</span> <span id="s873">No airplane ever left there.</span> <span id="s874">But these were small concentration work camps, you understand.</span> <span id="s875">They had SS guards and the SS commandos.</span> <span id="s876">But in general you worked from 6-6 but you got soup, proper soup at night and a slice of bread, and because the camp became smaller, it was bad enough.</span> <span id="s877">But we got ____ in Deshov.</span> <span id="s878">They took us to a public bath every four weeks.</span> <span id="s879">The Heinkel Work insisted that the prisoner shouldn’t have lice.</span> <span id="s880">They paid for us.</span> <span id="s881">I think they paid fifty pfenigs a day for us or something like that.</span> <span id="s882">Puchine went to September and Deshov went from April to July 1944.</span> <span id="s883">And that also had to be closed down because the Russians came.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: And where did you go after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: And then we were taken to a big camp near Krakow called Plaszow, which was built on the former Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s886">It was mostly women camp.</span> <span id="s887">Women were there.</span> <span id="s888">Jewish women.</span> <span id="s889">This was a tremendous camp, one of the worst camps.</span> <span id="s890">That commander, SS commander, only walked around in a white silk suit.</span> <span id="s891">And he would kill the women like nothing.</span> <span id="s892">We had one latrine.</span> <span id="s893">You know what a latrine is?</span> <span id="s894">Women and men together.</span> <span id="s895">There was no difference.</span> <span id="s896">Absolutely no difference.</span> <span id="s897">And we finally, somebody put a wooden plank in between us.</span> <span id="s898">And we had very very bad kapos there and SS people too.</span> <span id="s899">But we were only there a few days.</span> <span id="s900">Because by now we were so called _____ expert workers.</span> <span id="s901">So from Plaszow, after five days, we were sent to the salt mines in Wieliczka, but they did not put us to work but it was the worst camp, I think because everything was dirt, you know from the salt and from the prisoners who worked there, never made it more than four to six weeks, they told us.</span> <span id="s902">And because they couldn’t use us there, they sent us to a tremendous German concentration camp in Bavaria called Flossenberg, a big camp, a very big camp.</span> <span id="s903">That was in August of ’44.</span> <span id="s904">And there the SS commandant when we came in he asked, we were very dirty and in a long transport for the day, he asked, the kapos, where do these prisoners come from?</span> <span id="s905">And the kapos said they are Jews.</span> <span id="s906">He said Jews?</span> <span id="s907">Jews only walk in, they go out in the chimney.</span> <span id="s908">This was a tremendous camp, very clean, very orderly, but terrible kapos.</span> <span id="s909">The German kapos hated us.</span> <span id="s910">The Polish kapos, you know.</span> <span id="s911">And we were put, just to give you an example, where to undress, this was high in the mountains, we had to undress, we had to run into a shower and this was originally the gas chamber, and the kapos said that’s it.</span> <span id="s912">And we didn’t know what would happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: The kapos said you would die?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: Yes, because it was a gas chamber.</span> <span id="s915">But they also had water faucets there on the ceiling.</span> <span id="s916">But in our case, the boiling water came out and you couldn’t move anywhere, we came out like lobsters into the ice cold weather, but we got out.</span> <span id="s917">And the kapos didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s918">I only give happy thoughts because I couldn’t tell you the whole thing, you can read everything here.</span> <span id="s919">So in Flossenberg, after about three weeks, we were not put to work, we were put in into a special barracks for Jews.</span> <span id="s920">There were no other Jews.</span> <span id="s921">There was a camp of about twenty thousand prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: Mostly they were political prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: Political, Galitziana, homosexuals, no Jews.</span> <span id="s924">We were the first Jews that came in and the first Jews that go out.</span> <span id="s925">But what happened in Flossenberg, it’s an interesting story.</span> <span id="s926">One day they put out of the 250 men were not all German Jews, they were Russian Jews, Polish Jews, but now there may be 200 left.</span> <span id="s927">One morning they called, all German Jews to the barracks A.</span> <span id="s928">That was where the commanding was sitting.</span> <span id="s929">Hands up, and we figured that’s it, we didn’t know what to make out of it.</span> <span id="s930">And all of a sudden somebody pushed me and said, Jew, come inside.</span> <span id="s931">There was no dead man, or the SS man or the typewriter and he asked, your name?</span> <span id="s932">I said Heinz Ludwig Rosenberg.</span> <span id="s933">Idiot, you are Heinz Ludwig Israel Rosenberg.</span> <span id="s934">Yes sir.</span> <span id="s935">Where you born?</span> <span id="s936">So and so.</span> <span id="s937">Where your parents?</span> <span id="s938">What’s your nationality?</span> <span id="s939">I said I am stateless.</span> <span id="s940">You are German.</span> <span id="s941">All of a sudden I am German again.</span> <span id="s942">You never knew where to take these people.</span> <span id="s943">What did you learn, what did you do, and so and so?</span> <span id="s944">Wrote everything down.</span> <span id="s945">Out!</span> <span id="s946">Next one.</span> <span id="s947">I tell you why this is important to tail this on the end of this.</span> <span id="s948">Everybody, German Jews were registered.</span> <span id="s949">Why?</span> <span id="s950">Don’t ask me.</span> <span id="s951">It was Rosenberg.</span> <span id="s952">Then, about three weeks later one morning, they said Block, everything with loud speakers, Block 420 or whatever our block was, you do not go to work, you report to the gate.</span> <span id="s953">And the kapos hated the Jews, he said good, get rid of you Jews.</span> <span id="s954">And the gate is a real commander today, out.</span> <span id="s955">We each got a piece of bread and a piece of liverwurst.</span> <span id="s956">And we’re standing and standing.</span> <span id="s957">I was so hungry I ate, little, little, little, and 5 o’clock the SS man came with a big basket to collect the wurst and bread because the railroad didn’t come.</span> <span id="s958">And somebody said I don’t have it.</span> <span id="s959">Don’t have it, stand out.</span> <span id="s960">So when he came to me I said sergeant, I ate mine I was so hungry.</span> <span id="s961">Why do you speak such good German?</span> <span id="s962">I was born in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s963">Next one.</span> <span id="s964">He didn’t do anything to me.</span> <span id="s965">Somehow, you know, there was all a matter of luck.</span> <span id="s966">From Flossenberg we were transported to the other part of Germany, Colmar, which was in the French ________, in the mountains.</span> <span id="s967">It was in August of ’44.</span> <span id="s968">And this transport was not guarded by SS men, but by disabled German soldiers.</span> <span id="s969">And they told us, they left the gate doors open, and they said the war is over.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: In August of ’44 they said this?</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: They said, the war is over, that’s the end of the war.</span> <span id="s972">What have you done that you are in prison?</span> <span id="s973">Because we had prison uniforms by now.</span> <span id="s974">We said we are Jews.</span> <span id="s975">Oh, don’t worry, it’s all over.</span> <span id="s976">And they were basically not brutal with whips and so on.</span> <span id="s977">They were German soldiers.</span> <span id="s978">And we came to this little camp in Colmar which was a small camp, also prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: So you went from Colmar in August of ’44, a couple days later to Urbis to dig the tunnel through…</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: Not dig, not dig.</span> <span id="s981">To work in the tunnel.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: To work inside the tunnel?</span> <span id="s983">What were you doing inside that tunnel?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: Transport, the skier or the product for the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: Do you know what they were doing there?</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: I think they were building parts for the submarines.</span> <span id="s987">I know the submarines were assembled in Bremen.</span> <span id="s988">I worked there too.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: And so then they transported you to Sachsenhausen?</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s991">We were also again put in a special barracks because we were the only Jews in Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s992">We were next to the barrack of people who were condemned to die.</span> <span id="s993">Every week they collected prisoners should die.</span> <span id="s994">Every Saturday they had about 250 executions in Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s995">We were next to it.</span> <span id="s996">But you could not talk to these people.</span> <span id="s997">It was completely surrounded by wire, barbed wire, you know.</span> <span id="s998">You couldn’t talk to them.</span> <span id="s999">But we saw them.</span> <span id="s1000">They were all shackled together, foot and things day and night.</span> <span id="s1001">And they were permitted half an hour to march around in their little extra things.</span> <span id="s1002">And they had crosses here and crosses here and crosses here, ready for death.</span> <span id="s1003">Every Saturday morning the truck would come and throw these people on the trucks, the kapos, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1004">And then they collect again.</span> <span id="s1005">We were in the next barrack and that’s why we knew it.</span> <span id="s1006">And in Sachsenhausen we were put to work.</span> <span id="s1007">We were put to work to dig out the houses that were bombed by the British or American planes.</span> <span id="s1008">Heavy guards.</span> <span id="s1009">But we had to clean or dig or whatever we had to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: When you came to Sachsenhauser, when was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: October ’44.</span> <span id="s1012">We were about one month in Sachsenhausen, or maybe six weeks, I don’t remember, I have to look it up.</span> <span id="s1013">Dates are hard to remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Tape 2, Side 1 When we came to Bremen we were unloaded near the harbor and we were put, not near the harbor, maybe an hour from where they build the submarines and these things, A small camp with a very cool SS commander who hanged some people there, every day they were hanging.</span> <span id="s1015">I remember that especially.</span> <span id="s1016">And every morning at 5 0’clock we were put on a little barge, ice cold, and we were brought to the place of work because it was an hour away.</span> <span id="s1017">We had to work there.</span> <span id="s1018">I worked as a plumber or a locksmith, I don’t remember what I did.</span> <span id="s1019">I can’t remember exactly what I did any more.</span> <span id="s1020">But I worked.</span> <span id="s1021">And there were German men who were the people who worked all the time and we had to help them.</span> <span id="s1022">And some of them were very nice and others would report your number to the SS and at night you came to the camp and they would call you out and you got twenty- five on your behind.</span> <span id="s1023">You never knew when, you see.</span> <span id="s1024">So I only later on I was put in charge of the Jewish barrack and one day I came back from work, the SS commander told me that he had found a knife in my barrack and I would get twenty five on my behind.</span> <span id="s1025">And every man of the room got ten and every single Jew got one.</span> <span id="s1026">But I got twenty- five and you had to count.</span> <span id="s1027">You didn’t count you got the whip.</span> <span id="s1028">It was given to me by a Polish kapo, there were two Russians.</span> <span id="s1029">They were the worst Jew haters I ever see in my life.</span> <span id="s1030">They were Russian prisoners.</span> <span id="s1031">Later on before this camp was liquidated, these two Russian prisoners were stoned to death by the other prisoners.</span> <span id="s1032">And when Bremen came to an end, we again went on transport and went to Bergen-Belsen, the inferno of infernos.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: Do you remember when you got to Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: We got to Bergen-Belsen approximately the end of March, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: Of ’45?</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: So you were in Bremen from late ’44 to early ’45?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1039">Bremen was the worst I’ve seen besides Minsk.</span> <span id="s1040">Thirty thousand dead bodies on the ground.</span> <span id="s1041">Only because I was still able to work we transported, the Germans wanted to clean up that camp, and we had to transport the dead bodies, decomposed bodies, to the mass grave that day, and all of a sudden only _______ and you couldn’t get out of line, and my best friend Kurt Spitzkopf, with whom I went together all the time from Minsk, all of a sudden, while we were, he said, Heinz, there’s my mother.</span> <span id="s1042">His mother was killed in Minsk.</span> <span id="s1043">I said, good, your mother is dead.</span> <span id="s1044">My mother is dead, my mother (sound effect of machine gun), you couldn’t stop him.</span> <span id="s1045">So most of the people from my commando died in Minsk.</span> <span id="s1046">But when we were liberated in Minsk we were about, I think 10 people left from the 250 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: You mean liberated Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: Yeah, Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: When were you liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: April 15, 1945.</span> <span id="s1051">I was 75 pounds, typhus, blood clot, TB.</span> <span id="s1052">I only saw the British tank coming in and then I collapsed.</span> <span id="s1053">I was very very sick.</span> <span id="s1054">It took a year and a half to recuperate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: So you went to Sweden after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: No, you see, then when the camp was liberated and the British came in they didn’t know what to do with these people.</span> <span id="s1057">So first they had to eliminate all the dead people and then they opened the SS barracks and the soldiers and they made temporary hospitals.</span> <span id="s1058">We were so sick.</span> <span id="s1059">Most people died.</span> <span id="s1060">Ten thousand people died after liberation.</span> <span id="s1061">So I was lucky and they brought me to this hospital.</span> <span id="s1062">My legs were like this, with blood clots, you know.</span> <span id="s1063">But, one day a British doctor came and they called a very expert and he said no, no, it’s not so bad he will live.</span> <span id="s1064">That’s what I understood.</span> <span id="s1065">But then one day the British came around about in May or the beginning of June and said there are transports to Sweden, and we will put you on the transport.</span> <span id="s1066">So when they asked me what is your nationality, I thought I would be proud and say I am a German Jew.</span> <span id="s1067">He said no German Jews because we don’t know if you’re a Jew or not.</span> <span id="s1068">I said I’m a Jew, my name is Rosenberg.</span> <span id="s1069">No, no.</span> <span id="s1070">So the next time they came around I was a little smarter.</span> <span id="s1071">Said, what is your name Uh, huh.</span> <span id="s1072">What is your nationality?</span> <span id="s1073">Stateless?</span> <span id="s1074">Uh huh.</span> <span id="s1075">So they shipped me to Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: So they wouldn’t take German Jews to Sweden?</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1078">Not in the beginning because they were not sure.</span> <span id="s1079">You see they thought maybe these SS people, they couldn’t be sure.</span> <span id="s1080">The Polish could speak Polish, the French talked French, the Italians speak Italian.</span> <span id="s1081">I couldn’t speak.</span> <span id="s1082">My broken English.</span> <span id="s1083">Ve vant bread, yah.</span> <span id="s1084">You know, you see I didn’t know at that time.</span> <span id="s1085">So they took us to Sweden.</span> <span id="s1086">I was unconscious, but when I came to Sweden I never forget that and I saw all these blond Swedish people, they all volunteer.</span> <span id="s1087">Sweden took in 30,000 people.</span> <span id="s1088">They emptied out the schools, the hospitals.</span> <span id="s1089">I don’t know how many America took in.</span> <span id="s1090">I don’t know how many of Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1091">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1092">Switzerland took some and sent them back to Germany.</span> <span id="s1093">But when I saw these nurses I thought this is the entrance to heaven.</span> <span id="s1094">I thought really these long tents must be the entrance to heaven because I was conscious and unconscious.</span> <span id="s1095">And these nurses looked at me and they said Swedish language, look at the little boy here.</span> <span id="s1096">They knew there was nothing here nothing there, 75 or 80 pounds at that time.</span> <span id="s1097">But what happened at Bergen-Belsen, coming back to the registration in Flossenberg, my cousin, Albert Hottenberg just called, he was a high officer under Eisenhower and he liberated Buchenwald and Dachau and when he came to Flossenberg and he saw this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: He saw your name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: He looked for Rosenberg, he Heinz Rosenberg (sound effects) and it says Heinz Rosenberg shipped to here.</span> <span id="s1100">And he traced me to Sachsenhausen and from Sachsenhausen he was able to Bremen and Bremen.</span> <span id="s1101">Not that he saw me in person, but he knew I’m either dead in Bergen-Belsen or alive.</span> <span id="s1102">So we were in these big rooms from the German soldiers.</span> <span id="s1103">I couldn’t walk.</span> <span id="s1104">I had diarrhea.</span> <span id="s1105">I couldn’t get out of bed.</span> <span id="s1106">So I heard somebody shouting outside.</span> <span id="s1107">Hey Rosenberg.</span> <span id="s1108">But you know I couldn’t go to the window, nobody could.</span> <span id="s1109">I come to America a couple of years later, I get in contact with my cousin, my other cousin said Albert lives in Baltimore.</span> <span id="s1110">One day my wife and I go to Washington to see Otto and we go to Baltimore to see my cousin Albert and he says Heinz, I don’t understand you were in Bergen-Belsen, didn’t you hear me with a loud speaker in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1111">I was very sick, I didn’t hear anybody.</span> <span id="s1112">I went there with an army jeep with three American soldiers with a big loud speaker calling for Heinz Rosenberg.</span> <span id="s1113">I would have taken you to Gottingen and made you the Mayor of Gottingen.</span> <span id="s1114">Honestly that is what he wanted to do.</span> <span id="s1115">He was in command.</span> <span id="s1116">He had the whole district.</span> <span id="s1117">He was a high officer under Eisenhower, because he had jumped while still the war was going on over Gottingen in German uniform.</span> <span id="s1118">He was a typical German.</span> <span id="s1119">My cousin is a good tall looking man, typical German.</span> <span id="s1120">He was German.</span> <span id="s1121">So, I didn’t meet him there, but I met him here.</span> <span id="s1122">And we are still very good friends.</span> <span id="s1123">But this other coincidence in life only because the Germans took my card and file did he find me.</span> <span id="s1124">It’s unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1125">But you see, this here what I am giving you is all written here in this book, and I will give you a book.</span> <span id="s1126">And, you see, it is very very impossible to explain all the cruelties and all the tragedies and all that went on in these camps because the normal person cannot feel and understand what went on.</span> <span id="s1127">I happen to be a man who went through thirteen camps.</span> <span id="s1128">Sometimes I think I’m not really alive, it’s a dream that I am still here.</span> <span id="s1129">I wasn’t supposed to live.</span> <span id="s1130">I was in front of machine guns, I was in gas chambers, we were put out again in _______.</span> <span id="s1131">You can read all this.</span> <span id="s1132">To tell you my story is not important, but to tell you the story of the six million Jews and fourteen million Russians and Polish and other people who have been killed.</span> <span id="s1133">It is absolutely a necessity that the world should know what happened.</span> <span id="s1134">Only by knowing the facts can we build a better world.</span> <span id="s1135">If we don’t do it, the world will blow itself up.</span> <span id="s1136">And I don’t care if you are a Jew or gentile, black, white, yellow, whatever you are, I don’t care, I don’t mean you in person, the people you see.</span> <span id="s1137">If the world doesn’t realize that this hatred and this crime and this dirt has to stop, then they will destroy themselves.</span> <span id="s1138">I am at the age, maybe I’m lucky, I have another fifteen years, it’s not so important.</span> <span id="s1139">But, for my children and grandchildren and for all the children and grandchildren in this world there should be some kind of more understanding from all the peoples to know what went on.</span> <span id="s1140">It’s very hard to, you know, what should I tell you, how people starve to death, it wouldn’t make sense.</span> <span id="s1141">This you can read in books.</span> <span id="s1142">I can only tell you my story and my story is not important.</span> <span id="s1143">I am alive.</span> <span id="s1144">But the story of my parents, my sister, my first wife, all my friends, all the Jews from Hamburg, all the Jews from Minsk, all the peoples from all the other concentration camps, they put them at the knife for punishment, in the trees gallows, they hanged them, in Bremen they hanged them, all over they gassed them.</span> <span id="s1145">I am one of the few people who can talk about it.</span> <span id="s1146">I have a very good memory.</span> <span id="s1147">I hold this book in order that people should know what went on, that’s why I am willing to give you this book.</span> <span id="s1148">I didn’t write it for myself, I know the stories, I was there.</span> <span id="s1149">But the people who were not there, they should learn from it, you see, otherwise we will destroy ourselves.</span> <span id="s1150">This hatred has to stop somewhere and there is still tremendous hatred in this world.</span> <span id="s1151">Tremendous hatred and jealousy, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s1152">So I am trying to do my little part in order to bring a little bit of more understanding and peace to this world.</span> <span id="s1153">That the whole story.</span> <span id="s1154">I am an expert on concentration camps, unfortunately.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: You have been to more, I think, than anybody I’ve ever interviewed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: I really sometimes honestly and truly ask myself how come I am alive and everybody else didn’t make it.</span> <span id="s1157">But it’s really like a little ______ going through all these big naps and then all of a sudden one or two or three people are left over.</span> <span id="s1158">We are eighteen people, I give you the list of the German Jews who are still alive.</span> <span id="s1159">Some died already.</span> <span id="s1160">One girl died now in Australia last year.</span> <span id="s1161">Martin Stock died in Hamburg many years ago.</span> <span id="s1162">So it’s getting less, you know.</span> <span id="s1163">That’s why, we the witnesses, it’s very important, and I hope that when they build this Holocaust Museum in Washington, and here too, you see when I write to them they don’t answer.</span> <span id="s1164">You see, they have a very peculiar nasty attitude.</span> <span id="s1165">If you are not Mr. Wiesel, they think you are nobody.</span> <span id="s1166">And I don’t agree with them.</span> <span id="s1167">I offered them my book.</span> <span id="s1168">Here they build a Holocaust Memorial to ______ I wrote to them, they don’t even answer.</span> <span id="s1169">So I figure they can kiss me, you understand.</span> <span id="s1170">I wrote to Washington.</span> <span id="s1171">There was a big do in Washington a couple of years ago and I went there because I thought I would meet someone from Minsk.</span> <span id="s1172">Nobody there.</span> <span id="s1173">You see you have to understand something, that being in prison is one thing and being in private life is another thing.</span> <span id="s1174">Many people use it to become famous, to make money out of it.</span> <span id="s1175">When I wrote my book I wrote to Mr. Wiesel, I said Sir, here is a book maybe you can combine these facts with one of your stories or collect them, or something because your name is better known than mine.</span> <span id="s1176">Never an answer.</span> <span id="s1177">At least have the decency and answer.</span> <span id="s1178">But even the Holocaust Memorial, nobody answers.</span> <span id="s1179">(Yiddish expression).</span> <span id="s1180">I sent them the books and I met many Israeli Jews.</span> <span id="s1181">I think I would not have the good nerve, I wouldn’t have survived.</span> <span id="s1182">I slept whenever I had the chance.</span> <span id="s1183">I can take tremendous pressure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: You stayed in Sweden until ’49 and then you came to America in ’49.</span> <span id="s1185">Now I’ve got basically, your brother’s story up until he left for England.</span> <span id="s1186">Now what was your brother’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: Curt Egon Rosenberg and later on he was known under Edgar M. Roberts in England.</span> <span id="s1188">That’s why I went to Roberts, he didn’t want to go back to his old name.</span> <span id="s1189">He was born June 4, 1915.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: Now, after Kristallnacht, you said……</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: He was taken to Sachsenhausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: Taken to Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s1193">He was there for about five months, three or four months?</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: I think he came back in February, maybe February or March.</span> <span id="s1195">I can’t remember exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: He was born in Gottingen too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: Everybody.</span> <span id="s1198">The family goes back to 1600.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: O.K.</span> <span id="s1200">What happened after when he got stamped, red stamped on his passport saying he had to leave the country?</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: If you don’t leave, you have to go back to prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: So he left?</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: He was able to get to the Kitchener camp in England.</span> <span id="s1204">It was called Kitchener camp because it was a Lord Kitchener who had opened this for the German young Jews.</span> <span id="s1205">I think they took in about 200 or 300, 500 people, I have no idea how many.</span> <span id="s1206">I cannot tell you I wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s1207">Maybe 2,000, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1208">They had to do farm work and garden work, things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: And he then, he changed his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">A: No.</span> <span id="s1211">When he volunteered when the war started, he volunteered for the British Army, and he had to take a British sounding name, English sounding name.</span> <span id="s1212">They gave him the name, you know with new identity papers.</span> <span id="s1213">He became automatically an English citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: He fought in the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: What did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: I have no idea.</span> <span id="s1218">He was a soldier, I don’t know, I couldn’t tell you.</span> <span id="s1219">He never talked about it.</span> <span id="s1220">I didn’t ask him either.</span> <span id="s1221">The war was over when I met him.</span> <span id="s1222">I wasn’t interested in war any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: And he remained in England after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: Yes, yes, he died in England.</span> <span id="s1225">He died when he was 60 years old, it was in 1975, heart attack.</span> <span id="s1226">I was talking on the telephone with my aunt, bang, out!</span> <span id="s1227">He was only 60 years old.</span> <span id="s1228">He was married, he had no children.</span> <span id="s1229">They had a little factory and he was doing very well.</span> <span id="s1230">Hard working.</span> <span id="s1231">We saw each other each year.</span> <span id="s1232">We visited each other each year, either I went there or he came here.</span> <span id="s1233">We were very close.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: Let me ask you about your parents.</span> <span id="s1235">Start with your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: My father was born February 21, 1881.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Q: And he was born where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: In Gottingen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: He was born in Gottingen.</span> <span id="s1240">And what was his full name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: Fritz Alexander Rosenberg.</span> <span id="s1242">He and his two brothers Otto and Arens inherited the factory from his father who died 1917, I think, because all the five sons were in the war.</span> <span id="s1243">He was born in 1849.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: This was the linen factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1246">My grandfather had started it, my grandfather.</span> <span id="s1247">(aside: that’s the man I talked to, he is now in Texas.)</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: He worked in Gottingen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: He owned the factory with his own two brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: And they all ran the factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">A: Different parts.</span> <span id="s1252">You know, one was in the office, the other was running the factory, my father was traveling for sales.</span> <span id="s1253">My father was basically for sales.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: And he mostly sold around Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: Mostly in Hamburg, and the big cities.</span> <span id="s1256">Mostly big contracts from the ship companies, the military, things like this.</span> <span id="s1257">Hospitals, you know wherever you need linen with names and things like this.</span> <span id="s1258">Big orders.</span> <span id="s1259">And then the depression came and then the business went sour, you know.</span> <span id="s1260">In the depression, America too at the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: Do you remember when your parents got married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: They got married 1913, November 9, 1913.</span> <span id="s1263">That was a tragedy that we were deported on November 9.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: On the same time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: That’s why I remember the date extremely well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: The factory was seized in 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: Yes, 1933.</span> <span id="s1268">Gottingen was one of the worst Nazi cities, like all university cities.</span> <span id="s1269">Heidelberg, Gottingen, all the universities.</span> <span id="s1270">Nazism was the greatest.</span> <span id="s1271">And it was the students, you see, the students and we had the military garrisons there.</span> <span id="s1272">This was altogether the reason for this.</span> <span id="s1273">The smaller the cities, the more anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s1274">And Berlin wasn’t that bad and Hamburg wasn’t that bad but the smaller the cities, more the hatred.</span> <span id="s1275">And all the Jews in Gottingen were well off in comparison to others.</span> <span id="s1276">They were the store owners, the lawyers, the doctors, the business people, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: Do you remember any instances of overt anti-Semitism by German citizens?</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: No, I was too small.</span> <span id="s1279">You know my father would come home and say, “ah, ah, look at these stupid people, I give them four weeks, they will be out.”</span> <span id="s1280">That was his attitude.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: You mean the Nazis, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1283">They will never do anything to us, we are here since 1600.</span> <span id="s1284">I could only trace them to 1700 when I went back now because all cemeteries and everything had been destroyed.</span> <span id="s1285">You know, there is almost nobody left now.</span> <span id="s1286">It doesn’t make much sense now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: And you were all deported in ’38?</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: No, in ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1290">You were made to leave, let’s see, your house and you moved to Hamburg in 1934.</span> <span id="s1291">Did your father do anything in particular when you moved, after Kristallnacht until you were deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: No, he didn’t work after ’36, he couldn’t work any more after ’36.</span> <span id="s1293">We were helped by an uncle of mine who was a millionaire, on my mother’s side, by the Jewish Committee and my brother, sister helped also.</span> <span id="s1294">My father had no money since ’36.</span> <span id="s1295">Everything was taken away</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: O.K., then in ’41 you were deported to Minsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: All together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: You all remained in Minsk until you left in ’43, in September?</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: The ghetto I left September 1, 1943 and I was shipped to Treblinka September 14, ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: Do you know what happened to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: Well, they were still alive at that time, but as I know from other people who survived, that the ghetto was liquidated September 28, ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q: So not long after you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: Two weeks later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: Do you know what they did with these people, were they gassed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">A: Most probably gassed.</span> <span id="s1306">Either gassed or shot.</span> <span id="s1307">It doesn’t make any difference.</span> <span id="s1308">They were told that they would be shipped back to Germany.</span> <span id="s1309">See, the SS always put on a phony excuse to get the people into the cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: You know, I didn’t ask you.</span> <span id="s1311">You were married in Minsk?</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: Do you remember, what was the date of that?</span> <span id="s1314">I think you said it was 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: No, September ’42.</span> <span id="s1316">On a Sunday, September ’42, we finally arranged for the wedding.</span> <span id="s1317">It must be September ’42.</span> <span id="s1318">I’m sorry I don’t have the date.</span> <span id="s1319">Fifty years ago, you know I couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: The other thing I also did not ask you, can you describe the ghetto in Minsk a little bit, describe how big it was, how it was guarded, the fences, things like that?</span> <span id="s1321">We did a little bit, like where you stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: I will give you a plan later on.</span> <span id="s1323">The ghetto was very big.</span> <span id="s1324">We only knew, I only knew the German part of the ghetto, especially where the red house and the white house was where we came in first.</span> <span id="s1325">There was two different parts for the German, Austrian and Czech Jews.</span> <span id="s1326">We never entered the Russian ghettos.</span> <span id="s1327">We were divided by barbed wire.</span> <span id="s1328">We were not even permitted to talk to them.</span> <span id="s1329">Later on it wasn’t so bad.</span> <span id="s1330">We talked to them, the SS didn’t say much.</span> <span id="s1331">We exchanged goods because the Russian Jews were able to get much more food ‘cause they lived there, they knew the people against us and the people would trade their coats and their clothes.</span> <span id="s1332">We were starving, you see.</span> <span id="s1333">And actually, their kids themselves because they had nothing to wear any more.</span> <span id="s1334">So the ghetto was very big.</span> <span id="s1335">It was surrounded by barbed wire completely and there were SS guards on the outside, on the inside were the Jewish guards and every man at a certain time had to make two hours at night guard duty.</span> <span id="s1336">This was not only for people to get in but also for Jews not to run into the wire or do crazy things.</span> <span id="s1337">You see, the Jewish commander thought it would be better to have law and order in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1338">Not to aggravate the German SS or they would shoot right away.</span> <span id="s1339">And the man who was in charge of this German/Jewish force is the one who was later on sent back to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: Oh right, the man you were telling me about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: But he did a good job.</span> <span id="s1342">I mean the SS got in every day.</span> <span id="s1343">Anybody could kill a Jew.</span> <span id="s1344">I mean on the holidays they would just shoot anybody that came to them.</span> <span id="s1345">It meant nothing.</span> <span id="s1346">A dog was more valuable than a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: Let me ask you about your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: My mother was born February 21, 1891, in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s1349">Her maiden name was Herz.</span> <span id="s1350">Her first name was Else.</span> <span id="s1351">She had a brother and a sister and her father was still alive.</span> <span id="s1352">He died, my grandfather died 1934, natural death.</span> <span id="s1353">But she had a brother and a sister and the brother was taken to prison because of having an affair with a German lady, which was against the law.</span> <span id="s1354">In the end my aunt was shipped to Theresienstadt in ‘43 and then to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1355">By the way, my grandmother who lived in Gottingen up to 1943, was 84 they shipped her to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: Do you have a picture of her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: Yes, I have one picture of my grandmother, she was a very courageous lady.</span> <span id="s1358">And I heard from a letter I got from my uncle that my aunt was a real hero.</span> <span id="s1359">Let me se if I have a picture from my grandmother.</span> <span id="s1360">I thought I had one.</span> <span id="s1361">I have to find it.</span> <span id="s1362">Let me see for one moment.</span> <span id="s1363">Maybe I don’t have it any more.</span> <span id="s1364">I don’t see it right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: What did her father do for a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: Who, my mothers?</span> <span id="s1367">He was in export/import business of grain.</span> <span id="s1368">The grain business.</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">Q: Did he have his own business?</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1371">Together with his son.</span> <span id="s1372">But when the son took over in ’34, there were already restrictions on Jews having businesses.</span> <span id="s1373">So little, by little, all the Herz family was in the grain business.</span> <span id="s1374">It was a big family too.</span> <span id="s1375">The Rosenberg were a big family, family, the Herz were a big family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">Q: Is there anything you remember particularly that stands out about something that happened to your mother that might be significant, other than what we already talked about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">A: My mother in Hamburg, Gottingen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q: Anything, especially from ’33 on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: My mother was a very courageous lady who was a very good cook, a very good housewife.</span> <span id="s1380">She could make anything out of nothing.</span> <span id="s1381">She was educated in Lausanne, spoke perfect French, was much more educated than my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: Did she go to college, to a university?</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: She went to a special, how do they call this, a special school for ladies at that time in Lausanne.</span> <span id="s1384">She was very well educated.</span> <span id="s1385">She spoke perfect French, my father didn’t speak any languages but he had a factory.</span> <span id="s1386">But they were matched up.</span> <span id="s1387">This was not a love story.</span> <span id="s1388">At that time, you know, I have a good man.</span> <span id="s1389">It was different at that time.</span> <span id="s1390">But they had a very good life and I don’t know how happy they were, I cannot tell you.</span> <span id="s1391">I was a small boy.</span> <span id="s1392">There were a lot of fights when the factory went broke because my mother was used to a plentiful life and money and all of a sudden there was no money.</span> <span id="s1393">These I remember the fights between my parents.</span> <span id="s1394">But she was a very courageous lady in Germany.</span> <span id="s1395">I must say, honestly, I think most of all I have to say one thing, both of my parents were very very fair and understanding people, very modern, very outgoing, gave us, the children, a very very good upbringing and education.</span> <span id="s1396">This was more than most people do for their children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: And you told me about some of the period.</span> <span id="s1398">I just needed some for background.</span> <span id="s1399">O.K., how about your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: My sister, I feel in a certain way sorry for my sister because she died very young.</span> <span id="s1401">You see, when I look at my parents, I am sorry they died, but they had already a certain amount of life behind them.</span> <span id="s1402">My sister was very young.</span> <span id="s1403">When she was murdered in ’43, she was about, she was born in ’17, 26 years old.</span> <span id="s1404">She had never experienced the joys of life.</span> <span id="s1405">She had no boyfriend, there was no hope, she had no beautiful clothes, or anything, nothing.</span> <span id="s1406">Not only had Hitler turned against us, the whole world had turned against us.</span> <span id="s1407">Because she could have been saved, she was a very hard working girl, but she never had real joys.</span> <span id="s1408">I don’t think she ever had a real boyfriend, I mean yes, but nothing really steady or something like this.</span> <span id="s1409">And when she was, I know if she was murdered, the same with my parents or my first wife, Erica.</span> <span id="s1410">The young people, I feel more, much more sad about them than, you know, it’s one thing if I would have to go today, I would say O.K., like my wife passed away six years ago, O.K. I have so many years left but if something would happen to my son or to my daughter, or to my grandchildren would be much worse.</span> <span id="s1411">Because the life is in front of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Q: What was your sister’s full name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">A: Irmgard Rosenberg.</span> <span id="s1414">She was born in June 16, 1917.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: Did she also go to public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: Yes, we all went to public school.</span> <span id="s1417">In Germany you had to go to school.</span> <span id="s1418">You had to go to school, there was no way out of it, they would force you to go to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: And when did they kick you all out of school again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: My sister and my brother left school when we came to Hamburg.</span> <span id="s1421">She was about 16 or 17 years.</span> <span id="s1422">My brother was already 19.</span> <span id="s1423">He already worked Gottenberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">Q: You said she worked as a salesperson?</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">A: A sales apprentice, a company called Helfand in Hamburg, not there any more, also Jewish company.</span> <span id="s1426">You see, in ’33 and ’34, it was hard to get jobs in gentile companies, you had to work in Jewish companies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: Is there anything again, we’ve talked a little bit about.</span> <span id="s1428">She was obviously with the rest of your family, that you remember about her that sticks out in your mind from those years, from ’33 on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: My sister was a very very good person, she was too good and too, like all of us, we were all brought up with this honesty and decency and fairness.</span> <span id="s1430">Like it was done that way and especially in traditional Jewish families.</span> <span id="s1431">And she lived at home and she had no boyfriend, if she went out to movies with my brother or if she went with a boy my brother would go along.</span> <span id="s1432">It was a different lifestyle.</span> <span id="s1433">But she was a very, we got along very well, my sister and I.</span> <span id="s1434">She was a very good person.</span> <span id="s1435">Anything outstanding?</span> <span id="s1436">No, but she liked to dance and she liked music and she liked all the good things in life, but it never came through.</span> <span id="s1437">It was a tragedy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: Did any of the, like the deprivations of your going to Minsk, was there anything in particular that she got upset about.</span> <span id="s1439">You know what I mean, that really bothered her about the situation you were in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">A: We all did not expect, none of us expected to be murdered.</span> <span id="s1441">Everybody, you know when you have people, when you are sick or when you are drowning in water or when you are in a fire, you, the person, hopes that you will be saved.</span> <span id="s1442">Understand?</span> <span id="s1443">Everybody, everybody, including myself, always try, there are so many sicknesses behind me.</span> <span id="s1444">I don’t want to talk about my private life.</span> <span id="s1445">Everybody will always try and think that he will be the one who will be saved.</span> <span id="s1446">And everybody looks into a mirror and thinks that he is the best person or the best looking person or the tallest person or the honest person.</span> <span id="s1447">He might be the biggest crook but he thinks he is honest.</span> <span id="s1448">So you see what really went on in the mind of my sister, I honestly cannot tell you.</span> <span id="s1449">I cannot tell you of my father.</span> <span id="s1450">I know my father was an outspoken optimist and “they don’t mean us, we only work there.”</span> <span id="s1451">And certainly all of us expected us to work and after the war go back home.</span> <span id="s1452">You could not imagine that this cruelty, this mass murder would exist.</span> <span id="s1453">It was abnormal for the world.</span> <span id="s1454">I mean I remember that in Turkey in 1940, my father told us and my uncle Philip, my father would talk about the first World War, about ______ what they saw there, they were young and then the Germans, they fought the Frenchmen.</span> <span id="s1455">Ooh, ________ my uncle would say.</span> <span id="s1456">These French people, they must be ______.</span> <span id="s1457">All nonsense, they killed each other for nothing.</span> <span id="s1458">That whole killing is nonsense.</span> <span id="s1459">There goes a soldier and kills someone, doesn’t know who he kills.</span> <span id="s1460">You take a knife and you want to kill me, I will try to kill you first.</span> <span id="s1461">All nonsense, war.</span> <span id="s1462">Makes for the politicians, for big people, not for the poor people.</span> <span id="s1463">This goes back for thousands of years.</span> <span id="s1464">The kings always defer, the general always stood behind that you go.</span> <span id="s1465">He didn’t go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">Q: Would you like to talk about your uncle?</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A: No, it’s too far.</span> <span id="s1468">There comes a point where you have to stop.</span> <span id="s1469">I mean, I could go on with my family.</span> <span id="s1470">There are so many people who were killed and murdered and suicide, it comes too far.</span> <span id="s1471">He was a very good man, very poor when he comes to America.</span> <span id="s1472">Died of cancer.</span> <span id="s1473">The funny stories when he was in the hospital in San Francisco and my brother came from England to visit him once more.</span> <span id="s1474">He visited him and he couldn’t talk, they had to put a tube in his throat, and the doctor said to us, give him a week, that’s it.</span> <span id="s1475">You call us.</span> <span id="s1476">Well, one day I was working and my wife called me and she said Henry there is a telegram from San Francisco, uncle Philip had passed away.</span> <span id="s1477">Sorry to hear that.</span> <span id="s1478">So I called the hospital at night when I come home.</span> <span id="s1479">I said this is Henry Robertson, I hear my uncle, Mr. Philip Herz passed away, so whoever was on the phone said, if you wait a minute, would you like to talk to him?</span> <span id="s1480">Pardon me, talk to him, I cannot understand it.</span> <span id="s1481">So, he couldn’t talk, but he put the thing, he could talk.</span> <span id="s1482">He said “hello.”</span> <span id="s1483">I said Philip, what are you doing?</span> <span id="s1484">Well, I’m sleeping.</span> <span id="s1485">I motioned, I understand that he is dead.</span> <span id="s1486">Let me see the telegram.</span> <span id="s1487">What they wrote, Uncle Philip is dying, we need $400 to bury him.</span> <span id="s1488">You see, but my wife was so excited that she thought he’s dying.</span> <span id="s1489">He died twelve days later.</span> <span id="s1490">And then they couldn’t bury him and I called the funeral parlor, this is a true story, I said this is Mr. Robertson in New York, I want to send you the money.</span> <span id="s1491">Well, he said, don’t worry your uncle is happily on ice, he cannot be buried because we can only bury him when the money comes from Social Security.</span> <span id="s1492">I’ll send you the money.</span> <span id="s1493">No, no, it has to be proper.</span> <span id="s1494">He was four weeks happily on ice before they buried him.</span> <span id="s1495">An unbelievable story.</span> <span id="s1496">There is no feeling.</span> <span id="s1497">That’s why I do and I considered it my duty to tell everybody who wants to listen to it that whatever happened in the Holocaust, can never happen again.</span> <span id="s1498">And I will do my damn best when I talk to people I always tell them whatever they want to hear.</span> <span id="s1499">Most people don’t want to hear about it.</span> <span id="s1500">I can’t take it, you know.</span> <span id="s1501">I say you should hear about it so you know what’s going on.</span></p></body></html>
