id="s4">Question: Can do it a little louder, maybe?</span></p> <p><span id="s5">Answer: [inaudible] because it gets louder later.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Q: But if you want, you can tell me a little bit about what -- why -- why do you like this one, or what is it, actually?</span></p> <p><span id="s7">A: This is a Chopin concerto, and I grew up in Poland, and Chopin, of course, was of Polish origin and I grew up on his music.</span> <span id="s8">I -- my background was -- my parents loved music and they cultivated music in the house, and most of it was classical music, with a sprinkling of some new music, not to the extent that today’s music, but for instance, Gershwin was -- “Rhapsody in Blue” came out in 1938 or ’39, and -- just prior to the war, and we loved it.</span> <span id="s9">It was diff -- but -- it was different.</span> <span id="s10">That was the first time that I listened to Gershwin.</span> <span id="s11">And -- but Chopin was just part of my upbringing.</span> <span id="s12">Tchaikovsky, Cacciatore, and Rachmaninoff, very romantic.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: Okay, good.</span> <span id="s14">That was -- that was nice, very romantic, that was nice.</span> <span id="s15">Good.</span> <span id="s16">Okay, let me see.</span> <span id="s17">Let’s not make it extremely formal, let’s just go right to the difficult subject matter.</span> <span id="s18">Tell me -- us a little bit more about the time either just prior to liberation, or the moment of liberation.</span> <span id="s19">What -- what happened, what -- what -- wh -- who were you, where were you, what kind of state were you in, what -- what was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Well, prior to the liberation we were in barrack.</span> <span id="s21">We were --</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: I’m sorry, yeah, could we -- could we do that again?</span> <span id="s23">There was the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s24">I have to find a way of holding the microphone.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: So at [indecipherable] prior -- prior --</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Prior?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Let’s see, it’s the little -- let me see.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Prior?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Yeah, that’s better.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Prior to the liberation, we were locked in a barracks and the windows were shut and they were supposed -- supposedly trying to kill us, but there was not enough time, they had to escape because the Russian forces closed.</span> <span id="s32">And the sight through the locked shutters, we could see that the towers were empty, and the SS was gone.</span> <span id="s33">And this was the moment that we realized that they abandoned us.</span> <span id="s34">And that was April the 26th, I believe, of 1945.</span> <span id="s35">Since I was badly hurt, my friends were holding me, and broke the doors and ran to the kitchen, brought some margarine.</span> <span id="s36">We stuffed ourselves with the margarine, and we decided to leave the camp.</span> <span id="s37">Went across the street, there was the house that the commandant used to live, with the garden.</span> <span id="s38">There were several of us, one girl had her mother with, and somebody brought two eggs and two potatoes, and at that moment the commandant came back with a gun.</span> <span id="s39">And we were frozen stiff looking at him.</span> <span id="s40">And the poignant part was that he was afraid of us.</span> <span id="s41">And he disappeared.</span> <span id="s42">And we decided to leave.</span> <span id="s43">My friends were helping me.</span> <span id="s44">We went through the fields, there was a great deal of firework -- not firework, fire stemming from the war.</span> <span id="s45">They were being bombarded, and we ran.</span> <span id="s46">We joined with two Polish men who worked there in the fields.</span> <span id="s47">We reached the front line and first -- we saw the first Russian, and this was the -- suppose our liberation -- supposed liberation.</span> <span id="s48">Pretty soon we discovered that this was not the freedom that we were dreaming of.</span> <span id="s49">Freedom was very different.</span> <span id="s50">We thought of the normal -- normal life that will come of finding the family.</span> <span id="s51">It was very difficult period of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Could you -- could you say a little bit more about sort of the first impressions of the -- the liberators that you had?</span> <span id="s53">What was the condition at the -- at the fe -- you -- you went to the actual front line?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s55">It was actual front line because the war was still going on and the shooting was on both sides.</span> <span id="s56">As a matter of fact, one of the girls was hit.</span> <span id="s57">We just didn’t have time to look, we were running like an animal.</span> <span id="s58">The first Russian was of Asiatic origin because his face, the features were Asiatic.</span> <span id="s59">And he was very dirty, I remember his big, black leather boots, filthy uniform.</span> <span id="s60">He was the liberator, and we thought we should kiss his boots.</span> <span id="s61">He told us -- he motioned to us to go back, and the Russians gave us help.</span> <span id="s62">The help consisted of a barrel of herring.</span> <span id="s63">And we ate the herring, and of course the -- we be-became very thirsty, there was no water, the pipes were broken.</span> <span id="s64">And they told us to leave, my friends held me.</span> <span id="s65">We reached the first house in the village, the roof was gone from the bombardments.</span> <span id="s66">We went to the basement, the basement was very well prepared with food and sleeping equipment.</span> <span id="s67">We lay down -- we ate, we lay down, and the very same night, two Russians came, and raped two girls.</span> <span id="s68">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: I want -- I want to ask you --</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: -- something else before we -- we go on.</span> <span id="s72">Did you get any medical attention?</span> <span id="s73">Say a little bit more about th-the shape that you were in.</span> <span id="s74">You said you were badly hurt, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: -- did you get medical attention, anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Well, you have to understand the circumstances, the Russians were fighting, it was just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s78">I didn’t see anything there of -- of nor-normal food ration, or even [indecipherable] Red -- Red Cross.</span> <span id="s79">But they had some bandages and they gave me the bandages and I was bandaged around my body to hold my ribs.</span> <span id="s80">That’s all I remember.</span> <span id="s81">And when -- once we went to the basement, it was some sort of a trapdoor going down, which I wasn’t familiar with before.</span> <span id="s82">We went to the basement and one of the Russians was drunk.</span> <span id="s83">Wi -- he started to shoot at the jars which were lined on the shelves, and the pieces of -- pieces of the glass embedded in my left leg, and I was lying down on one of the two cots, and I ask one of the Polish men, please protect me.</span> <span id="s84">I -- when the times will be normal, I will give you -- my -- my mother, my family will give you anything in the world if you will help me.</span> <span id="s85">He covered me, and he sat down on me.</span> <span id="s86">And I was lying there and my leg was bleeding, but I didn’t make a sound.</span> <span id="s87">That was the night that two girls -- one was taken out, one was -- they blew the candle out and they raped her, and the other one came bloody back.</span> <span id="s88">This was my liberation.</span> <span id="s89">Very bitter.</span> <span id="s90">We wondered if this is -- i-if this was worth it, to survive to see this.</span> <span id="s91">The next day we left for the village, to another house.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: You -- you stayed -- you stayed in that village for a little while --</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: -- and you met other people there, and there were other episodes, but y -- it was -- it was still a dangerous, difficult situation.</span> <span id="s95">But did you experience any sense of -- of -- you had a little bit to eat, you had two Polish protectors, if you will.</span> <span id="s96">Did you experience any sense of -- of -- of freedom yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: No.</span> <span id="s98">The freedom was very bleak.</span> <span id="s99">I was petrified of the Russians now.</span> <span id="s100">So, after a couple of days, next house to ours was occupied by the former French prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s101">And I talked the them and they decided that they will take me to their house and protect me, and I stayed with them for quite awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Now, after awhile then, things changed, people started moving back to their native countries.</span> <span id="s103">Did you go to -- well is -- let me not ask as -- as such a question, what -- what happened after awhile then?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: Well naturally, I thought that my family survived.</span> <span id="s105">I was unaware that everybody was killed.</span> <span id="s106">So I wanted -- my first thought was going back to Poland.</span> <span id="s107">And there were some Polish people with some sort of equipment that they were going towards Poland and they had carts, and they took me -- they had Polish flag, and we went through Lignitz, I remember, and then -- the names escape me, but I know that we were in Lignitz, and we were in another city big, and that city was already organized, and people already had ration cards, and we slept in a place that we were assigned to.</span> <span id="s108">But I still wanted to go to my native city, and there was -- there was a train already, on one of the tracks, and I went with this train to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s109">And in Warsaw I got off the train, of course everything was without money and no possessions.</span> <span id="s110">A human being is very strong, unbelievably strong.</span> <span id="s111">And in Warsaw, I was just standing there with nothing and I saw a man with a s -- truck, and I ask him where he is going and he said he is going to Lódz, which was my city.</span> <span id="s112">And I ask him if he will take me, and he agreed.</span> <span id="s113">And that’s how I reached it.</span> <span id="s114">Warsaw was completely destroyed.</span> <span id="s115">There was -- I -- I had uncle and aunt, but I couldn’t find the streets.</span> <span id="s116">Everything was in ruins.</span> <span id="s117">So I was very glad that I was getting the ride, without money, which I didn’t have.</span> <span id="s118">He went -- we stopped in Lublin, I believe and he went out to eat and he left me in the car.</span> <span id="s119">And he came back, I think he brought a piece of bread, but I’m not too sure.</span> <span id="s120">I was hungry.</span> <span id="s121">We reached Lódz and -- of course, Lódz was not destroyed because it was occupied very quickly.</span> <span id="s122">And I tried to go to the place that we lived.</span> <span id="s123">I was not let in.</span> <span id="s124">The Polish people occupied our place.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Could you -- could you be a little more specific about that?</span> <span id="s126">You lived in a certain street --</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: -- and the house was still there?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: All the houses on our street were absolutely in perfect condition, because Lódz was occupied by the Germans, I believe on September sixth, maybe fifth of 1939.</span> <span id="s130">So the city had only the first day of bombing and it was not destroyed.</span> <span id="s131">And our house was standing, and the so-called superintendent was still the same one.</span> <span id="s132">And when he saw me, he thought that he -- that he saw a ghost.</span> <span id="s133">He said in Polish, how come I survived, why did I come back.</span> <span id="s134">This was the greeting I have -- received.</span> <span id="s135">When I wanted to go upstairs to our place, our apartment, the Lódz place, the people wouldn’t let me in.</span> <span id="s136">And I went down and the super said that the Germans own -- took everything out.</span> <span id="s137">The carpets, and whatever there was there, they took it out.</span> <span id="s138">So I went to -- two streets further.</span> <span id="s139">There was a -- some sort of a bureau that had information, people who came were putting down their names.</span> <span id="s140">And I looked through their list --</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Was it HIAS?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: I am not too sure if this was HIAS.</span> <span id="s143">Something to do with displaced person organization, but I -- I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s144">And I don’t want to say something that I’m not absolutely sure.</span> <span id="s145">And I looked for the names, there were no familiar names with the exception of one, which was my girlfriend.</span> <span id="s146">And my girlfriend survived in Lódz in hiding with -- with her husband.</span> <span id="s147">Her address was there, and I went to her.</span> <span id="s148">And I stayed with her for couple of weeks, and I decided since Poland didn’t want me, I don’t want Poland.</span> <span id="s149">And I decided to go back west.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Could you s -- so nobody from your entire family survived, at least at that time you -- that’s what you knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: At that time I -- I didn’t think anybody survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Say a little bit more about your decision to -- your feelings about Poland and about wanting to leave it.</span> <span id="s153">A little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: My feeling about Poland was very bitter.</span> <span id="s155">The Germans started the war, the Germans were the enemy.</span> <span id="s156">However, Poles were my countrymen.</span> <span id="s157">I grew up there, I loved the language.</span> <span id="s158">I loved the literature.</span> <span id="s159">I was, you may say patriotic.</span> <span id="s160">I had Polish girlfriends, and I thought on coming back that I will meet some people.</span> <span id="s161">I -- I was bitterly disappointed.</span> <span id="s162">That stems already from before, because when the war started, my friends didn’t come to see me.</span> <span id="s163">They could have in the beginning, before we went to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s164">But not having family left, and not wanting to contact any of my Polish ex-friends, my -- my idea was to leave Poland forever and ever.</span> <span id="s165">I didn’t want to have anything to do with Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: So you made your way, with a friend, to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Do you remember how long -- oh, do you remember, by the way, how long, roughly, it took you to get from the place you were liberated -- that was Ravensbrück, was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: I-I was liberated in Bittenberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: In Bittenberg, of course, I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: I was in Ravensbrück prior to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Yes, yes, i-in Bittenberg.</span> <span id="s173">How long did it take you on foot, on horse cart to get to Lódz, that’s such a --</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Well, no, we -- we went to Lignitz first from Bittenberg, that was not that far.</span> <span id="s175">From Lignitz we had a train to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s176">From Warsaw I was in that truck to Lódz.</span> <span id="s177">I cannot tell you exactly the frame of time that this occurred, but after two weeks being in Lódz, and my friend was with her husband, and I -- I just didn’t feel welcome.</span> <span id="s178">My po -- my Poland was not my Poland any more.</span> <span id="s179">I wrote -- I wrote a poem about it here in the States, that the fatherland didn’t love me.</span> <span id="s180">So I flaunted.</span> <span id="s181">I don’t want them any more.</span> <span id="s182">And I decided to move to Berlin because I was told that they had displaced person camps, run by the allied forces, and I thought maybe somebody survived there.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: So you made your way to Berlin -- you don’t have to go into -- into the story, although it is an interesting one, but for this purpose -- and sen -- so you arrived in Berlin, what was it like?</span> <span id="s184">What was Berlin like?</span> <span id="s185">What did you see when you arrived?</span> <span id="s186">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: It was very strange.</span> <span id="s188">We came -- we came with -- previously I told this story, that the Russian smuggled us to his cr -- train compartment, and we arrived in Berlin and he let us off at the station, and we were standing there, and sort of sizing people.</span> <span id="s189">And we saw two people, two young men who didn’t look -- appear to be Jewish, and we approached them and we asked them, and they said yes.</span> <span id="s190">And they gave us some fare in fennix, I don’t remember how much.</span> <span id="s191">And they put us on bus and they told us to get off ha -- was this Rickenstrasser, I don’t remember the first camp before Schlactensee.</span> <span id="s192">This was the very first one, it was in the Russian sector.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: You mentioned in the last interview, you said Oranienstrasse.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Oranien -- oran -- I don’t remember the name.</span> <span id="s195">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s196">But this was the very first camp, displaced person camp.</span> <span id="s197">And I was grateful for the help, but I didn’t want this type of -- I wanted privacy.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: But what -- what did -- what -- what did it look like, what -- what happened there?</span> <span id="s199">What -- what --</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: We were given places to sleep, we were given food, and I don’t remember too much about it, maybe because I’m getting older, mi -- things are sort of slowly blending and disappearing.</span> <span id="s201">I’m trying to remember the good things, and I’m trying to, maybe subconsciously forget the sad things.</span> <span id="s202">Maybe this helped me to live.</span> <span id="s203">The camp provide us with vital things that we needed to live.</span> <span id="s204">The two of us, my girlfriend and I, didn’t feel comfortable.</span> <span id="s205">We wanted some sort of a more normal life, so we were given a room by a German war widow.</span> <span id="s206">I still remember her name, Frau Beans.</span> <span id="s207">And she [indecipherable] and we were give a room, it was -- it was cold, I remember.</span> <span id="s208">We had a little stove in the middle of the floor that we made of coal or anthracite, to warm up.</span> <span id="s209">And we were given ration cards, and some Russians started to come to visit this aunt, and this -- and -- and the woman and her aunt, because they -- they -- they were given some food from the Russians.</span> <span id="s210">What did they do, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s211">We were very unhappy about that situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: It wasn’t normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: What was normal?</span> <span id="s215">What -- what did you want?</span> <span id="s216">What is it that you wanted, that you most needed?</span> <span id="s217">You were given the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: I wanted warmth, I wanted --</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Could you -- could you say that again?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: -- I wanted warmth.</span> <span id="s221">I wanted the -- the personal life, not to be in somebody’s room and behave and -- and make that piece of bread on this little stove, heat it up, and go for the ration with the card and stand on a line.</span> <span id="s222">I didn’t -- I didn’t expect my freedom to be of that sort.</span> <span id="s223">I -- I wanted to disassociate myself with all this.</span> <span id="s224">It was very bitter.</span> <span id="s225">To top this all, I saw in this German house, a Menorah, which her husband, who was killed in the war, sent her from one of the occupied countries.</span> <span id="s226">The woman had no idea what it was, but I saw a silver Menorah, and this broke my heart.</span> <span id="s227">After that, we had a little incident, we went to a movie house, which I described before.</span> <span id="s228">I did not want to stay in the Russian sector at all.</span> <span id="s229">My friend was a little bit enterprising, she got herself a boyfriend.</span> <span id="s230">I was petrified of everybody and everything.</span> <span id="s231">I just wanted to run away to American sector.</span> <span id="s232">And I went to the -- I think this was the Jewish HIAS, some Jewish committee in Cheplin, and I told him that I wanted to move, and he says I have to be registered.</span> <span id="s233">So I got from the -- from that organization some coffee Bonne café, and the Germans were crazy about Bonne café, so I took this Bonne café and I went to the German police station -- I really -- I -- I’m wondering now how -- how I could have done this, because I wasn’t well.</span> <span id="s234">And I asked the policeman if he would -- because everything, it was very organized already, you had to be registered, and live in this place, or this place.</span> <span id="s235">And I wanted desperately to leave the Russian sector and be in the American sector.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Why specifically the American sector?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Not specifically American, could have been English, or -- but I had some sort of relatives in America, so I felt that this would be maybe the closest.</span> <span id="s238">And that’s what I was advised also by that Joint, or HIAS.</span> <span id="s239">And I gave him the Bonne café, the German policeman took it, and put my name on list, and I got the room by Frau Pegiloft, town of Strasse [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s240">And Frau Pegiloft was a very old lady who at night locked her room because she was afraid of me.</span> <span id="s241">But after couple of weeks she warmed up to me, and I said, Frau Pegiloft -- because I could speak German, Frau Pegiloft, how was this the -- she said, “Ah, kvotch.</span> <span id="s242">I am the only Nazi left,” she said.</span> <span id="s243">“I was a Nazi, they all were Nazis.</span> <span id="s244">But now nobody says he was a Nazi and I’m the only one.</span> <span id="s245">I’m old, I don’t care any more.”</span> <span id="s246">So I stayed with Frau Pegiloft until the -- I received avonderong papers -- that means the paper to go to -- I think it was Bremenhaven.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Did you not stay a little while in -- in Schlactensee, and -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Oh, excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: That’s all right.</span> <span id="s250">Let’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s252">Yes, I was -- before Frau Pegiloft, I was in Schlactensee, you’re right.</span> <span id="s253">The policeman registered me in amer -- amer -- American sector and I went to Schlactensee.</span> <span id="s254">And I was in Schlactensee very short time, that’s why I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s255">I did -- I was not happy in Schlactensee.</span> <span id="s256">It --</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: What -- what was it?</span> <span id="s258">What was Schlactensee [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Schlactensee was again, they give you the basics.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: No, I mean, you -- you should -- you should say that it was di -- display --</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: It was a -- Schlactensee was a displaced person camp.</span> <span id="s262">And they had a lot of people already and people were very enterprising, they were used to the conditions, they had friends, they were going to Poland, they were bringing goods back and forth to Breslau, and Brotswaf.</span> <span id="s263">I could not partake in any of this, and all to me was very strange.</span> <span id="s264">I couldn’t eat the way people were buying something, sitting at a table and talking about business.</span> <span id="s265">I was lost.</span> <span id="s266">I didn’t feel good, I wanted to be in an -- in a room of my own, I wanted privacy.</span> <span id="s267">And that’s why I left Schlactensee.</span> <span id="s268">I went back to that police, and at that time I was getting, every month, some sort of ration from the Jewish committee.</span> <span id="s269">Coffee, some cigarettes, sometimes they had, sometimes they didn’t have it.</span> <span id="s270">But whatever I had, I swapped with this policeman, and I got the room by Frau Pegiloft.</span> <span id="s271">That’s how [indecipherable] Schlactensee.</span> <span id="s272">Pr-Proud to it.</span> <span id="s273">But a very short time, Schlactensee.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: And then eventually though, you did -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: And then eventually though, you did think about emigration.</span> <span id="s276">Say a little bit about that, how -- what -- what your thoughts were and where you decided you would have to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Well, at this time Israel was not an Israel yet, it was Palestine.</span> <span id="s278">I was -- my health was precarious to say the least.</span> <span id="s279">I was slowly healing.</span> <span id="s280">I did not feel that I -- I was not really brought up as a Zionist.</span> <span id="s281">I had the deep feeling, I still do, but I didn’t think that I would fit in that surrounding.</span> <span id="s282">I was unable to work.</span> <span id="s283">People had to work physically starting Israel, to build the country.</span> <span id="s284">My thoughts were about United States because I knew that I had some sort of relatives here.</span> <span id="s285">And that fact was brought to my attention by the chaplain, and one sergeant in the American army, in that Jewish committee.</span> <span id="s286">And they asked me for the name, and I said the name is Posalski, and after a few months I received a letter from Detroit and the name was changed from Posalski to Soles, and they located them.</span> <span id="s287">And this was my grand -- maternal grandmother’s sister, and there was a half-brother in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s288">And that family sponsored me to come to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: What -- what do you -- when did you leave -- so you left from Bremenhaven, I guess, when did you leave, and what do you remember about the boat trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: The boat trip was a nightmare.</span> <span id="s291">I wanted to die right on that boat.</span> <span id="s292">Strange.</span> <span id="s293">I was liberated, I was free, I was coming to the best country in the world.</span> <span id="s294">We were on Marine Marlin, this was an troop transporter.</span> <span id="s295">We were put down -- the people -- the displaced person people were -- having visas, they were sponsored, were put at the bottom of the boat.</span> <span id="s296">The top of the boat, the better deck, was reserved for German war brides.</span> <span id="s297">So there was another injustice done to us.</span> <span id="s298">We encountered very, very powerful storms, and our boat lost part of the bow.</span> <span id="s299">It was unbelievable, that trip.</span> <span id="s300">I don’t know what harm came to the boat, but I know that even the crew was sick.</span> <span id="s301">I was getting -- I was getting injections because I couldn’t eat.</span> <span id="s302">I was throwing up constantly, and it took us -- I don’t remember exactly, maybe 15 or 16 days on the boat to finally reach New York.</span> <span id="s303">So the freedom was -- it was something that I dreamt about, hoped for, envisioned, and it was so different and so bleak and so heartbreaking, that on that ship I said, I survived so many years under the German rule, concentration camps, I lost my family, I’m going to die in the middle of o -- the ocean.</span> <span id="s304">It’s ironic.</span> <span id="s305">But I didn’t.</span> <span id="s306">I reached New York, and I was met by --</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: How -- say --</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: -- some family member.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Say -- say -- that was a very -- in the last interview, a very moving way you described that when you arrived, what -- what -- what happened then.</span> <span id="s310">This whole thing --</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: Well, when we arrived, and we left the boat -- and we didn’t go to Ellis Island, we went to a pier -- there were benches, long benches and there were letters above, alphabetically, A-B-C and they told us to go to a letter that was corresponding with your last name.</span> <span id="s312">Since my name was Fisher, I went to letter F, and I was sitting there.</span> <span id="s313">And people were coming and picking up their relatives or friends.</span> <span id="s314">And I was sitting and sitting and sitting.</span> <span id="s315">And finally I saw a gentleman, a very distinguished looking gentleman walking by with a photo, showing that picture.</span> <span id="s316">And when I looked at the picture, I said, in Polish, “This is my grandmother.”</span> <span id="s317">So he knew that he found the right person.</span> <span id="s318">He was my grandmother’s half-brother’s son-in-law.</span> <span id="s319">He was an attorney in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s320">The people from Detroit couldn’t come to pick me up, because that day that our ship finally docked, my grandmother’s sister died, on the very same day.</span> <span id="s321">And they had funeral to attend to.</span> <span id="s322">So they wired or called the people in New Jersey, and they -- that half-brother of my grandmother, and this son-in-law came to pick me up.</span> <span id="s323">And we could not talk to each other.</span> <span id="s324">My -- my cousin, so-called cousin, was a very bright, educated man, but he spoke only English.</span> <span id="s325">I said German?</span> <span id="s326">No.</span> <span id="s327">Polish?</span> <span id="s328">No.</span> <span id="s329">French?</span> <span id="s330">No.</span> <span id="s331">Okay.</span> <span id="s332">Come.</span> <span id="s333">And I followed him, and there I saw this gentleman, gray haired with pink cheeks and the bluest eyes.</span> <span id="s334">And I saw my grandmother’s face, and that was my grandmother’s brother, and he spoke still some Polish and German.</span> <span id="s335">And I went with them.</span> <span id="s336">I remember the ride in the car, alongside the west side highway, and I saw all these lights at night, snake lights, like.</span> <span id="s337">And the Hudson River, and we came to the bridge, huge bridge, which was George Washington bridge.</span> <span id="s338">We crossed the bridge.</span> <span id="s339">I was sitting with my uncle -- great-uncle, and we reached his place in Patterson, New Jersey, it was Patterson.</span> <span id="s340">And his wife also spoke Polish and German and was the most wonderful, wonderful lady, who made me feel good, warm.</span> <span id="s341">She hugged me, she kissed me, and that’s what I needed.</span> <span id="s342">That’s what I needed, I didn’t need any material things, I just wanted to be loved, to -- to belong.</span> <span id="s343">And that was the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: But then eventually, you also visited the other relatives in -- in Detroit.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Could you say a little bit about that experience, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s348">Well, since I was sponsored by the people in Detroit, and the funeral postponed my going there, they communicated with this family that I should stay there for two weeks and come to Detroit.</span> <span id="s349">They send a ticket for a train, and I was put in a train in a very nice car.</span> <span id="s350">I remember that I had to -- a very nice chair facing the window, so it must have been first class, I guess.</span> <span id="s351">And they told the black attendant, a very nice man, to take care of me with food and so forth, because I couldn’t speak English.</span> <span id="s352">And he really took care of me.</span> <span id="s353">It was a long trip.</span> <span id="s354">And I was dressed very decently, because before I left Germany, all my accumulated coffee that I still had, I exchanged for a nice coat.</span> <span id="s355">It was with fur, I remember.</span> <span id="s356">And a scarf.</span> <span id="s357">And I looked decent, fairly decent.</span> <span id="s358">And when I arrived in Detroit, the people at the station were mighty surprised.</span> <span id="s359">I don’t know what they expected, but they thought that this will come somebody from beyond the moon.</span> <span id="s360">Well, I -- sure, I didn’t speak English, but I had brains.</span> <span id="s361">And I looked all right, because I -- I had the rations already in Germany to eat, and I had that couple of weeks with my aunt -- great-aunt and uncle.</span> <span id="s362">They fed me and they -- they were very, very nice to me.</span> <span id="s363">And I spent some time with the people in Detroit.</span> <span id="s364">The parents were nice, but their daughter was -- I must say she was cruel to me, because I took away the limelight away from her.</span> <span id="s365">And I again was unhappy.</span> <span id="s366">So it was decided that I will move to another brother they had.</span> <span id="s367">The brother was an old bachelor, who must have been at that time in his 60’s, and I was in my early 20’s, and they thought that I should marry him.</span> <span id="s368">So I -- I went to a Polish part of town in -- in Detroit, that is Polish.</span> <span id="s369">And I got myself a little job working on camera cases, and I -- I think I was paid 18 dollars a week, maybe 20, I don’t remember exactly.</span> <span id="s370">And I saved the money.</span> <span id="s371">They didn’t like that I got the job, because its -- it hurt their pride.</span> <span id="s372">But I couldn’t walk around without penny in my pocket and -- and if I would want to spend five cents I would have to ask for it.</span> <span id="s373">I wanted to be independent.</span> <span id="s374">So I got this money and I saved -- they didn’t want money from me.</span> <span id="s375">So I saved for the trip back to New York.</span> <span id="s376">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Did -- did -- did they ask you where you -- what happened to you?</span> <span id="s378">Did they have any understanding of where you’d come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Well, as a matter of fact, yes.</span> <span id="s380">I was learning English rapidly.</span> <span id="s381">I went at night to a night school, and they have classes for -- m-m-most of the people at night were people who worked here for many, many years, they did not have time to learn the language properly.</span> <span id="s382">So I learned very quickly, and I wanted to lead a normal, independent life.</span> <span id="s383">I didn’t want to be dependent on every -- anybody.</span> <span id="s384">And I didn’t want to stay with them.</span> <span id="s385">And the idea of marrying this old man was just horrific.</span> <span id="s386">So I wanted to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Did you get any medical attention when you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: Yes, they took me to a doctor once, and th-there were several things wrong with me, but unfortunately they didn’t have that type of help for the spine as they have nowadays, so nothing could be done.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: What was -- what was wrong?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: I had -- some ribs were damaged, broken, and the spine s -- it didn’t show when I was clothed, in clothes, but when I was undressed you could see sticking parts of -- and I was very self-conscious about it.</span> <span id="s391">No, I didn’t get the proper medical care.</span> <span id="s392">If I would have gotten -- if they would have put me in corset in those days -- but I guess that compassion is one thing, and money is another.</span> <span id="s393">And maybe it would be costly.</span> <span id="s394">No, I didn’t have proper care.</span> <span id="s395">And I came back to New York and went back to the great-uncle and great-aunt.</span> <span id="s396">I took a course, three months course to become a baby nurse, newborn babies.</span> <span id="s397">And then I was recommended from one family to another, and became great friends with all the families.</span> <span id="s398">I -- I have three babies that I took care of, that they are three doctors now.</span> <span id="s399">A long time already.</span> <span id="s400">So it -- it -- it -- it’s -- it’s interesting, it’s unbelievab -- I’m talking about my own life, but this is -- seems to me that it’s some sort of a strange book.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: So you earn -- begin to earn your first and earn your own money, how did that feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Oh, it was wonderful because when I got my first check, I gave it to my great-aunt, and I said, this -- this -- this is the sweetest day that I can help you for all you have done for me.</span> <span id="s403">Now, she didn’t have to depend on my money because she had three daughters, and all three were married well, they were all educated.</span> <span id="s404">And -- but I felt independent, I paid.</span> <span id="s405">And we spent many hours sitting in the kitchen, she was an elderly lady.</span> <span id="s406">Now that I’m elderly myself -- we were sitting -- she was sitting making her homemade noodles, homemade, and cutting them.</span> <span id="s407">And she said, “Well, when you are old you have to sit then you do these things.”</span> <span id="s408">So the little things that I remember with great li -- forgot this word, but this is such wonderful feeling I have when I think of her, the -- the compassion that she showed me, and the -- the warmth.</span> <span id="s409">I -- I felt that I belonged.</span> <span id="s410">And all the people that I worked for became my friends.</span> <span id="s411">I loved them all, and I hope I was loved there, too.</span> <span id="s412">So I was independent of this family in Detroit.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: Did you talk much about your experience, di -- what happened?</span> <span id="s414">Did you feel that people wanted to know, were ready to hear?</span> <span id="s415">What was sort of the situation there?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: In the very beginning it was very strange.</span> <span id="s417">Some people didn’t believe that this was possible, some people didn’t want to hear, and I decided for awhile I won’t be talking about it.</span> <span id="s418">I didn’t want to scare people away from me, because I thought, they don’t want to be surrounded by sadness and a teary story.</span> <span id="s419">But as I accomplished my -- my goal, and improved my English, I decided that my mission was to survive in order to tell the people as much as I can, wherever they will listen to me.</span> <span id="s420">Because thing -- such a thing as Holocaust, it was of gigantic proportions.</span> <span id="s421">It never happened to this extent and it has to be told.</span> <span id="s422">And that’s what we promised each other, my family.</span> <span id="s423">And I was the one that was left.</span> <span id="s424">So it will -- became my goal.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: In the early years, ho -- did you feel that people viewed you any certain way?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s427">There were two kinds of people.</span> <span id="s428">There were people who felt that by the very virtue of being born here, and living here for many years, for some reason I was sort of inferior to them.</span> <span id="s429">I disregarded this, because I felt well -- I feel that this is -- I don’t want to lower myself to their level.</span> <span id="s430">And there were people who were very sympathetic and very loving and I was drawn to these people.</span> <span id="s431">So I had to be very careful in the beginning not to overstate my feelings, not to -- I had to be very careful.</span> <span id="s432">People were critical of certain European ways, and I could not get used to some of the American ways.</span> <span id="s433">We ate differently, we -- we -- we behaved, very often, differently, but I didn’t dare to say it.</span> <span id="s434">I kept this to myself.</span> <span id="s435">It’s very unimportant, because each culture has its own way of dealing with things.</span> <span id="s436">And that’s what makes us different and that’s -- an intelligent person can or -- adapt or learn from each other, or disregard.</span> <span id="s437">It’s not important.</span> <span id="s438">These are -- these are very secondary issues, because after all, we are all human beings.</span> <span id="s439">If we try, we can get along, if we’ll only try.</span> <span id="s440">And that is one of the issues that I approach when I speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Do you think that people looked at -- at a displaced person in a certain way?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: In the beginning, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Cou-Could you say that in a sentence?</span> <span id="s444">Not -- I ask you the question, but could you make that into a sentence?</span> <span id="s445">You should maybe tell your husband not to [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s446">I want to ask you now about what sort of -- so you wa -- you -- you were back in New York, or New Jersey, you had t -- you had a n-new job, you began to feel a little bit more comfortable, you had some money.</span> <span id="s447">What was sort of the goal, what was it that you wanted next?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: What I wanted next was to have a child.</span> <span id="s449">I wanted to have a -- as I said this -- and you will see this on -- hear this on the tape, that I wanted to show Hitler that the seed survived.</span> <span id="s450">And I wanted a child the worst way.</span> <span id="s451">It was very unconventional those days to have a child without a husband.</span> <span id="s452">I got married to a man who is a very nice man.</span> <span id="s453">But this would not have been my choice if the times would have been normal.</span> <span id="s454">We are very different people, intellectually.</span> <span id="s455">And we are both honest, we both are of the same religion, we are both very honest, we are both civically minded people.</span> <span id="s456">And we both love music -- different kinds of music, but music.</span> <span id="s457">But we are very different.</span> <span id="s458">I needed more stimuli, which I couldn’t get from my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Intellectual stimulus?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Cou -- could you say it?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: I needed more intellectual stimulus.</span> <span id="s463">I tried to find this in reading, I became voracious reader.</span> <span id="s464">Financially I was not in position to -- to do things that I would have liked to.</span> <span id="s465">I would have liked to go to a good university.</span> <span id="s466">I thought that I had enough brain to do it, but my health was precarious.</span> <span id="s467">I got married and I immediately, the next month, I got pregnant.</span> <span id="s468">I wanted it, and I was afraid that I won’t be able to because I didn’t menstruate for about four years in camps.</span> <span id="s469">But I was fortunate enough, and I wanted a daughter, because I always felt that the daughter will be close, closer than a son.</span> <span id="s470">So I was lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Did a doctor s -- t-tell -- say that -- mention it again that the doctor -- you got medical advice and you were basically advised not to have a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: The doctors told me that it would worsen my condition, it would throw me off.</span> <span id="s473">But I felt that it was worth it.</span> <span id="s474">The -- if you put this on a scale, there was no comparison, I wanted a child.</span> <span id="s475">And it was worth it, and it worked out beautifully, because I do have a daughter who is very close to me.</span> <span id="s476">We are very fortunate.</span> <span id="s477">We nourish each other.</span> <span id="s478">And she has a daughter, and she has -- this is perpetuating.</span> <span id="s479">She has the same -- the same relationship with her daughter.</span> <span id="s480">She has a husband who is British, and he was very reserved when she -- he got married, but he sort of softened by our surrounding love.</span> <span id="s481">He became a ver -- much more relaxed.</span> <span id="s482">He’s still reserved, but not to the extent that he was before.</span> <span id="s483">He calls me Mom, I’m very happy about it.</span> <span id="s484">Most of all, I’m happy that he’s a wonderful husband to my daughter, and wonderful father to his child.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: When was your daughter born, what is her name, and how did you feel when you’ve -- when you got a daughter, how was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: My daughter was born on March 22nd, 1951 and her 50th birthday is coming up.</span> <span id="s487">And I’ll be there next week, and so will be my granddaughter, she will be flying.</span> <span id="s488">From the very beginning on, my entire life centered around this child.</span> <span id="s489">I lived on a fourth floor walk-up apartment in the Bronx.</span> <span id="s490">I had only one bedroom, and the bedroom belonged to her.</span> <span id="s491">We had a [indecipherable] in the living room.</span> <span id="s492">I tried to dress her the best I could.</span> <span id="s493">I tried to read stories, sing songs, teach her, expose her to music.</span> <span id="s494">I -- I delighted in bringing her up.</span> <span id="s495">It was my -- my life changed.</span> <span id="s496">I was very grateful.</span> <span id="s497">And I acquired friends.</span> <span id="s498">We decided to form groups.</span> <span id="s499">I belonged to a -- a book reading club.</span> <span id="s500">Friends who shared interests with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: You -- did you have s-survivor friends, or di -- s-say a little bit more about the kinds of friends you had, or w-was it -- s-say --</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: No, no, no, strangely enough, I lived in the building that I was the only survivor and I formed friendships with my neighbors.</span> <span id="s503">This was 1950 - ’51, you have to understand that it -- the conditions were absolutely different, it was safe.</span> <span id="s504">When the baby was born, I used to -- it was hot, we didn’t have air conditioning.</span> <span id="s505">New York can be very cruel in the summer.</span> <span id="s506">The humidity.</span> <span id="s507">So we used to go downstairs, the carriage was in the basement and we walked to the park at night, nobody was afraid.</span> <span id="s508">It was a local park.</span> <span id="s509">And all the other mothers with their babies were there, and we’re -- we’re sitting at night, not being afraid.</span> <span id="s510">So we formed very close friendships.</span> <span id="s511">Not one of my friends there was a survivor, strangely enough.</span> <span id="s512">One was Italian, Connie, adorable.</span> <span id="s513">And three others were Jewish.</span> <span id="s514">We played Mah Jong, I remember.</span> <span id="s515">I learned how to play Mah Jong tho-those days.</span> <span id="s516">And then in the summer, when my husband started to make a little bit more, in the summer we were leaving New York for the country.</span> <span id="s517">We used to rent a room.</span> <span id="s518">And the husbands were -- my friends to my -- the husbands were coming on a weekend.</span> <span id="s519">So that ch --</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: Wh-What was your -- what was your husband doing as -- as a job, what did he --</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: My husband worked as a inspector first.</span> <span id="s522">He -- he -- he had -- he went to University of Rochester, but he did not have his actual degree in engineering, so he worked for General Dynamics for many years.</span> <span id="s523">They went bankrupt, that part that he worked for, so he switched to a smaller place, I believe Sequential.</span> <span id="s524">And then he was hired by Union Carbide.</span> <span id="s525">And he worked in Union Carbide for six years, until his heart -- he had a small heart attack and I told him I don’t want him to work any more.</span> <span id="s526">I don’t need the money, I can live -- I saw worse things.</span> <span id="s527">Money was not everything, so I talked him into retiring.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: So he was an engineer of sorts, though?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: And say a little bit more about life in New York, then.</span> <span id="s531">You didn’t have that much money but you were not unhappy.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: No, I was not unhappy because I had friends who were in the same circumstances.</span> <span id="s533">If you don’t have much, and your friends don’t have much, you -- you’re not unhappy.</span> <span id="s534">You have food, you have clothes, you -- w-we were going -- as a matter of fact we were -- when we played once a week, we -- we used to -- but I don’t remember, 50 cents, or 75 cents on a side.</span> <span id="s535">When we had enough money, all the couples went to the theater, because we loved theater.</span> <span id="s536">So we packed two cars, and we went out.</span> <span id="s537">And when there was enough money we went to Lindy’s for cheesecake, too.</span> <span id="s538">And I’ve -- later on I found especially one friend that she had my interest in museums, and we used to go to Metropolitan Museum of Art twice a month, and became members.</span> <span id="s539">And I loved that, I loved that museum.</span> <span id="s540">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: You also went to libraries, I [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: Oh yes, the library was part of my -- my learning process.</span> <span id="s543">I learned a -- a really -- in the beginning by myself, sufficiently to be understood, and I took great care to be correct, to be fairly articulate.</span> <span id="s544">And I couldn’t get rid of my accent, which the American people after awhile, they saw that I spoke well, they -- they -- they were changing.</span> <span id="s545">I was -- I was nice and -- but these were different people from the ones that -- in the beginning, in Detroit, who said, well, what’s she know, she comes from Poland.</span> <span id="s546">That was different.</span> <span id="s547">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: How -- what kind of aspirations did you have for your daughter, how did you bring her up?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: How -- what kind of aspirations did you have for your daughter, how did you bring her up?</span> <span id="s551">You talked a little bit about -- already about -- about education and you want her to have a cultural background, she liked music, or something, but how did you think in terms of education, values that you wanted to --</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Well, values -- the -- the morals and ethics you teach the child from the beginning.</span> <span id="s553">About education, I felt that in -- I’m not going to push her in one direction.</span> <span id="s554">I want her to pursue her own road to the -- the kind of education that she wants.</span> <span id="s555">She wanted to study Shakespeare.</span> <span id="s556">My husband used to laugh, he said, “What do you want to do with Shakespeare?”</span> <span id="s557">He said, “How about a little typing on the side?”</span> <span id="s558">And she said, “But I love it.”</span> <span id="s559">So I said, “Well, she loves it, so she has to do it, she has to be happy, to do what she likes to do.”</span> <span id="s560">And once she was in high school, she went for a junior year abroad to England.</span> <span id="s561">And that, of course, changed her life, she became an Anglophile.</span> <span id="s562">And she want -- she dreamt about going to graduate school for her masters in England.</span> <span id="s563">And we sent her to England, to Shakespearean Institute.</span> <span id="s564">And whatever you learn, it’s your gain.</span> <span id="s565">It’s a wonderful thing.</span> <span id="s566">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Was -- was that difficult, to let her go?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: It was difficult, but I had again to outweigh my personal feeling for her happiness.</span> <span id="s569">She chose this path, she wanted, and this was the best school.</span> <span id="s570">Once she was accepted, to me this was an omen, she has to go.</span> <span id="s571">And she went and she loved it, and she graduated.</span> <span id="s572">She has masters in English lit -- literature.</span> <span id="s573">As a matter of fact she went also one summer to London, University of London.</span> <span id="s574">That was before she went to the Shakespearian Institute.</span> <span id="s575">She doesn’t do anything with the Shakespeare now, but she works twice a week in Santa Monica College, and she also has students who apply for colleges, she does work with the essays.</span> <span id="s576">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s577">She is a superb wr-writer.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Did you talk to her about -- about your experience?</span> <span id="s579">How did you impart -- how did she get to know about that?</span> <span id="s580">How’d -- how was that handled in your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: She always knew that I was a survivor.</span> <span id="s582">Her father was not, her fa -- father lived here through -- through the war.</span> <span id="s583">But I was a survivor and I never made secret out of it.</span> <span id="s584">I did not tell her in the details, the gory details of what went through, but I wanted her to know because this was the legacy.</span> <span id="s585">She was entitled to know where her mother came from, my background, I wanted her to be proud of it, and what she is.</span> <span id="s586">At the same token, she resented the people who caused my I -- my affliction, my being disabled as a result of the tremendous beatings that I was getting.</span> <span id="s587">She could not ga -- accept it.</span> <span id="s588">And I tried to temper her dislike -- more than dislike, her hatred, into -- it was very diplomatic, into understanding that people are people.</span> <span id="s589">There were people who were good.</span> <span id="s590">And we -- she went to the museum, she saw how many people saved people, at the risk of their own imprisonment or even losing their lives.</span> <span id="s591">I myself was surprised to see many Polish names on the wall of the museum.</span> <span id="s592">I was not aware that that many Polish people helped, I really wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Which museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: The Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C..</span> <span id="s595">I was surprised.</span> <span id="s596">I knew about the Danes at that time.</span> <span id="s597">My surprise was complete when I first pers -- once only, I went to Israel to visit Yad Vashem, and I saw that street of the Righteous Gentiles, and I -- I just broke down, because this was a very revealing thing to me, and being aware of the goodness of some people.</span> <span id="s598">People who did not lose their humanity, who -- who are giants.</span> <span id="s599">Because everybody now has to say to himself, how would I act under these circumstances?</span> <span id="s600">Could I have done it?</span> <span id="s601">Could I have hidden people at the risk of my life?</span> <span id="s602">There was one 17 year old girl.</span> <span id="s603">17 year old girl who had 13 Jews hidden in her house, and they all survived.</span> <span id="s604">So this is -- this -- this is heroism -- heroism, that’s -- that’s -- that’s wonderful.</span> <span id="s605">So this is always what I point out, the -- the bad and the good.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: All right, let’s go back to Israel.</span> <span id="s607">When did you go to Israel and what was the experience like?</span> <span id="s608">What -- what did it mean to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: I went to Israel, don’t remember the -- the -- the year.</span> <span id="s610">It was the year after the Six Day War when Jerusalem was returned to Israel.</span> <span id="s611">Going to Israel was -- I was not as excited as I maybe should have been, but once I was there, it was the most incredible feeling that occurred when I was at the Wailing Wall.</span> <span id="s612">And I am not a very religious person.</span> <span id="s613">I -- my husband has -- had a sister who passed away.</span> <span id="s614">She left for Palestine when she was a youngster, she was in the Zionist movement and she got married, and she really worked the soil.</span> <span id="s615">She was a real sabra.</span> <span id="s616">Her children were born there, her grandchildren, everybody was in the army.</span> <span id="s617">So we went to visit her.</span> <span id="s618">Once we went to Jerusalem, and I went to the wall, and I stood in front of this -- this -- this plain wall, and I touched -- touched the stones, something inside me changed.</span> <span id="s619">I cannot describe the feeling, it was like the history of the millennia came through my body.</span> <span id="s620">I reminded myself that my grandfather had on the wall of his room, some sort of a picture and there was saying, Oh Jerusalem, if -- can’t quote it.</span> <span id="s621">Something about losing a hand.</span> <span id="s622">I don’t -- I cannot be verbatim, I cannot, but I know that it’s very well known, and I know that existed in many homes.</span> <span id="s623">So this came to my mind.</span> <span id="s624">Jerusalem, walking the streets, the historical cobbled streets, which led from around the wall, through the 14 station of Jesus were of tremen -- made tremendous impact on me, because I walked on history.</span> <span id="s625">Jesus did walk there.</span> <span id="s626">Mary Magdalene was there.</span> <span id="s627">The Roman soldiers were there.</span> <span id="s628">The Hebrews were there, and here I am walking there.</span> <span id="s629">Tremendous impact.</span> <span id="s630">I went to the mosque, to the blue mosque.</span> <span id="s631">I took my shoes off, I saw the people -- very few people in there.</span> <span id="s632">I went downstairs where the rock is, and this is allegedly the rock on which Abraham was supposed to sacrifice his son, and God stopped him.</span> <span id="s633">I don’t know -- these were legends, but to me this was something that history repeated in all the hundreds and hundreds of years.</span> <span id="s634">So I sort of became a little part of the history, touching the whole thing.</span> <span id="s635">It made tremendous impact on me.</span> <span id="s636">Going to Yad Vashem was another story.</span> <span id="s637">Going in there and standing at the gallery, looking down at the slabs of stone with the names of the camps, I broke down.</span> <span id="s638">I thought I am immune to it, that I will not, but I did break down, and I cried.</span> <span id="s639">When I walked out, it was one of these beautiful s-sunny days in Jerusalem, and you’re coming out from this dark chamber of remembrances of the tragedy that human people suffered at human hands.</span> <span id="s640">And you go out and there is this street with the trees.</span> <span id="s641">The street with the trees of the Righteous Gentiles.</span> <span id="s642">The contrast is so startling.</span> <span id="s643">It is so eye opening.</span> <span id="s644">I -- I will never forget til the day I die, my feeling when I saw this.</span> <span id="s645">At that point I was not aware of all the Gentiles who did help.</span> <span id="s646">I knew smattering of things, because I was always interested reading the books.</span> <span id="s647">I knew about Denmark.</span> <span id="s648">I knew about sporadic things, but the names that I’ve seen this, and the trees.</span> <span id="s649">The whole idea was so special to me that it was the highlight of my trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Going back to -- oh -- oh no, let’s actually -- you -- you -- you -- you s-said a little bit about you’re not very religious.</span> <span id="s651">Speak a little -- speak a little bit about your relationship to Judaism, and about your faith.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Well, I grew up in a family that was -- my mother and father were non-observant Jews.</span> <span id="s653">However, the tradition was kept up.</span> <span id="s654">We went for all the big holidays to grandparents, who kept th-the -- Judaism alive, and they were religious.</span> <span id="s655">They were not Orthodox, but they were religious.</span> <span id="s656">I will never forget the Seders, the warm feeling of being with all my family, and with strangers, because we always -- my grandparents invited strangers, this was a tradition, from orphanage, soldiers who were of Jewish origin who did not have place to go to.</span> <span id="s657">We always had strangers at the table.</span> <span id="s658">And th -- we were only two grandchildren there, I was the older one, and mother’s sister boy was the younger one.</span> <span id="s659">And they had a cook, and a serving maid, and there was a long, long table laden with this food, and the people, and the happiness, and the lights, because my grandfather always said let there be a lot of light, it’s a holiday.</span> <span id="s660">So all the lights in all the rooms were on.</span> <span id="s661">It was such a wonderful, happy feeling.</span> <span id="s662">New Year’s we used to go to the temple to pick up my grandparents because they were going -- my parents didn’t, and we always brought a -- white flowers with us, a bouquet of white flowers, I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s663">So the memories and the -- the -- of the tradition were very strong with me.</span> <span id="s664">I -- I believe in some sort of supreme being, but I couldn’t define it.</span> <span id="s665">I did not have Hebrew education, neither did my mother.</span> <span id="s666">I -- I’m av -- extremely good Jew at heart because I believe in the commandments, and I feel if y -- you don’t have to be Jewish to follow the commandments.</span> <span id="s667">And if you follow the commandments, you’re religious.</span> <span id="s668">My father’s idea was more philoso -- philosophical, he thought that God surrounds us, that God is everywhere, in every huma -- i-in every human, in every living tree, in the nature.</span> <span id="s669">And I sort of adopted this.</span> <span id="s670">However, in camp, I was questioning, where is that supreme being?</span> <span id="s671">Where is God?</span> <span id="s672">What’s happening?</span> <span id="s673">These are human beings who are doing this to other human beings, therefore, is there a God?</span> <span id="s674">The questioning.</span> <span id="s675">Long time.</span> <span id="s676">I slowly returned to the faith.</span> <span id="s677">I’m not a temple goer, but I feel that I am a good Jew because I observe the commandments.</span> <span id="s678">I will not steal, I will honor -- unfortunately I don’t have parents, I’m an old lady myself.</span> <span id="s679">And I tried to bring up my daughter in the spirit, and my daughter did not have Bat Mitzvah, but my granddaughter did.</span> <span id="s680">So it’s like coming back.</span> <span id="s681">The circle is repeating.</span> <span id="s682">And when I spoke at my granddaughter’s Bat Mitzvah, I did say it, that the seed survived after all.</span> <span id="s683">To me this was very, very powerful statement.</span> <span id="s684">In view that so many members of my family were killed, and I felt that I was the weakest link, and I survived, and I was able to produce the next pr -- generation.</span> <span id="s685">It was very strong feeling, and this brought me back to the faith.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: You implicitly -- you seemed to imply just now that there was what is now coined or termed survivor’s guilt, a little bit.</span> <span id="s687">Is there --</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: Definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Did you feel guilty --</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: Definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: -- could you say something about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Definitely.</span> <span id="s693">I lived with that sense of guilt all my life.</span> <span id="s694">I felt that maybe I wasn’t the one deserving to survive.</span> <span id="s695">I -- maybe I wasn’t worth it.</span> <span id="s696">There were so many people in the family who were much more deserving to survive, and I was chosen to be the one.</span> <span id="s697">You live with this guilt always.</span> <span id="s698">I will never get rid of this guilt.</span> <span id="s699">And my daughter tried to get this out of me, but it’s down deep somewhere there, the guilt is there.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: Did you feel that you have this -- that you have or had a special obligation in some way, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Definitely.</span> <span id="s702">To speak.</span> <span id="s703">To leave something behind me.</span> <span id="s704">I’m sorry that I did not write a book, but this was such a trend, everybody was writing books.</span> <span id="s705">I said maybe by spoken words to people, maybe I will reach people by the very virtue of being in flesh in front of them.</span> <span id="s706">It was not a book, it was not a page, it was not a printed word, it was me, in flesh.</span> <span id="s707">And I tried to convey this to my listeners, you are looking at a survivor.</span> <span id="s708">I was there.</span> <span id="s709">You will be able to tell next generation, I spoke and listened to a survivor.</span> <span id="s710">To me this was so important, maybe more than books.</span> <span id="s711">Sometimes I’m sorry I didn’t write, but it’s too late for that, so I have to be satisfied with what I did.</span> <span id="s712">I tried my very best.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: Wh-When did you start speaking, and was it on your own impetus, or did somebody else urge you to, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: Nobody urged me.</span> <span id="s715">I felt -- first of all, the family said, when we saw that we are doomed, that if someone survived, some -- that one should speak.</span> <span id="s716">There was no question about it in Poland or Germany, I would not dream about it.</span> <span id="s717">In the beginning in the States, my English wasn’t good enough, and it was absolutely negligent, I didn’t speak the language.</span> <span id="s718">When I learned and I became fairly fluent in English, the obligation started to come back.</span> <span id="s719">I said, I promised, I have to start.</span> <span id="s720">And I started with some of my friends who were American born, and little by little it grew.</span> <span id="s721">People listen and they said, oh, you know, we have a group of women, this will be interesting to invite you.</span> <span id="s722">And since I live in San Diego, I did this for over 20 years here.</span> <span id="s723">And I was always recommended.</span> <span id="s724">I never put my name in the papers that people did.</span> <span id="s725">But -- especially the Catholic school.</span> <span id="s726">They invited me three times.</span> <span id="s727">And I said to the teacher, “But I’m repeating myself.”</span> <span id="s728">They said, “What do you think we do?</span> <span id="s729">We repeating our lessons, but each time is a different class, different people.”</span> <span id="s730">So I fulfilled my promise and my obligation, and I never wanted to profit by it.</span> <span id="s731">I did this because this is my absolute responsibility to the people who perished.</span> <span id="s732">And if there are some individuals who do profit by it, I’m sorry they do.</span> <span id="s733">I’m happy that they do some good by speaking, but I feel that it’s almost unethical to profit by it in any way.</span> <span id="s734">There is no glory in it, to -- to -- to be invited guest of honor here and there, and -- and have pictures.</span> <span id="s735">It -- it doesn’t apply to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: Let’s see, I just had a question that I forgot to ask.</span> <span id="s737">Sometimes -- where -- where else did you go?</span> <span id="s738">Yo-You mentioned Catholic schools, there were other places?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: Oh yes, I went to schools, I went -- I spoke before high schools, I spoke in Santa Monica’s high schools, I spoke before Hillel groups, I spoke in churches.</span> <span id="s740">And I liked to go to churches, because I felt that Jewish people, and Jewish organizations and Jewish groups that invited me, Havorah groups for instance, some people were there who were genuinely interested, but they knew about it.</span> <span id="s741">And some people said enough, it’s enough and they did not want to hear this any more.</span> <span id="s742">So I thought if I would speak to non-Jewish audiences, and I will reach just some of them, then I did something good.</span> <span id="s743">And I did.</span> <span id="s744">I -- I spoke in few churches, especially there is one church here, United Methodist, that I was invited -- that was a year ago, I think, and the lady who invited me -- I went with her and she said, “Do you mind there is a German lady in the wa -- in the church?”</span> <span id="s745">I said, “Of course not.”</span> <span id="s746">And this German lady listened very intently.</span> <span id="s747">And she tried to tell me that she and her whole family were never Nazis.</span> <span id="s748">I didn’t -- I did not question her -- and her grandfather would like to help people.</span> <span id="s749">I’m not interested in her story, and if they did that’s wonderful and she doesn’t have to explain this to me.</span> <span id="s750">I am there on one purpose only, to tell people not my personal story, but to spread my message.</span> <span id="s751">And my message always was one, let’s tolerate one another, let’s learn about each other.</span> <span id="s752">And I always say that people take this with a grain of salt, you don’t have to love one another, but tolerate one another.</span> <span id="s753">Learn how to live together, because otherwise we jeopardize th-the en -- the entire -- the population is growing fast, the earth is getting smaller.</span> <span id="s754">We’re flying from one place to another in few hours.</span> <span id="s755">If we won’t learn how to get along, we will perish.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: I-I know that this not something you want to get into detail necessarily, but let’s speak just a little bit about the price that you pay for this though.</span> <span id="s757">I mean, it is not -- it is not easy for you to keep talking about this.</span> <span id="s758">What -- what -- what happens when you do it?</span> <span id="s759">What -- what is the price you pay?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: I would deny if I would say that I don’t pay price for it.</span> <span id="s761">The price is my health.</span> <span id="s762">My innermost feelings, my -- my dreams, my nightmares.</span> <span id="s763">But you have to decide, is it worth it?</span> <span id="s764">I know I’m getting older, I know that I am winding up my da -- my speaking days.</span> <span id="s765">I’m glad that I’m doing this for -- for the museum, that this will be on the tape.</span> <span id="s766">I will leave something behind it.</span> <span id="s767">But I’m weaker.</span> <span id="s768">I’m getting older and my [indecipherable] are greater than before.</span> <span id="s769">Aside from the fact that I went through a -- a lot with my daughter, who had this terrible surgery, it took a lot out of me.</span> <span id="s770">And it was for me a big decision if I should do it -- this.</span> <span id="s771">But I said, I did the first part, I have to follow it up.</span> <span id="s772">I’m glad that you ask me, I’m glad you came.</span> <span id="s773">I’m glad that this will be in archives.</span> <span id="s774">I hope that it will be of some use, and it will do some good by reaching the right people, and the wrong people.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: Can -- can we go back to your life in New York for just a little while more?</span> <span id="s776">We spoke about Israel as being a very important thing that happened in your life, had a great impact.</span> <span id="s777">Yad Vashem.</span> <span id="s778">Your daughter, obviously, being born was -- was an incredible thing.</span> <span id="s779">What -- what else when you think back?</span> <span id="s780">Anything in the 60’s or 70’s that was sort of -- an event that sticks out that was important to you as an American?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: Well, a -- a ba -- the very important event that happened to me, that touched me very much, strangely, it is the creation of Israel.</span> <span id="s782">It -- it -- it was an unbelievable impact.</span> <span id="s783">Of course, I remember Golda Meier came to New York to speak at the Madison Square Garden before it was razed.</span> <span id="s784">And I was there with my girlfriend.</span> <span id="s785">And Ed McMahon, who was the man for -- who always introduced Johnny Carson, he was the MC.</span> <span id="s786">He introduced Golda Meier.</span> <span id="s787">And Golda, the -- the elderly lady, with the swollen legs, with the big, heavy stockings and big, black shoes, I remember -- will never forget.</span> <span id="s788">Ugly woman, speaking in the most beautiful English, speaking from her heart.</span> <span id="s789">And I remember the place was packed.</span> <span id="s790">I don’t know how I got in, I don’t remember that, but I was inside, and I remember they -- down the aisles, young people were holding four corners of Israeli map with Magen David, white with the Magen David and people were just throwing money into it.</span> <span id="s791">And I threw whatever I had in my pocketbook.</span> <span id="s792">This was a tremendous thing.</span> <span id="s793">Jewish people will have their homeland.</span> <span id="s794">It was something that I think only some sect of fundamelis -- fundament -- fundamentalist predicted that Israel will come back.</span> <span id="s795">And there it was.</span> <span id="s796">Now, I myself was not the material to go to Israel and fight and -- however, it was magnificent.</span> <span id="s797">That day will stick out in my mor -- memory forever.</span> <span id="s798">Incidentally, there is one person, I don’t know if that museum would be interested in, non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s799">The lady is in her late 80’s, lives he -- here in San Diego.</span> <span id="s800">We became great friends.</span> <span id="s801">We met in a writing club, because I was going to writing classes, I love to write.</span> <span id="s802">She and her husband took part in the creation of Israel.</span> <span id="s803">Her husband came home in 1945, or ’46, I don’t remember when, when the war was over, he was a veteran.</span> <span id="s804">And he didn’t have a job.</span> <span id="s805">He was recruited, not knowing for what and for where, by somebody by the name Al Schwimmer.</span> <span id="s806">They took him -- she didn’t know where he went, they took him to Czechoslovakia, they got few planes there, he was airplane mechanic.</span> <span id="s807">He was fixing planes so Israel could get six planes.</span> <span id="s808">This was when they -- before the war started.</span> <span id="s809">She didn’t know for a few months where he was, he was not allowed to let her know.</span> <span id="s810">And eventually he went to Israel, Israel was created, and she followed him, and she spent two years in Israel with him, working as an English steno -- some position there.</span> <span id="s811">And she saying -- said -- she wrote a book about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: She wrote a book about it.</span> <span id="s814">I have a copy.</span> <span id="s815">She said what -- what was supposed to be our work became our cause.</span> <span id="s816">This lady spoke about it, I invited her to some groups to speak about it.</span> <span id="s817">Her husband was one of the heroes, unsung heroes who helped Israel into being.</span> <span id="s818">Non-Jewish, young man, he died last year.</span> <span id="s819">She’s about 89, she still goes to writing classes.</span> <span id="s820">I wonder if museum would like to have her story.</span> <span id="s821">If you have a chance, tell them she is an extraordinary person.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: I will.</span> <span id="s823">And now it’s on tape, too.</span> <span id="s824">Is there anything before -- I want to also talk a little bit about San Diego later, but is there anything in New York in your life, you stayed there for 20 years, that -- that sticks out as an -- as an important event or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: Th-This was one of the most important events.</span> <span id="s826">The other events were my friendship with two ladies, especially.</span> <span id="s827">Especially the one, she came from Vienna originally, we went to museums together, we shared interests.</span> <span id="s828">I loved M-Metropolitan.</span> <span id="s829">And we went to concerts.</span> <span id="s830">There was nothing of tremendous impact there.</span> <span id="s831">I was always the class mother.</span> <span id="s832">I always went on trips for the school.</span> <span id="s833">I -- when the teacher needed a helper I was ready, because I didn’t work.</span> <span id="s834">I supervised.</span> <span id="s835">I loved being with the children, so -- I always stayed in touch with the people whose children I was working for when they were born.</span> <span id="s836">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: You could say something about your husband and you being very civic minded.</span> <span id="s838">I mean, you really --</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s840">My husband I were always -- we shared the idea that once you become a citizen of this country, you owe something to this country.</span> <span id="s841">And we are both civic minded.</span> <span id="s842">In New York, when my husband worked and I didn’t, I volunteered for Albert Einstein Hospital, and they ask me -- first they put me to count pills in the basement, which blew my mind off.</span> <span id="s843">I thought that I -- I will get crazy there, I couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s844">So I asked them to transfer me to the library cart.</span> <span id="s845">And I was walking with the library cart, and people who were able to read magazines and books, I did this.</span> <span id="s846">I had a uniform and then I talked my friends to do it, and we did this for quite awhile.</span> <span id="s847">And my husband wants me -- came to San Diego when he retired, this is 21 years that he volunteers in three hospitals, four days a week.</span> <span id="s848">And he is -- he has all kinds of awards, you can see it on the wall up there.</span> <span id="s849">He was always civic minded.</span> <span id="s850">He is appreciated in the hospital and it makes -- it makes our life easier in the way that we are not two elderly people sitting on top of one another, but we have some different interests.</span> <span id="s851">He loves his hospitals, I do not like hospitals.</span> <span id="s852">I like to stay away from hospitals.</span> <span id="s853">But there are some people who are needed there.</span> <span id="s854">And he fulfills this need.</span> <span id="s855">He’s in charge of volunteers for the emergency room.</span> <span id="s856">He stays in the emergency room, and the lady that I met today when I picked you up, worked for him in the emergency room.</span> <span id="s857">Which shows you how small this world is.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: Have you ever associated with co -- with survivor groups, or with survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: There is a survivor group in San Diego, and I went to one meeting there.</span> <span id="s860">But at this particular meeting -- the people are very active, and they do a lot of things, and there are a couple of them that do speak.</span> <span id="s861">One of them wrote some book.</span> <span id="s862">What bothered me was that he always peddles this book wherev -- every store you go to.</span> <span id="s863">He sits there, I will sign it, I will sign it, and this turns me off.</span> <span id="s864">And sometimes a lot of them were speaking Yiddish, which I didn’t.</span> <span id="s865">So I decided that I can be a very good civic minded survivor without being in the group.</span> <span id="s866">I will do my part without being a part of the group.</span> <span id="s867">The group is very nice, very good, they donated m-money for the wall, I believe, that this -- and they have a monument, some sort of monument.</span> <span id="s868">And I sent my money to -- as much as I could to Jewish American Congress, and to the Shoah Foundation and to the Holocaust Museum, 36 dollars, which supposed to have some significance because it’s twice 18, which 18 is life, [indecipherable] which I learned.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: I have only maybe two more questions.</span> <span id="s870">One is just a -- a quick follow-up question on your daughter.</span> <span id="s871">Could you maybe say again that -- it was very hard for her to hear details about what was done to you, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: She didn’t -- cou -- could you speak to that a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s875">When we lived in New York and my daughter was already a teenager, and -- and -- and even tw -- 19 - 18 - 19 -- and they were forming groups of second generation, my daughter did not join it.</span> <span id="s876">Now, I asked her about it.</span> <span id="s877">She said she lives with it, seeing my body, it reminds her enough of Holocaust.</span> <span id="s878">She could not associate with a group and speaking about it, it hurt her too much.</span> <span id="s879">She wanted us to have a normal life without m-mentioning.</span> <span id="s880">It -- it -- sometimes it was a -- wa -- she wondered how could I go on and on.</span> <span id="s881">She said, “Mommy, I would like you to stop, you are torturing yourself.</span> <span id="s882">I want you to stop it.”</span> <span id="s883">She meant well, and she does her civic duty.</span> <span id="s884">She contributes to it, but she could not speak about it because she -- in her heart it is a feeling of tremendous pain, seeing what has happened to me during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: And she also had a hard time hearing exactly what --</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: Well, I did not tell her details.</span> <span id="s887">I told her, I never made secret of it, how I survived the war, and -- but nothing that -- the gross details.</span> <span id="s888">She had to know, but at the same token I didn’t want to go overboard, because this was a child.</span> <span id="s889">I didn’t want to poison her mind.</span> <span id="s890">I had to find the middle road, for her to grow up to be a bright, open-minded person.</span> <span id="s891">And I hope that I achieved this.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Let’s talk about your granddaughter a little bit.</span> <span id="s893">You did have a -- you do have a granddaughter, and when was -- when was she born, and what is her rela -- what’s her name and what is your relationship to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: My granddaughter’s name is Alexis Danielle.</span> <span id="s895">She was born in 1978.</span> <span id="s896">She’s the joy of all our lives.</span> <span id="s897">She is beautiful in and out.</span> <span id="s898">She’s bright.</span> <span id="s899">She graduated Duke University.</span> <span id="s900">She had a lot of friends there, whom she misses terribly now.</span> <span id="s901">She is in her first year of law school, wants to study environmental law.</span> <span id="s902">She’s romantic.</span> <span id="s903">She wants to save the world.</span> <span id="s904">She wants to contribute to the betterment of the world, the human race.</span> <span id="s905">She’s an advocate for the animal rights, trees, water.</span> <span id="s906">Save -- save -- save the trees, save the water.</span> <span id="s907">She is not one of the crazies, she’s a very normal young lady.</span> <span id="s908">And we are very proud of her.</span> <span id="s909">And we hope that she will achieve what she set out to do.</span> <span id="s910">Her father is an attorney too, but in a different area, not criminal, he’s a litigator.</span> <span id="s911">And she has very happy home life.</span> <span id="s912">Her parents are very loyal, wonderful couple.</span> <span id="s913">I was very lucky that my daughter married a man who’s a wonderful husband and father and provides cultural background.</span> <span id="s914">They do go to theater very often, my daughter loves theater, and she exposed her daughter to the loves, as I did her, even when I couldn’t afford it, my daughter can afford it now.</span> <span id="s915">So Alexis is very well rounded young person, as is my daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: T -- only two more questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: One, you refer to your age that you are getting older.</span> <span id="s919">What does -- what does age -- what changes with age, or what has changed for you particular with regard maybe to -- to memory or also to events, the impact of -- of -- of the Holocaust to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: Well this is a -- this is a serious question.</span> <span id="s921">I am aging and I feel this with every minute, more so.</span> <span id="s922">And sometimes I rebel, because I lost so many years when I could have been doing things and learning, my -- my young years in the camps.</span> <span id="s923">Each year could count for 50.</span> <span id="s924">So I rebel that in my older age I have -- I have a big baggage, not only physical, but I have this -- this -- in the back of my mind, the -- the guilt feelings.</span> <span id="s925">I live with it.</span> <span id="s926">I will never get rid of it.</span> <span id="s927">So old age is -- it’s not so sweet.</span> <span id="s928">The only sweetness is the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: Is th -- is memory -- is memory fading too?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: The memory is -- I found out that short term memory is fading, but I was reassured that young people do it too.</span> <span id="s931">So when I will see somebody, I say how are you, without mentioning the name.</span> <span id="s932">But the long term memory, there certain things that are blending because it was so fast.</span> <span id="s933">When we were running, for instance.</span> <span id="s934">I don’t remember some of them.</span> <span id="s935">I don’t remember -- and I mentioned this many times, the face of my torturer.</span> <span id="s936">I erased his face from my memory because I didn’t want to be haunted by it.</span> <span id="s937">I don’t remember the faces of the [indecipherable] and the SS women who were so cruel.</span> <span id="s938">I don’t want to remember, I don’t want to see them in my dreams.</span> <span id="s939">So subconsciously this is gone.</span> <span id="s940">I know the fact, but I don’t remember the faces.</span> <span id="s941">Some of my friends who survived, they remember the -- the smallest details and yet when we were invited to Ravensbrück, Sachsenhausen, I received invitation.</span> <span id="s942">I could go free with my husband, pay fare, and pay three days stay.</span> <span id="s943">The program that was sent to me had a concert, visiting the SS barracks and something else.</span> <span id="s944">And I very politely denied -- I mean refused.</span> <span id="s945">I did not want to go back.</span> <span id="s946">I am not anxious to see Sachsenhausen or Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s947">I don’t want to see the barracks.</span> <span id="s948">I don’t need to see this.</span> <span id="s949">I never went back, I never went to Dachau or Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s950">I know about it, I don’t have to go to see it.</span> <span id="s951">People who went during the war, if they go, it’s good.</span> <span id="s952">Let them perpetuate the memory of it.</span> <span id="s953">I don’t need it.</span> <span id="s954">And th-the invitation for three days paid to fly, well it was to me almost an insult.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: Six years, roughly, of the Holocaust, the war years, almost 55 years after.</span> <span id="s956">Is -- is the -- is there a weighing?</span> <span id="s957">What is -- the 50 year -- the 55 years after the war, are they as strong as the six years?</span> <span id="s958">Is there -- can one weigh this -- this -- have you --</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: They are two different lives.</span> <span id="s960">There is no comparison.</span> <span id="s961">There is nothing that I can say -- I can weigh one against the other.</span> <span id="s962">The six years of imprisonment were -- German word, ewigkeit.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: Eternity?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: Eternity.</span> <span id="s965">These years now, especially now that I grow older, passing by very quickly, too quickly.</span> <span id="s966">I want to live long enough to see my granddaughter graduate, to see good things.</span> <span id="s967">To see her get married, and then I’ll be completely happy.</span> <span id="s968">To hear from people again -- I have listened to you, and I appreciate it.</span> <span id="s969">I learned something from you.</span> <span id="s970">I adopted some of your ideas.</span> <span id="s971">I hope that somebody sometimes will read or see my tapes in Washington and will let me know.</span> <span id="s972">It would be a -- a tremendous thing to know.</span> <span id="s973">I -- I received a lot of letters from schoolchildren, from people who listen, even from the sisters in the Catholic school.</span> <span id="s974">I send them -- not all of them, but a -- a lot of them to the Holocaust Museum, but I would like to know in the museum itself, if teachers who come for information, or somebody -- if somebody stumbled upon one of my tapes, or visual, or oral, and that I made some impact, that would be wonderful.</span> <span id="s975">It would be something -- fulfillment.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: I think this is where we should stop then.</span> <span id="s977">Thank you very much, Blanka.</span></p> <p><span
