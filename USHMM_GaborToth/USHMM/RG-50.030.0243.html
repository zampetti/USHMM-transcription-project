you know, as you know Poland was a very...a few upper and the majority were kind of struggling for life through the hard life.</span> <span id="s26">My family worked.</span> <span id="s27">My grandfather especially was a self-made man.</span> <span id="s28">______ was very prosperous in different type of business, but he was a self-made man.</span> <span id="s29">On my side, from my mother's side, they were a lot wealthier, but old money, like in the olden days, you know...old money coming from from the for generations, but my father's side was more strict.</span> <span id="s30">My family, as a child anyway, were...I always identified with my father's family because they they were more accomplished.</span> <span id="s31">They were more _____.</span> <span id="s32">That...in that time already I realized what it means, you know, upbringing...children.</span> <span id="s33">They were...even they had more money and everything but it was stricter that my mother's family was...we had grandmother, great-grandmother.</span> <span id="s34">My great-great-grandfather was the first Jew in Kielce which he got the permission from the Czar of Russia to live in Kielce.</span> <span id="s35">Jew were not allowed to live because it was a big city, and the grandchildren that they had so much money, they were a little bit spoiled and just like in America, they were not up to par.</span> <span id="s36">I see it now.</span> <span id="s37">I didn't see it then, but they...the the money spoiled them and it was too much money.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Can you tell me about what your father did and...</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: My father...my father and mother, they were the oldest from both sides and they were I think the unique, the unique couple.</span> <span id="s40">They...in Poland they used to give dowries, you know, but the the the girl had to have a dowry in order to marry.</span> <span id="s41">In my father's case, my grandmother was...she had a provision...at that time she was giving twenty thousand dollars.</span> <span id="s42">That was a lot of money...1920...for to my mother, but my father gave the same amount.</span> <span id="s43">My grandfather gave the same amount and this was very unique, and sure enough, after two years they lost all the money because they gave it to an uncle, to the bank, and the bank failed, so they lost everything and...but my father started later a trucking business.</span> <span id="s44">He was very successful and I remember till 1939 we were in the trucking business.</span> <span id="s45">He had trucks all over Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Can you tell me about the the kind of schools you went to when you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: I was going to my...I..</span> <span id="s48">.</span> <span id="s49">my grandparents and coming from my mother's side, very old _____, very famous rabbis which...going back which were known from the from all old kind, very famous.</span> <span id="s50">I mean not...I don't know if I can explain to you...it's not rabbis like we say here.</span> <span id="s51">It's something like ____ rabbis.</span> <span id="s52">You heard probably about that...that type, so naturally the family was very orthodox but as the generation go down, it was a little bit less, you know, and I went to ________.</span> <span id="s53">My mother was was so...my mother went to college.</span> <span id="s54">In that time for her grandfather to go to to college...this I remember that two days before she graduates since she supposed to encourage to go _____ for girl from my family, it was...it was a revolution, that my grandfather found out that she was dancing at a dance...you know, before graduation, with the boys, and she never graduate.</span> <span id="s55">It was forbidden.</span> <span id="s56">Alright.</span> <span id="s57">So that's how the type of ________.</span> <span id="s58">I went through school, but my my mother was very progressive and she wants...she took me out of school to send me to a private school...from the from a religious school to a private school but they taught religion too, and then they want to send me because I showed some accounting, they want to send me to Krakow to be...to a higher school of accounting and the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Can you tell me what happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: When the war broke out, the first day in 1939...as soon as the war broke out, the second day we had trucks that my father took the family, us and my uncle and another twenty people...whoever wanted to go...and we run away from Kielce to the Russian border to get away and I remember that my grandmother...this I saw with my own eyes...took out, at that time she had twenty thousand ______.</span> <span id="s61">It was a lot of money because it was...people never saw that type of money.</span> <span id="s62">She gave it to him, said whatever it will help him, keep it then.</span> <span id="s63">We went on the way to...we went on the way to the Russian border.</span> <span id="s64">It was about five, six hundred miles.</span> <span id="s65">On the way the German tanks were even ___.</span> <span id="s66">Killed two women on our truck.</span> <span id="s67">A truck...it was on the truck and in Europe at that time we had a General Motors truck, but the trucks were not covered.</span> <span id="s68">It was only a cover from canvas.</span> <span id="s69">You know, they didn't make trucks with the all all covered, so a few people were killed from the...from the Germans and we went to the city of Rovno and we heard that the Germans are coming.</span> <span id="s70">We wanted to go away to to Russia, and finally we went a few miles.</span> <span id="s71">The Russian army, they had a pact...the Russian army came in and we went back to Tuchin to a town of Tuchin that was about thirty kilometers from Rovno.</span> <span id="s72">People were very nice.</span> <span id="s73">They gave us a place where to stay and we lived there and the Germans...the Germans were, you know, they divided Poland between themself but after a while my mother went back because we didn't have...when we run away so fast we didn't no clothing, no nothing.</span> <span id="s74">We...when you live everyday...she went back and that time when other people went back to Poland to to come back but she never got to and she couldn't ____ because they closed the borders, the Russians did.</span> <span id="s75">So we stayed in Tuchin maybe a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Let me just...let me just ask one thing, so could you explain again what what did your mother do?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: My mother was a housewife, which was helping the business at the bookkeeping but she was...</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: No, no.</span> <span id="s79">When she got to...</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: To...to...to...to Kielce.</span> <span id="s81">She went back to Kielce.</span> <span id="s82">She stayed there, her home, because we left the business, that we left everything, that she wanted to liquidate, to bring things and come back to us, but she never...I never saw her after that.</span> <span id="s83">There was a lot of people used to go through the...through the border because it was right in the beginning in '39 and we really didn't know what the Germans are, that you can go but you can't come back.</span> <span id="s84">Nobody really I can see knew what to expect.</span> <span id="s85">They knew it's going to be a hardship, but nobody expected trouble.</span> <span id="s86">They're going to beat up a few things but there was no question, even for the Germans, because I pondered a lot of times and I ask questions why, because I'll tell you, explain later the reason which I could till today I don't understand because we went back to Lemberg (ph), OK, after a year.</span> <span id="s87">Am I so far OK?</span> <span id="s88">My mother went back and we stayed in in Tuchin.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: And then...</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Then Tuchin was too small for my father.</span> <span id="s91">We couldn't...we had to make a living so we went to Lemberg.</span> <span id="s92">It was a big town.</span> <span id="s93">It was in that time about twenty thousand refugees came from all over.</span> <span id="s94">Lemberg was the biggest town.</span> <span id="s95">You heard about Lemberg...Lvov (ph).</span> <span id="s96">But the living conditions and their hatred...not hatred but their disliking of the Russians with their lies, with their with their anti-religion, with their anti-...anti-behavior not against Jews but against everybody was so great that people registered.</span> <span id="s97">They were staying in line for three, four days, and they wanted to go back home, and I remember...I was at that time twelve, fourteen years old, and I remember that German officer, high officer came out because people were standing in the German Embassy because Russia in...had a pact at that time and I was there because we had to register to go back, especially...our mother was there.</span> <span id="s98">We want to go back to Kielce.</span> <span id="s99">And he said in German, Juden (ph), we don't want you.</span> <span id="s100">We don't like you.</span> <span id="s101">We hate you.</span> <span id="s102">Why do you want to go back?</span> <span id="s103">But I assume the dislike and the disappointment because who escaped...most wealthier people from from the people who had the means or like I say trucks and that and people were were anti-Communists.</span> <span id="s104">They they they were not officially anti-Communists like we know later, but they just didn't like the system.</span> <span id="s105">In Lemberg we had it very good, and I like to point out this, to tell this story...it has nothing to do with the Holocaust but it has to do with the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s106">My cousin...we were very extensive.</span> <span id="s107">We had over three hundred people in Poland, the family, very known from...the majority were well-off.</span> <span id="s108">It was so well-off that nobody came to America because we said we don't, we don't need it and we had it...they had a good life in Europe.</span> <span id="s109">Usually when people didn't a life, they couldn't make a living there, they went to America.</span> <span id="s110">That was the trend in Europe at that time.</span> <span id="s111">I had a cousin which was a son from a very wealthy family.</span> <span id="s112">They had a textile business, and he was the black sheep and he was the chief of the Communist Party and...not the chief of the Communist Party as such but the chief of Poland for the help NORP (ph) it was called, N - O - R - P, help for the prisoners of capitalists.</span> <span id="s113">Alright.</span> <span id="s114">He was an idealist and it just...it so happened...I don't know if this is something relevant to the case but attests a moral story to it which I would like to say.</span> <span id="s115">And he was put up the Red flag in the Polish parliament.</span> <span id="s116">That's how devoted he was, but he was an intellectual and he got ten years in there, ____ a real prison, Poland.</span> <span id="s117">When he was in Kielce and I was nine years old, nobody was in our house in Kielce and I remember he came...they let him out because they were helping him in prison.</span> <span id="s118">They let him out, and they said that he came in and four fellows carrying the books after him, you know.</span> <span id="s119">He had so many books from prison because he came...they let him out unexpectedly and he was grateful because his brothers came over to us to bring food to the prisoner.</span> <span id="s120">The prison was a dungeon.</span> <span id="s121">People were dying there from the wetness, you know, from...there were underground wetness and they they put them in there not to live.</span> <span id="s122">He was there ten years but being that they were rich, they bribed the authorities.</span> <span id="s123">They went out sooner.</span> <span id="s124">And this cousin came to to Lemberg and he became the director of the biggest textile store and at that time it was...you see in Russia you couldn't...if you worked, you could work a whole month and not earn for bread.</span> <span id="s125">You were hungry, but if you had a ______, _____ _____, you could live two months.</span> <span id="s126">Do you understand?</span> <span id="s127">And he was the director of the biggest biggest...is this...is this relevant or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: I'll tell you why it was relevant.</span> <span id="s130">You will find out if I..</span> <span id="s131">.</span> <span id="s132">he he was so dedicated but he was so disappointed.</span> <span id="s133">While he was there, with the Russian system, with the Communists, while he was sitting that he went out of his way...he took us in, you know, it was a line...people stay there three days...he took us in because me and my father, without the line, without waiting, two times a day.</span> <span id="s134">That's how we lived.</span> <span id="s135">We got ten yards of material.</span> <span id="s136">We sold it, but this was against his whole principle.</span> <span id="s137">He went to jail for that.</span> <span id="s138">He would have never done before the war because he was through and through and dedicated.</span> <span id="s139">Why was he disappointed?</span> <span id="s140">Communism is ____.</span> <span id="s141">Because all his friends what were sitting in jail, the rations put to ______.</span> <span id="s142">They told him...this is not hearsay but I heard it when I walked with my father and I have a good memory and I heard it when he was telling my father this, that they told them that we don't need Communism from Poland.</span> <span id="s143">If you're a good Communist, you should have stayed there and fight the Fascists.</span> <span id="s144">See Communists at that time didn't want, they didn't _______ because they were too smart, too wised up.</span> <span id="s145">Western Communists are no good, see.</span> <span id="s146">In in Poland, in Russia...</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Why...why don't we go back here...yeah, go back here to your story about your your being in Lvov.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Yes...but I I was...he returned to Po...to Germany to...he was so...that's what I wanted to say.</span> <span id="s149">He returned and the Germans killed him in a month, a horrible way.</span> <span id="s150">That's was one thing what I wanted to...in memory to him because he helped us in death.</span> <span id="s151">That's was...he hated so much ____ that he returned to to...then the Germans hunt him right away and they killed him in a most horrible way and that finishes the story.</span> <span id="s152">OK.</span> <span id="s153">We were in Lvow.</span> <span id="s154">We registered.</span> <span id="s155">The Russians came, one day in 1941...sometimes I can...you understand the _____...and they took all the Jews what registered to go back.</span> <span id="s156">They had a list and they took them to Siberia because they they were disappointed.</span> <span id="s157">How can people go back to Germany when we are living in paradise already?</span> <span id="s158">My father and my sister and I, we had a friend was worked uh a district attorney and he was a Party man and we were in his house hiding and they came in to look for us.</span> <span id="s159">They asked him, are you...do you have any foreigners here?</span> <span id="s160">He said no.</span> <span id="s161">And he was hiding...he showed his card and they let...they didn't look.</span> <span id="s162">In a way that minute it was lucky but it wasn't because otherwise maybe they would survived.</span> <span id="s163">Of course you never know what's happening.</span> <span id="s164">It was a time that you never knew what is right and what is wrong, what you're doing is good, what you're doing is bad, so we left, but whoever was...after when they took away all those people in tra...in in in trains without food, without that...they took them to Siberia.</span> <span id="s165">Whoever was left and he was a foreigner, they gave him a passport.</span> <span id="s166">They couldn't live hundred miles from the border, so we moved back to Tuchin.</span> <span id="s167">That's how we stayed back to Tuchin.</span> <span id="s168">We lived in Tuchin till 1942.</span> <span id="s169">That's why...then the Germans came in, naturally in 1941 and my father didn't...in Tuchin was a factory.</span> <span id="s170">Should I go now to Tuchin?</span> <span id="s171">In Tuchin was a factory which by our standards was very small, but in 1942 the Germans were freezing already near Stalingrad that time.</span> <span id="s172">Their clothes...they didn't have prepared themselves and we were making...in that factory they were making wool.</span> <span id="s173">You know, they have the sheep.</span> <span id="s174">They took...then they were making heavy material, so the Germans grabbed those things and that factory was a was two engineers.</span> <span id="s175">One was Gros (ph) and they were _____, from Lodz, which they were textile engineers and they were running that factory.</span> <span id="s176">The Germans came and they made a big deal out of it to enlarge the factory.</span> <span id="s177">My father became friends with Gros.</span> <span id="s178">He didn't...he was religious.</span> <span id="s179">He didn't work on Saturdays...</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: My father...so he talked to Gros and he said, you know, why don't you became overseer in the factory.</span> <span id="s182">The factory had also rooms and we moved in where the factory there has three rooms.</span> <span id="s183">You will be there the janitor and the overseer, everything.</span> <span id="s184">I mean...I don't mean the janitor but overseer.</span> <span id="s185">You will live there in the factory.</span> <span id="s186">So I..</span> <span id="s187">.</span> <span id="s188">we got connected to the factory and we...and we heard what was going on already.</span> <span id="s189">That time already we knew the tragedy what's happening because they start...in 1942 they starting already to killing Jews all over around, except in our town because that was...was three thousand in the small town Tuchin.</span> <span id="s190">Three thousand people.</span> <span id="s191">And me being young and there, I was kind of engrossed day in, day out, and one day...that was in 1941, Gros went with the car because we had always business in Rovno.</span> <span id="s192">Rovno was about thirty-five kilometers, a mile...I don't know exactly.</span> <span id="s193">I was in the car with him...</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s195">Did you work with Gros or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: I worked, yeah, and I did certain things, but I was young, you know, so I..</span> <span id="s197">.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Like like a go-for (ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s200">Right.</span> <span id="s201">The...I was with him every day because it was small and I..</span> <span id="s202">.</span> <span id="s203">he talked to me and in there it was Gros and there was another engineer which he wasn't that active.</span> <span id="s204">Gros was a great personality.</span> <span id="s205">He...he was dynamic.</span> <span id="s206">He was ___ and he was uncorruptible which was very rare.</span> <span id="s207">He didn't want to get rich, because at other times we had in different places that whoever was on the ruler, you know, they tried to...he didn't care.</span> <span id="s208">He was through and through a genuine to help, to help.</span> <span id="s209">There was also a director, a secre...an accountant, the main accountant which was Jewish.</span> <span id="s210">He he graduate from Berlin and the German made him a false Deutch (ph), which the only time what I heard that the Germans made a Jew a German, because they needed him and he spoke beautiful German.</span> <span id="s211">They were so impressed with him, they told him you are a German.</span> <span id="s212">But through and through he...he stayed away from...he wasn't that friendly.</span> <span id="s213">It didn't change but he was natural you know, and actually he was a false Deutsch (ph).</span> <span id="s214">You know what a false Deutch is?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Why don't you explain that?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: A false Deutsch means that he was a German but he was not born in Germany but he was from the German nation.</span> <span id="s217">All the Germans what lived out of Germany are considered false Deutsh.</span> <span id="s218">That's what also the things that Hitler wanted to take all the land till Slovakia (ph) and that's wherever a German lived, he said they're false Deutsch.</span> <span id="s219">They belong to Germany.</span> <span id="s220">That's called a false...false is nation, a national German or in other words.</span> <span id="s221">OK.</span> <span id="s222">So we lived there.</span> <span id="s223">The city...there was over three thousand people because other people came from all over, from Tuchin, and we were kind of privileged, the whole city, because of that factory.</span> <span id="s224">We got more food, that the ghetto was not built right away, but I remember in 1942...I don't remember the date...Gros said Herman, let's go.</span> <span id="s225">We're going to...to Rovno We came to Rovno.</span> <span id="s226">Before we came into the outskirts of Rovno, five German SS...I'm talking about ____.</span> <span id="s227">I think it was...more or less I recognized, you know, came over and they stopped the car.</span> <span id="s228">It was a chauffeur, me, and Gros and somebody else.</span> <span id="s229">Are you Herr Gros?</span> <span id="s230">He said yes.</span> <span id="s231">You have behaved from ___ Fuhrer, from ____, _____, you should go back to Tuchin.</span> <span id="s232">You can't get in to the city.</span> <span id="s233">He asked why, you know, because he felt with the Germans very, very open, very _____, because he knew the the top.</span> <span id="s234">So they said don't ask questions.</span> <span id="s235">Just go back.</span> <span id="s236">We got back and found out that that day they killed...I don't know exactly but to my knowledge twenty-two thousand Jews in in Rovno.</span> <span id="s237">That was the date and they wanted to save him, so they they turn us back.</span> <span id="s238">After that about a few weeks later, so we knew we were...the depression was going in already.</span> <span id="s239">We knew that...you see, it came gradually and like I mentioned before to the lady that in the places where the Russians were, this we knew and this I heard also from the Germans through Gros that there was not like in Poland.</span> <span id="s240">In Poland where the where the Germans were from the beginning, they put people to concentration camps, to arbeits lagers (ph) but where the Russians were, they abused older Jews, all the Jews were ninety percent under Communist, they are Jews of the old Communists, and they they very rarely took them to camps or to work, but they were mass murdered.</span> <span id="s241">They not...not even crematoriums, but they killed them...the open graves.</span> <span id="s242">They took Ukrainians and the Ukrainians did the killings.</span> <span id="s243">We came back and about a few weeks later I was in the office in the factory and they said there's some high Germans coming in to inspect the factory.</span> <span id="s244">Well, I was there because, you know, I was young so I could get in any place and I was sitting in a side and he came in and he introduced himself.</span> <span id="s245">It was...Gros was there, the other engineer and that false Deutsh, their accountant, and I was there...nobody else.</span> <span id="s246">And came in and said Reichsminister (ph) Rosenberg (ph), Alfred Rosenberg.</span> <span id="s247">I knew who Alfred Rosenberg was.</span> <span id="s248">Everybody knew.</span> <span id="s249">I knew him actually from the Nuremburg laws because he was the one what started the whole trouble.</span> <span id="s250">I didn't know...there was another guy.</span> <span id="s251">Alfred Rosenberg was slim.</span> <span id="s252">I remember him just like now, and the other fellow was Erich Koch.</span> <span id="s253">Erich Koch was the ______ from Prussia.</span> <span id="s254">I don't know if you know what the _____ is.</span> <span id="s255">The ________ was the government and Erich Rosenberg said that I just got a promotion from the Fuhrer that I am now the minister (ph) of all the territories what we took and at that time Germans was the height.</span> <span id="s256">They were up to Moscow and to Leningrad.</span> <span id="s257">It was 1942.</span> <span id="s258">I'm the _____ of all the territories what we took from the from the Russians.</span> <span id="s259">Actually _____, _______, east, OK.</span> <span id="s260">So he was the the main man, and they were talking what they can produce and how _____.</span> <span id="s261">Very, very cordial to to Gros and very...</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: And you were there in the room?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: I was there and sitting there, but I remembered what they did, what they do in _______.</span> <span id="s264">It's very hard to explain but as I'm sitting now, and I was fifteen years old, I thought and I was wondering if I would have a grenade, I would kill myself and I would kill Rosenberg and Gros and Koch and all of them in the house, if I could have it.</span> <span id="s265">This was just a childish way, but the bitterness what what I held from Rovno.</span> <span id="s266">They killed twenty-two Jews and and from Lemberg.</span> <span id="s267">You lived every day, but this was just, you know, something...a dream what a child can can dream, I would do that.</span> <span id="s268">It's even foolish to repeat but I'm repeating it what my thoughts were at that time, and while I was there, Gros said...this I remember...Herr Rosenberg, Herr Mini...Herr Mini... Herr Reichsminister...that's how they...I remember the word...Herr Reichsminister, __________.</span> <span id="s269">We are very productive Jews.</span> <span id="s270">This was the question...are you a productive?</span> <span id="s271">We thought at that time yet if you are a productive Jew, they'd let you live.</span> <span id="s272">If you're not a productive, they they will kill you.</span> <span id="s273">You see, the Germans, they were doing so systematically and I don't have to go into it because this was...a lot of people, everybody knows their system, you know, so I'm not going into it, but we thought...still thought that if we are so productive, if Rosenberg comes to a small town to us, we must be important, so he said, Herr Reichsminister, how's about to let us live.</span> <span id="s274">So for our town...you know we're only three thousand Jews.</span> <span id="s275">We're productive.</span> <span id="s276">We're working for the Germans.</span> <span id="s277">Let us live.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Let me ask this.</span> <span id="s279">Gros was Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: All the way.</span> <span id="s281">Yes.</span> <span id="s282">Jewish and Jewish.</span> <span id="s283">He had a Jewish girlfriend.</span> <span id="s284">He was married to a Jewish _______, and he never knew that he was going to be involved...he was a..</span> <span id="s285">.</span> <span id="s286">the time put him in he was an engineer from from Lodz, that time put him in to made...to be a leader, to do, but he was from ___ and ____, the ____, you know to a Jewish cause.</span> <span id="s287">He was not just a Jewish but he worked for the Germans, but this is...he wanted to save and he he wanted to save himself too, but being that he was the the whole...the whole _____, you know, the the key from the factory and with the Germans it's if you went to the higher echelon you could talk to them.</span> <span id="s288">It was just like uh _____ said...whoever's a Jew, I I decide.</span> <span id="s289">You understand.</span> <span id="s290">So when you talk to them, even if it was Rosenberg, the biggest murderer, or Koch, but if you were sitting with them, you talked like I'm talking with you.</span> <span id="s291">But he also said, they said Herr Gros, and this was the true words what I heard, ___________.</span> <span id="s292">I'm sorry to tell you...see he was...Germans were usually very polite, very nice.</span> <span id="s293">They kill you but they're very nice and very civilized.</span> <span id="s294">And they said ______.</span> <span id="s295">He didn't say you are Jew or death.</span> <span id="s296">No.</span> <span id="s297">______, but I have a ____, I have an order from the...I'm I'm repeating in German because his words...I'm...in my in my mind...I have order from Fuhrer that the _________...that means that no Jews can be alive.</span> <span id="s298">Then I started to think about...see before I didn't, but then I started to think, now I can come to ___ and I had that grenade because I saw that there's no end.</span> <span id="s299">Once he said this and he was...he was the god.</span> <span id="s300">He was...he was the life and death.</span> <span id="s301">When they went, Gros, my father, the owner, said there's no solution for us.</span> <span id="s302">We have no time.</span> <span id="s303">And we started to dig a bunker in the factory at night, throwing out the ground and dirt and digging and putting away the ground nobody should know, and we did this and this was around August they opened the ghetto.</span> <span id="s304">The first time in Tuchin, they put in all the Jews in the ghetto and also in the ghetto was a synagogue with warehouses and all the wheat, the corn what they took away from the peasants, they were storing there.</span> <span id="s305">They were storing the wheat full tons of tons.</span> <span id="s306">We told later if you will destroy that, the German army will starve, you know.</span> <span id="s307">I'm talking about myself.</span> <span id="s308">I said we as a as a young boy, you know.</span> <span id="s309">We actually moved into the ghetto but we had passes to go to the factory where we lived half-time in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s310">The ghetto was an open ghetto.</span> <span id="s311">You could come in and out.</span> <span id="s312">It wasn't like ghettos that police was around surrounded.</span> <span id="s313">Again, through the factory and through Gros and also the commandant knew that if Rosenberg comes in, he is good with Gros.</span> <span id="s314">He was the nicest guy and tried to accommodate because they were...Germans were always scared about higher.</span> <span id="s315">Gros may say something that we're not treated right, so even they were scared, so they treated us like with...the whole the whole Jewish and he promised them that nothing will happen to us.</span> <span id="s316">He didn't hear...he didn't know.</span> <span id="s317">The commandant from the city didn't know what Rosenberg, what I knew, when I was nobody but but we knew through Gros and we didn't tell nobody.</span> <span id="s318">Gros said not to say a word not to put a panic.</span> <span id="s319">The only people...I think what Gros did he went to the Jewish leadership there and told them that there's no solution, no way.</span> <span id="s320">So we lived in the ghetto and it came August and my father was going, still stayed in the factory, you know, and didn't come home and two days before Yom Kippur, September I think it was...I can't remember the date...the Jewish community surrendered the Jews, came together.</span> <span id="s321">They gave whoever was young they gave bottles of acid, you know, sulfuric acid.</span> <span id="s322">There was a few guns, a few deaths, which I didn't...I heard but I didn't see but a few young people had some, but they said if the Germans will come in, let's not die because we knew in Rovno they took them to the grave and they shot one by one.</span> <span id="s323">Let's kill as many Germans as we can.</span> <span id="s324">Let's burn the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: Had you or anyone uh seen these mass murders in Rovno or you just heard about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: People...if you saw them, you didn't hear about them.</span> <span id="s327">You understand?</span> <span id="s328">We came...we came to...the closest I can say whoever worked with the mass murderers in Rovno was like me and Gros sitting there, two miles away from the mass murders, and he said they're killing Jews and then we saw the graves.</span> <span id="s329">And then we saw there's no...see we went to Rovno later.</span> <span id="s330">There were graves but there was no Jews, so if you saw them, you didn't talk about them.</span> <span id="s331">You understand?</span> <span id="s332">Because there was no way to escape.</span> <span id="s333">Does this answer your question?</span> <span id="s334">You couldn't...you couldn't be there and escape because they were surrounded.</span> <span id="s335">We were talked about it and there were...you see, there was not only Germans.</span> <span id="s336">The problem was the Ukrainians were worse than the Germans.</span> <span id="s337">They made sure that nobody should escape.</span> <span id="s338">You could escape from a a wagon, from a train, but you couldn't escape if they surrounded you and they and they have mass...mass that you couldn't escape.</span> <span id="s339">There was no escape, not one to my knowledge.</span> <span id="s340">But we saw the graves later.</span> <span id="s341">I saw it where where they killed...it took place.</span> <span id="s342">We saw...this I saw before...the day before Yom Kippur that the Ukrainians were building right...not far.</span> <span id="s343">We could look...start digging graves.</span> <span id="s344">They didn't take any Jews to dig.</span> <span id="s345">Normally they took Jews to dig graves, but we, the three thousand people, very strong, very healthy because we had a good life till then, through the factory and through Gros' influence, we're not starving.</span> <span id="s346">Normally, the Germans starved that the people didn't have the strength to fight, to to resist.</span> <span id="s347">They starved them out slowly, slowly that they lost their fight.</span> <span id="s348">We were strong and healthy, not hungry, so when you have strength, you fight.</span> <span id="s349">You understand?</span> <span id="s350">You don't...you do whatever you could because you still have strength.</span> <span id="s351">That was the only difference and we saw that they're building graves and the day before Yom Kippur I remember I went out and I and I opened...it was a beautiful day I remember and I said it's so gorgeous.</span> <span id="s352">It's so beautiful.</span> <span id="s353">I'm fifteen years old and I have...and I have to die in this grave.</span> <span id="s354">I kept...I..</span> <span id="s355">.</span> <span id="s356">a day before Yom Kippur, my father came into the factory, to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s357">This I remember...they asked him why do you come back.</span> <span id="s358">Why do you come back?</span> <span id="s359">So he said, I want to be with my children.</span> <span id="s360">I..</span> <span id="s361">.</span> <span id="s362">me and my...I and my sister were were in the ghetto and then that they surrounded.</span> <span id="s363">You couldn't go out already.</span> <span id="s364">Before we could.</span> <span id="s365">Took away the passes, you know, the last day we couldn't get back, but in...they let in, so he didn't have to come but he came back.</span> <span id="s366">Naturally some fathers, you know, a father is a father.</span> <span id="s367">He wanted to come back.</span> <span id="s368">So we were talking, the the ____.</span> <span id="s369">We knew they're digging graves and we knew...we didn't know how they're going to come, how we have to fight them, how you have to use the bottles and whatever and right after Yom Kippur in the evening when I I..</span> <span id="s370">.</span> <span id="s371">around four...become dark, I fell asleep.</span> <span id="s372">What the Germans wanted to do was send in trucks and grab a few hundred people at a time and to take them out and to shot them and come back, slowly, gradually because they didn't want a fight because they didn't know...we were too too strong and too...they didn't have a division there, you know.</span> <span id="s373">They had...but they had the police and what I remember is I fell asleep and I woke up and I saw fire, more fire yet.</span> <span id="s374">You know, the ghetto in the small Polish towns were wooden...wooden houses.</span> <span id="s375">They were there.</span> <span id="s376">I woke up and I knew that it started.</span> <span id="s377">I looked for my father and sister.</span> <span id="s378">Couldn't find anybody.</span> <span id="s379">It was already fire, burning, yelling, people were burning, and the the Germans used a wooden gate.</span> <span id="s380">They didn't have to build a strong gate around the ghetto because there was...the ghetto was only short time that they had it from wood, so we had to run, to run away.</span> <span id="s381">I kept the bottles and whoever was right there, the Germans were there.</span> <span id="s382">We start throwing, throwing.</span> <span id="s383">Then the Germans start...this I saw, the Germans start burning the face.</span> <span id="s384">You know, when you...ashes when you get in face, it's not so pleasant, you know, but we knew that we can't, so what they did, they regrouped, and they got in one side with the machine guns.</span> <span id="s385">They saw that they can't do it and and it was also the order the first thing to burn the synagogue, the corn and the wheat.</span> <span id="s386">This was...if you have to die, let the food burn.</span> <span id="s387">Let them not...let them starve, you know, and our mind this was the the whole salvation because if if you if you think you catch...they say a razor blade, you know, even if you cut yourself.</span> <span id="s388">This was so far what we were talking to burn the the...nothing we could do.</span> <span id="s389">We were...we were defenseless.</span> <span id="s390">So I remember that I walked...while they were shooting from one side I walked to the other side.</span> <span id="s391">I don't know if it's northeast...I I don't know...and I, with this arm yet I pushed...and the hundreds of people with me, we pushed the the gate.</span> <span id="s392">The gate fell down.</span> <span id="s393">Then the gate fell down and we had to climb it.</span> <span id="s394">We started running.</span> <span id="s395">People started running, but when we start running, there was a Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s396">Usually the ghetto was right and the Jewish cemetery was on on the hill.</span> <span id="s397">The Germans, they were shooting but the bullets mostly hit the stone.</span> <span id="s398">Whoever fell, fell.</span> <span id="s399">Mostly they didn't do much but because they hit the stone.</span> <span id="s400">You know, we were after that...</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: So the gravestones gave you cover?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: The gravestones gave us cover.</span> <span id="s403">Otherwise nobody would have survived because they were standing there and we were on top.</span> <span id="s404">The gravestones gave us cover and I knew when I..</span> <span id="s405">.</span> <span id="s406">I can recall even now when I was running I knew every minute I would be hit from the back, but the stones...just you hear bouncing, you know, bouncing bullets.</span> <span id="s407">It was...and here the whole city was already...was burning.</span> <span id="s408">The whole ghetto was one, one big fire.</span> <span id="s409">Whoever could run, run.</span> <span id="s410">I was looking...my mother...while I was running...you see over there woods were...mostly wooded area.</span> <span id="s411">We were running to the woods.</span> <span id="s412">It was about ten kilometers, but I got in in in the place where we lived was a family Constant...from Constantinople...Constanople.</span> <span id="s413">A father...his name was Kagan (ph), and he had a daughter my age, a real pretty girl I remember, you know, and he said, while we were...they run away from their ghetto to us, so we knew each other and three other fellows what they knew Kagan.</span> <span id="s414">I couldn't find my sister and and father so I was with them, and we were running together, and we run into the woods.</span> <span id="s415">To the woods, it was very...not woods, you know, maybe two, two miles and those part, two mile woods was nothing because there were five hundred mile woods later, further up, you know.</span> <span id="s416">Big woods going into Russia.</span> <span id="s417">Those are still wild country, you know, with woods.</span> <span id="s418">In the morning...it was already in the morning because we started later.</span> <span id="s419">We woke there and then we saw that we were quite a big amount of people and we got Kagan...I was the youngest so with with the girl was Kagan and the all three but there were three brothers.</span> <span id="s420">Said this is not the place to stay.</span> <span id="s421">The Germans will come tomorrow and they will kill us all because there's no place here.</span> <span id="s422">I mean we're open here.</span> <span id="s423">The three brothers suggested they have about twenty miles away from there, thirty miles away were the big woods.</span> <span id="s424">There were ________.</span> <span id="s425">_____ is like a lord.</span> <span id="s426">You know, in Polish a _____.</span> <span id="s427">_____ is German.</span> <span id="s428">______________.</span> <span id="s429">In the woods where he used to own that land, there were woods going they said up to Kiev.</span> <span id="s430">I didn't measure them but there were for hundreds of hundreds of miles woods, and each mile, each kilometer...I'm talking mile but it was kilometer...had a measure, a number, you know, not to get lose, and it had a little...for horses to go through because they cut...when they cut the wood, so they had...it was like a road, like a city from woods.</span> <span id="s431">But also was cut out pieces where Ukrainian villages were there, so he said let's run away.</span> <span id="s432">I..</span> <span id="s433">.</span> <span id="s434">we are from that part and I know people what we gave away everything what we had, and they will help us.</span> <span id="s435">They would hide us.</span> <span id="s436">Let's go.</span> <span id="s437">We went.</span> <span id="s438">We went through a water that I remember.</span> <span id="s439">It was already late.</span> <span id="s440">Over there it's it's cold, and we came to that to that village.</span> <span id="s441">I remember they gave us food.</span> <span id="s442">We went into the people what they they were friends from that...they were from that village.</span> <span id="s443">They were very nice to them.</span> <span id="s444">They gave us...we were hungry.</span> <span id="s445">Hunger doesn't stop, no matter what, no matter how ___ you are, especially when you are young.</span> <span id="s446">And I remember I fainted.</span> <span id="s447">I fainted and I fell down and somehow I woke up and I said why did I..</span> <span id="s448">.</span> <span id="s449">to Kagan I said why did I wake up.</span> <span id="s450">I didn't...so he said somebody will cry.</span> <span id="s451">This is a time not to be sorry.</span> <span id="s452">He wanted to give me...to grow up, I should grow up, you know.</span> <span id="s453">This is not a time to cry.</span> <span id="s454">If you...if you didn't get up, you didn't get up.</span> <span id="s455">We stayed there for two days I think and we found out that they killed the three brothers.</span> <span id="s456">The Ukrainians killed the three brothers.</span> <span id="s457">They came up to us, without...without shame and they said we don't have nothing against you, to Kagan, to his sister, to me.</span> <span id="s458">They gave us a lot of things, everything what they had and we were scared that they would want it back, so we killed them.</span> <span id="s459">Just plain ________.</span> <span id="s460">And you can run.</span> <span id="s461">You can go.</span> <span id="s462">We don't have nothing against you.</span> <span id="s463">We went away from there and we went to the woods, looking where going.</span> <span id="s464">We went to the woods and there was a small village and it was only one house.</span> <span id="s465">Before the village was one house, outside, out ___.</span> <span id="s466">Again we were hungry.</span> <span id="s467">When you have...when you are hungry, you don't care where you're going or the enemy because the hunger, starvation...the air is good.</span> <span id="s468">The air was fresh.</span> <span id="s469">When I..</span> <span id="s470">.</span> <span id="s471">when I think about it now, why did we...you know, they were Ukrainians, enemy territory, just just like that, but there's no other place to go, and we knocked and there was...came out a young man.</span> <span id="s472">The man was in pretty good _____, had a wife and a little baby.</span> <span id="s473">Oh...stay with me.</span> <span id="s474">We're going...he gave us food, kept us.</span> <span id="s475">We stayed there three days or four days.</span> <span id="s476">He was very nice to us.</span> <span id="s477">Kagan, at that time he around forty years old.</span> <span id="s478">You know, when you are fifty and forty, you're an old man.</span> <span id="s479">He was wearing a chain.</span> <span id="s480">You know, in the olden days, you saw the double chain with a pair of boots.</span> <span id="s481">Boots, new, nice boots.</span> <span id="s482">When I run away because I slept, I put on shoes that...old shoes, you know, because I I got dressed quick because I saw the fire, but he probably didn't sleep.</span> <span id="s483">He was

boots.</span> <span id="s488">That was enough.</span> <span id="s489">They took...the Germans was the love... salt was the very, very dear, very rare over there.</span> <span id="s490">If you brought in a Jew, the Germans paid a half a pound, a pound or half a pound of salt for each Jew.</span> <span id="s491">Plenty Jews were killed for that salt and if he had a gold watch with boots, was worth hundred pounds of salt.</span> <span id="s492">I remember it was Saturday night, and Michov (ph), he liked me and he said you know, you sleep.</span> <span id="s493">They had, you know, very primitive houses with the the straw covers you had which you don't even probably saw in your life, but outside were for the cow or for...you know, the straw and the...whatever they had some land because it was woods so they didn't have too much land.</span> <span id="s494">He said that Kagan and the daughter should sleep there.</span> <span id="s495">It wasn't that cold.</span> <span id="s496">It was warm, and I should sleep inside.</span> <span id="s497">I slept Saturday night and Sunday morning I woke up and I see Michov walked in a little drunk and he was wearing the chain and the boots.</span> <span id="s498">____ the dumbness, the stupidity...I don't know...fear I didn't have because there was nothing to fear.</span> <span id="s499">I asked him, Michov, where you take the watch and the boots.</span> <span id="s500">That's not yours.</span> <span id="s501">That's Kagan's.</span> <span id="s502">So he said I'll be honest with you.</span> <span id="s503">I killed him.</span> <span id="s504">He was an old man and didn't want to live, so I killed him.</span> <span id="s505">But you, I'm going to keep you for the whole winter here.</span> <span id="s506">Don't be afraid.</span> <span id="s507">You have nothing.</span> <span id="s508">That was his words, and I remember them just like now, so I said...</span></p> <p><span id="s509">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span

_______.</span> <span id="s521">See, I was already torn up.</span> <span id="s522">My clothes were torn up so they looked...I knew already that I looked...even I didn't look what they called the Jewish look.</span> <span id="s523">You understand?</span> <span id="s524">I never looked, you know, but when you are depressed, when you are turned up, at that time you you looked strange, you knew

<span id="s637">They had built up from wood houses.</span> <span id="s638">They had a fire in in the back.</span> <span id="s639">There was no chimney and the fire was going out through the

<span id="s647">He was from Poland so he...the other people were from the small...from the other towns.</span> <span id="s648">They were...I was a..</span> <span id="s649">.</span> <span id="s650">you

id="s655">But he had food for himself.</span> <span id="s656">We had to go at night or in daytime and to beg for food.</span> <span id="s657">My shoes were gone, so I had from wood made, you know, rags and that and around and we were every...once a week we were going to to the villages and to ask for food.</span> <span id="s658">The Polish village was too far and it was cold but the Ukrainian village was closer.</span> <span id="s659">One day I went into a village with another girl.</span> <span id="s660">The girl which was was theirs.</span> <span id="s661">She later died, and we knocked

They'll kill us.</span> <span id="s666">They came in and one man was from from Tuchin and he knew about my father, about Gros, so he said today we don't kill Jews.</span> <span id="s667">That was his word.</span> <span id="s668">I remember when they knocked.</span> <span id="s669">They came in, about five, six men, so I asked him how come.</span> <span id="s670">You see, because it was...I asked questions which normally, in normal time you don't...you don't ask, but there was a question that I knew they do, you understand, and I asked him that question how come you don't kill today, so he said because we are now negotiating with the Russian partisans to fight against the Germans and it will take about another three days, and we better not catch you.</span> <span id="s671">If it doesn't go through, we better not catch you in three days.</span> <span id="s672">They gave me the best food what I had in months.</span> <span id="s673">They treated me nice and they told me to go, so actually it's just like you were in the lion's...in the lion's den and you escaped in the right time.</span> <span id="s674">So you see, I..</span> <span id="s675">.</span> <span id="s676">so I start asking myself questions, how can luck bring you because he told me if we would catch you yesterday, we would have killed you because this just came out.</span> <span id="s677">So I went back and I stayed there in the woods, you know, but I was hungry.</span> <span id="s678">You had to go again to eat.</span> <span id="s679">What did we get?</span> <span id="s680">We get potatoes.</span> <span id="s681">Boiled potatoes without salt, the stomach can ____ but that was the only thing what they gave us and some...we had places.</span> <span id="s682">One time I went into a Ukrainian house for

id="s685">I was young still and I jumped out.</span> <span id="s686">I was alert and it went through the wood.</span> <span id="s687">Otherwise it would went through me, and I run out because he didn't...he didn't like me, but somebody else, the same Ukra...the Ukrainians gave me food.</span> <span id="s688">They gave me a few potatoes and some told me come over ____, ___________.</span> <span id="s689">This I remember because I I learned Ukrainian or even if I wasn't a native there, I was a stranger, but this was _______.</span> <span id="s690">Some have a war and to some people, there's a war and to some it doesn't matter (ph).</span> <span id="s691">You understand?</span> <span id="s692">For them, it's the matter (ph).</span> <span id="s693">They live good now.</span> <span id="s694">But a month later I went again with the same...I I walked with the same girl.</span> <span id="s695">There was other places but she lived in the same...in the same house so we went to back together.</span> <span id="s696">You had to go about three, five miles.</span> <span id="s697">This was...already the snow was very high but we always tried to go when it's snowing that the Germans shouldn't come back and find out where we are, so when the snow start falling, we walked and then it fell back so it shouldn't leave any...you get...when you live in the woods, you get very smart.</span> <span id="s698">You...you learn.</span> <span id="s699">Though I never lived in a small town or small village...I was born in a big city, you get to learn like _____, you know.</span> <span id="s700">You get to learn how to live with the nature and I remember we walked out to a village and maybe thirty people, Ukrainians, surrounded us, both of us and they said where should be kill them.</span> <span id="s701">Here or in the woods?</span> <span id="s702">The woods was like from here to next block, two blocks so they...the others said why should we kill here.</span> <span id="s703">We'll take them to the woods.</span> <span id="s704">There nobody had to bother with him and while I was talking, the leader was talking to me, an old lady, an old woman, came out and she happened to be the mother of the leader.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: You're saying that the same old lady you'd seen before?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s707">This was different story.</span> <span id="s708">The mother of the the other one was a police Ukrainian...a German Ukrainian policeman.</span> <span id="s709">He...this one was a ________.</span> <span id="s710">They were partisans.</span> <span id="s711">See, it's different...between working for the Germans as police and being, you know, like like a like SS.</span> <span id="s712">Those were partisans.</span> <span id="s713">They were fighting.</span> <span id="s714">See, the Germans, the Ukrainians worked for the Germans, were German helpers on the German payroll.</span> <span id="s715">This were Ukrainian partisan which wanted a free Ukraine.</span> <span id="s716">They were nationalists.</span> <span id="s717">They killed Jews the same way.</span> <span id="s718">It has nothing to do but with the nationalists, their aim was not to so much love to the Germans but love to the country, to to Ukraine and to have a free...and they thought the Germans would give them which they would never do, but they thought the Germans would give them a free Ukraine.</span> <span id="s719">Right.</span> <span id="s720">You see, you know, politics was involved in that, but that was a different...but the old lady, the mother from the leader, from that Ukrainian run out and she grabbed the gun from him.</span> <span id="s721">I remember a small lady and he was a tall guy, a strong guy.</span> <span id="s722">Somehow he didn't expect because the mother, she start to to hug him and she grabbed the gun and she was holding the gun to him, and she said those are two children.</span> <span id="s723">If you kill them, I'll kill you.</span> <span id="s724">I I remember that the other Ukrainians, you know, they they got they got kind of shocked, you know.</span> <span id="s725">She was a good woman.</span> <span id="s726">She meant it just why should they kill us.</span> <span id="s727">And they said run.</span> <span id="s728">Run to the woods.</span> <span id="s729">We start running and every minute, even the the five hundred or thousand yards was like miles because I thought somebody from them would shot me, but she would have killed him probably.</span> <span id="s730">They would shot me in the back.</span> <span id="s731">We run in the woods and we were free already.</span> <span id="s732">We were saved.</span> <span id="s733">Again things like that doesn't happen, but it happened.</span> <span id="s734">But we realized...there were about five boys of us and my age...we realized that there's no life to go and beg and to to be killed, you know.</span> <span id="s735">Someday the luck will run out and the same time we we dropped the Polish, the the Ukrainian villages and went further to the Polish villages, but the Polish village, the Polish people...there were three hundred and eighty people there.</span> <span id="s736">They were very nice to us.</span> <span id="s737">They gave us food.</span> <span id="s738">They were working with the partisans and one day they were surrounded by Germans.</span> <span id="s739">The Germans sent in the army, the regular army and they took all the men and they shot them.</span> <span id="s740">Three hundred and eighty people they shot.</span> <span id="s741">The women, they shot and they killed them.</span> <span id="s742">They they poisoned.</span> <span id="s743">They didn't shot them but they gave them some some injection, something.</span> <span id="s744">Nobody, not one survived from that the whole village.</span> <span id="s745">That was a few villages, Polish villages, where they shot everybody.</span> <span id="s746">They did the same thing what they did, claiming that they are sympathetic to the to the partisan, to the Russian partisans.</span> <span id="s747">So we...the roads to beg or to eat were cut off, so we decided, five of us, that we are going to look for the partisans.</span> <span id="s748">We knew that the Russian partisans, there was a Russian partisan by the name of ______.</span> <span id="s749">That's Colonel Niewiedow (ph).</span> <span id="s750">Niewiedow.</span> <span id="s751">They were the lead partisan organization in the whole Ukraine which eighty percent were sent out from Moscow.</span> <span id="s752">Normally there were two kind of partisans, the Russians.</span> <span id="s753">There were partisans they organized, natives, whoever wanted but the Ukrainians were against the Russians, so they didn't have much to organize.</span> <span id="s754">They had a very rough deal because they were against them, so they had to bring Russian people to fight the Germans, and those were the the true partisan uh ______ to send out, you know, from _____.</span> <span id="s755">Later I found out seventy percent were Spanish people, not for Spanish but Spain, for Franco (ph), the ones what were in the civil war.</span> <span id="s756">That was a real intellectual...the real...the war that's coming in was were fighting Franco.</span> <span id="s757">When Franco won the war in Spain, they went to Russia and Russia didn't play much.</span> <span id="s758">They trained them and they they...Russian always was like England, fighting to the last Eng...to the last Indian soldier.</span> <span id="s759">The Russians did the same thing.</span> <span id="s760">They sent them out because it was a very dangerous mission, to send out the Spanish Communists.</span> <span id="s761">Again, they didn't want them in Russia because they had enough Communists there.</span> <span id="s762">OK.</span> <span id="s763">As you can see, I'm not such a great lover although they saved my life, you know, but that's the truth.</span> <span id="s764">That was Spanish...very fine, very fine people, very...very...they were not the average Russian partisan, the average soldier.</span> <span id="s765">Each one was with a personality.</span> <span id="s766">We met some Ukrainian...some partisans and they told us sorry, we don't take.</span> <span id="s767">What did you do?</span> <span id="s768">See, without without ammunition.</span> <span id="s769">We said how we get ammunition.</span> <span id="s770">Go take a stick and kill a German, take his gun or his rifle and come to us.</span> <span id="s771">Then you'll fight.</span> <span id="s772">It's easier said than to do because the Germans were twelve feet tall in our eyes.</span> <span id="s773">We were young and anyway the Germans were the the the rulers there.</span> <span id="s774">How can you go and kill?</span> <span id="s775">I I stayed away as far as I can from a German and they told us to take a stick and kill a German.</span> <span id="s776">Again, the same story.</span> <span id="s777">Everybody was _____.</span> <span id="s778">So we decided, four of us, four or five young boys...there's only way how to get to the partisans, cause we knew we can't survive.</span> <span id="s779">We didn't know when it's going to end and the woods was cold.</span> <span id="s780">It was forty below zero with no clothing, no food, no nothing.</span> <span id="s781">The older people stayed there.</span> <span id="s782">We're going to see how the the horses with the with the sleds, and we're going to follow and it happened that we saw a partisan with a sled and he happened to be Jewish.</span> <span id="s783">We went over to him.</span> <span id="s784">We told him who we are.</span> <span id="s785">He said I can't take you, but follow...don't say a word but follow my road and you'll get there.</span> <span id="s786">That's all he said.</span> <span id="s787">He went away.</span> <span id="s788">We waited for an hour.</span> <span id="s789">It wasn't snowing, and we followed.</span> <span id="s790">We followed maybe five, six miles, and once we we were going, they came out and said hand, you know, raise your hands.</span> <span id="s791">And they took all five five of us separate places.</span> <span id="s792">How did you get here?</span> <span id="s793">So I said we saw...we were looking for the partisans.</span> <span id="s794">We want to fight.</span> <span id="s795">We are against the Germans and we saw a road.</span> <span id="s796">We want to fight.</span> <span id="s797">Where are your guns?</span> <span id="s798">We don't have any guns.</span> <span id="s799">We're going to send you back and we made up, if they told us they send back, what we have to say.</span> <span id="s800">We have to say two things we agreed.</span> <span id="s801">We want to be killed by a Russian bullet, not by German.</span> <span id="s802">That was appeal (ph) to the Russians, and if they...if we'll see they don't want to take us, they should be aware that if the Germans catch us, we don't...we're not responsible what we're going to say.</span> <span id="s803">We had to use threat.</span> <span id="s804">To use threat to the Russians was pretty desperate, but we had no other way.</span> <span id="s805">They they took each one because they thought they didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: And these these were the parti...the partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: These were partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: The the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s810">They didn't know if the Germans sent us.</span> <span id="s811">They didn't know how we got there and they were...had to be careful too so they took each one separate and start asking questions, how we got to them, because if we can get to them, the Germans can get to them.</span> <span id="s812">You understand?</span> <span id="s813">So we didn't blame them.</span> <span id="s814">They heard one saying we want to...we want to fight.</span> <span id="s815">We wanted this, and they decided to take us in because...decided not because we want to die for them but they were afraid that if the Germans catch us, they would...we will say...I mean they would say or something...they will they will force us, you know, to to say where they are.</span> <span id="s816">So the Germans were not close, but they were afraid to go in because they didn't know how strong the partisans are, and they also didn't know...you can't attack somebody in the woods because a division can't do...they didn't have that many divisions but they can't send in because they don't know where they're going to be hit.</span> <span id="s817">You can hide, you know, three people, ten people, a hundred can keep up a whole a whole brigade if you don't know where you're going to be hit.</span> <span id="s818">Soon as they took us in, they took all our clothes because we were in a horrible stage.</span> <span id="s819">They burned everything what we had.</span> <span id="s820">They gave us new clothing.</span> <span id="s821">It was like a paradise.</span> <span id="s822">They gave us...they had the same thing made from wood, but they had I remember _____ uh uh Persian carpets were laid down.</span> <span id="s823">It was something like a new life.</span> <span id="s824">Next day came out.</span> <span id="s825">They took us to the commandant, you know, to the chief took us there, starting to ask the story, and who was sitting there...Gros.</span> <span id="s826">Gros saw me.</span> <span id="s827">Start hugging.</span> <span id="s828">The commandant looked...start hugging and kissing me.</span> <span id="s829">He said why didn't you say something.</span> <span id="s830">How would I know?</span> <span id="s831">We would have taken you in right away and I told him.</span> <span id="s832">He took me away.</span> <span id="s833">He was the engineer, the ____.</span> <span id="s834">He was the...this this partisan specially was sent in to break, to undermine bridges.</span> <span id="s835">The Germans were sending trains to the front and they also cut the woods in order to be safe because they had machine guns on top because the partisans were...their mission was to destroy all the trains because if you less ammunition will go to the front, the less the Russians will be killed and that was their mission.</span> <span id="s836">They were ______.</span> <span id="s837">In Russian it is ______.</span> <span id="s838">Their mission was to to...very dangerous there because about twenty feet, thirty feet they cut out all the woods so you had to take off the train and they were standing on top watching, so what did we do?</span> <span id="s839">We undermined and we were staying there and we, you know, like...how to explain to it...turn off the trains when they were shooting us, we had to run away right away and it was a quick...a hit and miss but the train had to go.</span> <span id="s840">So they had to train us.</span> <span id="s841">It took time, but in the meantime I asked Gros what happened and I was telling him the story because I didn't know what's happened in Tuchin, what has...so he was telling me and I found out the truth, that after when they burned the ghetto, my...when I was running through the woods, my father, my sister, they were stayed together and some twenty other people what worked in the factory and Gros himself went to the bunker.</span> <span id="s842">They were there for three days because there was enough prepared food, everything.</span> <span id="s843">And a Ukrainian told the German and they shot everybody except Gros.</span> <span id="s844">They pulled Gros...he should train...Jews (ph)...he should train Ukrainians in the factory they should work.</span> <span id="s845">Naturally they didn't they didn't do nothing to the false Deutch, so they had there and Gros.</span> <span id="s846">Gros told me that he was in contact with the partisans.</span> <span id="s847">He was working all the time...from the beginning he was in contact.</span> <span id="s848">He was working on both sides.</span> <span id="s849">He knew what the Germans, everything was told to the high echelon, to the partisans, so he was like like a double...you understand.</span> <span id="s850">But so Gros realized there's no more Jews.</span> <span id="s851">Why should he train them.</span> <span id="s852">Next day they send in partisans and they took George, and they took Gros with them.</span> <span id="s853">He became the assistant from the comman...from the commandeer (ph) for he was an engineer.</span> <span id="s854">We had to build bridges.</span> <span id="s855">We had to do that.</span> <span id="s856">He was...he was very high up, you know, almost the second in command.</span> <span id="s857">I told George, Gros, he kind of felt kind of in a way that I'm the only survivor, that special...you know, watch.</span> <span id="s858">I I told him, first of all I told him about Weinka.</span> <span id="s859">See I knew only...deep down at that time I had the worst hatred to Ukrainians because I saw what they did, and the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s860">They went knives and they were cutting than to Germans, because I didn't see with my own eyes any atrocities from Germans, but I saw from Ukrainians what they...whatever your eyes see, you understand.</span> <span id="s861">From the Germans I heard, I knew, but Ukrainian I saw with my own eyes, so I told them about Weinka.</span> <span id="s862">He's dead, and they took care of Weinka with with the family, but I asked one question.</span> <span id="s863">I asked a favor from the chief, from the from the few people what they sent to Weinka.</span> <span id="s864">They caught Weinka on a Sunday...to save the mother because she gave me food.</span> <span id="s865">In the state where Weinka lived in the house, they digged out maybe thirty to forty graves, pieces.</span> <span id="s866">They found chandeliers, all the Jewish from Rovno, gold, silver...not pieces but I would say tons.</span> <span id="s867">You know, great big big things what Weinka with their three brothers, what they had over there put away and mostly silver things.</span> <span id="s868">You know, mostly religious silver things which which...he definitely didn't have it when his father.</span> <span id="s869">They took care of Weinka with the family.</span> <span id="s870">Then...</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: When you said they took care, they...what did they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: I don't want to even go into that what they did to him, but he didn't die a nice death.</span> <span id="s873">They hanged him but they burned him also.</span> <span id="s874">I mean whatever he did to twenty-two thousand people was not enough, but that's all what could be done and and Gros told to the commander that they should listen to me what...I was I was...you know, I was a new recruit, but I had somebody behind me.</span> <span id="s875">Again, and to ____ and they they did to Weinka things which in a in a normal society, you don't do, OK.</span> <span id="s876">But the mother...I said not till she run away.</span> <span id="s877">I was sorry for her because she she gave me food.</span> <span id="s878">You know, it wasn't there, but she had children like that what they they were murderers.</span> <span id="s879">Not only murderers but but they they they were the known...Weinka...I don't know if anybody else...I never mentioned Weinka before until now and I don't know if if...but this is the Weinka what what was sitting...people from Rovno mentioned he was sitting near the grave with the machine gun and he was shooting people, so how could I..</span> <span id="s880">.</span> <span id="s881">you see, the funny thing is that I always had even now feelings, blood, that I can't see blood.</span> <span id="s882">I faint.</span> <span id="s883">I used to faint when I was a child and I even faint now when I see blood.</span> <span id="s884">I didn't faint when I saw Weinka's blood.</span> <span id="s885">My heart turned to stone and I had only lived for revenge and revenge makes you an animal.</span> <span id="s886">You know, it doesn't...it takes away all humil...humility.</span> <span id="s887">It takes you...it makes you wild, a beast and and I knew that I'm only a few survivors.</span> <span id="s888">I didn't know how many people survived, you know, in that time, but I knew I'm the one and as long as I'm alive and I have the power, I have to do to take advantage.</span> <span id="s889">OK.</span> <span id="s890">(Crying)</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: Just take a moment.</span> <span id="s892">It's OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: I also wanted to take care of Michau (ph).</span> <span id="s894">Michau killed Kagan for no reason, for gold, but the wife and the child didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s895">Michau was a different case.</span> <span id="s896">He was an individual murderer, you know, and I always lived not to hurt things, to people what they didn't do nothing, only what they did and not by association.</span> <span id="s897">I didn't want to kill Michau.</span> <span id="s898">I didn't want to do anything to Michau but I told again through Gros to the partisans what Michau did and the funniest thing is I forgot one thing to mention.</span> <span id="s899">In the partisans, I found Kagan's daughter.</span> <span id="s900">When she run away in the woods, the partisans caught her.</span> <span id="s901">Being a girl, they took her.</span> <span id="s902">But I was very disappointed.</span> <span id="s903">She fell in love with a..</span> <span id="s904">.</span> <span id="s905">I saw her...a matter of fact, in the partisans she was sick.</span> <span id="s906">She had some cold.</span> <span id="s907">They had a little hospital for...they had doctors there.</span> <span id="s908">It was a whole...it it wasn't just a few...a few partisans.</span> <span id="s909">It was a whole like a battalion, you know, people, hundreds of people.</span> <span id="s910">I saw her and I told her that, you know, Michau killed your father and that and she was kind of indifferent.</span> <span id="s911">I don't know if what happened to her, what her mind was...I really don't know, so I realized that with her I can't do much.</span> <span id="s912">I told Gros and Gros gave an order.</span> <span id="s913">They shot...they they throw Michau to the to the...they took him to the woods and they shot him.</span> <span id="s914">They shot him also because they are afraid that he will be a traitor.</span> <span id="s915">If he could do like that, he will be a traitor to the Germans, and the partisans didn't play in that time too much with human life.</span> <span id="s916">Human life was very, very cheap.</span> <span id="s917">So we went with the partisans.</span> <span id="s918">We stayed there for a long time until one day...</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: Let me assess this.</span> <span id="s920">When you with the partisans, did you participate in in raids?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: In everything.</span> <span id="s922">There was no, no...nothing was Gros should try to save me or nothing.</span> <span id="s923">He wouldn't do that.</span> <span id="s924">He wouldn't do that.</span> <span id="s925">He...Gros was a very principle...he had a principle and he didn't...he...I..</span> <span id="s926">.</span> <span id="s927">in raids and burning and and dangerous thing.</span> <span id="s928">He he was like whatever has to do with death, my my luck, you know, and he would never go against, you know, because they knew, his chief knew and everybody knew that he is my protegee, so he wouldn't save me for for anything.</span> <span id="s929">It would be something serious.</span> <span id="s930">If I would do something wrong, probably he would try to save me, but to go...missions had nothing to do with him because he was not a military leader.</span> <span id="s931">He was only their assistant to the ___ but he was mostly building bridges, preparing how to do things, but he was not the one what told them how to go to shoot, to break up the bridges, so I participate and not...all of us, all five of us...there was no difference.</span> <span id="s932">After a while they told us, they spending...spent day and night.</span> <span id="s933">They told us how to do and what to do and how to break and how to put the dynamite and how to escape and how to death (ph) and who was wounded, just like anybody else, and it was going around for six months I would say.</span> <span id="s934">One day...and I didn't know why and when...it was already '43.</span> <span id="s935">They send us...they took us, all five of us, and they said you are dismissed from the partisans.</span> <span id="s936">Never happened...nobody is dismissed.</span> <span id="s937">You...only you you you die or they shoot you, you know.</span> <span id="s938">We didn't do anything wrong.</span> <span id="s939">We didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s940">I was...we were disappointed.</span> <span id="s941">What do you mean you're going to dismiss us?</span> <span id="s942">But we cooled off a little bit.</span> <span id="s943">Gros came out, not to them, to me.</span> <span id="s944">He said we are going on a very serious mission.</span> <span id="s945">We're going together with Kovpak (ph).</span> <span id="s946">Kovpak was the biggest partisan...was a whole army, and we're going to fight with the German army, playing (ph) very serious mission and you are five young boys.</span> <span id="s947">I can't dismiss you alone.</span> <span id="s948">I want you should be alive.</span> <span id="s949">The war is going to pretty soon end, and I want you should survive, somebody should survive.</span> <span id="s950">I can't do it to you alone.</span> <span id="s951">I have to do it to all five of you, so don't feel bad that you didn't fight good, that you are not good soldiers, but I want to do that thing for you.</span> <span id="s952">He took in clothing, regular clothing, you know, to barter, to to live something.</span> <span id="s953">They send us out.</span> <span id="s954">We felt...even all that, we felt kind of disillusioned, as a child, you know.</span> <span id="s955">We found out two months later that they they killed sixty percent of the of the partisans.</span> <span id="s956">The whole German army when starting...the Russians starting coming back, they had an order to fight the German army and the partisans had no heavy artillery, nothing heavy and how could they survive.</span> <span id="s957">They they they...I never knew what happened to Gros.</span> <span id="s958">I later heard that he was in Poland.</span> <span id="s959">He was a minister of something of...but I never was in touch with him, but in his own way he tried, I felt, to save my life and he didn't try to save my life because it was like a symbol.</span> <span id="s960">Somebody...see, because he didn't know either who survived.</span> <span id="s961">It was such a time that we didn't know if there is anybody survived.</span> <span id="s962">You understand?</span> <span id="s963">In his eyes, I was the only one what survived to be to tell the story, so I took...we got back to the same place where we were and we're waiting and three months later the army came, the Russian army.</span> <span id="s964">And at that same place with us was the Polish family, the one what told me, the policeman...he was hiding there too because the Ukrainians wanted to kill him.</span> <span id="s965">And the Russian army came in.</span> <span id="s966">We heard that the Russian army on Rovno, you know.</span> <span id="s967">It was around thirty kilometers, thirty-five kilometers, forty, where we were.</span> <span id="s968">I don't remember how many kilometers...it's not important.</span> <span id="s969">He told me, you know, Heinrich (ph), let's go back now.</span> <span id="s970">We are safe.</span> <span id="s971">And I said you know, I want to go back with the soldiers.</span> <span id="s972">I wanted soldiers.</span> <span id="s973">I wanted to see Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s974">I don't want to go back, and it so happened that a day later, one day later, came in a column of Russian soldiers, the Russian army.</span> <span id="s975">All of us what we were there ___ went with them to go to the city.</span> <span id="s976">And about fifty miles, we fell on him.</span> <span id="s977">We went to a Ukrainian town.</span> <span id="s978">We saw him and his family.</span> <span id="s979">He he had about five, six children, young children, Polish people, cut in pieces, directly in pieces, all of them killed by Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s980">So you see it was again...I didn't go with him.</span> <span id="s981">If I would be go...gone with him...it was something hold back I shouldn't go.</span> <span id="s982">There was no reason, but something...I don't know...no wisdom, no no no shrewdness, no smartness told me not to go, but after then they...the Ukrainians killed them because they were again against the Russian.</span> <span id="s983">They were fighting.</span> <span id="s984">They lost...their bitterness was they lost their independent Ukraine which they never had in a way.</span> <span id="s985">You understand?</span> <span id="s986">But their their hatred was so great, so they figured...they...he was against them.</span> <span id="s987">He was a Polish.</span> <span id="s988">They would kill him.</span> <span id="s989">We came back to Rovno, to town.</span> <span id="s990">This is a new chapter starts.</span> <span id="s991">Do I have to...I would like to stop for a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s993">OK.</span> <span id="s994">Why don't you...yeah, we can stop now.</span> <span id="s995">Why don't you take a..</span> <span id="s996">.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: I I I am thinking I'm doing better than I thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Tape #3 ...town, small town, to kill not so much individual Germans but to to kill the livestock, to kill the food, to kill what they...you know this Ukraine, that was the best gift from there, so they had a hit mission to kill, to burn livestock and and corn and wheat...food for the German army.</span> <span id="s1000">This was what they did.</span> <span id="s1001">They avoided Germans.</span> <span id="s1002">Naturally where army was they were too big because we were too small, but our main mission was to sub_____, to cause the Russians to un...uh explosive train, train with ammunition or what every...every train went with soldiers or with ammunition, so what happened the trains are going to the front.</span> <span id="s1003">They had to go through the woods because everything was woods there so wherever the train went, we had missions to destroy the trains, to burn the trains.</span> <span id="s1004">Once you are...in the beginning was very easy because we went through ___.</span> <span id="s1005">The train...the train came and we put in uh explosives.</span> <span id="s1006">Then they cut...they took Ukrainians and whatever Germans and they cut down paths and it was very hard, so we had to hide.</span> <span id="s1007">We had to put...the Germans never knew where it's going to hit, but they knew more or less where the partisans are so we put...what they did they they they started to use empty wagons in the front.</span> <span id="s1008">When it...the ammunition will go up, the empty train should come and the train should stop and they should go further.</span> <span id="s1009">Fix it and go further, so we had...our mission was harder so we had to wait and let the empty trains go through and when the train came, the real train came...it was right after and they had on the top soldiers with machine guns, with heavy machine guns and if they saw any movement, they stopped and they had their very, very...they had hundreds of soldiers in in in the big trains with this heavy ammunition to the front watching them, so the minute they saw any movement, they stopped and they were after us, so we had to stay there, watch, put in the explosives and stay in the back in the woods, one side and the other side and when the train came in to detonate.</span> <span id="s1010">Once they did, it was a tumult and they start shooting.</span> <span id="s1011">Partisans were hit.</span> <span id="s1012">Partisans were killed, but we didn't have no mission to fight anybody, any Germans.</span> <span id="s1013">To kill a German or ______, this was not our mission.</span> <span id="s1014">Our mission was to escape.</span> <span id="s1015">This was because there was no reason to...the only...the mission was to do that much damage that the train should not...once they start burning, it was ammunition then _____.</span> <span id="s1016">Especially we were looking for oil and gas.</span> <span id="s1017">They had to...every train had also a lot of gas, you know, for the tanks.</span> <span id="s1018">That was the main thing because once it started burning, the whole train went and it also interrupt...interrupted the...everything for the war effort.</span> <span id="s1019">This was the _____...and we had also every few days planes came, throw us in ammunition because we didn't have it.</span> <span id="s1020">We couldn't build it, but planes came in.</span> <span id="s1021">We had torches and they came in and and the Germans were there.</span> <span id="s1022">Plenty times the Germans came with planes and they were shooting us down.</span> <span id="s1023">We had to be pretty careful because they were strong.</span> <span id="s1024">They were powerful and we were under the ground, but this was the main mission is to go in there...but they were also watching.</span> <span id="s1025">Planes were watching, flying through to go in and to detonate the trains.</span> <span id="s1026">I didn't do...we didn't do it every day, not everybody.</span> <span id="s1027">It was organized.</span> <span id="s1028">Some people did that, some that...we didn't do every second day.</span> <span id="s1029">That was not...our mission was very nerve-breaking, very very dangerous and it was I would say I went twelve, fifteen times to do that all the time while I was there in the partisans.</span> <span id="s1030">Because they had also more experienced, older...they were also...we were young, you know, especially me.</span> <span id="s1031">There was more experienced people what had through (ph), and they wanted...they didn't send me just out to to to do it to get killed.</span> <span id="s1032">You understand?</span> <span id="s1033">So...but they did send out and we went out just like anybody else, but not as often as the experienced, older soldiers.</span> <span id="s1034">They were...they were trained...more trained than I.</span> <span id="s1035">They had schooling.</span> <span id="s1036">They had...you understand?</span> <span id="s1037">But we went as helpers.</span> <span id="s1038">I was not as the prime, the prime soldier, but we went just...the bullets cut us just like them.</span> <span id="s1039">That's uh...that's what...that's the story what I..</span> <span id="s1040">.</span> <span id="s1041">what I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s1043">Let's go back uh to where you were before, how you returned to Rovno with the Russian army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s1045">How we returned?</span> <span id="s1046">We saw the soldiers who went to Rovno.</span> <span id="s1047">We went with the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s1049">This is...this is uh what year...just to back up, so this is what, in 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: I think it was already the beginning 1944.</span> <span id="s1051">I really don't remember the date.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: But it was winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: Winter.</span> <span id="s1054">The Russian came in.</span> <span id="s1055">They took Rovno and a few weeks later we came to...we saw a column, you know...not the main army but just one part of the of the army, you know, on horses.</span> <span id="s1056">It was not tanks, not the big...the heavy...because it was the woods and they just happened to go through.</span> <span id="s1057">We went with them, and we went with them.</span> <span id="s1058">We went to Rovno and Rovno was already free and we actually went...all what they survived went to one house, and we stayed there two, three days, not longer.</span> <span id="s1059">And they surrounded us.</span> <span id="s1060">After three days...</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: They?</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: The Russian army and they took every young, able-bodied man to the army.</span> <span id="s1063">They took us to the army.</span> <span id="s1064">There was not too many, you know, but whoever...see, whoever didn't live in that building what we we came because people...there was other people, survivors, which we didn't know.</span> <span id="s1065">Whoever they didn't know, they didn't...they didn't...but we knew.</span> <span id="s1066">We were like naive and came.</span> <span id="s1067">We thought that the war is over for us.</span> <span id="s1068">If we meet...the war started.</span> <span id="s1069">You understand?</span> <span id="s1070">Under normal circumstances, the war should have been over.</span> <span id="s1071">The Russians came in.</span> <span id="s1072">We came back.</span> <span id="s1073">The war should be over.</span> <span id="s1074">All of a sudden being Russia was Russia, they took us.</span> <span id="s1075">We told them we fought...we fought already.</span> <span id="s1076">We were partisans.</span> <span id="s1077">There was nobody to talk to.</span> <span id="s1078">We still have...that's what they said.</span> <span id="s1079">The Germans are not finished yet.</span> <span id="s1080">We were not in Berlin yet.</span> <span id="s1081">So they took us to Russia, to deep Russia.</span> <span id="s1082">They send us to school to be to be preparing for the army.</span> <span id="s1083">They knew already with us that we knew what we're doing.</span> <span id="s1084">While I..</span> <span id="s1085">.</span> <span id="s1086">starting a very...a very tricky story with the army.</span> <span id="s1087">While I was in the army, they also took thousands of Ukrainians which they...and they...and they...Russia had a policy at that time which I knew and and later I found out that they don't take Ukrainian and send on that front where they home but they have to send them to a different place because they were in strange territory because they didn't trust them.</span> <span id="s1088">And the Russian didn't care that I'm Jewish, that I am...I'm not a..</span> <span id="s1089">.</span> <span id="s1090">I'm not running for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1091">They were all one.</span> <span id="s1092">The Russian policy doesn't mean anything but their policy was that all the people from Rovno, to take to a strange front, to the opposite, not to...not...to strange territory, and I wind up with a division what ninety percent were Ukraine, from Rovno, from _____, which the biggest nightmare for me.</span> <span id="s1093">Why?</span> <span id="s1094">Because I knew that they all enemies.</span> <span id="s1095">They all Fascists, just like the Germans.</span> <span id="s1096">The same Ukrainians what...you understand the _____, and the Bulbas, this what what they were killers are here in the army with me together, and I knew that I would be shot every minute in the back.</span> <span id="s1097">Who will know?</span> <span id="s1098">Who will care?</span> <span id="s1099">One night I was on the front.</span> <span id="s1100">For me it was one nightmare.</span> <span id="s1101">On the front was already a different story.</span> <span id="s1102">I was with a heavy machine gun and maybe sixty to a hundred feet...you know, the front is here and the Germans were on the other side, and I always kept two grenades with me in case the Germans catch me not to catch me alive.</span> <span id="s1103">You know, it was a a fear which it was in me.</span> <span id="s1104">Dead was not a ques...there was no fear.</span> <span id="s1105">That itself was nothing because I went through so many times that it really became like a like a play...suffering.</span> <span id="s1106">I was scared.</span> <span id="s1107">So instead of the Germans should catch me, I better kill myself, so I kept two grenades in case of something happen, and one night I was standing with my machine gun in the front.</span> <span id="s1108">On the other side were Germans, and five Ukrainian from my...I heard noise.</span> <span id="s1109">Five Ukrainian tried to run over to the Germans.</span> <span id="s1110">Four I wounded and one I killed, you know, because I thought the Germans are coming to me.</span> <span id="s1111">They send out Russians in the morn...in the morning and they caught the four and they said they wanted to go to the Germans.</span> <span id="s1112">They were not the only ones.</span> <span id="s1113">The whole division would have gone over to the Germans, because their heart was not in Russia.</span> <span id="s1114">Their heart was with Germans.</span> <span id="s1115">I was a hero.</span> <span id="s1116">Next day they took twenty thousand...the the the headquarters from the army made a big...see Russian like propaganda.</span> <span id="s1117">In order to give heart to the army, they are experts in propaganda, and they had to...every day was hours of propaganda and hours of inter...you know, to fight was something because there was no other belief.</span> <span id="s1118">There was no food, but they had to give something so they gave propaganda, you know, to bring out, to fight until death for the...they didn't say they're fighting for the father...for the Communism.</span> <span id="s1119">In that time the policy changed.</span> <span id="s1120">They're fighting for their fatherland, also for the motherland.</span> <span id="s1121">________, the motherland for ______.</span> <span id="s1122">The motherland everybody understood, what the motherland.</span> <span id="s1123">Communism was not too many takers, so this went on...there was probably was twenty, twenty-five thousand soldiers.</span> <span id="s1124">It was a general.</span> <span id="s1125">It was...it was the whole.</span> <span id="s1126">.</span> <span id="s1127">whole few divisions together after that deal, and they asked me I should give a speech.</span> <span id="s1128">I was never a speaker.</span> <span id="s1129">My Russian wasn't too good, but I remember the speech what I gave.</span> <span id="s1130">I gave a speech that we have to fight.</span> <span id="s1131">We have to go forward, you know.</span> <span id="s1132">I wrote one of the _____ speech, but I remember it by heart, that every step...</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: Repeat the speech, if you say you can remember.</span> <span id="s1134">That'd be...</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: Yes, I remember.</span> <span id="s1136">Friend ______, you know, this friend...I was under the Germans.</span> <span id="s1137">It's true.</span> <span id="s1138">And I saw...I didn't talk like a Jew.</span> <span id="s1139">I talked like a Russian.</span> <span id="s1140">And I saw what the German doing to our brothers and sisters, Ukrainians, Jews, Polish, that they're killing them.</span> <span id="s1141">They destroy them, that nobody except the German race is important.</span> <span id="s1142">But deep down I heard that the German...the biggest mistake, we were talking in the army, that they're killing prisoners, Russian prisoners, in that time already that the Russians knew that the Germans are killing thousands of Russians and you have to fight not for...we're not fighting against Russia.</span> <span id="s1143">We have to fight against Germans because they're killing us because we are sla...we are under...under _______, sub-human.</span> <span id="s1144">We...now I'm talking as a Russian.</span> <span id="s1145">You understand?</span> <span id="s1146">We are sub-human...not as a Jew but as a Russian...and the Germans, if they catch us, they're killing us because we are not the German race.</span> <span id="s1147">They are the high race.</span> <span id="s1148">So I had to talk to them in the same language and I said that I saw what they're doing to us and I was there and I came back and I'm fighting now with you together and every step what we're going forward, closer to kill the beast, we are helping humanity.</span> <span id="s1149">We are helping ourselves, making short and sweet.</span> <span id="s1150">And there were tremendous...tremendous...you know, they they were happy with my speech, you know, and I and I talked to it what I meant with my heart because _____.</span> <span id="s1151">I knew that they are the only ones what they can kill the Germans.</span> <span id="s1152">See, that minute there was no Ukrainian anymore, but I was scared that the thousands of Ukrainians were there and they will hear this speech and I wouldn't live.</span> <span id="s1153">The following night while I was there came over to me a man, an officer.</span> <span id="s1154">This is getting a little bit very...and he said are you...are you the in the partisans.</span> <span id="s1155">Yes.</span> <span id="s1156">Are you a Ukraine?</span> <span id="s1157">Are you Jewish?</span> <span id="s1158">Yes.</span> <span id="s1159">He didn't have no insignia, no nothing.</span> <span id="s1160">Do you know who I am?</span> <span id="s1161">I said no.</span> <span id="s1162">He said how were the Ukrainian behaving?</span> <span id="s1163">I said they were behaving...because I already shot four, you know, wounded so they knew that I'm not from them.</span> <span id="s1164">He knew already.</span> <span id="s1165">How did they behave?</span> <span id="s1166">They were anti-Russian, anti-Polish, anti-Jewish and for everything they were for Germans.</span> <span id="s1167">You know a lot of them here?</span> <span id="s1168">I said I know people here what they killed Jews during the war.</span> <span id="s1169">And I know one what was a ______ but he...this one was there too.</span> <span id="s1170">The one...he was a teacher, but I found out that he was leaning for Communism what what...in the _____ what told me we don't kill Jews, he was dead too.</span> <span id="s1171">He became friendly with me.</span> <span id="s1172">Again, he saved me.</span> <span id="s1173">He told me that.</span> <span id="s1174">I was friendly with him and I was telling him everything, and I said there's hundreds of them here what what from Tuchin, from Rovno, what... Do you...can you give us the names?</span> <span id="s1175">I am from _______.</span> <span id="s1176">Yes.</span> <span id="s1177">I heard the name but you you don't repeat that name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: Can you explain what it is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: _______ is uh CI...CIA.</span> <span id="s1180">Contra...what is the the CIA..._______ is contra...uh what is

couldn't understand Russian good.</span> <span id="s1184">I though bad.</span> <span id="s1185">_____ is bad.</span> <span id="s1186">And this...but it's spelled different.</span> <span id="s1187">The name is ________.</span> <span id="s1188">That's a very secret, top secret organization which they had a right...they were above everybody, above the _____ which was very scaricy (ph), very fearsome, but they had a right to go to any any officer, any general, anything.</span> <span id="s1189">They were the upper, upper without question.</span> <span id="s1190">It's not...even here I think uh don't have that much right that they had a right to check everything.</span> <span id="s1191">They were the top _____.</span> <span id="s1192">He is from there, and you are working for us from now on.</span> <span id="s1193">I really didn't know what he is telling me, what did there...and I want to have...you should check out everybody what was against for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1194">We know that this division has a lot of traitors and a lot of Ukrainians which killed...did a lot of atrocities and I want you should give me the names.</span> <span id="s1195">In a way I was very thrilled, to be honest with you, because again we're going back to my main enemies.</span> <span id="s1196">I didn't know what they do...from the other side I knew they're going to kill me because even without knowing, but secret, nobody should know.</span> <span id="s1197">Nobody ____, that I should...I know a lot of things, but this man, he knows more names than I do because I really don't know the names.</span> <span id="s1198">I I can't point out because I..</span> <span id="s1199">.</span> <span id="s1200">you understand?</span> <span id="s1201">I wasn't their friend.</span> <span id="s1202">I only knew what they did.</span> <span id="s1203">We can't talk to him but you should talk to him that he should give you, and and we gave him a list.</span> <span id="s1204">Three hundred people...two hundred people, from...all from Rovno, from Tuchin, all the people what were involved what when the police he knew...because he was in the in the _______.</span> <span id="s1205">But after a week there was no names anymore.</span> <span id="s1206">We we couldn't find any more whom to give.</span> <span id="s1207">What they did with the people, with the Ukrainians, I really don't know and I don't want to know.</span> <span id="s1208">I didn't see them what they did with them.</span> <span id="s1209">They used me and I wanted to be used.</span> <span id="s1210">After a few weeks, they start coming to me.</span> <span id="s1211">I said I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s1212">I don't know anybody else.</span> <span id="s1213">He start pushing and they can persuade and there was nothing to do, nothing to...you can't get out nothing and I was stubborn.</span> <span id="s1214">I said no.</span> <span id="s1215">I found out later they want to get rid of me, the Russian.</span> <span id="s1216">How to get rid of me?</span> <span id="s1217">They sent out twenty-four people to catch a German in daytime and I suspect it was organized.</span> <span id="s1218">I mean they used to it from time to time, but I suspect the main culprit was organized through them.</span> <span id="s1219">So I don't know...for a few years ago with Russia I would talk like that even, but now I can say it.</span> <span id="s1220">I suspect they organized to get rid of me because they didn't want to have any witnesses.</span> <span id="s1221">We were here and the Germans were three...in three ways surrounded so they told us to take...a ____ means a tank...a German to find out their position.</span> <span id="s1222">In the daytime was suicide.</span> <span id="s1223">It was no much suicide that from twenty-four, twenty-two got killed.</span> <span id="s1224">One was cut his legs off.</span> <span id="s1225">He was inside of and I was wounded in my arm and my leg inside off and I was only one what survived in that massacre (ph).</span> <span id="s1226">Again, I was cut off from my my legs here.</span> <span id="s1227">My...here I was bleeding from my from my...near my heart.</span> <span id="s1228">I thought my heart was hit, was bleeding.</span> <span id="s1229">And I was laying and I throw away my machine gun and I run back.</span> <span id="s1230">I run back while I was wounded and bleeding because they started for an hour to...the the...they thought that we're going in from the front to fight them.</span> <span id="s1231">They started for an hour to bombard, you know, to...our position.</span> <span id="s1232">Didn't mean nothing in the army because one did that, but it didn't happen too often.</span> <span id="s1233">Meantime I was bleeding and I thought I'm dying (laughter) because the blood was coming so strong that I thought my heart is wounded.</span> <span id="s1234">Came over an officer.</span> <span id="s1235">I don't know who it was.</span> <span id="s1236">Again, without insignia and he said where's you gun.</span> <span id="s1237">I'm going to shoot you.</span> <span id="s1238">Why did you leave your gun there?</span> <span id="s1239">So I said....you see in Russia one thing...if you gave your blood for the ___, for the country, the minute when your blood runs, nobody can touch you.</span> <span id="s1240">You are a holy man, you know.</span> <span id="s1241">Later they can do whatever they want, but the minute when your blood runs, you can say anything.</span> <span id="s1242">So I told him why don't you go there and catch...take my gun.</span> <span id="s1243">You understand?</span> <span id="s1244">In the meantime, while they stopped shooting, the general which not a political, which didn't know, heard that the guy what gave the speech is wounded, and he gave a special order (crying ?)</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: Take your time.</span> <span id="s1246">Take your time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: Immediately they bring me to a hospital.</span> <span id="s1248">It was a very dangerous because you had to go up hills but the the Germans saw it, and they _____, but he said without...you know, once you get an order...I want to bring him alive to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1249">Came an order from the general, right away was help because I was laying there and bleeding.</span> <span id="s1250">Nobody touched me.</span> <span id="s1251">Nobody came, and this is not normal.</span> <span id="s1252">You know, usually they would send somebody.</span> <span id="s1253">They were dead.</span> <span id="s1254">But there was nobody to talk and now I'm talking that for the time out of it.</span> <span id="s1255">They brought me into the hospital.</span> <span id="s1256">Luckily...I remember they put me to sleep and they operated on me and a Jewish doctor __________.</span> <span id="s1257">You know, ______ because everybody knew me.</span> <span id="s1258">They knew me from the speech.</span> <span id="s1259">The nurses said look at this.</span> <span id="s1260">The boy what gave those...this speech is already wounded, you know.</span> <span id="s1261">Not that I was such a great hero, but they knew me from this speech and that I was I was there, you understand.</span> <span id="s1262">Normally, a a plain soldier didn't come and gave speeches for for for an army for twenty-five thousand people, so they gave me the biggest care and everything and I went to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1263">After after three weeks I I recuperate and I was recuperated and the Russians were not too great lovers of my nation too, my...at that time, everybody...and I I I remember...I I recuperated already and I was still _______ a little bit and I had...I got already two medals.</span> <span id="s1264">I got a medal already in the partisans.</span> <span id="s1265">I got a medal because I was wounded.</span> <span id="s1266">I got, you know, a few things.</span> <span id="s1267">Came over a captain and he said why aren't you on the front.</span> <span id="s1268">Why don't you fight?</span> <span id="s1269">And I was a partisan and I went though much and I hit him once and twice.</span> <span id="s1270">To hit an officer, a different story.</span> <span id="s1271">He called me Jew too.</span> <span id="s1272">Why don't you fight?</span> <span id="s1273">And again, at that time for me, to tell me I don't want to fight and all from a Russian...I expect it from everybody else, you know, but from a Russian I..</span> <span id="s1274">.</span> <span id="s1275">in my youthfulness, in my ___, I expected some compassion, something what I went through.</span> <span id="s1276">You understand?</span> <span id="s1277">So when I hit him, I didn't care what's going to happen, so he said ____ why don't you fight, again.</span> <span id="s1278">And I recognized that he didn't have any medals.</span> <span id="s1279">He was not a army officer.</span> <span id="s1280">He was not in the front.</span> <span id="s1281">You see, there's all kinds...there's there's field commander officers what they're fighting and to fight on the front, in the Russian front, you didn't last more than a week or two.</span> <span id="s1282">Either you were dead or you were in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1283">If you were lucky, you were in the hospital because human life was not very much cherished, you know, in the army.</span> <span id="s1284">If you were on the front and fighting, you didn't last long.</span> <span id="s1285">Either you were wounded, you were lucky, and it was a wound you could be healed, or you were dead, because they put masses, you know, they gave the order and they went, they went masses of people.</span> <span id="s1286">People didn't count.</span> <span id="s1287">So so I saw that he wasn't there, so he put me into the they call me to the higher and naturally they call me to the political, the assistant.</span> <span id="s1288">And the political heard me speak, my speech.</span> <span id="s1289">Political every...in every army...in the army, the Russian army, every battalion, every thing has a..</span> <span id="s1290">.</span> <span id="s1291">has an officer of the army always and they had a political officer.</span> <span id="s1292">The political officer in a lot of cases has more to say than the army.</span> <span id="s1293">Not in fighting but everything else because he is the political officer.</span> <span id="s1294">The political officer knew that I am a friend, that I am...they took away...they kept me...they took away the...they didn't take away me.</span> <span id="s1295">I don't think they kept the ______ anymore.</span> <span id="s1296">You understand, because again I had somebody watching over me and he knew that what I went through and what ____.</span> <span id="s1297">Anyway, I was there and then they, they discharged me and they asked me what...what I wanted to...should I go further?</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: I realized then I had enough.</span> <span id="s1300">The war was going on.</span> <span id="s1301">They were dying, people what I knew every day so...and I also realized my love for the Russians...you understand...was not too great because I don't really fight for something, so I said I want to go to school.</span> <span id="s1302">I was very good in politics.</span> <span id="s1303">In Russia, politics is very important.</span> <span id="s1304">Like I told you, I had a very good in history, so when they heard, you know, the division or _____, they asked the general who came in there, they asked how the political...everyday you had indoctrination of policies, you know.</span> <span id="s1305">The Russians didn't know from day to day...they didn't even know there who is Stalin, so they said he is a great man, but you had to answer to Stalin as ____.</span> <span id="s1306">You understand?</span> <span id="s1307">This was the true way.</span> <span id="s1308">The Russians, the average Russian...he's a great man.</span> <span id="s1309">Everybody knew he's a great man, but they didn't know what position, whether he's chief of staff...you know, so they always pushed me out I should answer.</span> <span id="s1310">So they want to send me to political school.</span> <span id="s1311">I didn't want to go to political school because I didn't like the system, and I didn't want to be...to stay there.</span> <span id="s1312">Once I knew I'm going to political school, I stayed there and it's not mine home.</span> <span id="s1313">It's not there.</span> <span id="s1314">I want to go back, so I went to tank...to tank school and became...that's what it is...I became a..</span> <span id="s1315">.</span> <span id="s1316">tank school took three months and they taught how to fight a tank and that was a dangerous ar...this tank tank the Russians, they took the toughest guys, and I was very tough.</span> <span id="s1317">I was very strong _______just at home I was raised very weak, you know, with Monday, Tuesday sick.</span> <span id="s1318">All of a sudden I became very tough.</span> <span id="s1319">All that ____ from all this life, and tanks were scarce.</span> <span id="s1320">_____.</span> <span id="s1321">You know, the the the...it's just like the red...Red Beret, you know, tough guy.</span> <span id="s1322">I went there and I was there once...there we're fighting in there and this was when after the war when Lvov (ph) and we came to the ___________ and I rode the tanks when they surrendered.</span> <span id="s1323">We got an order and we were fighting different fights.</span> <span id="s1324">Different tanks were burned and out.</span> <span id="s1325">I was burned once in a tank, but this is just in the army, what you do tanks.</span> <span id="s1326">I was told that...they they told us to go in...even the Germans surrounded, to go forward and shoot and go to the the ocean because we didn't trust ____ and we surrounded them, but they didn't shoot back anymore.</span> <span id="s1327">I came back.</span> <span id="s1328">We came...you know, it started but before evening, before evening, going back before, I I hid myself.</span> <span id="s1329">A few months before, there was the chief...I was one day standing guard by the general.</span> <span id="s1330">The chief of the front for the whole front...you know Russia in that time had five...the front means...you know, what the front...do I say it right in English...five different divisions.</span> <span id="s1331">They needed maybe twenty-five or a hundred...fifty divisions on one front.</span> <span id="s1332">This was the Leningrad front, on that side.</span> <span id="s1333">And the chief from the tank co..</span> <span id="s1334">.</span> <span id="s1335">from the tanks...I was standing in the near his car.</span> <span id="s1336">The wife came out and start talking to me and I found out that she is Jewish.</span> <span id="s1337">The only general in the Russian army, a four-star general, so the wife had a daughter, again my age, and I start...they took me in.</span> <span id="s1338">They start asking me questions and I was telling him all the stories what I went though because I had...even for him in the army, to tell him from the partisans what the Germans did, he wasn't aware.</span> <span id="s1339">So he said I should be adjutant.</span> <span id="s1340">I should work for him.</span> <span id="s1341">I was very ____, getting away from the from all the...____ gave me beautiful clothes, ___ and I was on staff, an adjutant and I was...he had a higher ranking adjutant than I am but I was the one...orderly I would say.</span> <span id="s1342">You understand?</span> <span id="s1343">But I had...I was more than that because I had an insight to him.</span> <span
