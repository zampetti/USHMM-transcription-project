id="s3">0:00:27 Q: Please tell us your full name, where and when you were born and what life was like before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">A: Irving Horn and he was born in Radom, Poland on February 25, 1927.</span> <span id="s5">His birth name is Esahar Hershenhorn.</span> <span id="s6">He changed it when he came to the US.</span> <span id="s7">He came from a middle income family.</span> <span id="s8">First memories: the Jews had to integrate their schools (all Jewish schools, etc).</span> <span id="s9">Irving was transferred to a school outside his town.</span> <span id="s10">Polish schools were mixed in apartment buildings so there were tenants and students together (on separate floors).</span></p> <p><span id="s11">During registration, the Polish principle commented; "Well what was that Jew doing here anyhow?”</span> <span id="s12">That was the first time Irving had to face anti– Semitism There was a lot of anti-Semitism before the war that Irving could feel.</span> <span id="s13">He was beaten up at this school daily.</span> <span id="s14">After a year, his mother put him in another school, located closer to downtown, and there were a few more Jewish students.</span> <span id="s15">At that school, they were only beaten up weekly.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">0:04:00 In June 1939, Irving took the Junior High entrance exam that all 6th graders took that year he was at a Jewish day school.</span> <span id="s17">His family went on vacation, and then the war broke out.</span> <span id="s18">The school never opened again.</span> <span id="s19">Radom was occupied by the Germans seven days later, on Friday September 8.</span> <span id="s20">There were restrictions instituted immediately.</span> <span id="s21">Examples of forbidden things: radios, assemblies of five people or more, property, and stores.</span> <span id="s22">After a week of the German takeover, Irving and his brother were arrested and taken to the Gestapo who demanded a ransom from the Jewish community for him and other Jewish boys they had kidnapped.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">0:06:20 It was quite a large ransom, but they paid it.</span> <span id="s24">The boys were released.</span> <span id="s25">Irving said that the worst thing was not being able to go to school.</span> <span id="s26">So they started a secret school in 1939.</span> <span id="s27">It existed until 1941, when the ghetto was sealed off.</span> <span id="s28">They knew the risk was arrest and several years in prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">0:07:48 Q: What was life like in the Jewish Community before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Radom had a population of about 100,000 people and 25,00 to 30,000, were Jews according to Where Once We Walked) of them were Jews.</span> <span id="s31">The population was mostly orthodox Jewish.</span> <span id="s32">They would observe the traditional, orthodox Sabbath.</span> <span id="s33">Everything stopped on Friday evening.</span> <span id="s34">He said that the younger generation was not like that.</span> <span id="s35">They were more "forward looking".</span> <span id="s36">Most people spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s37">Within the Yiddish area of the ghetto, the only language that you needed to know was Yiddish.</span> <span id="s38">There were very few people who were illiterate in Yiddish, but there were many who were illiterate in Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">0:10:06 The younger generation was progressive.</span> <span id="s40">They would play football (soccer) but were forbidden to play on Saturday.</span> <span id="s41">They also tried to speak Polish more and assimilate more.</span> <span id="s42">They thought they were more intelligent than the older generation because they could speak Polish.</span> <span id="s43">Also, the upper class spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s44">It was a blue collar type town.</span> <span id="s45">There were a lot of tanneries.</span> <span id="s46">It was the principle industry.</span> <span id="s47">Irving's father worked in a tannery owned by German people.</span> <span id="s48">His grandfather had actually owned his own tannery.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">0:11:58 At work, the day after the war broke out, Irving’s father was told that they could no longer employ Jews.</span> <span id="s50">His mother normally did not work; most women except nurses did not work.</span> <span id="s51">Religiously, all prayers were stopped after the occupation.</span> <span id="s52">They forbade any assembly of more than five persons was forbidden.</span> <span id="s53">Since ten people are required for a minyan (quorum), one could only pray individually.</span> <span id="s54">Irving was supposed to have his bar mitzvah in February 1940, so he was tutored by a melamed (teacher).</span> <span id="s55">They did not have a Torah.</span> <span id="s56">There was also a food shortage.</span> <span id="s57">They had to be careful when they had his bar mitzvah ceremony.</span> <span id="s58">They invited male relatives over, so that they would have the requisite ten males present.</span> <span id="s59">There were German guards patrolling around.</span> <span id="s60">When they found someone they put them to work.</span> <span id="s61">Also, if the guards saw someone with a beard, and lots of Jews wore beards, they would cut off the beard.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">0:15:24 There was a shortage of fish, so for his bar mitzvah meal his mother made some meat taste just like fish.</span> <span id="s63">Slowly religious and other types of Jewish life came to a halt.</span> <span id="s64">It was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s65">The Germans wouldn't allow the Jews to walk and live on certain streets.</span> <span id="s66">Later Jews were not allowed to own stores.</span> <span id="s67">Then all Jews over the age of, he thinks, 14 had to work.</span> <span id="s68">The Germans established a Judenrat, where even Irving had to work.</span> <span id="s69">He was called to work once a week.</span> <span id="s70">The rich people would pay for substitutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">0:17:12 There was a shortage of food.</span> <span id="s72">The worst thing was that there were diseases.</span> <span id="s73">Life became miserable.</span> <span id="s74">There was an epidemic of typhus.</span> <span id="s75">Both his brothers got typhus.</span> <span id="s76">It became very difficult to stay at home (after school) and do nothing.</span> <span id="s77">So, with the help of his mother, he got a job with a dental technician while he was still going to school.</span> <span id="s78">He had two brothers, each seven years older than he was.</span> <span id="s79">When the war broke out, they were both 19.</span> <span id="s80">They had a very difficult time.</span> <span id="s81">He also had a sister (who is actually an adopted cousin, the child of his father's older brother and his mother's older sister).</span> <span id="s82">Irving’s sister was 14 years older than him.</span> <span id="s83">He still misses her.</span> <span id="s84">She was married in 1938 or 1939 and had a baby girl in 1940 named Malka.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">0:20:42 He didn't realize the impact of not being able to earn a living back then because he was very young.</span> <span id="s86">Jews were not allowed to do many things.</span> <span id="s87">His father used to do illegal things.</span> <span id="s88">His father would buy raw animal skins and convert them into leather.</span> <span id="s89">His father would smuggle these products out of the town, by Poles during the war.</span> <span id="s90">His father was caught by the Polish police and the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s91">For two years, they were being chased by the police.</span> <span id="s92">His brother was arrested too (this was already 1941).</span> <span id="s93">They took him for interrogation early in June of 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">0:23:41 It was difficult to get him to the Gestapo building for interrogation because there were thousands of German troops marching to the Russian front in the streets; it was Operation Sarasota.</span> <span id="s95">This was three weeks before the war with Russia broke out.</span> <span id="s96">It was very difficult to make a living.</span> <span id="s97">But there were people who made a good living.</span> <span id="s98">There were also a lot of poor people who were starving.</span> <span id="s99">There were lines for bread.</span> <span id="s100">This made for an uneven structure throughout the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">0:25:26 The ghetto was formed in April of 1941 by an announcement that was posted on several streets.</span> <span id="s102">There were two ghettos in Radom, so the announcement said that everyone who lived outside of the ghettos had to move into one by the given date which Irving doesn’t remember.</span> <span id="s103">The Judenrat assigned places to live for those who didn't already live in the ghettos.</span> <span id="s104">Irving's family already lived in the main, large ghetto.</span> <span id="s105">There was a smaller one that was on the other side of town called Klinista.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">0:26:35 Irving’s family had two rooms and a kitchen, and they were assigned two more families to live with them.</span> <span id="s107">Up until that time, they had still been running the illegal school.</span> <span id="s108">But with three families to a place it was impossible to run a school.</span> <span id="s109">They created a Jewish Police that had its own hats and armbands.</span> <span id="s110">All the Jews had to wear armbands with the Star of David on them.</span> <span id="s111">There were some activities inside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s112">There were some cultural activities, and they had set up a Metal School (for shaving metal).</span> <span id="s113">They were taught how to use lathes.</span> <span id="s114">They even put on a show.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">0:28:21 The Jewish hospital was right outside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s116">In order to go from one side of the Polish area to the other side, the Poles had to cross the ghetto.</span> <span id="s117">Conditions in the ghettos got worse.</span> <span id="s118">The first thing that started happening was the Gestapo would raid the ghetto.</span> <span id="s119">They would come at night and arrest 30 to 40 people for unknown reasons.</span> <span id="s120">And if they didn't find the person they were originally looking for, they would take a substitute.</span> <span id="s121">They would shoot some people on the street as they were looking for people.</span> <span id="s122">There were several of these raids.</span> <span id="s123">One time they came and arrested all the Kosher butchers.</span> <span id="s124">One of Irving's friends, named Naden worked with his father who was a butcher.</span> <span id="s125">He was taken away also and interrogated.</span> <span id="s126">Irving remembers when they brought Naden back to the ghetto (he lived above Irving's family), the Gestapo brought the boy to the back of the house and shot him right there as the boy called for his mother.</span> <span id="s127">The boy's father went mad after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">0:30:40 The Gestapo took 9,000 (out of 10,000) people from the small ghetto one night.</span> <span id="s129">They also killed several hundred.</span> <span id="s130">They packed the people on trains and sent them to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s131">They realized that there was more room on the train so they gathered a few thousand from the main ghetto.</span> <span id="s132">Irving's sister was amongst them.</span> <span id="s133">He became emotional when remembering his sister.</span> <span id="s134">The above took place in August 1942, and a few weeks later (still in August) the deportation of the main ghetto took place.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">0:32:24 The Ukrainians came on a Sunday morning.</span> <span id="s136">The remaining Jews knew they would be deported, but at the time they didn't know to where.</span> <span id="s137">Irving and his father volunteered to work on an estate ten miles away.</span> <span id="s138">His brother worked in the town's weapons factory.</span> <span id="s139">His mother was supposed to work there with his brother, but the Ukrainians would not let her.</span> <span id="s140">She was deported that night along with 90% of the main ghetto.</span> <span id="s141">He believes that hundreds were killed.</span> <span id="s142">They (I guess the Ukrainians) went to the Jewish hospital and shot all the sick people.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">0:34:20 They buried hundreds or maybe a thousand people that night.</span> <span id="s144">He says, however, that he was not an eyewitness to that.</span> <span id="s145">The ghetto, he found out from his brother who was still in town, had been reduced to two streets and only 2,000 people.</span> <span id="s146">Irving and a friend left work claiming they were ill so that they could go back to their home in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s147">The administrator gave them a letter claiming that it was giving them permission.</span> <span id="s148">Instead it read: "These two Jews do not want to work hard.</span> <span id="s149">I suggest you shoot them".</span> <span id="s150">They of course did not transmit the letter and instead stayed in the small ghetto.</span> <span id="s151">The Germans or Ukrainians would always do things to the Jews in the ghettos especially on Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s152">On Purim, they decided to execute all the Jewish doctors.</span> <span id="s153">Then they started a list for Jews who wanted to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s154">Many townsfolk signed up including Irving and his brother.</span> <span id="s155">On January 13, 1943 they called everyone out of the ghetto and started reading from the Palestine list.</span> <span id="s156">Miraculously, his and his brother’s names were not called.</span> <span id="s157">Half of the ghetto was deported to Treblinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">0:37:58 Irving dodged further danger when lying about being a doctor's brother.</span> <span id="s159">He went with his brother to work in the weapon's factory where several thousand Jews worked.</span> <span id="s160">Jacob Holtz was a very vicious guard at the factory.</span> <span id="s161">He would execute people.</span> <span id="s162">Irving's job was to clean up after horses, but one day he was called up to dig a grave in 15 minutes for a person Holtz had shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">0:40:57 Irving and his brother stayed at this factory in Radom until 1944.</span> <span id="s164">On July 20, 1944, there was an attempt on Hitler's life.</span> <span id="s165">Six days later they heard shots.</span> <span id="s166">The Russians had arrived in Ludwin, which was about 30 miles from where they were.</span> <span id="s167">He and his brother asked some Poles who were working in the factory if they would shelter them until the Russians came.</span> <span id="s168">He and his brother thought they would be able to survive the war in that way.</span> <span id="s169">The Poles refused.</span> <span id="s170">On July 26 they were evacuated.</span> <span id="s171">The Germans marched the Jews to the main street of Radom.</span> <span id="s172">The Poles who were on their way to work cheered and clapped that the Jews were being removed from the town.</span> <span id="s173">The Poles pointed out where some Jews were hiding so they could be shot.</span> <span id="s174">The Poles were extremely unfriendly.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">0:43:22 The small ghetto was joined to the people who worked in the weapon factory.</span> <span id="s176">New guards were brought in, and it became a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s177">Most of the time they were guarded by Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s178">On July 26 they left the town because the Russians were in Luba near by.</span> <span id="s179">They were accompanied by Ukrainians, Latvian, Lithuanians, Estonians, and the SS guards.</span> <span id="s180">The SS were very mean.</span> <span id="s181">They marched all day.</span> <span id="s182">In the evening the SS suggested that those who were having trouble marching sit down in a carriage and rest for a while.</span> <span id="s183">The carriage was taken to a forest and they were all shot.</span> <span id="s184">They would sleep in the fields.</span> <span id="s185">On the second night some people wanted to escape so they would hide in pipes in the fields hoping that they would be forgotten.</span> <span id="s186">But in the morning, the SS put machine guns inside and shot them.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">0:46:14 On a dusty hot day (it was summer), they were very thirsty.</span> <span id="s188">The SS shot people who would run for water.</span> <span id="s189">On Friday at noon they arrived at Tomaszow Mazowieck.</span> <span id="s190">They put the females in the city jail and the men in an empty factory.</span> <span id="s191">Irving was one of the youngest.</span> <span id="s192">They stayed in Tomaszow for a week.</span> <span id="s193">Then they were put on a freight train and arrived in Auschwitz after about a 30 – hour train ride.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">00:48:11 They arrived at three am.</span> <span id="s195">They knew the reputation of Auschwitz, but didn't know what was going to happen to them.</span> <span id="s196">They heard that some of the people from their ghetto were still alive after two years.</span> <span id="s197">This gave them some hope.</span> <span id="s198">They were lined up.</span> <span id="s199">They were told to give up their gold and diamonds (which they didn't have).</span> <span id="s200">They were told to hurry and get back on the train.</span> <span id="s201">They didn't know why.</span> <span id="s202">Just then another train came.</span> <span id="s203">It brought people from the Lodz ghetto, about 4,000 men, women, and children.</span> <span id="s204">They took them off the train, and within 15 minutes took them all to the crematoria.</span> <span id="s205">Not one of them survived.</span> <span id="s206">After that they took Irving's group.</span> <span id="s207">They went through an inspection.</span> <span id="s208">They were looking for people over 40, under 18, or twins.</span> <span id="s209">Irving was 17, his dad was over 40, and his brothers were twins.</span> <span id="s210">So the brothers separated, his father did not shave, and he shaved twice.</span> <span id="s211">Those who were chosen were killed.</span> <span id="s212">The women stayed in Auschwitz, and the rest of them were told to get back on the train.</span> <span id="s213">Then they left Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s214">Irving, his brothers, and his father were not selected.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">00:53:14 They left Auschwitz on Sunday arrived in Czechoslovakia on Monday and where they made a stop.</span> <span id="s216">There were trains going to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s217">They went through Austria and stopped right outside Stuttgard.</span> <span id="s218">They were sent to a delousing station for a shower.</span> <span id="s219">They were in Vaihingen an der Enz.</span> <span id="s220">This place was 22 km out of Stuttgard.</span> <span id="s221">They had just put up five buildings for them to live in, mere shells.</span> <span id="s222">There was barely anything there.</span> <span id="s223">The meals were coffee (burnt chickoree), soup, (basically water and turnips), and a slice of bread.</span> <span id="s224">That's all they got.</span> <span id="s225">There were many diseases, and there was starvation.</span> <span id="s226">He worked in a big factory called Bowshater.</span> <span id="s227">After a few weeks Irving, his father, and his brothers were transferred to another camp ten miles away called Winderitsing.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">1:01:20 This was one of the worst camps.</span> <span id="s229">There was no water inside at all.</span> <span id="s230">The toilet was a big hole in the ground.</span> <span id="s231">Diseases were rampant.</span> <span id="s232">At first there were only Jews at the camp.</span> <span id="s233">Later, some Poles were sent there, but most died after a few months because of diseases.</span> <span id="s234">The prisoners were working to build something underground, he was not sure what.</span> <span id="s235">Irving found that it was easy to slip away from work.</span> <span id="s236">So he slipped away.</span> <span id="s237">He went to a barn and stole some fruit and went back to the camp.</span> <span id="s238">He would do this quite often.</span> <span id="s239">He befriended a farm owner's wife and would spend quite a bit of time with her.</span> <span id="s240">One night, on a snowy Christmas Eve, the guards looked for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">1:06:50 They beat him up to find out where he went.</span> <span id="s242">He lied and said that he went to the airport.</span> <span id="s243">They put him on his knees outside in the cold as punishment.</span> <span id="s244">He asked what they were going to do to him.</span> <span id="s245">They said they were going to shoot him, but because of a great victory the Germans had won that day they reduced his sentence to 50 lashes.</span> <span id="s246">Then he was in solitary confinement, and he got pneumonia.</span> <span id="s247">There was a room called the hospital.</span> <span id="s248">All the doctor had was aspirin.</span> <span id="s249">When Irving's fever went down, he was made to carry bricks.</span> <span id="s250">He couldn't carry the bricks because they were too heavy so they put him in solitary confinement.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">1:09:53 When he left the solitary confinement, they announced that they were evacuating the camp.</span> <span id="s252">The sick people were sent to one camp, and the healthy ones were sent somewhere else.</span> <span id="s253">His brothers were sick and were sent to Vaihingen.</span> <span id="s254">He and his father were sent to Koerdorf.</span> <span id="s255">All these small camps were under the administration of a concentration camp in France called Natzweiler.</span> <span id="s256">Their clothes were deloused and returned to them.</span> <span id="s257">They also had to wash themselves.</span> <span id="s258">A Pole named Tadik worked there.</span> <span id="s259">This camp housed mainly Hungarian Jews.</span> <span id="s260">They had a choice of working or going to the doctor.</span> <span id="s261">They were only allowed to go the hospital if they thought they had a fever of 104 degrees.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">1:14:16 He was led to a TB Hospital.</span> <span id="s263">No one would come near.</span> <span id="s264">He was the only Polish Jew in there.</span> <span id="s265">Everyone was a Hungarian.</span> <span id="s266">No one was allowed to leave.</span> <span id="s267">Irving thought that he would never leave.</span> <span id="s268">He was there until late March 1945 when it was evacuated.</span> <span id="s269">He could not really communicate with the others.</span> <span id="s270">There were about 150 people there.</span> <span id="s271">They were very nice.</span> <span id="s272">Late in March, they were told that the Americans were coming and that the camp was being evacuated.</span> <span id="s273">They were put on a train and mixed with other sick people in the train with them.</span> <span id="s274">All the healthy people were marched out of the camp.</span> <span id="s275">They went to Dachau.</span> <span id="s276">They only stopped to remove the dead.</span> <span id="s277">They had no food for days.</span> <span id="s278">Then after 3-4 days they heard bombing, planes, and commotion.</span> <span id="s279">For almost a week they were not fed.</span> <span id="s280">In his car only about 10 survived.</span> <span id="s281">Finally, they were let out of the train.</span> <span id="s282">This is when Irving met his father.</span> <span id="s283">He had been in one of the other cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">1:18:57 They were still not fed.</span> <span id="s285">They did get a little water on Saturday night (the last time they had water had been Tuesday night).</span> <span id="s286">That Sunday was Easter Sunday.</span> <span id="s287">They were fed after six days.</span> <span id="s288">They stayed in Dachau from April 1, 1945 until late April.</span> <span id="s289">They said that camp was much better than the other camps they stayed at.</span> <span id="s290">His father hurt himself and it became infected.</span> <span id="s291">They showed the gangrene foot to the Red Cross when they were inspected.</span> <span id="s292">They were told that his father had to go the hospital.</span> <span id="s293">But that same day, all Jews were told to evacuate Dachau.</span> <span id="s294">They were taken on passenger trains, and they all received Red Cross food packages.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">1:22:37 Irving was so hungry he ate his package but it aggravated his sickness.</span> <span id="s296">They went to Tirol on the Austrian border.</span> <span id="s297">They were told that Austria was no longer at war, Hitler was dead, and that they were all free.</span> <span id="s298">They were told that they had to go back to Germany to get fed; the Austrians would not feed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">1:24:03 They were taken to a place in the Tyrolean Mountains.</span> <span id="s300">It was snowing that day on April 29 and it was cold.</span> <span id="s301">The SS guards were changing into civilian clothes and leaving during the night.</span> <span id="s302">Left on their own, Irving and the others walked and reached a village.</span> <span id="s303">He found and followed his
