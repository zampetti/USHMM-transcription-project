like I had said before, this was not uh, deemed a concentration camp, It was a labor camp.</span> <span id="s7">We were fighting in the Hartz mountain sector.</span> <span id="s8">Um.</span> <span id="s9">On our way into fighting in Austria.</span> <span id="s10">Anyway, when we, when we, when we crossed this river and we came into this area the Germans were in there.</span> <span id="s11">But they were more, they didn't, they didn't put up any resistance and they had an airport nearby.</span> <span id="s12">And as a matter of fact this was the place I saw my first German jets.</span> <span id="s13">And I never knew what they were, but I knew they were just damn fast, because I tried to open up fire on them, a couple of them.</span> <span id="s14">And by the time you could get your guns trained, that thing was phew, gone like that.</span> <span id="s15">But anyway, um, we s- we s-, um, we passed this house and off in the distance you could see huge warehouses and then long rows of um, something like a, I don't know what, it's not a quonset hut, but uh, just a square, long buildings, and it had a gate in it.</span> <span id="s16">And I don't recall what the writing was up over the gate, but what it, what we did encounter, inside of there, I got out the turret of my tank, and walked in to see what was inside.</span> <span id="s17">And that was when I, d- d-, well you could smell death for maybe 20 miles before you ever got to it, because it's very dif-, humans and animals, entirely different.</span> <span id="s18">You can stand a cow or a horse or something that's been shot up, but a human being, is death, the stench of death from it is, it's, it's awful.</span> <span id="s19">So, I saw this high ceiling and this little narrow pathway down the center, and they had

id="s24">And can you imagine them being twi-, now me at six foot it is twice as high as I am tall, in other words you got twelve or fourteen feet.</span> <span id="s25">Now these bunks, they got little ladders going up there and these people, now you might find underneath here would be dead person, and in, living in that, living person was just too damn weak to even move.</span> <span id="s26">And all they, all they do is just hold out their hand, and you were afraid to touch them.</span> <span id="s27">Uh, some of them had scabs and sores and everything on them, they had just been there for- and- and what I understand that these people were fed a ounce of meat I think it was once a week.</span> <span id="s28">They were also given potato soup or cabbage soup once a day in a um, a small cube of bread, it might have been about like so.</span> <span id="s29">And I don't know how thick it was but it couldn't have been very thick.</span> <span id="s30">And they were nothing, they had an American Colonel in there, I don't know how many months he had been a prisoner, but he originally weighed about two, his height must have been, I'd say a good six four.</span> <span id="s31">He originally weighed about 230, maybe a little bit more.</span> <span id="s32">And I don't think that he weighed any more than eighty pounds when we saw him.</span> <span id="s33">So you can imagine the, the horror that those people suffered under Ger- German occupation.</span> <span id="s34">Um, as prisoners of war, they didn't even feed some of them.</span> <span id="s35">They- It was just- I- I- I- I- the only that I can say to you would have to have seen it.</span> <span id="s36">The pictures that you saw depicting the death in the concentration camps, this was identically the

to the rear.</span> <span id="s52">Uh there was no other gun there but that and they had them in there by the hundreds, just cases of them, you kind of like wonder where, you know, went all that

until they get their strength back to where your stomach becomes acclimated to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">SWB: Were you surprised?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">JOHN HOLMES: Yes I was.</span> <span id="s70">I truly was, because I just couldn't believe that an individual that is supposed to be fighting for the preservation of his cus- culture and his country could be doing this to people who had not defense.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">I couldn't believe this.</span> <span id="s72">Because you-you-you-you're flab bergasted.</span> <span id="s73">You-you're so shocked by what you're

fourteenth reconnaissance platoon was out scouting and they ran into a bunch of Nazi SS and they were captured.</span> <span id="s77">And we had a hell of a fire fight.</span> <span id="s78">And I-I definitely was responsible for killing one, two three, four, I'd say approximately six German soldiers myself.</span> <span id="s79">Directing fire in on them.</span> <span id="s80">They, these, they- they captured about a dozen of these uh, it-it was the fourteenth conance- reconnaissance unit.</span> <span id="s81">And they tied their hands behind their back and they tied their feet together, and I'm not telling you what somebody told me, I'm telling you what exactly I saw.</span> <span id="s82">And in this little town there must have been at least, no-oh- I don't even think this town had a-

prisoners.</span> <span id="s91">Cause you had to kill them.</span> <span id="s92">Because they were not going to surrender.</span> <span id="s93">The Nazi SS was not going to surrender.</span> <span id="s94">They would shoot and shoot until they were killed.</span> <span id="s95">It was stupid because they were raised all the way from the Hitler youth.</span> <span id="s96">And that's what they believed in.</span> <span id="s97">And when you caught them, they all had that insignia on their collar.</span> <span id="s98">So that's how you knew what you were fighting.</span> <span id="s99">But,

side, and we're in the middle of this town, and we had just got out of that, I had just got out of the turret of my tank, and we were kind of, the guys, y-y you need to stretch your legs a little bit
