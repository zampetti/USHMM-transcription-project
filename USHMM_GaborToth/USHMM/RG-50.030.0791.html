would make it 1901.</span> <span id="s255">And her father dies in an uprising when she’s five years old.</span> <span id="s256">That’s 1903.</span> <span id="s257">That’s well before World War

id="s609">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: Because the – the plans were, on your property, you – you build, you know, where you wanted.</span> <span id="s611">So – so that was close to the river, close to the border, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: By border you mean the territ – your – parents’ land?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: From the neighbors’ land.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s617">So, you went to find your father in the village of Krupa?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: What happened?</span> <span id="s620">What did you find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: On the – on the way to it, my father was led by group of Byelorussian boys, with the gun pointing at him, and walked towards us.</span> <span id="s622">Where they were walking – I really don’t know wher-where they wanted him to go.</span> <span id="s623">At that point, wasn’t yet towards Łyskow.</span> <span id="s624">In the Łyskow was – that was post office place, very small town.</span> <span id="s625">And in it was place for the police, and apparently – and they got the guns from the police over there, and – and police already was in the jail.</span> <span id="s626">And they were leading my father there.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: To the jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: To the jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: In Łyskow.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s631">And my father just said, go to Mom and tell her what you saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: Okay, but I’m a little confused.</span> <span id="s633">You’re saying this happened September first?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Oh, wait a minute.</span> <span id="s635">No, no, no, that’s not – not September first, that was 19th?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: September 19th?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: September 19th, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Okay, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s641">That’s – okay, that makes more sense, bec-because –</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: – September first is when Germany attacks.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Germany attacked.</span> <span id="s645">At that time, the radio still was working, and we heard the – the news on the radio yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s647">[phone ringing] We can stop, please [break]</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Okay, so we were talking about the radio still worked, and was telling – wi – there was information over the radio that the germ – Germany had attacked Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Do you remember how your parents reacted?</span> <span id="s651">How –</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Very, very worried.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: Didn’t know wha-what to do.</span> <span id="s655">And I really – I really don’t remember.</span> <span id="s656">They did – they didn’t want to upset us, you know, so that was a ri – a lot of it was hush hush.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Not – not to tell children much.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: And the next two weeks is – you know, did – was there any more news?</span> <span id="s660">Did you hear more things?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: More on the radio.</span> <span id="s662">Yeah, we were – we were getting some, but I don’t remember probably where the station was that they were getting the news.</span> <span id="s663">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: Did school start?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: No school.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: The school – school starts – my – my parents didn’t send us to school –</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: – at that time.</span> <span id="s670">Up f – at that time – no, that was when the Russians came in.</span> <span id="s671">Then – then our help went.</span> <span id="s672">They didn’t – they didn’t stay with us any more.</span> <span id="s673">But – but at this point, we were – we were still being taken care of, as far as the people working for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: And were the people who worked for you Byelorussian?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: From the villages.</span> <span id="s678">Mostly from – from another village that has the same name as our osada.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: Okay, a-as – as your settlement.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: As my settlement, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Which was bran –</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Brantowce.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: Brantowce.</span> <span id="s684">So there was a village Brantowce, and there was a settlement of Brantowce.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: Right.</span> <span id="s686">And I heard that Brantowce name came from the family name Brant.</span> <span id="s687">So – so he probably owned this – this property of – at our osada.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: Mm-hm, your settlement.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: And the village at earlier times, you know, probably the village –</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: – belonged to him, and the people worked for him, and he – I don’t know how – how it was working, but my father was paying to – to those women or men, you know, that were – were working in the fields.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: And you said there were two or more people working in the fields?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: Oh they – no, no, in the fields there were sometimes hundred people.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: Oh really?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Because – depending what was being done.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: So you mean, during the harvest time, or the –</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: – farming time, there could be many people.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s701">And they would come as day laborers to work on this –</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: Day.</span> <span id="s703">And I know my father gave them one zloty, which is what, like one dollar.</span> <span id="s704">So, each one got, so he always was prepared with those single – single zlotys.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: Did you have any interaction with these – with the villagers who would come to work with you – work at your father’s farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: What kind of interactions, what did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: I mean, did you talk to them, did they talk to you, did you know them by name?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Oh yes, when I was riding the horse, they were screaming that I am gonna fell – fall off.</span> <span id="s709">They – they were sa – shouting, [indecipherable] you gonna fall off the horse.</span> <span id="s710">And I – and I didn’t care.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s712">So, what happens – what happened after that?</span> <span id="s713">How did things progress?</span> <span id="s714">You know, the war’s declared, people are nervous.</span> <span id="s715">Nothing really much changes.</span> <span id="s716">And then what happens?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: Well, we – we just sit and wait, and – and get some news if you can.</span> <span id="s718">And if you get nothing, that’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: But until ra – Russians cross the border, that’s when radios were cut, and everything was cut.</span> <span id="s721">And Germans already got all the stations, so the cities on the west, and – and we just –</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: So was –</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: – completely became –</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: Isolated.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: – isolated, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: So, does that – on the day that no more news came over the radio, is that when your father said, I’m going to go to fi – that other village?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s729">And did you – did you know that the Russians had crossed the border at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: I – we didn’t.</span> <span id="s731">I don’t remember, that was surprise when we saw the tanks rolling down those roads.</span> <span id="s732">Because in our area, the roads were just a normal – how do you call?</span> <span id="s733">Field roads.</span> <span id="s734">But well used and everything, you know, so – so that’s what they were rolling those tanks on, and they were coming and – and so – so they didn’t come to – to our area, until the 19th.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: Was your father already arrested by then?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: No, that’s – that’s when – that’s when they arrested my father, on the – on the second day.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: On the second day.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: Because on the se – we were quite a ways from the border, so they didn’t come to our area until next – second day.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: So, early – early in the morning he – he went to find out the news, because he always read, and he always had to know.</span> <span id="s741">He wanted to know everything what’s going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: And when he went to find out, when you went to find him –</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: They – they – they arrested him.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: And brought him to the jail in Łyskow.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: Mm – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: And then you went – he told you to go home and tell your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: And – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: Oh, and he asked too that my – our mom bring some clean clothes, and – and some f-food, because he didn’t eat nothing from morning til – I think my mother probably got there maybe in the evening, she had to walk seven kilometers to the Łyskow –</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: – because –</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Why wouldn’t she go by horse, or by cart?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: I don’t know, maybe she – she went by – by cart.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: That I d – I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s758">But my father had to walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: And they walked him.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s762">So sh – de – was she able to see him?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: That day, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: She – and she gave him a clean clothes, an-and – and food.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: And was there any reason given as to why he was arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: Because he was Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: That was enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: They were – they were arresting all – all people that were well – well-to-do, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: And was your father – your family considered well-to-do?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s772">So they – and – and they didn’t let my father go home, and they kept him, and over there were – were a policeman and – and also Jakowinski(ph), the one that I was telling you about, who has a car.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Oh, so he was there too?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: And – and – and his – oh yeah, and his car was taken by the young Byelorussian boys, the one that – that was a chauffeur at –</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: For him.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: – for him.</span> <span id="s777">So he – he’s the – the one that owned that car, and the reason I know, or we know, because when – when my father was arrested second time, he was let go once.</span> <span id="s778">My mother went to the village, and she was asking for the people to – to get – to sign the petition for him, she got the whole list.</span> <span id="s779">I remember that list ve – so, so well, you know, that – that he – that my mother came home and is – and she said she gonna go now to – to Łyskow, and she gonna ask the people to let – let him come home.</span> <span id="s780">But before that, he was taken to Wolkowysk – no, no, no, that was from Łyskow, they let him come beca-because my mother says there’s nobody to help me, and she had a little baby, and she was not healthy.</span> <span id="s781">So – so –</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: So that – so her – when she went to the village of Brantowce, not the settlement but the village –</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: No, the – not Brantowce, this was to Krupa.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: To Krupa.</span> <span id="s785">And were – and people signed this petition –</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: – and it was to request that your father be let go?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: Did she go to Byelorussian people, or to –</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Well, they organized their own government.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: Police was fi – you know, how do you call it, fired or whatever.</span> <span id="s795">Arrested, arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: The police – the police was arrest –</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: Arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: – relieved of their duties and then arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: And they – and they rep-replaced that government with Byelorussian people.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Why would the Byelorussian people from Krupa sign a petition to release your father?</span> <span id="s801">What was in their interest for them to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: Because my father, he had to move the fish from the summer ponds, into the winter ponds.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: And – and that had to be done manually.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: He usually had couple men that were doing it, but when they let him go, then he came and – and he moved the –</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: The fish.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: – the fish himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: So e – he was allowed to leave because there was nece – necessary work to be done –</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: And the new –</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: And they didn’t want to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: And they didn’t want to do this work?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: And my father paid for it.</span> <span id="s817">That he – they were not free, you know, they – they were coming, and – and I ni – I saw my father every time they – the people were working, he always had some money to give.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s819">So the villagers in Krupa, their reason to sign the petition is that they didn’t want to do the work that needed to be done, and it was to let your father go so he could do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s822">And the – and the people who let him go were local people, was that right?</span> <span id="s823">It was local people who arrested him, and local people who let him go?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: Parth – part of that – that group, that Byelorussian people.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: And did you – when you had seen him on the road, had you recognized the – the people who were guarding him?</span> <span id="s826">Did you know who they were?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: We – we didn’t know because usually children like us, you know, that – of the people with the property, or that had little – and Polish people, because there – there was a lot of Polish people that were buying land here.</span> <span id="s830">It was for sale, and they would move from the western part, here.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: So that was something that was done all the – all the time after the first World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: Did the be – were – had relations been bad with the local Byelorussian people?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: From Krupa children were be – very bad.</span> <span id="s835">I’m talking about children.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: They were throwing – throw – sta –</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: Stones?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: – rocks, stone at us, shouting at us, calling us – how did they call Irchu(ph)?</span> <span id="s840">Polaki(ph)?</span> <span id="s841">Polaki(ph), and – and something else.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A2: With the dogs – with dogs they were, and the dogs –</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: With dogs they – they were chasing us.</span> <span id="s844">So we – we used to go in the back of the village, we couldn’t go through the middle.</span> <span id="s845">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: This is before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: That was before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: So they – they were preparing – they knew probably what was – will come, and happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: You think so, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: I think it was planned real well.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: Your father is released, and he comes back and he moves the fish from the summer pond to the winter pond.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Yeah, yeah, and – and that’s all the – in barns, and – and feeds the stock and – and all, you know, until – until he is arrested second time.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: When was he – how was he arrested the second time, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: It was January fifth.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: So three months had gone by?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: And then –</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Okay, and then January fifth, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: And then the – that car from Jakowinski(ph) –</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: So, that had belonged to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: – that drives up.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: And it’s winter, and it’s parked in the house – front of the house, and we – we just – it was cold outside, so we – we didn’t play, and besides that, it was such a time that – that we were not sure what’s going on.</span> <span id="s868">And so – so we see from the car comes out couple sol – Russian soldiers, and – and with them comes that Jakowinski’s(ph) chauffeur.</span> <span id="s869">And that chauffeur was a relative of our neighbor.</span> <span id="s870">Our neighbor was married to a Byelorussian woman.</span> <span id="s871">Very nice woman, I have no bad word about her.</span> <span id="s872">And – and he comes and leads those people, and tells them things, that my father was so and so, the bad one, you know.</span> <span id="s873">All the bad words that he could find.</span> <span id="s874">He di – he never saw my father before, or maybe saw because my father co – sometimes visited Jakowinski(ph).</span> <span id="s875">So – but that was – I – I – I – I don’t know why – why he did it, or, well, probably for his benefit.</span> <span id="s876">And – and – and they ask my father to show his pictures.</span> <span id="s877">So he, of course, has taken the – not the family albums, he took the – his – from – from the jail, with all his friends, and the – and – and they started, you know, telling that my father was so bad, that my father was beating them, and – and – and things – things that I was listening, I – I don’t even remember any more.</span> <span id="s878">But he was li – he was accused so badly.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: In front of you, in front of all the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: In – in – in front of all the family.</span> <span id="s881">And the – and – and then – then they take that – that was a little – we used to take little cases like that to the beach here.</span> <span id="s882">And that was my father’s little suitcase that he kept his papers and army – army papers and everything.</span> <span id="s883">They took everything.</span> <span id="s884">And then they told my father, get dressed,

id="s1150">And why is that if you were the last to pick up – to be picked up, you had so much time?</span> <span id="s1151">I would have thought they would give you less time, because everybody is waiting in those sleighs, and it’s cold outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: I don’t know, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1153">Well – well anyway, I – I wanted also to take a – a picture of my

<p><span id="s1169">A: And – and they put the comforters for us to sit in, and so we wrapped ourselves.</span> <span id="s1170">My mom didn’t know what to do, how to take baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: So – so she took two pillows, and put Jereczek in between those and try to block the cold air and everything from him.</span> <span id="s1173">So – so sh-she – she was saying, I don’t know if he will live.</span> <span id="s1174">Maybe he’s choked, and everything.</span> <span id="s1175">But somehow he survived.</span> <span id="s1176">So – so when we were dri – I want to say driving – riding those sleds, we got halfway only to station, to Wolkowysk.</span> <span id="s1177">So they took us into the palace of – don’t remember already names.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: I – I di – I should have prepared myself, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: It’s okay.</span> <span id="s1181">But it was a – a local palace.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: A local palace in one of the villages, halfway to Wolkowysk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: So it was like a large estate?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: Very.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: And that was a – and they – they took all the sleds that were behind us, and – and us in there.</span> <span id="s1187">And I remembered where I was sitting, because we couldn’t sl-sleep there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: It was so many people, and I was sitting with my – my sister and my brother by the window.</span> <span id="s1190">So when we came in, I went – I-I’m talking about my trip – I went straight to that place, and I said that’s – that’s where we were sitting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: Oh, that is when you – when you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: Oh, that night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: That night.</span> <span id="s1195">We spend the night there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: So, you’re talking when you took a trip to your hometown many years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: That you found the palace, and – and you’ve –</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: Found the pla – yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: – you told them where you were sitting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: And I remember when – I remembered everything vividly.</span> <span id="s1202">Nothing – now I am losing memory, but when I was writing my book, I – I – I remembered everything as if I’m there now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: So – so that’s very –</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: Was this – was this palace one of Polish nobility?</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: So it had been –</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: [indecipherable] they were arrested also, either killed, or – or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">A: – or like my father, taken to a gulag.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1212">What was the manner of these – I mean, it sounds – it sounds actually, as rough as the soldier was, he was doing you a kindness –</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: – by – by helping pack things up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">A: Yes, he was – he was very nice, and you know, children will sometimes hold the hands, and – and their hands are freezing, and whatever.</span> <span id="s1216">When he saw my hands, he says – he started – you take your – that hand, and you kind of roll in between yours, and – to warm it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: And he – he did – he did that for me.</span> <span id="s1219">And – and then my – my mom, you know, when our sled, on one – on the way back next day, s – fell over, and we ended up in the snow, he was helping us and – and it was – i-i – Russian soldiers, they have to be th-the way they – they are.</span> <span id="s1220">They have to be in doing what Stalin told them.</span> <span id="s1221">But some of them, they are forced to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: So you could tell they didn’t want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1224">So they – they had – and they – they had good people and bad people like everywhere else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: And was – was – were other soldiers like him who were – who were taking – I meant, those who came to take you, or was there manner in general –</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: Right, it wasn’t like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: They – when they left, that’s when he started.</span> <span id="s1229">Because it came five of them, and then only one or two, I – I – that I don’t remember already.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: So, I – I would have to read my book and maybe refresh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: That’s okay.</span> <span id="s1233">But it – but it means that when he was left alone, and there was no one else to see him –</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: – he could afford to be helpful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: He showed – yeah, he showed his feeling for us, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: – what they were doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: So, you stayed overnight there, near the window –</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: – in this palace?</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: And what was the next day like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: Next day they put – took us to this – the same sled, but there were things missing already.</span> <span id="s1245">So somebody stole some of the food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: And so whatever we took from the home, already wasn’t – wasn’t as much there as – as it was taken.</span> <span id="s1248">So – but –</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: And then you say you’d continued the journey?</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: Continued the journey to the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: And where was the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: And th-the train was in Wolkowysk, at the station, not too far from my uncle.</span> <span id="s1253">And my – my mom’s aunt.</span> <span id="s1254">So – and in – on the way close to Wolkowysk, I saw a sled, a small sled, you know, and – coming with the horses real fast, and looking at us all the time.</span> <span id="s1255">And the people.</span> <span id="s1256">Not – not especially us, you know, but – but trying to identify.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A: When they saw my mom, and us, they turned around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q: Do you know who it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">A: It was my aunt and my uncle.</span> <span id="s1261">No, my – I’m sorry, not my – that – she – that was my babcia.</span> <span id="s1262">That’s my mom’s aunt.</span> <span id="s1263">Oh, no, no, thank you, I have –</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: And – and babcia, that’s the one that I – I was tal-talking about, that’s my – my mo – babcia, my mom’s ciocia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1268">So – so they turned around, and they went back to Wolkowysk, because they – they knew where.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: They knew that it was you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1271">And then, apparently, Babcia watched all the time, which – which boxcar, because those were animal thi-things.</span> <span id="s1272">And which – which one was the – the one that they pushed us in.</span> <span id="s1273">So, after – after we got in, a Russian soldier came and naw – opened the door, and – and told Babcia to – to give what she had.</span> <span id="s1274">She brought –</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: That’s unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: – she brought so-some – how do you call?</span> <span id="s1277">Tea, hot tea, and some sandwiches.</span> <span id="s1278">And she wanted to take Irka(ph).</span> <span id="s1279">And Irka(ph) was smaller, so – so she thought she can raise her.</span> <span id="s1280">And Irk-Irka(ph) was holding so – so hard to my mom’s hand that – an-and they didn’t let her to be taken away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: So, she wouldn’t go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A: She wouldn’t go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1284">Would the soldier have let her go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: Force her?</span> <span id="s1286">No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: Not force her, but would she – if she had wanted to, do you think –</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1289">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s1290">Maybe he would.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: What you describe sounds very unusual, that someone was allowed close enough to the train –</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: – to give – to give water, or food, or tea, or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A: Well, she spoke Russian.</span> <span id="s1295">He possibly thought that she’s Russian, and she was [indecipherable] and whatever, Polish.</span> <span id="s1296">So – and – and she was living there all her life.</span> <span id="s1297">Because there – there were Polish and – and there were lithu – Lithuanian also –</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: I’m sure.</span> <span id="s1300">So – so that – and that is not unusual, but – but after she spoke Russian, she talk – he didn’t know, and he let her –</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: And he let her –</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: – let her gaved whatever he brought –</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: She brought, yeah.</span> <span id="s1304">What were the boxcars like?</span> <span id="s1305">What did they look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: There was three levels, so when you get – got in, you couldn’t sit, you – you should – you could get in and – and just lay there, or – or sleep.</span> <span id="s1307">And otherwise, you couldn’t sit in there.</span> <span id="s1308">So it –</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: So who helped you put your trunk in the boxcar?</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: They – whoever was, you know, I’m sure my brother was one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: And my brother was very – like in charge of ev-everything, so – so he watched.</span> <span id="s1313">But as far as food, we didn’t have much, because somebody stole.</span> <span id="s1314">But – but my mom did little bit of this, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: But your mother was there with an infant, with a baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: Yes, and – and when we – we got there, she – she thought that she gon – he gonna have a real – a real red butt, because he wasn’t changed all day, and – and between the two pillows.</span> <span id="s1317">So – but everything was okay.</span> <span id="s1318">We took him all the way to Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q: And you had to change diapers on the lo – on the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1321">I don’t know how my mom – mom did that.</span> <span id="s1322">Maybe she just – or if – if he – he – he was still milking my mom.</span> <span id="s1323">At that time I don’t know if she had anything, but she – she had whatever she had, and otherwise I – I think she tried to substitute.</span> <span id="s1324">He was – he was at that time, only from June to – about eight months old.</span> <span id="s1325">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: Did he cry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">A: First he did, and I remember my mom said, when – when we were on the way, and he was about – between those pillows, she heard him cry.</span> <span id="s1328">But then she says, oh, he – he quit crying.</span> <span id="s1329">So maybe she – he is asleep.</span> <span id="s1330">But then she says, or maybe he is not alive.</span> <span id="s1331">So – so things – things were – you know, everything wasn’t sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">Q: So wa – was she on a lower plank, or on an upper plank?</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">A: They – they got us in between, so we – we had – so – so it was probably above the – the lower, an-and the – and the lower wer-were suitcases.</span> <span id="s1334">And on this one was – I don’t – my hand is not good.</span> <span id="s1335">Probably that wa – that high.</span> <span id="s1336">And the – and the third one – the – the best was for the highest people, but you know, men or – or – or somebody that is more quicker, not with baby, you know, they took those places, and we got, you know, some who are in between.</span> <span id="s1337">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: Why would they be the best places, the ones on top?</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">A: More air.</span> <span id="s1340">It was – it was mo – more space.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: And in between was – you had to breathe so – so the air was coming from here and there.</span> <span id="s1343">Was kind of stuffy.</span> <span id="s1344">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Q: Did you know any of the other people in your boxcar?</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: No, because when we were riding on a – with those sleds, our – our sled turned over, and then everybody went, so the neighbors from – from the – our osada, they went, and we stayed be – until they lifted the sled, and put us back into the sled.</span> <span id="s1349">And then w – then we were coming with different – different people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">A: So when they put us in – and there was 60 people in our boxcar.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">Q: Sixty.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">A: So 30 on one side, 30 on the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q: Were there other people who had babies?</span> <span id="s1355">Were there more babies?</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">A: Not in our boxcar.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: Only Jereczek.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: So what happened after that?</span> <span id="s1360">You’re in the boxcar, what happens?</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: Well then – then we waited, I think two days, by the time they apparently the whole – there was about hundred – hundred of those boxcars, full of deportees, and – and then – and then we started going.</span> <span id="s1362">But they – in – in this area, between bra – no, between – oh my gosh, again no name.</span> <span id="s1363">Well [indecipherable] next – next station when – when the large station, when they got us there, we had to wait for Baranowicze.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: Baranowicze.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: I got it, Baranowicze.</span> <span id="s1366">There they were changing the tracks from European width to the Russian.</span> <span id="s1367">So we had to wait there until they finish.</span> <span id="s1368">When they finished, it was like second day or third day, something like that.</span> <span id="s1369">And then – then we had to carry everything from – from this one to – to the other one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: Oh, so you changed, actually, cattle cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1372">And there, we had little more room –</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: – than – than on the Polish ones.</span> <span id="s1375">So they had – then we got – also on the lower, but – but there wasn’t three of them, was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">Q: It was two –</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">A: – it was two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q: – it was two platforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: Two – two platforms, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1381">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A: So – so it was a little – a little easier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: And was it a – everybody from the firs – from the di – was it everybody who was in one boxcar then gets transferred to the same boxcar on the next train, or di –</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: Probably –</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">A: – because they – they were keeping really soldiers were standing so nobody will run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">A: So – so that’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: So that – at that point did you know you were in the Soviet Union?</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: No, it wasn’t yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: It wasn’t yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">A: Because Baranowicze –</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: Is still Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: – is still Poland.</span> <span id="s1395">So to the border was still quite a few miles –</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">A: – or kilometers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Q: So what happened after that, how did things go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: Well, then – then we started rolling, once they packed us all.</span> <span id="s1400">And we were – we were going fast, and people were watching, you know, some of them, there’s – you know, there is about two – two windows on one side, on – on top.</span> <span id="s1401">So – so we were watching some of them.</span> <span id="s1402">You know, if you were lucky, where is the Polish border?</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: Could they find it, could they see it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: We saw, and – and they started singing [speaks Polish] and things like that, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q: What are those?</span> <span id="s1406">Are those –</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: Hymn.</span> <span id="s1408">Polish,

yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">A: That was – and – and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: And so the boxcar would just sing that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">A: Singing all the Polish, one after the other, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">Q: How – how could you tell – how could those who –</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">A: Sorry my voice is –</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">Q: I appreciate that you sang it.</span> <span id="s1427">Thank you.</span> <span id="s1428">How could you tell when you were pro – crossing the border, that this is Poland, and this is no longer Poland?</span> <span id="s1429">What looked different?</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">A: And there were wires, how do you call those wires, with the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Q: Barbed

know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: Take a look.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">A: – climb up and – and take a look.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">A: And we had to do it quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">A: Just a – a look and – and that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">Q: Yeah.</span> <span

know, so – so I – I just remember that, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q: Did you cry a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: As a child, you – you don’t know so much what’s happening.</span> <span id="s1449">My mom – oh, my – our mom fainted.</span> <span id="s1450">When the train – that was yet in Wolkowysk, when the train moved –</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">Q: Okay, the first train, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">A: – the first – my – our mom fainted.</span> <span id="s1453">And we cried and cried because we didn’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s1454">I – I never saw my mother faint, you know, and – and all of a sudden, you know, she’s – I thought she died.</span> <span id="s1455">And once – one lady, apparently she was maybe nurse, and she – she had smelling –</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">Q: Salts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">A: – salt – salts, and – and she do – did that to her [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">Q: So to bring her back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">A: To bring her back, yes.</span> <span id="s1460">And – an-and then I – I don’t know if she fainted again, or – or not, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: How did people behave with one another on that train, on that car?</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: Oh, we were – we were like – we didn’t know each other, but – but we – we talked to each other like to your brother or sister, because that’s all – you are – you are sitting here and – and you’re – you’re going.</span> <span id="s1463">Going to the same place, going from your home, a warm har – home.</span> <span id="s1464">And – an-and I don’t know if you want to hear about conditions in that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">A: In – we didn’t have any toilets, of course.</span> <span id="s1467">The only thing, there was a hole in the floor, and – and nothing else.</span> <span id="s1468">No – no cover, no nothing, so – so how – how do you do that?</span> <span id="s1469">Some – some people had extra blankets.</span> <span id="s1470">They somehow managed to h – to hang it up, to – to cover –</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: Hide it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: – make it private.</span> <span id="s1473">So that was it.</span> <span id="s1474">But, it was fro – freezing temperature.</span> <span id="s1475">It didn’t take long until that hole was all fr-frozen, and no more hole.</span> <span id="s1476">So the only way you could empty yourself, outside.</span> <span id="s1477">So everybody, didn’t matter, a lady or – or – or a man, or – or – or who – the child, everybody had to go –</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">Q: Outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">A: – outside.</span> <span id="s1480">And a Russian soldier would stand with a gun over you.</span> <span id="s1481">Y-You open your – your panties [indecipherable] and it became, you know, everything – you have to go.</span> <span id="s1482">But eventually when – when you didn’t eat so much, so you didn’t need to go so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Q: So how often would they open the train doors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">A: I think maybe twice a day.</span> <span id="s1485">So – so that was – and – and another thing was they gave you a loaf of bread the first day, and a bucket of water for – for all – for whole 60 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">A: So – so we – we didn’t get much food, and of course that – that wasn’t en – and how much water did you get when you have a – a bucket of water?</span> <span id="s1488">So – so you just get cup or something, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">Q: So people must have been hungry very quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">A: Well, hungry and – but gradually your stomach gets – gets –</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">Q: Adjusted?</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">A: – adjusted to that, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">Q: Did anybody get sick on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">A: Everybody.</span> <span id="s1495">They – they were sick, they were dying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Q: There were de – people who were dying in your car?</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">A: And babies – babies I’ve seen they threw out.</span> <span id="s1498">They – you couldn’t carry it because it wouldn’t – and can you imagine the mother, losing a child?</span> <span id="s1499">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q: Did this happen in your boxcar too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">A: No.</span> <span id="s1502">Luckily, in our boxcar there was no dead person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1504">But you saw in the other boxcars.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">A: But we saw through that little window, once in a while, you know.</span> <span id="s1506">Or sometimes the door was opening, and they were carrying out from the other door.</span> <span id="s1507">So they didn’t consider people as people.</span> <span id="s1508">To them was like animal carrying the – I’ve seen so many dead, so many.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">Q: What happened where you got – when did you – where did you end up?</span> <span id="s1510">Where did the train take you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">A: It took us to a station – through vol – Moscow, Vologda, and at Vologda our train turned north towards Arkhangelsk.</span> <span id="s1512">And on the way to Arkhangelsk, at the station that – I have it in my book, but not in my head, finally they stopped the train and si – told us to take our stuff out.</span> <span id="s1513">They had, again, sleds waiting for us.</span> <span id="s1514">They helped my – my brother, or probably one of the people was helping to – to put that trunk on.</span> <span id="s1515">And – and us – and my sister and I and my mom, we were allowed to ride, but not my brother.</span> <span id="s1516">My brother had to walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: Your 15 year old brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: My 15 years old brother.</span> <span id="s1519">And he walked all way to – to Shilova.</span> <span id="s1520">Every night we would stop in a village, Russian village, of the people that were also deportees from the first – from the revolution –</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">A: – Russian revolution.</span> <span id="s1523">And at one house a woman, when she saw my mom, she st – with the baby, she started crying.</span> <span id="s1524">Apparently she had a baby too, and – when she was deported, and now – now –</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Q: She sees someone else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A: – she – she sees one and she – she started t-telling my mother – my mother spoke Russian, because she was through – through a couple, in German and – and Russian occupations.</span> <span id="s1527">So to – to my mother, the languages were not strange.</span> <span id="s1528">And – and then – then sh – we – I don’t know why she took us downstairs, but as we were walking downstairs, there was a little curtain, and she opened that, and she showed a Blessed Mother picture, and she says, I too believe in God.</span> <span id="s1529">And didn’t – didn’t say much, because they are afraid, you know, their – they were afraid.</span> <span id="s1530">So – so – so we slept there on the floor.</span> <span id="s1531">They provided just floor because that’s all they had, probably one bed for themselves, and – and nothing else.</span> <span id="s1532">So that was our first night.</span> <span id="s1533">Then s – then I think we – we had like four or five – they’re in the book.</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">A: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">Q: How long did it take to get to Slishko(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">A: To Shilova?</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">Q: Shilova, excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">A: A week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1541">And your brother walked the whole time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: And – and every day he had to walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: And what about your baby brother, your – the other brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: The – the baby brother was okay yet, and my mom – but he had very clean – she probably had enough powder or whatever, you know, to – to help him to heal and – but that’s – that’s all she ca – she could do.</span> <span id="s1545">But that woman was very helpful.</span> <span id="s1546">Well, I guess we – we met a lot of people on the way, good people.</span> <span id="s1547">I cannot – cannot complain.</span> <span id="s1548">There were bad people, but those not necessarily were Russians.</span> <span id="s1549">They could be Polish.</span> <span id="s1550">Because when they stole something, I don’t think the Russian would carry, because – although, who knows?</span> <span id="s1551">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">Q: So did this lady – did this lady have food to give you as well, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">A: Just kipiatok.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">Q: And what’s kipiatok?</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">A: Just hot water.</span> <span id="s1556">And they – they all had ra – rationing, so we – we – we couldn’t expect and – or if – if the government gave them something, you know, but otherwise – and like they appar – apparently expected that we did take enough food, you know, for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">Q: So when you get to Shilova, what is – what did you find there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">A: They put us in one room, two families.</span> <span id="s1559">And the room was maybe a – like this living room to – til – to here.</span> <span id="s1560">From there maybe it’s even – this is ba – bigger.</span> <span id="s1561">And – and one side was boards, and nothing else, no mattresses, no nothing, for one family, and the other si-side boards also sta – you know, it’s like a table, and – and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">Q: So was it like a room that would be 10 by 10?</span> <span id="s1563">Ten feet by ten feet, or – about half the size of this living room?</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">A: Yeah, that’s – that’s all, only – only that much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">A: And there was one table, small table in the middle, by the window.</span> <span id="s1567">And two – two chairs, but not real chairs like we have, the one with the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">A: So – and – and then there was one small bed yet, a real – real bed.</span> <span id="s1570">That – that one was my s – my brothers’.</span> <span id="s1571">So four of us in – in one, across, because otherwise would be not enough room for – for – for us.</span> <span id="s1572">So – so we did across, legs – legs probably my Mom’s were falling – showing.</span> <span id="s1573">And – and the same, the other family was three children and the father and mother.</span> <span id="s1574">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: So five people on one, and five in the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">Q: Ten people in this small room.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">A: In this small room, and one stove, and one of those, like many, many years ago, when there was no electric type stoves, or – or electric whatever, you know, it’s – it’s very primitive.</span> <span id="s1579">So – so that’s all.</span> <span id="s1580">Do you – then the next day, they came, the [indecipherable] is the one that’s in charge of whole – whole 800 people there that they brought.</span> <span id="s1581">In – in that they – they – he comes, and he asks who is – who is the man in the family.</span> <span id="s1582">And the only man was my – my brother.</span> <span id="s1583">One person has to work, he said.</span> <span id="s1584">So you’re going to work, at 15, with the men, with adults.</span> <span id="s1585">And whatever – whatever he earned during the day – if he didn’t make his ra-arash – a ration?</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">Q: Quota?</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">A: Quota.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Q: Quota, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: If he didn’t make his quota, he would get less – less bread.</span> <span id="s1590">There was soup and bread that they could – could get when they were working, once a day.</span> <span id="s1591">And – an-and bread, they could divide for morning and – and on lunch.</span> <span id="s1592">And if – if they didn’t, you know, then they didn’t have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">Q: So what did they do in Shilova, what was ki – what was the work that your brother had to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">A: Cutting.</span> <span id="s1595">Cutting tr-trees, trimming branches on them, and – a-and putting them in a – a mound that they were told that that’s how it sh – the measurements have to be, the – the length of it, and – and – and so much high – height, and – and so – so that’s what my brother was supposed to – and I – I didn’t know until I read my brother’s report when he – when he was getting into the army, Polish army.</span> <span id="s1596">So – so at that time, he wrote that he was not getting enough food, and they were cutting, and that’s why he was getting sick being there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">Q: So that meant your – your older brother was working as an adult, even though he was 15 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">Q: And was his ration, his food, for the whole family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A: No, that was for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">A: But only as much –</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">Q: As he worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">A: – as each person should get it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">Q: And so they said he didn’t me – ma – meet his quota –</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">A: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">Q: – and so he would get less food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">Q: And the – I mean, it sounds like the cards were stacked against him, because he was a boy to begin with –</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">Q: – to have to do an adult job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1613">So – and on the first summer, he came home, they brought him home sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: So he didn’t come home every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">A: No, he was in the camp for half a year, for New Year’s – New Year’s day they would give the day, that was holiday, and for first of May.</span> <span id="s1616">And there – there was holiday.</span> <span id="s1617">So – so those days they would come home.</span> <span id="s1618">Otherwise, they were working all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Q: So he was taken away, and you never saw him, except for such holidays, and in the summertime, and you, fr – if I count, do you know the date you arrived in Shilova?</span> <span id="s1620">If it –</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">A: To Shilova?</span> <span id="s1622">I know in the book.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">Q: It’s in the book?</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">A2: I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1626">Well, when we interview you, then we will – we will get that then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">A2: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">Q: But I would say that it’s probably if you were taken on February 10th, you know, and you spent some days until you cross the border from Poland into the Soviet Union, probably sometime in – at the end of the month, or the beginning of March is when you arrived there.</span> <span id="s1629">I’m just estimating.</span> <span id="s1630">So your brother is taken, and you don’t see him at least until May first.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1633">And when he came –</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">A: Until he got sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Q: So what did he get sick from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">A: A nutri – nutrition.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">Q: A lack of nutrition.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">A: Less of nutrition.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q: What was his disease?</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">A: First time was he couldn’t see.</span> <span id="s1641">He – hi – he lost the vision at night.</span> <span id="s1642">So, they sent him home, and he came with a raw liver.</span> <span id="s1643">Because on Siberia we didn’t see them eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">A: But when somebody is sick and couldn’t work, then they found it.</span> <span id="s1646">And – and he – he came with that, and my mother was chopping it and trying to make it – no – no onion, no – no spices.</span> <span id="s1647">Maybe she had some little salt or something.</span> <span id="s1648">So – so she would prepare that for him, and – and he had to eat.</span> <span id="s1649">And my sister knows what the – what – how it tastes because she had – she had the problem in her life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1651">Now, in – what did the rest of you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">A: Before my si – my brother and that one date before, when he headed home, he showed me how to cut the trees – tree down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">A: And which tree to cut.</span> <span id="s1655">Which tree is dry, dead.</span> <span id="s1656">So I went with him, and – and I helped him to cut.</span> <span id="s1657">And when we cut it down, he showed us how – how to cut into pieces.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">A: And how to put on a sled.</span> <span id="s1660">Oh, one thing –</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">A: – or more things that they gave us to take from home, our sled that we were playing with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">Q: So you could bring a sled?</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">A: So we could bring the sled, just was – it wasn’t big.</span> <span id="s1665">It was probably that big.</span> <span id="s1666">It was ours to – for down – downhill.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">A: And that thing came – came in so handy, because we took that sled, and we went to – to the – where the bog is, but in the wintertime it’s frozen.</span> <span id="s1669">And there are the trees that are dead.</span> <span id="s1670">So we cut those trees, one by one, and were carrying home.</span> <span id="s1671">So my brother helped me to prepare that foo – that wood, and – and we – and I learned how to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">A: So then, next day, my sister, I took her with me, okay, we are going.</span> <span id="s1674">Because to cut the tree, we had one – one long saw that you have to pull on each side, so – so she was on one side, I was on the other.</span> <span id="s1675">We cut it, and then I did everything what my brother taught me, and we started wa – bringing the f – the wood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">Q: So you would at least have heat for the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">A: Heat and – and cooking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q: And what about the other family, did they do the same thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">A: I always think, you know, they used our wood.</span> <span id="s1680">Because there was two boys, and one boy was my brother’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">Q: Age.</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: – age, so he went to work in a forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">A: But the other one stayed here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">A: And – and they – I don’t remember i – them bringing any – any wood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">Q: Did they contribute in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">A: I – I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1690">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1692">Eventually they – they moved to another room, but – but that was probably a year later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">Q: So what did – did your mother stay in the room with your baby brother, or did she have to work as well?</span> <span id="s1694">Did she get –</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">A: No, my mother was getting release from work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">A: Relief because one of – this baby, and the other one, she had something wrong.</span> <span id="s1698">When she was walking, she was holding her here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">Q: Her side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">A: So she apparently had something, either intestines, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">Q: She was not well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">A: She was not well, and each time – and – and also, she was getting migraine.</span> <span id="s1703">I am blessed with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q: Oh, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">A: Today – today I had to take pills.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">Q: Oh, what a pity, what a pity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">A: That’s okay, I forgive my mom.</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s1709">So she was not well, and you and your sister would go and get the wood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">Q: Did you have any other duties that you had to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">A: Eventually we went to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">A: I’ll – but when we went to school, it was morning hours.</span> <span id="s1715">And then in afternoon, we got the job.</span> <span id="s1716">We could work and make some money.</span> <span id="s1717">So it was a [indecipherable] which, cubic meters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">Q: A cubic meter, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">A: Cubic meter, and we had to cut the wood a certain am –</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">Q: Length.</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">A: – length, and make it until it reaches the – the requirement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">A: And then we got something like maybe one ruble, or something for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">A: I know it wasn’t much, but it was helping my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">A: Because whatever he was giving us was enough only to buy bread.</span> <span id="s1728">So – so but we sa – somehow we survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">Q: Were you selling some of the items from the trunk?</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1731">We – we were going to Russian people, those that were previously deported.</span> <span id="s1732">And the village was on the other side of the lake.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">A: In the wintertime the lake froze, so we could get there.</span> <span id="s1735">But no boats or anything that could take us across.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">A: Some – some of the women from the other side sometimes would come here.</span> <span id="s1738">And I remember my mom had a sweater, like a – a wool for knitting.</span> <span id="s1739">And she didn’t know how to knit, and I didn’t learn because I didn’t want to learn, because the village people were – were doing that.</span> <span id="s1740">So I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">Q: Oh really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">A: – oh, this – I – I had s-some kind of stupid pride.</span> <span id="s1743">And so – so when my mother was selling that, she says, see, you could have make a nice sweater for yourself, and now you don’t know how.</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">A: And would you believe, I – I took the needles [indecipherable] and I – and I knew it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">Q: You learned how?</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">A: The only – by myself this time.</span> <span id="s1748">Because that women that was teaching me, apparently she showed me enough that I memorized.</span> <span id="s1749">I wasn’t that stupid, like now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">Q: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1751">Very good, very good.</span> <span id="s1752">So that you – you sold the sweater to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">A: To the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">Q: – to the villagers over in the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1756">And they gave you more when it was ne – new.</span> <span id="s1757">So – but it wasn’t that much, you know, that wasn’t – I don’t know, maybe two sweaters or something.</span> <span id="s1758">But things like that, you know, and they gave us a lot of those, in the – in the trunk, you know, the – those things, pillowcases and – and so – so all that, you know, helped us.</span> <span id="s1759">Except at the end we already at the end of our stay there, it wasn’t enough to do exchanging or – because we – we would ask for the bread, gave us loaf, you know.</span> <span id="s1760">Okay, I will give you – give you this.</span> <span id="s1761">I mean, it’s – it’s that kind of, you know, business.</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">Q: That kind of bartering.</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">A: Bartering, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">A: So – so we – we did that, you know, and – and – and then in the summertime, we did have berries.</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">A: Especially cranberries.</span> <span id="s1768">The only problem was, you had to go into a bog.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">Q: A bog, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">A: And – and – and there was ice yet floating on top, so the water was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">Q: Cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">A: – cold.</span> <span id="s1773">And I’m – I am – I started getting some kind of sores on my legs.</span> <span id="s1774">So apparently from cold –</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">A: – cold water.</span> <span id="s1777">But – but we went couple times with Irka(ph) to – to pick, and we were selling, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">Q: The cranberries?</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">A: – cranberries, yeah.</span> <span id="s1780">And also, we could – they – they provided for us, a barrel.</span> <span id="s1781">In that barrel you could preserve those blueberry – n-no, cranberries.</span> <span id="s1782">And – and they would provide some food, and of course vitamins.</span> <span id="s1783">So – so we saved for us, and then selled what – sold what was too much for us.</span> <span id="s1784">And – and then get couple, and some – and for that extra money, we would ma-make – buy soup.</span> <span id="s1785">Because they were providing fish soup.</span> <span id="s1786">They called it uha(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">Q: Uha(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">A: So, the [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">Q: How is – how is your brother doing, your little brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">A: He didn’t last too long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">A: There was no – no food for baby.</span> <span id="s1793">My mom would – would – I – I remember was chewing that bread, and – and giving them chewed up, you know, it’s – she would never do that, but that’s the on-only way the baby could – because he was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">Q: Digest it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">A: Yeah, he wasn’t even a year old.</span> <span id="s1796">So, at – he was getting sick all the time.</span> <span id="s1797">She didn’t have any – she was so – so slim.</span> <span id="s1798">She was a nice – probably your – your size person, and then when – when it came, probably like Easter, first Easter, he already was getting sick and – and diarrhea, and – and things like that, you know, and – and not – not too – too long, he was already with bloody discharge from his rectum.</span> <span id="s1799">So – so that – that was already beginning of the illness that he died of.</span> <span id="s1800">And he died on July – I don’t know, fourth or – or second.</span> <span id="s1801">Something in beginning of July.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">Q:

Huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">A: Oh wait a minute.</span> <span id="s1816">I’m – I’m – I’m already mixed up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">Q: Okay, you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">A: Well, I know he was year old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">Q: He was at least a year old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">A: Yeah, on July, okay –</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">Q: So then –</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">A: Yeah, yeah, I’m okay.</span> <span id="s1823">That’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">Q: Yeah –</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">A: – that’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">Q: – so it was right –</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">A: – that was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">Q: – he lasted five months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">A: – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">Q: Five months –</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">Q: – of captivity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">Q: And then he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">A: And in eight – eight or – or seven years – seven months of –</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">Q: Of normal life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">A: – a normal life, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1839">So, early July is when he dies, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">Q: – do you remember that moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">A: Oh, do I. [crying] He was a – like our ba – doll.</span> <span id="s1843">We played with him, we did ev-everything with him.</span> <span id="s1844">My mom didn’t have to do not – not much.</span> <span id="s1845">We both, Irka(ph) and I, we took care of him.</span> <span id="s1846">She did only change the diapers or something like that, but otherwise, we were –</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">Q: You were taking care.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">A: It was our – our baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">Q: Was it in the daytime?</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">A: He was dying, and – and people were so – so helpful.</span> <span id="s1851">Whoever had somebody dying, you know, they would come and they would pray.</span> <span id="s1852">They would try to – to help my mom, you know.</span> <span id="s1853">And – and they even make – made a coffin for him, a little white, you know, and – but I – I couldn’t – I couldn’t accept [indecipherable] crying and praying God that he would live.</span> <span id="s1854">I think it – this – that was the most painful thing in my life because I couldn’t understand what – what is happening, I couldn’t understand why it’s happening, you know, it –</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">Q: And he was so innocent, he’s a baby.</span> <span id="s1856">He’s a baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1858">All the babies in the camp died.</span> <span id="s1859">Eight hundred people were there, and only one survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">Q: Only one baby?</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">A: But that pe – pe – person – that family was privileged for some reason.</span> <span id="s1862">I don’t want to talk about it, but – but there were people that were trying to give some others that maybe had some – something wrong, or – I –I – I really don’t know why – why that f-family was giving out some other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">Q: You mean they were informing on other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">A: Informing, yeah.</span> <span id="s1865">And they – and they – every day they could get a glass of milk for that baby.</span> <span id="s1866">My mother – of course we – we saw, because the – we have windows and we see, you know, people wa – people walking in front.</span> <span id="s1867">And so when uri -- Jereczek was so much – so sick, she would go to – to that pryncidacin(ph) and ask him.</span> <span id="s1868">He was the only one that had a cow.</span> <span id="s1869">He was – he was in charge of the camp.</span> <span id="s1870">And so my mom went, and I remember she came with the glass of milk, gave – and gave him that, you know, what’s glass of milk, you know, just – but, better than nothing.</span> <span id="s1871">And – and that was the last glass that he – that he had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">Q: So it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">A: The only glass.</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">Q: The only glass.</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">A: But there was no meat, no – no nothing.</span> <span id="s1876">Bread and water.</span> <span id="s1877">And our family didn’t – didn’t have money, and we just exchanged our clothes for – for food, for bread, for potatoes.</span> <span id="s1878">Potatoes they had the lot.</span> <span id="s1879">So – so we could get.</span> <span id="s1880">Once my mother said, I will go, because she felt sorry for us, but I don’t know how many time – times Irka(ph) went, but I went once with a couple lady friends, and they took me with, and I exchanged fo-for – for potatoes, so that was okay.</span> <span id="s1881">I – I took the sled with me, and put the bag on it, bu – and nothing happened.</span> <span id="s1882">But when my mom went, for some reason, they froze.</span> <span id="s1883">Maybe she was resting too much, and maybe laying down on – on ice, or something.</span> <span id="s1884">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">Q: You know something, we’ll break for a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">Q: I’m going to make a phone call, and then we’ll continue until lunchtime, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1889">[break]</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">Q: We’re – we’re talking again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">A: Oh, oh, we’re talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">Q: We’re talking again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">A: Uh-oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">Q: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1895">But we – we – before we cut and you know, cut the camera, we were talking about a very – very tragic event for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">A: For me that was very – I never forget that.</span> <span id="s1897">I still remember grave of Jereczek.</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">Q: Oh, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">A: Irka(ph) and I, we made a fence around.</span> <span id="s1900">Can you imagine, two little girls?</span> <span id="s1901">We dug f – to put the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">Q: Coffin in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">A: – posts –</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">A: – into.</span> <span id="s1906">We figured out how to put the – around the grave, and – and we – we made – put the grass on the – and planted some wildflowers, because we tried to plant – our babcia that sent from Wolkowysk those flowers, seeds that she send us.</span> <span id="s1907">And they didn’t want to grow.</span> <span id="s1908">But we did plant and – and found out that they don’t grow.</span> <span id="s1909">But to us –</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">Q: Where did – where was – where was his grave in the compound?</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">A: There – there was a – a cemetery, because those Russian people, when they were deported, they were dying out.</span> <span id="s1912">So there were some graves, but those graves, some of them had crosses, some of them already – because it was 20 years, and the only thing there was is a wooden cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">Q: Did your brother have a wooden cross?</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">Q: Were you able to put his name on it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">A: It’s the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">Q: Not really, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">A: I – I don’t think we put the name.</span> <span id="s1919">I don’t think we thought about it.</span> <span id="s1920">We just decorated.</span> <span id="s1921">The flowers, the – the little wianki, you know, to hang up on a – wianek is – how do you say wianek?</span> <span id="s1922">From the flowers, you make the circ –</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">Q: A wreath?</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">A: A reef.</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">Q: A wreath.</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">A: A reef, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">A: Little reefs on it, you know.</span> <span id="s1929">And – or – or put just bouquet o-of flowers on the grave.</span> <span id="s1930">We – we a – if not every day, then every second day we would go to his grave.</span> <span id="s1931">And the – it was – we kept that as a – as our part of responsibility.</span> <span id="s1932">And my mo – our mother, once in a while she would go, and she would praise us and say, you know, that’s – that’s the right thing to do, and – and we –</span></p> <p><span id="s1933">Q: How was she doing?</span> <span id="s1934">How was your mother doing after this – after all this happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">A: She – she did good, and that’s when she started getting those migraines.</span> <span id="s1936">And sh – and sometimes her migraine would last for two, three days.</span> <span id="s1937">And she would – one day she says, cut – cut my hair.</span> <span id="s1938">And she had already long hair.</span> <span id="s1939">And – and she just took scissors, and – and he says, oh just cut there.</span> <span id="s1940">And I didn’t know how to cut, you know, so I took – I think she had made into a one – one of those braids.</span> <span id="s1941">A braid, and – and she just took that braid, cut here.</span> <span id="s1942">And she didn’t care, because she –</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">Q: Because the weight of the hair was hurting her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">A: Yeah, that’s what she thought, that the weight of the hair is causing her – but, you know, it didn’t help.</span> <span id="s1945">And she would – tie a scarf on her head tight, do it tight, you know, and oh she – she suffered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">Q: She was suffering.</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">A: And with migraine, I know if I wouldn’t take the pill, those that are helping – one lady in Joole(ph) told me what to take, and – and it’s cheap, and – and I can get at Walmart.</span> <span id="s1948">But oth-otherwise, I don’t know what I would do, because doctors always try something that they think it helps.</span> <span id="s1949">Not everyone helps.</span> <span id="s1950">But now – now I – I always take that aceen – aceenominophen(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">Q: But you know, for a person who was in the situation that your mother was in, and that other people were in, not everybody who got deported was in the best of health, or their health got broken in different ways along the journey, or on the journey, or in the place.</span> <span id="s1952">And how do you take care of that, how do you recover, you know, when there is – when you’re in such a – you know, if someone gets sick, or if someone has cancer, or someone – you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">A: Well, th – over there, there was an – nobody knew about cancer, period, and – and – and those were not old ladies.</span> <span id="s1954">There were – there were some pu – people that were deported with the – grandmothers.</span> <span id="s1955">And – but those grandmothers were taken, and they said, we’re taking them to the place that when they – where they get better, and they apparently poisoned them, because no-nobody s-saw one of them.</span> <span id="s1956">So all those grandmothers were destroyed from this – this earth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">Q: From your – from the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">A: From the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">Q: From the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">A: From the camp.</span> <span id="s1961">But lucky mi – my mom was just 43, or some – between 43 and 45.</span> <span id="s1962">So she was a young person.</span> <span id="s1963">So they apparently thought that their podoszok(ph), which is a little – a little bit of powder, that’s the podoszok(ph).</span> <span id="s1964">And that’s what they gave each time she – she had to go to that pryncidacin(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">Q: Pretzidatto(ph).</span> <span id="s1966">What does pretzidatto(ph) translate as?</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">A: This is manager.</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">Q: Was this a person who was a military person?</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">A: I don’t know if he is military, but – but probably that’s – in a way, he is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">Q: A government official, though?</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">A: I think so, because he was in – in charge of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">Q: You said 800 people were in this Shilova, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">A: Tushilova(ph), yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1977">Tushilova(ph), or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">A: Tushilova(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">Q: Tushilova(ph), okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">Q: And – and that the adults were taken away that could work, to work in cutting down trees.</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">Q: Can you describe how that settlement looked?</span> <span id="s1984">Was it in – you mentioned that there were bogs, were there forests, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">A: Forests all around.</span> <span id="s1986">And only some places became bogs, and those bogs then destroyed that – the trees.</span> <span id="s1987">So those are the ones that I and Irka(ph) were – we were looking for –</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">Q: What about –</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">A: – to cut down, because they were lighter to begin with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">A: And – and ready to be put into fire.</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">Q: What – what did the – how many buildings were there to house these 800 people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">A: Ah, I don’t remember exactly, but probably eight.</span> <span id="s1994">And each building – the one that we were, were eight of those rooms –</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">A: – for some families – there were some families like eight people in one, so they got the ha – one room.</span> <span id="s1997">But since our was only five, and a baby, so apparently they didn’t count, or they didn’t think that he will live.</span> <span id="s1998">And us stayed with two families in one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">Q: So it would be like eight large buildings and maybe eight to 10 rooms per building, and about 10 people per room, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">A: Something like that, and – and some more, because – because they were a large family.</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">Q: And you said one family got special treatment because they informed on others.</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">A: Mm-hm, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">Q: So what kind of things could they inform on?</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">A: People would, after work would meet and talk, you know, what would be, what – for instance we – we were sitting at the table, and – and that was making – I don’t remember exactly, but that – whatever we were using, we would put finger on it, and that thing would be energized, and go from – and we would ask, and – and it would spell wha –</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">Q: Like a Ouija board.</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">A: Ouija board.</span> <span id="s2007">And – and you know, that kept us going, because we believed that that thing tells us the – the truth.</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2009">So they would report on these kinds of activities.</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">A: And – or, we would – on Sundays, we would get

id="s2015">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">A: Not in our camp.</span> <span id="s2017">I’m – I know there were –</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">A: – but not in our camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">Q: And you said that every baby that came to that camp died, except one.</span> <span id="s2021">Were there other people who were dying in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s2023">Oh, I have to tell you that one.</span> <span id="s2024">My brother worked in the summer.</span> <span id="s2025">Whatever tree, or – or those woods they were cutting, now, when the lake –</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">Q: Wasn’t frozen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">A: – wasn’t frozen, then they took that – that circle, because they were throwing into water – and – and into – inside of the circle, and were – with a special – I have it in my book.</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">Q: Was it a special instrument of some kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s2029">A: Special thing, primitive, but they made it, and then they could pull, they – on – on the shore.</span> <span id="s2030">They could turn that.</span> <span id="s2031">And that was moving the – the wood towards the opening in the lake where the river starts.</span> <span id="s2032">In – and then they, on a river, they wa – they go on a shore walk.</span> <span id="s2033">And – and they watch where there is like a turn, and at the turn, and the – the wood gets stuck.</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">Q: So they would try and guide the logs from the water –</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">A: To – right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">Q: – from the lake to the river.</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">A: – to the oma – to the Onega river, because this one’s smaller, Kosh(ph) river, and that I remember.</span> <span id="s2038">And – and to the ome – Onega –</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">Q: Omega?</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">A: Onega, Onega.</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">Q: Onega.</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">A: Onega river.</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">Q: Onega river, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">A: And then – and then they let it go, wherever – wherever some – something else takes over.</span> <span id="s2045">So my brother and in a group of those men, was – and there was another young boy.</span> <span id="s2046">I’m sure there was couple – couple of them.</span> <span id="s2047">That one was fourth grade high school, and my brother was only second grade.</span> <span id="s2048">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">Q: Second year of high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">A: Second year of high school.</span> <span id="s2051">So – so my – my brother was in a boat with the young men – young boys.</span> <span id="s2052">And – and my – and his friend was sitting on the same bench, but he’s on this side, and – and – and Urich(ph) on the other side.</span> <span id="s2053">So when – when they came to the [indecipherable] waterfall, then they – the Russian, whoever was in charge of that group, said that they have to go down on the waterfall.</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">Q: They have to go down the waterfall.</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">A: On the waterfall, with the boats.</span> <span id="s2056">So the old man, I guess more knowing how to – how – how to operate that, you know, water and the – and the boat.</span> <span id="s2057">So they went down, and they were okay.</span> <span id="s2058">But then comes that – this young boys’ boat, and it went straight into water and filled up with water, and they got up out of the water.</span> <span id="s2059">But in the middle of the Stasek(ph), my bro-brother was on the right side towards the shore.</span> <span id="s2060">And th – and the people that was on the shore threw the rope to him, pulled him out.</span> <span id="s2061">Urich(ph) jumped towards the middle, and the middle, there was –</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">Q: A current?</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">A: – rocks.</span> <span id="s2064">And he stood on that, and that was the s – the last thing that people heard from him.</span> <span id="s2065">And – and the father was watching.</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">Q: Oh my.</span> <span id="s2067">Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">A: And then the father was looking for him for whole week until they found his body.</span> <span id="s2069">And – and the mother was – oh, you could hear all over, her crying.</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">Q: All over the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">A: She was crying so – every day, every day.</span> <span id="s2072">That’s the worst thing, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2074">Yeah.</span> <span id="s2075">How long did you stay in this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">A: Until – I was looking, but I forgot already.</span> <span id="s2077">Oh, til – til January 17th of ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">Q: Of ’42?</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">Q: So that meant you were there almost two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">Q: And how – how did you find out – what happened that you could leave?</span> <span id="s2083">What happened that – that things changed?</span> <span id="s2084">A: I think – I think men always find something faster than – than we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">A: They – they were already allowed to go not – not to work.</span> <span id="s2087">So they came to the camp [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">Q: There were some men who came to the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">A: All those husbands and – and wives, even wives were there [indecipherable] also were there, working.</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">Q: You mean who were logging, who were cutting branches?</span> <span id="s2091">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">A: Who were logging, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">A: So they – they came to – to the camp, and they already knew that Polish army is being organized and where, all this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2095">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s2096">A: So they were informed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">A: I guess Russians were informing these Polish people that they can go, and they are free.</span> <span id="s2099">That we are free.</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">Q: And – and about when did the – did this news come by?</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">A: I – e – in November.</span> <span id="s2102">But it was August – August, I think, of – of ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">Q: Forty-one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">A: Forty-two.</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">Q: You said –</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">A: Or ’41?</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">Q: – you left in – in January ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">A: Forty-two, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">A: Oh, that’s right, so ’41.</span> <span id="s2111">And – and my – my brother came and – and they couldn’t work any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">A: So – or were not allowed, or something like that.</span> <span id="s2114">So – so my – my brother and – and there was a nice gentleman that he organized that group.</span> <span id="s2115">I think I – in book everything is right, not here.</span> <span id="s2116">So – so they – they did get as a group, and decided to – to leave.</span> <span id="s2117">I think it was 11th of November, and it’s a – I think – I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">Q: Your brother was part of this group?</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">Q: So he left you and – he left with the group.</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">A: And – and – and my mom gave him a lot of – not a lot, whatever he had – she had, money, whatever she saved.</span> <span id="s2122">And – and – and – and my brother says, no, no, no, I am not gonna take.</span> <span id="s2123">But then he’s already on the lake, and she says go and give him – you have to give him, I cannot keep this.</span> <span id="s2124">We will sell – sell some – some of the clothes.</span> <span id="s2125">So – so I ran after him, I catch him, and – and I say – say to him, Mamusha said you – you have to have it.</span> <span id="s2126">And he says no.</span> <span id="s2127">So he was as stubborn as my sister, and he didn’t take it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">Q: He didn’t take it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">A: So – so I – I brought on that, I – but I swa – I think it was like 70 or something.</span> <span id="s2130">So – so then – then we sta – started saving money for our trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s2131">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2132">A: Because in order for us to leave, we as a family of a soldier, we were allowed to leave the Siberia.</span> <span id="s2133">If we didn’t have nobody, we wouldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">Q: So does that mean because your brother was a soldier, or because your father had been a soldier?</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">A: And the father also.</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">Q: Did you know where your father was at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">A: I – we received one – I was looking here at that postcard from my father –</span></p> <p><span id="s2138">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">A: – in

wherever you are, try to go in the direction of – again, a place where – where the Polish army is organized.</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">A: So – so that – that was our destination, and th –</span></p> <p><span id="s2145">Q: And did your f – excuse me for interrupting – was your father also released?</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2147">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">A: But father was with awful, awful, awful condition.</span> <span id="s2149">And got four – I think four rubles for two years of – of gulag.</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s2151">Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">A: Big rewa – big reward.</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span

<p><span id="s2158">A: He joined.</span> <span id="s2159">In the book look for – for – I – I have two pictures.</span> <span id="s2160">One that he’s just joined, and then when he is already in better shape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">Q: Ba – okay, but he was able to leave the Soviet Union during these – these months –</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">A: With the Polish – with the Polish –</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">Q: With the Polish –</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">A: – army.</span></p> <p><span id="s2165">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">A: And they hi – they didn’t want him to be served in the army when he was younger, but this time they –</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">Q: They took him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">A: – they took him and – and – and were very happy, and he was very happy.</span> <span id="s2169">He was driving a truck or something there, you know, delivering, you know, ammuni – ammunition during the war, and he – he did – did his good – good job.</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">Q: Service, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">A: Yeah, good service.</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">Q: So – but di – you didn’t meet up, you didn’t see him

id="s2180">So you – you’d know – your father is in a gulag, he is released, he is in bad condition, but he gets his way south.</span> <span id="s2181">He joins the army, he leaves, and he ends up serving as a – as a truck driver delivering ammunition.</span> <span id="s2182">Meanwhile, your younger – your older brother goes, and it’s the three – three women who are left: your mother and yourself and your sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">Q: And you start planning to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span

station.</span></p> <p><span id="s2200">A: Railway station.</span> <span id="s2201">And – and she says, on the way we’ll be trying to sell.</span> <span id="s2202">So in those villages that we had to

id="s2215">So – so my mother gave her that hat.</span> <span id="s2216">And she gave my mom a loaf of bread, hundred rubles.</span> <span id="s2217">And yet she gave – she told my mom, come tomorrow morning, I’ll give you another loaf of bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s2218">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">A: So – so that was such a –</span></p> <p><span id="s2220">Q: A huge

Yes, th-they gave him bottle of whisky.</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">A: He says once he [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2298">Q: No pain, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2299">A: He did not need that, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s2300">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2301">Well, before the break, we were talking about – we were talking about how you and your mother needed money, and your si – the three of you: you, your sister, your mother, needed money in order to leave the camp, and how she was able to gather some money together by selling some things –</span></p> <p><span id="s2302">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">Q: – including the knit hat.</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">Q: And then we stopped at the point where you said your uncle and wa – in Moscow was also of great help –</span></p> <p><span id="s2306">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">Q: – at this time.</span> <span id="s2308">So explain to me in what way he was helping you and your mother and your sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s2310">Shortly before we left Siberia, my – my mom was wondering how can we get the money.</span> <span id="s2311">And – and I don’t know if she has written to – to my aunt in – my – no, babcia.</span></p> <p><span id="s2312">Q: Your aunt – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2313">A: Ma – my mom’s aunt in Wolkowysk, or – or not, but I know that that was the aunt of also uncle – I don’t know if I call – told you right name.</span> <span id="s2314">He was Joseph.</span></p> <p><span id="s2315">Q: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2316">A: But –</span></p> <p><span id="s2317">Q: I don’t remember, but you did mention –</span></p> <p><span id="s2318">A: The one in Moscow, his name was Joseph.</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">Q: – the one who – who had – the one who was inducted in the tsar’s army –</span></p> <p><span id="s2320">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2321">Q: – and could not leave the Soviet Union –</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">Q: – after the Bolshevik revolution.</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">A: Yes, that’s the one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">Q: So he was in Moscow, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">A: Yeah, so – so he apparent – she apparently, the aunt wrote to him and told him that we’re in need of money.</span> <span id="s2327">So my mom sent us to the post office.</span> <span id="s2328">We – we had to go, I don’t know, maybe eight kilometers to – to the main aw – post office, to pick up the letter.</span> <span id="s2329">And we got the letter and we come home and – and – and I look at this, and this is from Uncle Joseph from Moscow.</span> <span id="s2330">So – so – and of course when Mama opened this and – and si – found 300 rubles, that was all that we needed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2331">Q: Oh my.</span> <span id="s2332">So that helped, that helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">A: So that yes, that helped us.</span> <span id="s2334">Hundred – hundred thou – thou – rubles for each person –</span></p> <p><span id="s2335">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2336">A: – on the – on the train.</span> <span id="s2337">But not on – on the sled.</span></p> <p><span id="s2338">Q: So she still had to pay for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2339">A: For that she paid, a-and – and only she could ride, and we two, we were supposed to walk.</span> <span id="s2340">And we said Mama we – don’t worry, we will walk, we will walk, and – because she was worried that – and doesn’t have enough to pay.</span> <span id="s2341">Well, first – first distance was from our camp to Polwina(ph) which was part of – half to – to the next village, an-and that’s why the name Polwina(ph), halfway.</span> <span id="s2342">So – so Irka(ph) and I, we were walking.</span> <span id="s2343">And Irka(ph) –</span></p> <p><span id="s2344">Q: And you – and you were walking because there wasn’t enough money to pay for you to ride in the sleigh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2345">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2346">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2347">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2348">A: See, at that point my mom didn’t sell her hat, an-and the – and other s – other beautiful things that I remember seeing and admiring it, you know.</span> <span id="s2349">But at that point we – we had only that much how to pay.</span> <span id="s2350">And she, of course, she would never make it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2351">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2352">A: The – the way sh – when she was walking [indecipherable] sometimes, and not always.</span> <span id="s2353">When she felt little better.</span> <span id="s2354">So – so at that time, we walked, and when we got to the end, I think Irka(ph) was so – i-in such a pain – she is a very tough little child when she was little, and now too.</span> <span id="s2355">She – what she has, I – I think I would be dead long time ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s2356">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2357">A: Exercises, and all.</span> <span id="s2358">But – so – so then – and then, at – at – in that village when we arrived, my mother says, I have to somehow bribe the – the –</span></p> <p><span id="s2359">Q: Driver?</span></p> <p><span id="s2360">A: – driver, because Irka(ph) cannot go back to – to walk.</span> <span id="s2361">So – so she took my prettiest skirt that I liked so much, you know, with those pleats all around, and I never forgot.</span> <span id="s2362">Forgave her, but – but f – didn’t forget.</span> <span id="s2363">And at that time my – of course, I – I didn’t – she didn’t ask me, and I would always allow.</span> <span id="s2364">But Irka(ph) all the way, hardly ke – could walk.</span> <span id="s2365">And – but I walked all the way.</span> <span id="s2366">My – my le – feet would – would be –</span></p> <p><span id="s2367">Q: Took you the whole way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2368">A: – okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2369">Q: And so what kind of a distance are we talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">A: Hundred twenty kilometers to the station.</span></p> <p><span id="s2371">Q: So that’s a good – almost a hundred miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s2372">A: Kilometers</span></p> <p><span id="s2373">Q: I know, 120 kilometers –</span></p> <p><span id="s2374">A: Mm-hm, it’s a hundred miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s2375">Q: Hundred miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s2376">A: – yeah.</span> <span id="s2377">So – so –</span></p> <p><span id="s2378">Q: That’s huge.</span></p> <p><span id="s2379">A: – I did.</span> <span id="s2380">I did.</span> <span id="s2381">And I guess my legs are okay, because I don’t even have big veins.</span> <span id="s2382">Irka(ph) has u – they – her veins are like my finger.</span></p> <p><span id="s2383">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2384">A: You can see that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2385">Q: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s2386">A: So – so that was –</span></p> <p><span id="s2387">Q: And – and then you were able to buy tickets on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2389">Yes, because my mom sold that hat, and – and some – and that was shawl that she – and that I admired, I always looked at it and then, you know, girls –</span></p> <p><span id="s2390">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2391">A: – like some pretty things.</span> <span id="s2392">So – so it was – it was really good preparation.</span> <span id="s2393">And then – then as we – as we were driving by the open – this boxcar, then was open there, and – and one of the gentleman from the – from the camp was there.</span> <span id="s2394">And – and he says, come on into our – they still needed some more people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2395">Q: So you had – you had an open boxcar now?</span></p> <p><span id="s2396">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2397">Q: No – not a –</span></p> <p><span id="s2398">A: Yeah, now – now we are free.</span> <span id="s2399">So it – so it was a – a open thing, and waiting for us.</span> <span id="s2400">We could close the door when we wanted, we could do anything that we wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s2401">Q: So – but it was the same set-up as before, with the planks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2402">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2404">A: But only two.</span></p> <p><span id="s2405">Q: Only two.</span></p> <p><span id="s2406">A: Only two, so – so it was more – more room for us, and – an-and we went – we went in the top.</span> <span id="s2407">And on the top, that man, he was helping us a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2408">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">A: As we were going, I will tell you – will we finish until I get to Mexico?</span></p> <p><span id="s2410">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s2411">Oh, we can talk about it now if you want to, or was – he was helping you in Mexico?</span></p> <p><span id="s2412">A: Oh, no, no, this is not in Mexico.</span> <span id="s2413">This is when we were going south –</span></p> <p><span id="s2414">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2415">A: – already without my mom.</span></p> <p><span id="s2416">Q: Oh, he helps you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2417">A: We – we left – on the first station, Irka(ph) and I were looking for Mom.</span> <span id="s2418">We were running at the station on one side.</span></p> <p><span id="s2419">Q: Okay, no then – no, let’s get a little –</span></p> <p><span id="s2420">A: Back up?</span></p> <p><span id="s2421">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2422">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2423">Q: Because otherwise I – I might not understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s2424">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2425">Q: So you’re in this boxcar, and there’s a gentleman there from your camp, who sees you and says come on in, and he helps you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2426">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2427">Q: And you get the top platform, the top bunk where it’s a little bit more air.</span></p> <p><span id="s2428">A: Mm, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2429">Q: And you’re proceeding south.</span></p> <p><span id="s2430">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">Q: And then what happens?</span></p> <p><span id="s2432">A: And then at one – at one of the s-stations, one person catches a dog.</span></p> <p><span id="s2433">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2434">A: And – and they murder the dog, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s2435">Q: Food.</span></p> <p><span id="s2436">A: – cook – cook and smelling this – it’s the worst – worst meat if you want to cook the dog.</span> <span id="s2437">Well, anyway – and when the – one skin, when they too – pulled off the skin from him, they wanted to throw away.</span> <span id="s2438">And the woman that had two little girls, they look more like twins or anything, and – and – and she was kind of not too – too able to provide –</span></p> <p><span id="s2439">Q: Food.</span></p> <p><span id="s2440">A: – or save for them, because they were overpowering her or something, that she – she didn’t have nothing.</span> <span id="s2441">My mom would have at least a spoon of something, and then she would divide that spoon among us.</span> <span id="s2442">Usually not herself, she wouldn’t include.</span> <span id="s2443">So – so she – that woman takes that skin, burns the hair – you can imagine burning hair in a – in a –</span></p> <p><span id="s2444">Q: Cattle car, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2445">A: – traveling –</span></p> <p><span id="s2446">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2447">A: – train.</span> <span id="s2448">And – and then she cooked that.</span> <span id="s2449">And she cooked that skin for probably hours.</span> <span id="s2450">And there was a stink and – and whatever.</span> <span id="s2451">You know, it’s – it was just unbearable, but – but poor children were hungry and that’s all she could provide.</span> <span id="s2452">Possibly she was with my mom, you know, to go to buy that food, and the train left and she didn’t go because they were saying, and she listened.</span> <span id="s2453">And our mom said no, I cannot feed you, I – I have to go.</span> <span id="s2454">So – so –</span></p> <p><span id="s2455">Q: Oh, so you stopped at a train stop.</span> <span id="s2456">You stopped at a railway station.</span></p> <p><span id="s2457">A: Yes, following.</span></p> <p><span id="s2458">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2459">Following after this incident.</span></p> <p><span id="s2460">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2461">And then – and then we g – jumped out, opened the door because we were in charge of doors and everything.</span> <span id="s2462">So – so we opened the door and started running at the station and calling, Mamushu(ph), Mamushu(ph).</span> <span id="s2463">But Mamushi(ph) was not on one side, so – so we went for the other side.</span> <span id="s2464">And on the other side we did the same and – and – and then we see the train, the wheels are moving.</span> <span id="s2465">And I said to Irka(ph), let’s – let’s go on the other side.</span> <span id="s2466">And I’m telling you that I think God was protected us because the train was already moving and we managed to go on the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s2467">Q: You mean by the other side, you’ve managed to get into the car from the other side?</span></p> <p><span id="s2468">A: The – only from that side the door was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2469">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2470">A: So – so w-we – we climbed underneath and started running towards the front, because we went til –</span></p> <p><span id="s2471">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2472">A: – til now to the back.</span> <span id="s2473">So we were running, and – and here is the door opened, and – and Mr. whatever stands in the door and come on, give me hand, give me hand.</span> <span id="s2474">And – and he pulls us what – with arm, one arm and – and the – I guess he was pulling so fast that – that – and we were light, we were still hungry and – and – and – and skinny.</span> <span id="s2475">So – so he pulled us in.</span> <span id="s2476">And he f –</span></p> <p><span id="s2477">Q: And do you remember the train station, what the name of it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s2478">A: Maybe in the book.</span></p> <p><span id="s2479">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2480">A: Because I – I don’t remember, at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s2481">Q: Was this very far into the journey, close to the beginning –</span></p> <p><span id="s2482">A: Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2483">Q: – or close to the end?</span></p> <p><span id="s2484">A: That was whole day, as we started at – at noon –</span></p> <p><span id="s2485">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2486">A: – the train was speeding.</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">A: Speeding and speeding and speeding.</span> <span id="s2489">And just stopped at the pi – or stopped or didn’t stop, or just whistled woo-ooo and go and go and go, until we passed, I think Ural mountains.</span> <span id="s2490">So, from Vologda to – to the Ural mountains, and then – and then he stops.</span> <span id="s2491">Apparently he tried as fast and as farthest to get because Germans are – airplanes are flying.</span> <span id="s2492">And if they saw the – I think that during the day they could go.</span> <span id="s2493">At night, train – the airplanes would – would be bombar – bombarding the train.</span> <span id="s2494">So anyway – so we – we are at the – at the train, and – and – and another day, but – but was stopping more often.</span> <span id="s2495">So whatever station we would – we would come out and call Mamo, Mamo, Mama, you know, and – and – and nobody – nobody –</span></p> <p><span id="s2496">Q: So you had been on the train for one whole day when it stopped at a station, your mother left to buy food, and didn’t return before the train left.</span> <span id="s2497">In other words, it – it left without her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2498">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2499">Q: And so – and then, at each subsequent station, when the train would stop, you would go out and you would shout.</span></p> <p><span id="s2500">A: We would go out, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2501">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2502">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2503">A: And then – and then we – the whole – whole day and night, and – and – kept on going, we were going for a certain time that I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s2504">And finally we got to the southern state, but now it’s a different country, Kirghizia.</span></p> <p><span id="s2505">Q: Ah, Kyrgyzstan.</span></p> <p><span id="s2506">A: Kyrgyzstan.</span> <span id="s2507">And they’re separate now.</span> <span id="s2508">So – and there was, in Jalabad(ph), was Polish army already.</span> <span id="s2509">Whatever they are – they are – were, you know, part of them, you know, and – and they gave us good food, and – an-and we were, you know – but no Mama.</span></p> <p><span id="s2510">Q: So how long did – yeah, how long did the trip from Vologda to Jalabad(ph) last?</span></p> <p><span id="s2511">A: Probably about three – three weeks, or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2512">Q: And you lost your mother on the first day?</span></p> <p><span id="s2513">A: No, week.</span> <span id="s2514">We were traveling from the first station to Vologda for a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s2515">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2516">A: Over there we were traveling only during the day, and at night would be standing in a secluded area.</span></p> <p><span id="s2517">Q: The train.</span></p> <p><span id="s2518">A: The train.</span> <span id="s2519">So the – the –</span></p> <p><span id="s2520">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2521">A: – the airplanes wouldn’t see.</span> <span id="s2522">And then in Vologda, we were stand – staying for whole week.</span></p> <p><span id="s2523">Q: Oh, so two weeks from – so it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s2524">A: Two weeks, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2525">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2526">A: So – so there, every day, they would be telling us, we will leave today.</span> <span id="s2527">We will leave today and – and – and we started going, and whatever.</span> <span id="s2528">So for a whole week my mom was always living with that nervous, oh, I’m going for bread, or – or – or my daughter is going for – because which she would send Irka(ph) and me, and whatever – whichever felt little better.</span> <span id="s2529">So – so we – we were constantly separated, and – and she was nervous about losing us.</span> <span id="s2530">And then – then finally her system couldn’t hold it, and – and she says, we – we don’t have nothing to eat, so – so she is going.</span> <span id="s2531">And she didn’t even listen to us, what we – now, of course, which mother listens to a child?</span> <span id="s2532">So – so anyway, after – wait, what did I want to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s2533">Q: In Vologda –</span></p> <p><span id="s2534">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2535">Q: – you had to wait a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s2536">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2537">Q: But you were already on the boxcar.</span></p> <p><span id="s2538">A: Oh we – we were in the same boxcar that we paid in – in – in the first station.</span></p> <p><span id="s2539">Q: And the fir – what was the name of the first station?</span></p> <p><span id="s2540">A: Tha-That’s the problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s2541">Q: You don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2542">A: In my book.</span></p> <p><span id="s2543">Q: It’s okay.</span> <span id="s2544">Okay.</span> <span id="s2545">And it was – but then you traveled for a full day, and then at one station your mother goes out to get the bread, and the train starts to move.</span></p> <p><span id="s2546">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2547">And at – that day an – day, because each day they were saying that we will leave, we will leave, you know, at noon, or in the evening, and this.</span> <span id="s2548">And then, at that day, they se – they were saying the same thing.</span> <span id="s2549">And a – I don’t know, Irka(ph) or – or I was – I think Irka(ph) probably, was for the bread.</span> <span id="s2550">And she come back.</span> <span id="s2551">Maybe she ti – she’ll tell you –</span></p> <p><span id="s2552">Q: Okay, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2553">A: – straighten me out.</span> <span id="s2554">And – and whoever was there, came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2555">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2556">A: So – so then my mom decided she will go.</span> <span id="s2557">And – and she did go.</span> <span id="s2558">And we were crying, we were asking her and didn’t work.</span> <span id="s2559">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s2560">Q: And you never saw her again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2561">A: And – and it was like 12 o’clock – five – five minutes after t – after – after 12 o’clock, the train starts moving.</span> <span id="s2562">And then you can imagine both of us just couldn’t – couldn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s2563">Q: It wa – and it’s – it’s what one has heard before, that very often the trains would stop, and one of the family members would get out to get something, and then they’d be left behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s2564">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2565">But some of them catch up, and some don’t have luck.</span> <span id="s2566">They couldn’t find out – see, that was war, you know.</span> <span id="s2567">They probably left when there was something – they got probably clear from – from somebody.</span> <span id="s2568">So – so that was not a pr – on purpose for leave those, or leave that, you know, it was just happened.</span> <span id="s2569">And – wait, what else?</span> <span id="s2570">Oh, and we were – when we were going down, and probably the first longer stop for us was at the place that was Polish – Polish – oh my gosh, I knew all those names and ev – whatever.</span> <span id="s2571">Where – Polish government small office was there.</span> <span id="s2572">And so I went to report that we lost our mother, that Mother stayed in Vologda, and gave the names, mine – Irka’s(ph) and mine, and we never heard of that, you know, that anybody reported anything, you know.</span> <span id="s2573">So she didn’t get that far.</span></p> <p><span id="s2574">Q: Did she have the money, or did you have any money?</span></p> <p><span id="s2575">A: She had the money.</span> <span id="s2576">She had nice fur lined coat that was very warm.</span> <span id="s2577">And – and she had our I.D., because without I.D. you couldn’t get – buy the bread.</span> <span id="s2578">So – so my – my suspicion is that – oh, and another thing I have to tell you.</span> <span id="s2579">Years later, when we arrived in Mexico, in our or-orphanage were two little sisters of the boy that in Vologda jumped out of that train, and to bring his father and – and the rest of the group back to the – he – he thought that he will make it, and they will be able to get on the train.</span> <span id="s2580">But it didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s2581">He stayed with the father, father died.</span> <span id="s2582">And – and our mother was on a – he said on a breck(ph).</span> <span id="s2583">What is breck(ph)?</span> <span id="s2584">I tried Russia – Russian people, I tried Jewish people, I tried anybody I could imagine, if any knows what is breck(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s2585">Q: Yeah, what is a breck(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s2586">A: The only thing I can imagine, it was a platform, maybe with some si-sides, or maybe nothing.</span> <span id="s2587">And – and they were on that breck(ph) with whatever they had on, and with the wind, when train was going so fast, they would never survive if they were standing on.</span> <span id="s2588">So all people, like flies were freezing and falling off.</span> <span id="s2589">And – and somebody found my mother frozen, dead.</span> <span id="s2590">And – and she – and – and she had all these clothes on, all her documents.</span> <span id="s2591">She saw, on my mother’s document there is two little girls.</span> <span id="s2592">She would get three portions of bread at the store, not one, and – and she was probably only one, and she threw her clothes off, or just – just – no, she probably ki – kept a – a coat.</span> <span id="s2593">And – and – and she took my mother’s I.D.</span></p> <p><span id="s2594">Q: So – so you – you – you think this is what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s2595">A: Right, because exactly everything the same, except – except only thing, where is she from?</span> <span id="s2596">And she was from Saint Petersburg.</span> <span id="s2597">So at that time people were running away from the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2598">Q: Okay, so in other words, you find out later, in later years, that there’s a woman who –</span></p> <p><span id="s2599">A: In 1999, I think, because already my – my book was published.</span></p> <p><span id="s2600">Q: Okay, so in 1999, you find out that there was somebody from Saint Petersburg who had the same documents as your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s2601">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2602">Q: Did you know this person’s real name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2603">A: No, it didn’t show, just that – that she – she traveled from Saint Petersburg.</span> <span id="s2604">Everything was the same except instead of from Arhanga(ph) Skyoblish(ph), or from Brantowce, you know, that’s the only thing that was different.</span> <span id="s2605">And I wrote to – to American because it was through American that I was getting that inform-information.</span> <span id="s2606">And – and – and she – or – or – or Red Cross couldn’t get that information.</span></p> <p><span id="s2607">Q: So the only pieces of information you ever had about what happened to your mother is from two sources: one, a boy who happened to have jumped off the same train –</span></p> <p><span id="s2608">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2609">Q: – to get his own father –</span></p> <p><span id="s2610">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2611">Q: – to the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s2612">A: Yeah, and he survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s2613">Q: [indecipherable] the boy survived, the father did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s2614">A: And – and his sisters were in Mexico with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2615">Q: Okay, and you met him in Mexico, and he said your mother had been on the breck(ph), whatever that is.</span></p> <p><span id="s2616">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2617">Q: And then the second piece of information came in 1999, when from the Red Cross and from the Russian Red Cross, you got some information that there was a woman who had the same I.D. as your mother, but that she comes from Saint Petersburg, not fr –</span></p> <p><span id="s2618">A: Yeah, and in – in the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2619">Q: At the same time, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2620">A: So – so this is –</span></p> <p><span id="s2621">Q: And otherwise you have no idea what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s2622">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2623">Q: And what you think happened, even though you don’t have the information, is that this is – the person from Saint Petersburg found your mother frozen and took her documents, and maybe some of her clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2624">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2625">Q: So what happened to you on the train, you didn’t have any documents, it was just you and your sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s2626">A: That’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s2627">Q: And how did you eat, who fed you, and how long did it take from that point when you lost your mother, til you reached Jalabad(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s2628">A: Almost three weeks, I think.</span> <span id="s2629">I have –</span></p> <p><span id="s2630">Q: I mean from the point you lose your mother –</span></p> <p><span id="s2631">A: – I have dates in my books, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s2632">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2633">A: – so you c – you can get that, and my sister probably –</span></p> <p><span id="s2634">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2635">A: – has better – better recording.</span></p> <p><span id="s2636">Q: Okay, so – okay, the three weeks –</span></p> <p><span id="s2637">A: But –</span></p> <p><span id="s2638">Q: – is – is from the point you lose your mother, not from the point you left the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s2639">A: Three weeks.</span> <span id="s2640">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2641">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2642">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2643">Okay, what – what was the next question?</span></p> <p><span id="s2644">Q: The next question is how did you eat, who took care of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2645">A: Oh, a couple – couple men that were fluent in Russian and whatever, they wrote – they took piece of paper, they wrote similar format, our names, and we could – we could buy – or they could buy bread.</span> <span id="s2646">On the train we had – my mom left a little change purse.</span> <span id="s2647">And – and that – that’s – that has a long story, too, because all of a sudden we are looking for that change purse, and there is none.</span> <span id="s2648">But then, a couple days later, apparently parents noticed that the little girl too-took the change purse from us, and she told them, put it back where you find it.</span> <span id="s2649">Which is normally is said by p-parents.</span> <span id="s2650">And she did.</span> <span id="s2651">All of a sudden I pa – I look, and at the top of that container where it was, it’s – it still is.</span> <span id="s2652">So – so we had some – I-I think I have also how much I had, but so we used up that.</span> <span id="s2653">And then when we went to that Polish consulate, oh, I remembered, then they gave us 40 rubles.</span></p> <p><span id="s2654">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2655">A: So we had 40 rubles plus there was like in teens, I think, of the change.</span> <span id="s2656">So – so that lasted until we got to the Jalabad(ph), to that – that place, and – and then [indecipherable] about, after I think couple days, they fed us, an-and gave us good care.</span> <span id="s2657">And then they send us to collective farm.</span> <span id="s2658">And over there we were supposed to wait for something to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2659">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2660">A: Orphanage or – or something.</span> <span id="s2661">So after – after we got there, they just threw us out at the station, at the end – end of life – li – at the end of line.</span> <span id="s2662">So – so for two days we stayed there, and we didn’t know what happen – will happen.</span> <span id="s2663">Good thing we – we had a good send out, you know, with a little food, but not enough for two days.</span> <span id="s2664">So – so we – we were eating, and there was a big mound of – it’s from maku(ph), whatever the name that means.</span> <span id="s2665">It’s from the seeds of bawelna – aye-aye-aye, bawelna.</span> <span id="s2666">That was – [indecipherable] bawelna?</span></p> <p><span id="s2667">Q: Sunflower?</span> <span id="s2668">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2669">A: Y-You use for the – feeding the cows.</span></p> <p><span id="s2670">Q: Corn?</span></p> <p><span id="s2671">A: No, no, th-they use something else in Kirghizia.</span> <span id="s2672">Corn doesn’t grow there, it’s a sandy, sandy place.</span> <span id="s2673">Well, maybe it’ll – it will come back.</span> <span id="s2674">I’ll – I will continue.</span> <span id="s2675">Whatever that – that was, we were – we would – i-it wasn’t clean on top, so we would clean up and eat that, and it was very bitter.</span> <span id="s2676">But, you know, better than nothing in your stomach.</span> <span id="s2677">So – so somehow we survived that.</span> <span id="s2678">And then next day comes Kirghizian man, with the big whatever – didn’t look like a wagon or – or anything.</span> <span id="s2679">So we – we just walked behind him, told – tol – showed us, only we didn’t understand at – at all what he was saying.</span> <span id="s2680">And took us to his collective farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2681">Q: So I want to understand.</span> <span id="s2682">You go to a pol – Polish authorities in Jalabad(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s2683">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2684">Q: The Polish authorities say well, okay here, we feed you, we take care of you, but go to this collective farm until we know what to do with you.</span> <span id="s2685">Is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s2686">A: But they lost completely, because the army – because the ar – that was the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s2687">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2688">A: And – and I guess they were not the – concerned about us, they were concerned more of those soldiers, because those soldiers came naked almost, you know, to join the army, so – so they –</span></p> <p><span id="s2689">Q: When you said they lost completely, they – they completely forgot you, or they –</span></p> <p><span id="s2690">A: I think so, because nobody sh-showed up for us.</span> <span id="s2691">Nobody ever knew wha – which place we are, because even that Kirghizian man, when he came he just asked us if we can go with him, so we went, because we didn’t have –</span></p> <p><span id="s2692">Q: Okay, but was this the place that you were supposed to go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s2693">A: I don’t know, I don’t know if that was anything like that.</span> <span id="s2694">Whatever it was, we – we ended up in that collective farm.</span> <span id="s2695">And – and th – and they let us sleep in their office, because we came very – very late [indecipherable] by horse and – or – what – that wasn’t horse, what did we use there?</span> <span id="s2696">Some – some other animal.</span></p> <p><span id="s2697">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2698">A: Well, anyway – anyway so – so when we came it was almost midnight.</span></p> <p><span id="s2699">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2700">A: So we slept on floor in that, you know, cold and no – no heat, no nothing.</span> <span id="s2701">It was March when we ca – got – March, we started in –</span></p> <p><span id="s2702">Q: January.</span> <span id="s2703">January fifth, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s2704">A: – January 17th.</span> <span id="s2705">So that was more than three weeks.</span> <span id="s2706">Yeah, because I remember it was March.</span></p> <p><span id="s2707">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2708">A: Well, anyway, when we got – got there, they gave us a little – like a bagel thing, and that’s all, but that was enough for us, our stomachs were pos – almost empty anyway.</span> <span id="s2709">So, until next day – next day they came, and they took us to the – they called it lepianka.</span> <span id="s2710">It was made of clay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2711">Q: So a place to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s2712">A: Place to live.</span> <span id="s2713">It was just four walls, no floor, just sand.</span> <span id="s2714">A opening for the stove, just there.</span> <span id="s2715">And no place even to put the – the pot –</span></p> <p><span id="s2716">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2717">A: – if you had, you know atu – anything to cook.</span> <span id="s2718">But anyway, that was – and to sleep on the – on the floor they told us, go in the field, pick up some – oh, cotton, and that was cotton seeds, the other, that mountain –</span></p> <p><span id="s2719">Q: Oh, cotton seeds, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2720">A: – cotton seeds.</span> <span id="s2721">And very bitter, don’t try to eat that.</span> <span id="s2722">So – so we picked those cotton seeds, laid them on the – on that sand.</span> <span id="s2723">Then on it our – one of the – we had still comforters.</span> <span id="s2724">So one was to sleep, the other one was to cover.</span> <span id="s2725">So we – we were okay with that.</span> <span id="s2726">And of course, on the floor.</span> <span id="s2727">And then – and – and with us came another girl that was 14.</span> <span id="s2728">I didn’t know her before, but now – now we’re – we’re in the same house, and she has two little boys, much younger than she is.</span> <span id="s2729">So – so – so we were okay as –</span></p> <p><span id="s2730">Q: Five.</span></p> <p><span id="s2731">A: – we had fun and – and whatever.</span> <span id="s2732">So we were there for, I don’t know, a week or something, without working.</span> <span id="s2733">Then they tell us that we have to go to work.</span> <span id="s2734">And one day when – Irka(ph) [indecipherable] we cheated.</span> <span id="s2735">But we had got only one of those ro-round things that –</span></p> <p><span id="s2736">Q: Right, the rou – the portion.</span></p> <p><span id="s2737">A: – Irena’s portion.</span> <span id="s2738">But we – we brought home, we shared it, and that was for lunch, but we didn’t have nothing for – for dinner, so – so we – we brought home and we – we ate half and half of that.</span> <span id="s2739">So – so we were there until spring, until started getting warmer.</span> <span id="s2740">Next to that hut, there was a – a – a big – bi – a pretty big, like a mountain.</span> <span id="s2741">Miniature mountain.</span> <span id="s2742">And – and that mountain started moving, but not mountain moving, on-only on the mountain snakes.</span> <span id="s2743">There was so many, and they were – they were coming out, and then they would roll up, you know.</span> <span id="s2744">And we went to go somewhere, and here is one, here is one.</span> <span id="s2745">So – so we were jumping through them, and – and going to – to the field to work, or – or s – or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2746">Q: Did they bite?</span></p> <p><span id="s2747">A: No.</span> <span id="s2748">But – unless you step on them.</span> <span id="s2749">And you know, bu – jumping over them was dangerous, but we didn’t think about it.</span> <span id="s2750">And – and we started going to work, and sometimes playing, you know, and – and those little boys, the – they – they were mischievous, you know, so – so they – they started killing turtles.</span> <span id="s2751">There were turtles.</span> <span id="s2752">But we were s – not stupid, but not educated, let’s – let’s put it that – that you cannot eat turtle.</span> <span id="s2753">You can eat turtle.</span> <span id="s2754">Turtle tastes like chicken, if you prepare it, you know, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s2755">Q: And you cook it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2756">A: – and you cook it.</span> <span id="s2757">But they had eggs inside, in spring they had eggs, and they – they were giving birth to probably something.</span> <span id="s2758">And so those eggs, the boys were catching turtles, killing them with a rock, big rock, and – and taking those eggs out, those poor things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2759">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2760">A: And leaving that good meat there.</span> <span id="s2761">And – and – and their sister, she was older than I, so – and I knew hi – then she knew how to cook those eggs.</span> <span id="s2762">She put them on a frying pan and – and mixed, without – there’s no butter, no nothing, no – no bacon, no –</span></p> <p><span id="s2763">Q: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2764">A: Noth – so – but she made them somehow, and – and she wanted me to try, a-at least that much.</span> <span id="s2765">And – and I tried and I spit it out faster, I – I just couldn’t, as hungry as I was, but I couldn’t swallow that.</span> <span id="s2766">It – it smelled different than – than an egg.</span> <span id="s2767">So – so anyway, so – so that was the end with the eggs.</span> <span id="s2768">I was with my sister with – with weeds, we were more a soup of – of weeds.</span></p> <p><span id="s2769">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2770">A: That – that’s what our mom on Siberia was –</span></p> <p><span id="s2771">Q: Was making, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2772">A: – preparing, so – so that’s what we tried, too.</span> <span id="s2773">And we were –</span></p> <p><span id="s2774">Q: How long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2775">A: About four months.</span> <span id="s2776">Four months, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2777">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2778">A: And – and then, in the field, there was a Polish lady that we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s2779">You know, everyone talks between – she had two daughters.</span> <span id="s2780">So apparently they were doing the same thing, one day one, the one day the other one was going.</span> <span id="s2781">And they – and she – she saw us talking Polish.</span> <span id="s2782">So – so when I – she asked me, where is your – she asked, where is your mamusha(ph), and I started crying.</span> <span id="s2783">I just couldn’t keep my tears.</span> <span id="s2784">And she just – the word mamusha(ph) was for me more than I could take.</span> <span id="s2785">And at that point she said, don’t cry.</span> <span id="s2786">She – she hugged me and – and she says, I’ll – I’ll help you.</span> <span id="s2787">And she – she says, this Sunday I’m gonna go to Polish consulate.</span> <span id="s2788">She knew where.</span> <span id="s2789">And – and she report – she reported us.</span> <span id="s2790">They send us bread and couple cans of sardines, and – and it was shortly before Easter.</span> <span id="s2791">So bre-bread and sardines ta – what can you have?</span> <span id="s2792">That’s a royal meal.</span></p> <p><span id="s2793">Q: That’s a feast, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2794">A: So – so we – we had that for a couple days.</span> <span id="s2795">And – oh, and – and at the consulate they told her, bring one of them only, at least one.</span> <span id="s2796">Well, she chose me, although – and that one was older, but for some reason she chose me.</span> <span id="s2797">So – so I go.</span> <span id="s2798">The whole day we were going there and – and back.</span> <span id="s2799">Irka(ph) stayed home.</span> <span id="s2800">When I came home, Irka(ph) was sitting already half a mile away from – from home and waiting for me.</span> <span id="s2801">And – and of course then – then we – I gave her, probably that bread – what did I give you to carry?</span></p> <p><span id="s2802">A2: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s2803">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2804">A: So – so we went and – and the – in consulate they s – they said to us that we’ll send horse and buggy, and because Polish army had that, and – and they came and took our stuff, and – and took it to the –</span></p> <p><span id="s2805">Q: Did they take you too?</span></p> <p><span id="s2806">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2807">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2808">A: Then they – they take us all –</span></p> <p><span id="s2809">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2810">A: – to the orphanage.</span> <span id="s2811">There, by the consulate was orphanage.</span> <span id="s2812">So that’s where our orphanage life starts.</span></p> <p><span id="s2813">Q: So you’re living in this collective farm, it sounds like somebody just sent you there for no reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s2814">A: Right, but there was no orphanage.</span></p> <p><span id="s2815">Q: Oh, got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2816">A: There – there was – not at that time.</span> <span id="s2817">And later, in this – in this pla – but that was Lenin-Jol, that – see, I remember.</span> <span id="s2818">In Lenin-Jol was orphanage, in Jalabad(ph) there was none at that time.</span> <span id="s2819">But it was happening all –</span></p> <p><span id="s2820">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2821">A: – all the time, you know, somebody –</span></p> <p><span id="s2822">Q: Things were changing all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2823">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2824">Q: Okay, so now you go to an orphanage and it happens to be in Jalabad(ph), right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2825">A: No, no, this one in Lenin-Jol.</span></p> <p><span id="s2826">Q: In Lenin-Jol, all right, so there –</span></p> <p><span id="s2827">A: So that’s closer to – on this side of the mountains.</span></p> <p><span id="s2828">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2829">A: Because there is a big mountain ridge –</span></p> <p><span id="s2830">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2831">A: – in between.</span></p> <p><span id="s2832">Q: So you go to the orphanage in Lenin-Jol, and how long do you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2833">A: Not too long, maybe month, maybe month and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s2834">Q: And then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2835">A: And then we – we go back to Jalabad(ph).</span> <span id="s2836">In Jalabad(ph) was a train for us.</span> <span id="s2837">We got tickets already, and – and they load as many kids as they could, a-as they had on a train, and took us to – oh my gosh –</span></p> <p><span id="s2838">A2: Krasnovodsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s2839">A: Krasnovodsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s2840">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2841">A: In Krasnovodsk we waited in the open sun all day, no water, no nothing.</span> <span id="s2842">The kids were dying; some children were dying, some were – and the teachers, you know, are – and – a-and whoever were taking care of this group, many teachers, you know, they didn’t teach, only they took care of us.</span> <span id="s2843">Eventually they were teachers, they were –</span></p> <p><span id="s2844">Q: Yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2845">A: – teaching us, but – but not at this time.</span> <span id="s2846">So – so th – one teacher went to get some water with a bucket, and she was bringing the – to the orphanage.</span> <span id="s2847">By the time she br – came with this bucket to the orphanage, the bucket was empty.</span> <span id="s2848">People were from all over sometimes laying on the sand, you know, because they were hardly – and they had cup in hand, and they would –</span></p> <p><span id="s2849">Q: Take water.</span></p> <p><span id="s2850">A: – take water, and – and it wasn’t for them, she didn’t want to give, but what she could do –</span></p> <p><span id="s2851">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2852">A: – you know, people – people were dying from star – from –</span></p> <p><span id="s2853">Q: Thirst.</span></p> <p><span id="s2854">A: – thirst.</span> <span id="s2855">So – and once we got, you know, on – on a – well, and our – our trunk came with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2856">Q: The one that came all the way from – from Bransowice(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s2857">A: Brantowce, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2858">Q: Brantowce?</span></p> <p><span id="s2859">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2860">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s2861">A: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s2862">Q: Did it have anything in it le – any more?</span></p> <p><span id="s2863">A: Not too much, but very important things.</span> <span id="s2864">Skating – skates.</span> <span id="s2865">Books –</span></p> <p><span id="s2866">Q: Books.</span></p> <p><span id="s2867">A: – that my mom told – told me to take.</span></p> <p><span id="s2868">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2869">A: Wait, what else was there?</span> <span id="s2870">A suit for my mom –</span></p> <p><span id="s2871">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2872">A: – and one suit for my father.</span> <span id="s2873">We were – we were thinking about them, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s2874">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2875">A: – when we meet them, they can –</span></p> <p><span id="s2876">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2877">A: – right away get dressed and –</span></p> <p><span id="s2878">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2879">A: – and look elegant.</span> <span id="s2880">And – and what – there were some other – other things, but anyway, whatever I – I mentioned, and the book I – I wanted – that was for Jereczek(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s2881">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2882">A: But I – I wanted to keep that.</span> <span id="s2883">One of the teachers took it, and I – I didn’t even know which one.</span> <span id="s2884">Skates, the teacher told me no, you cannot.</span> <span id="s2885">You don’t need it any more.</span> <span id="s2886">We were going to Pahlevi and Teheran, you know, there was no ice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2887">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2888">A: So – so that – that somehow she convinced me.</span> <span id="s2889">Of course my mom’s and father’s, I cried, I want to have that, I want, because my mom and dad will not have any – anything to wear, to change into better clothes.</span> <span id="s2890">And – and what we had on, maybe we had one change of dresses or something there.</span> <span id="s2891">But they didn’t allow us to take that.</span> <span id="s2892">But then I asked for book, and she allowed me to keep the book.</span> <span id="s2893">She allowed me to – oh, couple pillowcases that we didn’t exchange yet.</span> <span id="s2894">So – so those – those I – I had three of them, because I gave one to my sister, and one to my brother.</span> <span id="s2895">So – so the pillowcases – and they were beautiful embroidered, with my mom’s initials.</span></p> <p><span id="s2896">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2897">A: So – so I still have that.</span> <span id="s2898">And – and there was something else, whatever – but – but anyway, I cried and cried, and she wouldn’t let me.</span> <span id="s2899">And – but who – who had – and you know that now in church – I – I belong to a choir, church choir, and we have one song that we sing, I never can finish.</span> <span id="s2900">Always end up crying, because it – it is, when I came to the seashore, about Jesus.</span> <span id="s2901">And ha – I shouldn’t talk about it, I always cry.</span> <span id="s2902">Never can finish the song.</span> <span id="s2903">Right away I see that in front of me, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2904">Q: The trunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s2905">A: The trunk.</span> <span id="s2906">The trunk is – was so important to me at that time.</span> <span id="s2907">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s2908">Q: It was the last piece from your life of your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s2909">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2910">I have those little things yet, you know, but – but those are not that important, apparently.</span> <span id="s2911">In my book I – I drew that trunk there, you will find it when you read it.</span> <span id="s2912">And I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2913">Si –</span></p> <p><span id="s2914">Q: It must have very hard to leave that trunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s2915">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2916">Although I took those spa – few things, you know, but – but it’s not important as – as that was.</span> <span id="s2917">That was my – my mom’s – how do you call, thing for the wedding –</span></p> <p><span id="s2918">Q: Trousseau?</span></p> <p><span id="s2919">A: – from her grandmother.</span> <span id="s2920">Trousseau.</span></p> <p><span id="s2921">Q: Her di – her trousseau.</span></p> <p><span id="s2922">A: Trousseau, filled up, you know, from – from her babcia.</span> <span id="s2923">So – so it was important.</span> <span id="s2924">And I don’t know if I ever – I ever change, as far as that, you know, for – my mom was – was – I cannot forget her, and – and that’s the reason why I wrote book.</span> <span id="s2925">That was because I wanted to – somebody to find.</span> <span id="s2926">I thought that some miracle will be, and – and somebody to find.</span> <span id="s2927">Well, I found a little girl.</span> <span id="s2928">I found – she came here to visit her son, from Poland.</span> <span id="s2929">And – and she remembered me.</span> <span id="s2930">She w – she wanted to – to come to see us.</span> <span id="s2931">And I thought maybe we’ll develop a friendship, but – but she says she has to go back to Poland, she’s just visiting her son.</span></p> <p><span id="s2932">Q: Now, you found a little girl who knew your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s2933">A: Well, she’s – she’s now the adult woman like me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2934">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2935">A: So – so – so she found, through the book.</span> <span id="s2936">Her son bought the book, and – and her – her son saw the last name, because he – he and his father have the same last name.</span> <span id="s2937">So – so now I – I met her, but that’s the last thing, and not what I was looking for.</span> <span id="s2938">But what can you do?</span> <span id="s2939">We are praying, we are doing, and God is leading us.</span> <span id="s2940">And why?</span> <span id="s2941">I – I often ask th – Irka(ph), you know, why do we live?</span> <span id="s2942">Two of us?</span> <span id="s2943">I guess this is the purpose.</span></p> <p><span id="s2944">Q: We don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2945">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2946">Q: We don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2947">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2948">Q: So you had to get on that transport to Pahlevi –</span></p> <p><span id="s2949">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2950">Q: – without the trunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s2951">A: Without the trunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s2952">Q: What was the transport –</span></p> <p><span id="s2953">A: And I was the last one from the orphanage to get on in the – on the – that –</span></p> <p><span id="s2954">Q: On the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s2955">A: On the boat.</span> <span id="s2956">And the – and I remember everything, you know, the – the walk was boards, some of them missing.</span> <span id="s2957">So the teacher says, watch it, so your leg doesn’t fall in.</span> <span id="s2958">But – and – and it was only standing room, and those children that were sick, they would be sent – sitting on the – on the floor in the tra – in the ship.</span> <span id="s2959">And those ships, they – they were not the real ship, not transport.</span> <span id="s2960">Those were transporting the – probably coal or something, and they cleaned up and – and are taking – were taking children and people, you know.</span> <span id="s2961">They – they transported, I think 12,000.</span> <span id="s2962">It could be 12,000 or plus some – some small amount.</span> <span id="s2963">I have, from the tu – in the book –</span></p> <p><span id="s2964">Q: Twelve thousand people, or 12,000 children, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s2965">A: People.</span></p> <p><span id="s2966">Q: Twelve thousand people and then –</span></p> <p><span id="s2967">A: And s – and soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2968">Q: Okay, in this – on this boat, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s2969">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2970">Q: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2971">A: No, no, there was maybe five, six transportations through the Caspian Sea to Pahlevi.</span></p> <p><span id="s2972">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2973">A: In – in Pahlevi and Karachi we ended up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2974">Q: So, and – okay, so you end up in Pahlevi, and how long do you stay there?</span> <span id="s2975">That’s part of Iran.</span></p> <p><span id="s2976">A: In Pahlevi they asked to – or they took us to the shower.</span> <span id="s2977">We all had to take shower.</span> <span id="s2978">They cut the hair – or previously they cut the – the hair, so we were all bald.</span> <span id="s2979">And then – and then they changed us to a different section of the – of the camp, on sand, not – under the sun.</span> <span id="s2980">I don’t think there was any – any – how do you call – there was any of what?</span> <span id="s2981">I forgot here.</span> <span id="s2982">Oh, tents.</span> <span id="s2983">There was no tent – excuse me – just the – the food when they – and I ha – we di – we slept on a blanket, on the sand, and it was soft and warm.</span> <span id="s2984">And – til morning, and then got up and ran straight to the sea to take a bath.</span> <span id="s2985">Oh, I – I enjoyed, to me that was a – a fun.</span> <span id="s2986">Finally I could swim.</span> <span id="s2987">Oh, I didn’t tell you at – at the kibietka(ph), when we were in – in the ca – in the kohaus(ph), one day, I don’t know what I was wearing, did I have bathing suit with me or what, but I jumped into [indecipherable], which is water – waters coming from the mount – mountains, melting snow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2988">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2989">A: And – and it was fast running water.</span> <span id="s2990">I jumped in on our side, ended up about half a mile farther –</span></p> <p><span id="s2991">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2992">A: – on the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s2993">Q: Because the current was so strong?</span> <span id="s2994">Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s2995">A: And I – and I – I knew s – how to swim, but not properly.</span> <span id="s2996">I wasn’t a good – good swimmer, I was just a swimmer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2997">Q: But you made it out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2998">A: I made it on the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s2999">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3000">A: The only thing, on the other side was Kirghizian village, and this one we had only one – one kibietka(ph) and that’s it.</span> <span id="s3001">So – so on the other side kids were, I think, with open mouths, how could I do that?</span> <span id="s3002">I don’t think they – they knew how to swim.</span></p> <p><span id="s3003">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3004">A: Because I don’t think any mother would allow kids to – to go into water like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3005">Q: No, it’s too dangerous.</span> <span id="s3006">It’s too dangerous.</span> <span id="s3007">Okay, so – so in some ways your odyssey out from the Soviet Union is over by this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s3008">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3009">Q: Did your life change?</span> <span id="s3010">Did it – did it get – did i – anything become brighter, or was it all overshadowed because you had lost your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s3011">A: Probably one and then two.</span></p> <p><span id="s3012">Q: Both of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s3013">A: Both of them, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3014">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3015">A: Yeah, I – I never quit.</span> <span id="s3016">And then in Teheran, we were waiting for other transport [indecipherable] yet, you know, and they – and they were bringing every day the couple buses of the deportees or – or whatevers.</span> <span id="s3017">And – and we would run with Irka(ph) to the – to that – and that was a airport place that I can – I think it was used by American soldiers.</span> <span id="s3018">And – an-and we would run there and wait and watch each person coming.</span> <span id="s3019">And at the end, we would hug each other, no Mama.</span> <span id="s3020">No Mama.</span> <span id="s3021">That was th-the probably saddest place where – where we [indecipherable], because from here we already knew that she didn’t came out from Russia.</span> <span id="s3022">Because all through her th – Teheran were coming people from Russia, were – have t – had to stop there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3023">Q: It was the first place.</span></p> <p><span id="s3024">A: First place.</span> <span id="s3025">There was a hospital that was available, there was a place where like Irka(ph) had to go to – to that place.</span> <span id="s3026">She’ll probably tell you that.</span> <span id="s3027">And they wanted to – to take Irka(ph) only to that place.</span> <span id="s3028">And we – we got two – two of us, no, you will not take her away.</span></p> <p><span id="s3029">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3030">A: Irka(ph), you will not – she will not stay.</span> <span id="s3031">I am not going.</span></p> <p><span id="s3032">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3033">A: So – so we – we tried to – we didn’t trust anybody any more.</span> <span id="s3034">Because there were some instances that they would not – oh wait, again, I’m – I’m getting blockages.</span></p> <p><span id="s3035">Q: That – that people wouldn’t let you be together, is that it?</span> <span id="s3036">They – they would split you apart?</span></p> <p><span id="s3037">A: Well, they wanted to take her for the place where they will feed her –</span></p> <p><span id="s3038">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3039">A: – give her better food –</span></p> <p><span id="s3040">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3041">A: – and I didn’t need that.</span> <span id="s3042">I – I was – could be eating only –</span></p> <p><span id="s3043">Q: You were healthier.</span></p> <p><span id="s3044">A: I-I was healthier, ta – right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3045">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s3046">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s3047">A: And – and she – and started from Siberia, she was always undernourished, so she had problem always, and she still has.</span> <span id="s3048">But G-God is good to us.</span> <span id="s3049">So – and her –</span></p> <p><span id="s3050">Q: Did you hear from your brother?</span> <span id="s3051">Did you know what was go –</span></p> <p><span id="s3052">A: Nothing –</span></p> <p><span id="s3053">Q: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s3054">A: – nothing, we didn’t know yet, until we – after couple months we were transferred to Maleer(ph).</span> <span id="s3055">Maleer(ph) was a little away from – from the sea, camp for the Polish army, which never was u – not Polish, for American army.</span> <span id="s3056">In India they had stationed American soldiers.</span> <span id="s3057">So – so they gave tha – this for the orphanage, a thousand kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s3058">Q: And this was in India?</span></p> <p><span id="s3059">A: That was in India.</span></p> <p><span id="s3060">Q: So you moved from –</span></p> <p><span id="s3061">A: From –</span></p> <p><span id="s3062">Q: – Iran to India?</span></p> <p><span id="s3063">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3064">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3065">A: And then ha – oh, I di – I – oh, I skipped a little bit.</span> <span id="s3066">I skipped because from Teheran, we went to Isfahan.</span> <span id="s3067">And Isfahan was – was a – was a city of wealthy per – pers – persovia – per –</span></p> <p><span id="s3068">Q: Persians.</span></p> <p><span id="s3069">A: Persians.</span> <span id="s3070">And they donated their homes, summer homes to the Polish –</span></p> <p><span id="s3071">Q: Orphans.</span></p> <p><span id="s3072">A: – orphans.</span> <span id="s3073">So there was five – over 5,000 orphans there.</span> <span id="s3074">And – and so they transferred us to – to that camp number six.</span> <span id="s3075">And number six was the largest, there was 300 children.</span> <span id="s3076">And that was some kind of convent, I think.</span> <span id="s3077">And there was a – a church by that, and there was bishop presiding there, so – so that was a big, big place.</span> <span id="s3078">And we had already organized school [coughs] Excuse me.</span> <span id="s3079">And I was in fifth grade, because in Poland I was – I finished fourth and started fifth, but never – never finished, because of whatever there.</span> <span id="s3080">So – so we got separated with Irka(ph).</span> <span id="s3081">Irka(ph) was in one building, I was in the other building, but we were close, so we were gradually getting used to it.</span> <span id="s3082">And – and Irka(ph) by then was little better.</span> <span id="s3083">But her teeth were not better, but that’s her subject.</span> <span id="s3084">But I had to drag her to the dentist.</span> <span id="s3085">Oh, she was – no, she won’t – doesn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s3086">She has very sensitive teeth, and I wish I would share with her.</span> <span id="s3087">I – I go to dentist, at 86, I still have my teeth, and my – and – and she – she has problem.</span> <span id="s3088">So –

germs, and it’s not tasting good, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s3095">Q: It does the trick.</span></p> <p><span id="s3096">A: Yeah, and in – in Isfahan, we had very good teacher, fifth grade teacher.</span> <span id="s3097">And she gave us a project to do, to fi – to write your story of the Siberian deportation.</span></p> <p><span id="s3098">Q: That’s a very good project.</span></p> <p><span id="s3099">A: Whatever – whatever you lived, from your home til now, it’s – and I wrote mine, I don’t know how many pages.</span></p> <p><span id="s3100">A2: Four.</span></p> <p><span id="s3101">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s3102">Q: Four pages.</span></p> <p><span id="s3103">A: Oh no, more than that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3104">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span

id="s3109">[indecipherable] And – and that is the beginning of my si – my writing the story.</span> <span id="s3110">She – I kind of build it in-into me, one thing to – to write something.</span> <span id="s3111">But I – but maybe another teacher in Mexico.</span></p> <p><span id="s3112">Q: Also?</span></p> <p><span id="s3113">A: That was another s – time that I was instructed to – to write another – oh, you right maybe – maybe you right, because I have written another one, and that one is about 15 pages, in Mexico –</span></p> <p><span id="s3114">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3115">A: – when I was in, I think first year or second year in high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s3116">Q: Okay, and so this first one could have been shorter.</span></p> <p><span id="s3117">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3118">Q: Do you still have both of these writings?</span></p> <p><span id="s3119">A: I am sure I do, because I don’t throw out nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s3120">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3121">A: I ha – I’m Hector collector.</span> <span id="s3122">In – would you believe in Poland I started.</span></p> <p><span id="s3123">Q: Oh yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s3124">A: You know what?</span> <span id="s3125">A little pieces of glass, colored glass.</span> <span id="s3126">That attracted me, so that was my collection in Poland.</span> <span id="s3127">Q: Before you left.</span></p> <p><span id="s3128">A: Before I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s3129">Q: Before you left.</span> <span id="s3130">Before you were deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s3131">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3132">Q: Okay, I’d like to kind of wrap this up, I know that there are a lot of sections that we can’t pay as much attention to, but I’d like also to be able to talk to –</span></p> <p><span id="s3133">A: Irka(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s3134">Q: – your sister today.</span> <span id="s3135">So after – after India, after you were in India, at some point you were sent to Mexico, is this correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s3136">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3137">Q: And this was all with the orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s3138">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3139">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s3140">How – were you in India – okay, let me put it this way, phrase the question this way: when did they send you to Mexico, what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s3141">A: That was at the end of ’43, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s3142">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3143">A: In November.</span> <span id="s3144">On November first, I think we arrived in León, Guanajuarto, and – and that’s – that’s where –</span></p> <p><span id="s3145">Q: And why in Mexico?</span> <span id="s3146">Was there another orphanage there or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s3147">A: No.</span> <span id="s3148">General Sikorski visited Mexi-Mexico.</span> <span id="s3149">I think that was with the suggestion from maybe – maybe President Roosevelt, because I’m sure he came and asking for the staying in United States, for the ca – bringing some – some Polish people to – to U.S.A., and – and I know Roosevelt wanted to be friends with Stalin, and who – who of Poles would want to be friends with Stalin any more?</span></p> <p><span id="s3150">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3151">A: So – and – and of course that wouldn’t go with the – along with the politics.</span> <span id="s3152">So – so possibly that’s where it came from, and so General Sikorski went to – to the mexi – to Mexico to ja – to the president of Mexico, and – and he agreed.</span> <span id="s3153">He – he says, I can find for 50,000 Polish refugees.</span> <span id="s3154">So that was –</span></p> <p><span id="s3155">Q: That’s huge.</span></p> <p><span id="s3156">A: – the – the beginning, but it didn’t happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s3157">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3158">A: First group arrived in Mexico on July second, or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3159">Q: July second which year?</span></p> <p><span id="s3160">A: Forty-three.</span></p> <p><span id="s3161">Q: Forty-three.</span></p> <p><span id="s3162">A: And the – and the second one arrived on November – I think first.</span> <span id="s3163">So – so whatever – what – whatever was promised, didn’t happen, because United States didn’t want to – I don’t know didn’t want, didn’t have ships, or whatever, the war was, you know, in – in –</span></p> <p><span id="s3164">Q: Going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s3165">A: – going on and – and possibly – so – so all the Polish people went to the English colonists in Africa.</span></p> <p><span id="s3166">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s3167">But you made it to Mexico.</span> <span id="s3168">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3169">Q: Were you on the first, or on the second –</span></p> <p><span id="s3170">A: Second.</span></p> <p><span id="s3171">Q: In November.</span></p> <p><span id="s3172">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3173">Q: And you went by boat, by ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s3174">A: By ship, and that was a huge, huge – the ship weighed I – I also za – forgot – R – R something.</span> <span id="s3175">No.</span> <span id="s3176">Well anyway, whatever the name is, it’s in the book.</span> <span id="s3177">I’m sending –</span></p> <p><span id="s3178">Q: Everything to the book.</span></p> <p><span id="s3179">A: – everything to the book.</span></p> <p><span id="s3180">Q: And the book, we have to say – we have to mention the name was – tell me the title of your book.</span></p> <p><span id="s3181">A: “The Fulfillment of Visionary –</span></p> <p><span id="s3182">Q: – return.</span></p> <p><span id="s3183">A: – Dream.”</span></p> <p><span id="s3184">Q: “The Fulfillment of Visionary Dream.”</span></p> <p><span id="s3185">A: That’s why I wanted to give you another one –</span></p> <p><span id="s3186">Q: Ah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3187">A: – but I guess so – so – so return, you have return –</span></p> <p><span id="s3188">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3189">A: – because those were the first editions.</span></p> <p><span id="s3190">Q: I see, and it is the visionary dream.</span> <span id="s3191">“The Fulfillment of Visionary Dream.”</span></p> <p><span id="s3192">A: And this one was a little – the truth is always the same, and whatever else I did, corrected some – some – but I had very good editor.</span></p> <p><span id="s3193">Q: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s3194">So now when we’re talking, you’re in Mexico in November, and are you taken to another red – orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s3195">A: No, it was the same.</span> <span id="s3196">Mexico gave us a hacienda, which is like big property of somebody that is not around, or gave that, I do – I really don’t know the story of that.</span> <span id="s3197">And [indecipherable] Santa Rosa, and that was enough for school, a huge school building, high school was in a little different – but i-in – within the roun – around the same area.</span> <span id="s3198">So – so we – we had very good teachers.</span> <span id="s3199">We have even – I don’t know if you are familiar of a Jesus of Mercy.</span> <span id="s3200">The priests that brought Jesus of Mercy, a story, or – or whatever, to United States, across the ocean, was my teacher.</span> <span id="s3201">I have that many letters from him.</span></p> <p><span id="s3202">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s3203">A: From – and – and he was a priest.</span></p> <p><span id="s3204">Q: Was this a particular order?</span></p> <p><span id="s3205">A: Yes, Marian.</span></p> <p><span id="s3206">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3207">A: Marian father –</span></p> <p><span id="s3208">Q: Marian order, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3209">A: Marian fathers.</span></p> <p><span id="s3210">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3211">A: And – and he came here to United States, and brought all the papers of Sister Faustina.</span> <span id="s3212">So – so all – all this – that story was – and when I was writing book, I went – I had at that time, I bought a – a little house in Florida, and I went to f – to that house, and that’s where I have written the book.</span></p> <p><span id="s3213">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3214">A: And every day, whenever I started writing, I would pray to him, because he – he was al-already was dead, and all the story I knew about him, you know, so – and seems like always something happened if I didn’t pray, and I couldn’t s – could not continue to write.</span> <span id="s3215">And then I thought, why can’t I get back in the – and all of a sudden, oh, I didn’t pray.</span> <span id="s3216">I pray and then for the rest of the day I will write without stopping.</span></p> <p><span id="s3217">Q: You were fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s3218">A: So – and then I had three occurrences that was, I don’t know how to call, the vision or something, or it was tired vision, or what.</span> <span id="s3219">Maybe – maybe somebody who is more educated would know something about it.</span> <span id="s3220">But at night I would wake up, something wakes me up.</span> <span id="s3221">And one time the whole ceiling, I don’t see the ceiling, I don’t see the pictures.</span> <span id="s3222">Like I am in some kind of thing, and – and all of a sudden disappears after – after a while.</span> <span id="s3223">And that happened three times, and I thought, is my Mama trying to –</span></p> <p><span id="s3224">Q: Reach you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3225">A: – appear to mia – to – to me?</span> <span id="s3226">Yeah.</span> <span id="s3227">Those are – those are the things for somebody with more education, more faith maybe to – to – to receive.</span> <span id="s3228">But I don’t have even one picture, because my uncle, the one in Wolkowysk, he had to destroy his pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s3229">Q: The one who was left –</span></p> <p><span id="s3230">A: The one that –</span></p> <p><span id="s3231">Q: – your mother’s younger brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s3232">A: Right.</span> <span id="s3233">He – he says he probably buried them maybe in his backyard or something, and – and water came and you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s3234">Q: Destroyed, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3235">A: – he had to destroy them anyway.</span> <span id="s3236">So – so whatever.</span> <span id="s3237">But he – he – when I was there, he brought me his album.</span> <span id="s3238">I remember the same album that I was looking when we were visiting them.</span> <span id="s3239">And – and I – I saw so many missing – missing spots.</span> <span id="s3240">And he left those, the same way as they were before the war, except missing pictures of my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s3241">Q: Oh, how sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s3242">A: Because he was trying to – to sh – to – to con –</span></p> <p><span id="s3243">Q: Conceal.</span></p> <p><span id="s3244">A: – conceal the – his – his relationship to – because my father was involved in so many – so many things, that he was – he was one on the list, that we will deport him.</span> <span id="s3245">And so he says he was packed.</span> <span id="s3246">He – his things were in bundles –</span></p> <p><span id="s3247">Q: Ready to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s3248">A: – because whenever they were coming, somebody would inform him, and – and he would be trying, you know, be ready.</span> <span id="s3249">But somehow he – they couldn’t find pictures.</span> <span id="s3250">Probably they were looking for pictures.</span> <span id="s3251">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s3252">Q: Such unbelievable detail.</span> <span id="s3253">Unbelievable.</span> <span id="s3254">So you were in Mexico in the orphanage for how long, for how many years?</span></p> <p><span id="s3255">A: From November ’43, to May ’46.</span></p> <p><span id="s3256">Q: Three years.</span> <span id="s3257">And you finished your high school there?</span></p> <p><span id="s3258">A: Almost.</span></p> <p><span id="s3259">Q: Almost.</span></p> <p><span id="s3260">A: Almost.</span> <span id="s3261">And then – then when we came to United States, I – I was taking courses here and there, took – in high school I took something that would help me.</span> <span id="s3262">Math, it is my – it was my – always my top –</span></p> <p><span id="s3263">Q: How did you get to – how did you get to the United States?</span> <span id="s3264">What was

father, and apparently my father told – told her that I don’t want my father to get married.</span> <span id="s3279">How can you get married, we will find Mama.</span></p> <p><span id="s3280">Q: Yeah,
