id="s11">01:01:03</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Question: Hello Maria, welcome to Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Answer: Thank you, Joan.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: Could you tell me the name that you were born with and when and where you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s16">I was born December 26, 1918, which in Poland is Christmas, so I’m a Christmas child.</span> <span id="s17">And I was born in the city of Kolomyja, which at the time I was born was Poland, it was newly created Poland.</span> <span id="s18">Before then, it was Hapsberg, Austria.</span> <span id="s19">Therefore, my parents spoke German and I was brought up in the German language.</span> <span id="s20">My parents eventually learned some Polish but they didn’t like the language, so at home the language was German.</span> <span id="s21">When I came to school I naturally had to learn Polish so at the age of five-and-a-half I entered a Polish school in Kolo-mier (ph) and I said something in Polish which didn’t sound right because it was not my initial language.</span> <span id="s22">So the children, including the teacher, started laughing, making fun of me.</span> <span id="s23">Naturally, it was quite traumatic.</span> <span id="s24">I ran home crying, crying I’ll never go to school again.</span> <span id="s25">Well, I did go back.</span> <span id="s26">And I’ve been a student for many, many years later.</span> <span id="s27">Interesting enough, when I thought about this experience many years ago, I think it played an important role in my later life choice of Polish as the aid of concentrations university, strange as it may sound.</span> <span id="s28">But there are some dynamics that turned it upright anyway so this was my experience.</span> <span id="s29">Actually, I was writing still, I still am, and German and Polish are pretty much my languages even though, although they have both deteriorated.</span> <span id="s30">Well, the way I remember Kolomyja, it was a small town, although it wasn’t small to the eyes of a child.</span> <span id="s31">And later when I visited the smaller towns, the villages around, it seemed that Kolomyja was big.</span> <span id="s32">It’s an interesting thing about Kolomyja that, as I write about it just years later, many years later, that Ta-pan-gee (ph) was an important city during the earlier centuries.</span> <span id="s33">It’s very old.</span> <span id="s34">They just celebrated seven hundred and fifty years of the birth of the town and they say it goes back even further.</span> <span id="s35">It was ransacked, it was demolished, it was burned all the way, many times, first by the Tartars, then by the Mongols, or vise-versa, then by the Cossacks.</span> <span id="s36">There were endless destruction’s and occupations of Kolomyja.</span> <span id="s37">I do not know how far my father’s family goes back.</span> <span id="s38">The name was Hiersch (ph) and I was born as Matylda Hirsch.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">01:04:02 My parents wanted to Polonaise my name because that was important for them, I assume, as many parents do, but at home I was called Mattie because my parents spoke German.</span> <span id="s40">My father spoke Yiddish with many of his helpers in the store and business with some of the people in the community, but my mother was very snobbish about it.</span> <span id="s41">She came from another city called Chad-no-vich (ph).</span> <span id="s42">Czernowitz was a bigger city, it was a very snobbish city, it was, they called themselves small Paris, little Paris.</span> <span id="s43">Her parents lived there.</span> <span id="s44">Actually, I knew only her father because her mother died just before I was born and I was named after her mother.</span> <span id="s45">So she had that air of Czernowitz about her and she despised Kolomyja and she despised Ukrainian town and she despised the Polish people and she didn’t want to hear any of the Yiddish language.</span> <span id="s46">So, sadly enough, I was brought up in the German language and German was the language, but certainly I spoke Polish later and, with my girlfriends it was always Polish.</span> <span id="s47">There was a city itself, I saw it only forty years ago for the first time I went back.</span> <span id="s48">It’s a handsome city now and as I read some of it’s history, it had a rich history, over the centuries it was a town in which a lot of trade was going on.</span> <span id="s49">It was on the tracks between Poland and Austria and Romania, so apparently business and trade was very important.</span> <span id="s50">My own father came from a whole generation of people who owned the same store, the same business.</span> <span id="s51">This was porcelain and enamel and glass.</span> <span id="s52">So we always had the very beautiful table settings because of their availability.</span> <span id="s53">I remember that when my older sister got married, and her husband didn’t have a profession, so my father took him into the business.</span> <span id="s54">But smartly gave him a special division of it, so he became the importer of chandeliers.</span> <span id="s55">It all sounds very, very strange but this was back in our time.</span> <span id="s56">My father was Orthodox, my mother came also from a religious family, but not as Orthodox.</span> <span id="s57">So there was a little bit cheating, I suppose, but she wore a wig because it was important in our home town.</span> <span id="s58">My father was a follower of Rabbi, he was a Hasidic, a follower of a Rabbi called Wishnitz, he came from the city of Vinnitsa.</span> <span id="s59">Apparently he was important in the Rabbinical dynasty and as a child I remember the Wishnitz (ph) Rabbi coming and staying in our home and I didn’t like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">01:06:59</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: I was crushed by the, by the tone of all these people.</span> <span id="s63">He would come, I was very young then, he would come Thursday night for Sukkotbat.</span> <span id="s64">So on Thursday night, from the railway station, he would come escorted by about 200 hus-a-dem (ph), some from his own entourage’ and some from our home town, and because it was dark, it was evening, they would come with, the German name comes back, “Falken”, these lightings, strobes carried in the street, torches, right?</span> <span id="s65">Now it comes back.</span> <span id="s66">I sometimes think in German from my childhood years.</span> <span id="s67">So they were full of torches and to the dark night of my home town, which was very Anti-Semitic, although I wasn’t exposed to it, I sensed it, and the women would stand on the balcony and greet them, saw them coming in.</span> <span id="s68">Since I was so young, to me this was an overwhelming picture and I said I didn’t like it.</span> <span id="s69">They all came into our house, which was big and he would give him the biggest room.</span> <span id="s70">In front of his room was a Gabbai, a Gabbai was the assistant of the man who collected the quitels, and quitels is something that a Jew would write out on a paper asking the Rabbi for advice.</span> <span id="s71">So together with the paper I assume that the Rabbi got the money too.</span> <span id="s72">I suspect it so.</span> <span id="s73">But anyway, the Gabbai stood in front of our living room where the Rabbi held court and he would see people.</span> <span id="s74">Hundreds of people would walk through our home.</span> <span id="s75">And to me this was overwhelming, very unhappy kind of experience.</span> <span id="s76">I was the youngest and I think on me it worked more than on my sisters because I was already born into Poland, it made a difference.</span> <span id="s77">Since I’m the youngest, my experience of learning school and otherwise was different than that of my older sisters.</span> <span id="s78">It shows you the meaning of history.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: What’s the difference in age between you and your sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Five years each, five years each.</span> <span id="s81">My older sister was Cyla, C-Y-L-A if you want it, and there was a difference of twenty years between us all.</span> <span id="s82">I’m not sure, but something like it.</span> <span id="s83">She married Jacob Goldstein, a man from Lvov who didn’t have money and didn’t have much of a profession, but he was the son of a Talmudist and to my father, that was important.</span> <span id="s84">So, there was a tremendous wedding, all my sisters had tremendous weddings except me, and their only son, Menek, survived the war.</span> <span id="s85">I don’t know whether I should go into, she was killed in the last days of the ghetto and her husband was transported to the Belzec Extermination Camp in 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">01:10:01 Anyway, that was my sister, Cyla, and she lived a pretty middle-class, it was pretty prosperous.</span> <span id="s87">Her hobby was to do petite work, petite point, and I remember her beautiful pictures on the walls, all her own work.</span> <span id="s88">This was her hobby.</span> <span id="s89">She was well known in town, she had girlfriends and when their son was born, it was a great thing because he was the only boy in the family, until then we had nothing but girls.</span> <span id="s90">Now the next sister was Frieda, her name, my sister Cyla, was Cyla Goldstein, that was her name and her son is Menek Goldstein, and he survived.</span> <span id="s91">My next sister was Frieda.</span> <span id="s92">She was very beautiful.</span> <span id="s93">Frieda married a man who was a cousin, a second cousin.</span> <span id="s94">He came from Cal-es-sa-bot (ph), from a resort town, very well known spot in Europe.</span> <span id="s95">His father was a brother of my father, but that was of a different mother so they were step-brothers.</span> <span id="s96">And therefore, it was permitted for them to marry, even so, they worried that they’re offspring may suffer from it and be mentally retarded, whatever.</span> <span id="s97">She ain’t, she’s a doctor of eye diseases.</span> <span id="s98">She turned out to be okay.</span> <span id="s99">But this wedding, I remember vaguely.</span> <span id="s100">I only remember my dress, I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s101">It was the most beautiful dress I’ve ever had.</span> <span id="s102">And their wedding was held in Stanislawow, a city a little bit bigger than Kolomyja.</span> <span id="s103">This is somehow, I still remember.</span> <span id="s104">No, she lived in Karlsbad (ph) which means she lived in a privileged place because Karlsbad (ph) was a beautiful international spot and he was making a good living, he had many patients so it was sort of high life.</span> <span id="s105">Anyway, in 1938 Hitler occupied . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Wait, you’ve missed a sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Oh, you want to go this way, sure.</span> <span id="s108">Then the younger sister, also five years younger, is Frania.</span> <span id="s109">Frania survived.</span> <span id="s110">By the way, my sister Frieda survived and in Czechoslovakia they got out of Dorosig into Palestine.</span> <span id="s111">She’s still alive, she’s unfortunately in a nursing home now and her husband died a few years ago.</span> <span id="s112">Then, there’s my sister, Frania.</span> <span id="s113">She’s alive, she lives in my neighborhood, her husband was killed, and they’re child, Laszek, Alex, was about three years old in the ghetto and miraculously he survived and he lives in New York City.</span> <span id="s114">Though she later re-married and her second husband adopted him so his name is Alex Gitterman.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">01:13:04 And then comes me.</span> <span id="s116">I was the youngest.</span> <span id="s117">No, my sisters still had a background of Hapsberg, Austria, although Frania was very young then.</span> <span id="s118">In 1916 I believe, my parents ran from Kolomyja because of the war.</span> <span id="s119">And they came to, they ran to a place which is near Sigit, Marmorosk I think, which is where Wiesel comes from, which was a border of Romania and Hungary.</span> <span id="s120">There were large Jewish communities there.</span> <span id="s121">My father went into hiding there because the Austrian army was busy trying to find men to fight their war, they needed my father naturally, so they lived a very, very difficult kind of life.</span> <span id="s122">I think they lived in Mon-room-a-vot (ph).</span> <span id="s123">And at that time I still had another sister, whom I never met, she died right there.</span> <span id="s124">She was between Cyla and Frieda and I think she was fourteen years old when she developed a serious appendix condition and there was no time to get to the hospital, she died right in my father’s arms, I understand.</span> <span id="s125">Some things that I heard about years later, my parents didn’t talk about it, but it was always in the air and I suspected that something happened there, but I say, I was born after, I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s126">Only about ten years ago, walking in the beautiful woods of Switzerland, my mother’s younger brother told me about it.</span> <span id="s127">They talked about her in some ways, her name was Yetta, but it was hushed-hushed and it was never quite there.</span> <span id="s128">I’m sure that my childhood was spent in a family which suffered from depression, yet it was not, it was covered over.</span> <span id="s129">Probably because my father was a Hasidic and in the Hasidic tradition, joy and pain are mixed.</span> <span id="s130">So, I think so, in looking back at it that my childhood was very complex because it was a Hasidic family and my mother was, had that air of a bigger city with more civilization and the country in which I lived was Polish Anti-Semitic, so I would think I have the strength of all of that in some way in my own personality.</span> <span id="s131">But, I remember there were times of when my mother would cry and this was the anniversary, not only of the deaths of my sister and her daughter, but the death of her mother.</span> <span id="s132">They all lived in that hiding place near Sigit there and my grandmother, her mother, died of a heart attack, apparently still a young woman, so for my mother it must have been a horrible loss.</span> <span id="s133">She would go to visit her father later, she once took me to Czernowitz and this I remember.</span> <span id="s134">These things are very vague in my memory because they were not talked about, but it was there in the air and from time to time I would overhear something.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">01:16:01 There’s a good possibility I tried to protect myself from the pain too.</span> <span id="s136">So I grew up in this family in which I was extremely important because only years back later, I could understand the importance of me.</span> <span id="s137">Because I had to replace all these losses, I’m sure.</span> <span id="s138">So, I was an extremely overprotected child to the extent that I hated it, I was embarrassed by it.</span> <span id="s139">When I sneezed, there was immediately a doctor around me.</span> <span id="s140">When I went to school, and I forgot my breakfast, somebody from the store would knock at the door of my class and bring me the breakfast.</span> <span id="s141">My mother was extremely anxious about me and my parents over-protected me in a way which probably helped them some way but also did not.</span> <span id="s142">So my sister Frania, I think, was a little bit jealous, I never knew about it because no matter what I did was fine.</span> <span id="s143">Which means I wasn’t prepared for the hardships of life that later came my way.</span> <span id="s144">I was a child who could never do wrong.</span> <span id="s145">And they thought I was bright and I did extremely well in school.</span> <span id="s146">To the end of my sister because she didn’t do so well, she was pretty and she liked to go with boys and she wasn’t so interested in studies.</span> <span id="s147">I was, all of my, the grades were always above ‘A’, you know?</span> <span id="s148">Once I brought a ‘B’, I cried for weeks!</span> <span id="s149">I got a ‘B’ in mathematics which was unbelievable because it was always ‘A’s in other subjects and my preferred subject was Polish literature, romantic Polish literature.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Did this create a problem between you and your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: No.</span> <span id="s152">I was a child who was smart.</span> <span id="s153">I don’t think I was pretty, my sisters were pretty, my two sisters, Frania and Frieda were very pretty, but I never experienced a sense that I wasn’t okay.</span> <span id="s154">Looks didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s155">I was accepted.</span> <span id="s156">I say I was, scholastically, I did so extremely well.</span> <span id="s157">My sister, Frania, still remembers with pain that when my mother would go to the teachers for the periodic visitations, they would say, how come your daughter, Frania, cannot do that well?</span> <span id="s158">I’m sure it didn’t do her any good, but that’s what she remembers.</span> <span id="s159">But she was very pretty.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Tell me a little bit about your violin playing?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Oh, how do you know this?</span> <span id="s162">As, I must have been six years old, eight years old, I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s163">My parents hired a violin teacher for Frania and myself.</span> <span id="s164">And we didn’t like it.</span> <span id="s165">But anyway, I mastered in playing the Hatikva so every Saturday night, many guests, our house was full of guests always.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">01:19:07 I think I still carry this tradition to some extent.</span> <span id="s167">We had to play, the ha-tic-fa (ph) had to play, a few other things.</span> <span id="s168">It was not something that I really liked very much.</span> <span id="s169">Probably I couldn’t identify with the teacher.</span> <span id="s170">We also had a teacher of Hebrew.</span> <span id="s171">Darlis Bate (ph).</span> <span id="s172">And him we hated!</span> <span id="s173">He was a poor, old Jew who didn’t know to teach.</span> <span id="s174">My sister and I use to bribe him, give him a zloty and he would go, he would leave earlier.</span> <span id="s175">Unfortunately, we didn’t learn much so until these days, I cannot read any of the Hebrew text and I’m sorry about it, I wish I could.</span> <span id="s176">But this was my mother, my mother looked away because it wasn’t as important to her and as girls, we were not suppose to learn much of the Hebrew text.</span> <span id="s177">We never was suppose to go to synagogue until you're married so I never went to synagogue because when I married, the war was on and I’ve never gone to a synagogue.</span> <span id="s178">I remember, right after the war, there was some gathering of the American soldiers and I was included and it was in a synagogue in Heidelberg, I’m not even sure, but occasionally I go now to religious service but a synagogue is not part of my life and this is because of my background.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Were your friends primarily, if not all together, Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: All were Jewish.</span> <span id="s181">Well, in primary school, what you call, elementary school, there were non-Jewish students too.</span> <span id="s182">I do not recall contact with them.</span> <span id="s183">I had two close friends, both were neighbors on both sides of our house.</span> <span id="s184">We use to visit with each other.</span> <span id="s185">My main preoccupation was with reading.</span> <span id="s186">When my girlfriends would come and to ask where I was, my mother or whoever was around would say, you’ll find her in a book!</span></p> <p><span id="s187">01:21:00 This was my childhood, I was an avid reader.</span> <span id="s188">But I liked to play with them and both of them were killed, but we use to go away a lot.</span> <span id="s189">I think this too established my pattern of traveling later in life.</span> <span id="s190">For ten weeks, every year, my parents would remove me from school a little earlier.</span> <span id="s191">It had to start the 15th of June and I wouldn’t come back until sometime in September.</span> <span id="s192">Every year we would go to the mountains.</span> <span id="s193">My mother believed that we didn’t look well enough, that we needed all the fresh air.</span> <span id="s194">She believed in these things.</span> <span id="s195">So we went to the Carpatian Mountains because my home town is surrounded by the Carpatian Mountains, Kolomyja is the entry to the Carpatian Mountains.</span> <span id="s196">We would go to different places, the names may mean nothing, but from time to time they crop up.</span> <span id="s197">Losuv, Garemcze, Delatyn, these were the places.</span> <span id="s198">The way we would go, it was so funny, my father would stay behind and he would come one week.</span> <span id="s199">But we would go for the ten weeks and we took everything along because these were pretty primitive villas.</span> <span id="s200">My mother insisted on a villa which was inside and which was always surrounded by trees; apple trees, pear trees and plumb trees.</span> <span id="s201">Poland has a lot of very delicious fruit so there had to be trees, that was the requirements of hiring a villa.</span> <span id="s202">And it had to be close to the street but not too close, close to the street so we could look and see some traffic but not too close so nobody would come close to us.</span> <span id="s203">And it had to be on a little river.</span> <span id="s204">On a little stream.</span> <span id="s205">And we would go swimming there, not swimming really, sitting under the stones.</span> <span id="s206">My sister, Cyla, made it into her real hobby.</span> <span id="s207">She would go every morning, sit under these stones in which you had a, what do you call it, little water fall and she would sit there for hours hoping she would loose weight this way.</span> <span id="s208">She was overweight and she wanted to loose weight, this was her idea.</span> <span id="s209">One day, she decided she really wants to do it more professionally so there was a man from Warsaw, a Polish man, who ran a special spa for the loosing weight.</span> <span id="s210">He was Anti-Semitic to the core.</span> <span id="s211">His name was Dr. Tarnovsky, but Jewish middle-class women like all the others went there to loose weight.</span> <span id="s212">Well, she didn’t like that too much so one day they had an afternoon off and she went to the village and she moved into Konditorai, a cafe.</span> <span id="s213">Konitorai I knew was a very special institution.</span> <span id="s214">It’s coffee and hot chocolate and there was beautiful pastries.</span> <span id="s215">So, she eats here pastry and drinks the chocolate and here walks in Dr. Tarnovsky and he sees that thing, he walks over to her and he slaps her, right across her face.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">01:24:02 Well, this was an awakening for her.</span> <span id="s217">She never went back to that spa anymore.</span> <span id="s218">But this was the situation.</span> <span id="s219">Part of it was, anti-Semitism in Poland just had its full way, in different ways, but I personally did not experience it in elementary school, perhaps not in elementary school but in High School.</span> <span id="s220">Until I come to that, I remember these different locations of our traveling to for this summer, and it was a whole trip.</span> <span id="s221">In front of us was always a carriage with horses which would carry our beddings, our dishes, our household kosher which meant you needed double dishes, and some furnishings.</span> <span id="s222">This was in front and in the back was Fiakev, a drosh-ka (ph), with my mother, my father if it was for the week-end and all children.</span> <span id="s223">There was a maid, a woman to clean and it had to be a Jewish maid to cook because we were Kosher.</span> <span id="s224">So coming to these places, my mother believed in good air, fresh air and food.</span> <span id="s225">So she wanted us to drink milk from the cow.</span> <span id="s226">And she would bribe us.</span> <span id="s227">So food was always something which they had to beg us to eat.</span> <span id="s228">I would get either a zloty or a big piece of chocolate to drink that milk and I always managed to avoid drinking that milk.</span> <span id="s229">It was a game going on, I still hate milk for this reason.</span> <span id="s230">I was so ostioperosis probably because I didn’t drink enough milk.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: This time away from, did this make all of you much closer than you would have been?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: We were a very close family, always a very close family.</span> <span id="s233">Close in the family was a prescription I’m sure of my family, probably because it’s a Jewish tradition but probably because they had suffered losses.</span> <span id="s234">So, to my parents, the business was important to my father and he was a very good businessman, family was all that mattered, always.</span> <span id="s235">And to us it still does.</span> <span id="s236">Now we have fragments of the family but family is still very important to us, to all of us.</span> <span id="s237">So I was brought up with this, I was suffocated by it, I really didn’t like that much closeness.</span> <span id="s238">And with my colleagues who had more space, and I always wanted more space.</span> <span id="s239">My whole traveling in my life was always getting more space.</span> <span id="s240">These were the consequences of that emotional overcrowding, extremely so.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Were there political discussions that you remember as you grew up?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">01:27:06</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: By the way, yes.</span> <span id="s244">I wasn’t involved politically until sometime later in my gymnasium years.</span> <span id="s245">Yes, the Kolomyja, like most towns in Poland, had a lot of political divisions among the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s246">There was the Main Zionist, and there were Left Zionist, the Communist, the Socialist, the Liberals, the Divisionists, you name it.</span> <span id="s247">Amazing, a small city like Kolomyja which only had 40,000 people, half of them were Jewish, they had about a few Jewish newspapers.</span> <span id="s248">It was a highly literate city.</span> <span id="s249">I wasn’t among them because my parents protection some how or other excluded me.</span> <span id="s250">My parents protection and my need for the Polish patriotism somehow excluded me much from it, as strange as it is.</span> <span id="s251">But I had liberal ideas.</span> <span id="s252">My parents, my father worried about it, that I was going very liberal at one point.</span> <span id="s253">But I didn’t join a particular group.</span> <span id="s254">However, there were many, many groups.</span> <span id="s255">Most of the Jewish people in Kolomyja as in most of Poland were poor.</span> <span id="s256">There were people who were really poor and then there was the middle class, upper middle class, and a very few who were really extremely rich.</span> <span id="s257">There must have been, but in my home town the middle class and upper middle class were the rich people.</span> <span id="s258">I remember, I still have a great pain when I think about the poverty in my home town.</span> <span id="s259">My first memory is of the water carriers.</span> <span id="s260">We lived in a house in which the apartment was on top of the business and there were wide staircases.</span> <span id="s261">And the water carriers, all whom were Jewish, they were carrying up the water, big cans, because there was no other way of getting water.</span> <span id="s262">The water came from a main fountain in the city, on Mokra Street.</span> <span id="s263">Mokra Street is well known because there are survivors like Dov Noi, who’s well know, he comes from MokraStreet.</span> <span id="s264">Many people lived on MokraStreet.</span> <span id="s265">It was the poorest neighborhood and there was a big fountain and the water carriers possibly were on the lowest rank of the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s266">And they carried that water upstairs.</span> <span id="s267">I remember once, on a very cold day, and Kolomyja being in the Ukraine, a cold, cold climate.</span> <span id="s268">I asked my mother, how come this man has ice on his hands?</span> <span id="s269">Doesn’t he like to wear gloves?</span> <span id="s270">This was my awakening, that some people didn’t have money for gloves.</span> <span id="s271">The poverty was everywhere and when I think of that poverty, I think of them like of the closest family because there was no right for them to suffer such an end as these people did.</span> <span id="s272">They really never had any life.</span> <span id="s273">There was a lot of stigma about being poor and there was a lot of sukkotme.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">01:29:52 In my High School, which was a Jewish Gymnasium, it was one of the sets of gymnasiums, it was a chain of, called Zyowskie Towarzystowo szkoty Ludoweii Sreduig, it was a chain of Jewish Gymnasiums established in Poland, which was run by the Jewish parents, who established it.</span> <span id="s275">They paid for it, it was extremely expensive.</span> <span id="s276">Somehow or other, because there was no gymnasium for Jewish girls after elementary school, ten parents got together and established it.</span> <span id="s277">My parents and nine others.</span> <span id="s278">And they took in one parent who didn’t have money.</span> <span id="s279">Their name was Neiman and she was Sophia Neiman.</span> <span id="s280">I still remember the pain and the stigma and the sense of sukkotme.</span> <span id="s281">She wore clothes which came from America, which means she had a coat which was red.</span> <span id="s282">Only American children wore red coat, we never wore red coat.</span> <span id="s283">In High School you wore navy.</span> <span id="s284">And this was such a stigmatic thing.</span> <span id="s285">And another thing I remember is that outside was a school building, was an old Jew who was selling some food, potatonik, and you could buy it with butter or with margarine.</span> <span id="s286">Margarine was half price of butter, and she would buy the margarine potato.</span> <span id="s287">All these things stay with me because it was so unjust.</span> <span id="s288">Well, of the ten students, we were ten students and ten teachers.</span> <span id="s289">All teachers were Jewish.</span> <span id="s290">They came from Warsaw, from the big cities.</span> <span id="s291">We had to be more pious than the Pope in achieving our accreditation because the commission would come down from Warsaw and we had to be good.</span> <span id="s292">So we had ten teachers to ten students.</span> <span id="s293">And of the ten students, miraculously, unbelievably, all survived!</span> <span id="s294">All the teachers were killed.</span> <span id="s295">I wanted to bring you pictures, some how I couldn’t get it down from my wall, it was heavy.</span> <span id="s296">But I be jumping a little bit.</span> <span id="s297">This was the gymnasium years and it was all Jewish students, all Jewish teachers.</span> <span id="s298">It was considered a high level gymnasium.</span> <span id="s299">It is described in the book about Poland by Dr. Sylvia Helliard, you may know about it, called “An Air of Destruction”.</span> <span id="s300">She has quite a bit about these schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Were you all close, all the students, including the one who was somewhat stigmatized or what about that one?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: Well, she was not stigmatized by us, we just felt the stigma.</span> <span id="s303">I felt the stigma.</span> <span id="s304">For reason, I don’t know why, I still don’t know why I identified with the underdog.</span> <span id="s305">Some way or other I assume it eventually led me to social work, but I didn’t know the origins of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: But you, of course, were living in very privileged ways?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: I lived by comparison, I’m sure here in America it now would not be because of it, but by comparison with the others, and I had a lot of pain about it.</span> <span id="s308">Probably was a part of my rebelling against my parents, whatever it was that came into it, that I became very liberal.</span> <span id="s309">The pain about witnessing so much poverty still stays with me whenever I think about what happened.</span> <span id="s310">But anyway.</span> <span id="s311">.</span> <span id="s312">So, this was the gymnasium years, we had to study a lot.</span> <span id="s313">We had to study Latin, eight years of Latin, that’s a lot of Latin.</span> <span id="s314">We had to study, the only thing we didn’t like is religion.</span> <span id="s315">Of course because the teacher wasn’t great.</span> <span id="s316">I had marvelous teachers of Polish literature, one of them became my role model.</span> <span id="s317">I think she played an important part in my choice of this profession later.</span> <span id="s318">We had a teacher of German literature, we had mathematics, which was not my subject somehow or other.</span> <span id="s319">But I couldn’t afford to have a ‘B’ ever so my parents hired a tutor.</span> <span id="s320">I fell in love with the tutor, my first adolescent crush, and a learned it and I passed exams very well.</span> <span id="s321">Then we had a lot of gym.</span> <span id="s322">I wasn’t great in gym, just passing.</span> <span id="s323">What else did we have?</span> <span id="s324">Certainly geography and history, history was always my great interest and remained so.</span> <span id="s325">Geography and history.</span> <span id="s326">In the University, I had to decide, study was history.</span> <span id="s327">I believe that you don’t understand people without history.</span> <span id="s328">In those days, I didn’t understand it but now I teach my students that you do not understand people without knowing history of their people.</span> <span id="s329">Well, we’ll come to it later, but anyway, I consider it as part of the web of the personality, historic events.</span> <span id="s330">Those days I did not understand it this way, just liked history.</span> <span id="s331">Every single strut in the roadway, you know, I had to memorize.</span> <span id="s332">We had to, we had to decide a in High School and I was very good at it because I memorized Mickiewicz, Schen-kavitch (ph), Krasinski, these were the very famous, and later came the positivists and I was really, this was my life!</span> <span id="s333">It still is, reading, I’m still an addict in reading.</span> <span id="s334">I don’t remember now because my mind doesn’t work well but in those days I absorbed it all.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: What attracted you to the positivists?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: It was lit, oh sure, it was after the romantics who needed a pause!</span> <span id="s337">Orzeszkowa, Aun-jus-kov-a (ph).</span> <span id="s338">The other day, they had a few months ago, they had a film festival of Polish movies and there was a marvelous, marvelous movie of Orzeszkowa, I forgot what it was, it was fantastically well done, but the positivists.</span> <span id="s339">And then when I came to the, this was all in High School.</span> <span id="s340">It’s amazing, I didn’t have any conflict with Poles at that point.</span> <span id="s341">I studied so many years in high school, we were totally isolated.</span> <span id="s342">We didn’t experience it.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">01:36:14 I didn’t know, my father had some customers who were Polish, but I didn’t have any contact.</span> <span id="s344">So, anti-Semitism was nothing that was experienced personally except that it wasn’t it, but you knew it was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Did your parents talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: No.</span> <span id="s347">I knew that my father would bribe the tax accountants, when they came, the tax man.</span> <span id="s348">He would send them fantastic sets of porcelain for Christmas, as I remember, because of our discussion what to choose for these people, so they were bribed.</span> <span id="s349">He would give some of them discounts, I know, that later saved my life in strange ways.</span> <span id="s350">The Ukrainians were very poor.</span> <span id="s351">This was a Polish regime and Ukrainians were both illiterate and poor.</span> <span id="s352">They were peasants, they would come into store barefoot, I remember that.</span> <span id="s353">And they would always buy dishes which were considered very inferior, fiance (ph), ceramic.</span> <span id="s354">They were painted.</span> <span id="s355">They would buy big dishes, painted, big dishes for soup, or whatever else.</span> <span id="s356">But the fine porcelain was always for the Polish and for some of the Jewish families too.</span> <span id="s357">But my father did more than this, handling the people from the city, but from all over they came.</span> <span id="s358">It was an established business for the Province.</span> <span id="s359">And the provincial peasants were very, very many.</span> <span id="s360">So we got both the Ukrainian peasants would come in and the Polish people were the aristocracy, in a way.</span> <span id="s361">And then there were Jewish people with money.</span> <span id="s362">This was the clientele and there were many helpers in the store and that’s where I picked up Yiddish because they spoke Yiddish to a very large extent.</span> <span id="s363">We had a bookkeeper who survived the war, we had my brother-in-law, my older sister’s, her husband later joined and he had the presentation of chandeliers and enamel bath tubs.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Enamel what?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Bath tubs.</span> <span id="s366">Tubs for the bath.</span> <span id="s367">This was all new because there was no way of having any, water didn’t come into the apartment so you had to pour it, so the bath tubs we had for that luxury of taking a bath.</span> <span id="s368">And he was doing very well this way but it was part of the business.</span> <span id="s369">So that’s where, Yiddish you could hear in the store, they spoke Yiddish, these boys.</span> <span id="s370">One of them survived, I met him after the war, I couldn’t believe it, but, the rest were all killed.</span> <span id="s371">I remember seeing them over the, over in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">01:39:01 But, I, so I was sort of isolated or protected from actual confrontation with anti-Semitism, but as I said, it was always in the air.</span> <span id="s373">For instance, on Yom Kipper my parents would go to synagogue, naturally, we girls stayed home.</span> <span id="s374">And we always barricaded ourselves.</span> <span id="s375">We were afraid always to stand in the window or on the balcony, the balcony was a big part of our life.</span> <span id="s376">We lived on the main street called Kol-soy-oi (ph), you could see people walk back and forth and my mother was very orientated towards clothes, she was critical of this, this dress is too long and this is too short and this is too bright and so on, but on Yom Kipper night, some of these nights it was forbidden for us to show our faces, this I remembered.</span> <span id="s377">We worried, although we never experienced it, that some of the Polish or Ukrainian goons will come and knock out windows so there was this sense of panic all the time.</span> <span id="s378">In our town there were so many Jews, half of the population was Jewish.</span> <span id="s379">You could see the difference.</span> <span id="s380">Suddenly it was very dark, it was very quiet, all the stores were closed, most stores belonged to the Jews.</span> <span id="s381">No body moved, nothing moved.</span> <span id="s382">And then you always thought, somebody will come, knock at the door, knock out the window, it happened occasionally but I myself did not experience this.</span> <span id="s383">But I do recall the feeling of some anxiety, perhaps even panic, that it might happen.</span> <span id="s384">So I say, I knew about it, but not in a personal way.</span> <span id="s385">Yom Kipper was very difficult, we all passed it, I didn’t after a certain age, but Yom Kipper I remember as it was dark in the apartment.</span> <span id="s386">There was a very severe fast.</span> <span id="s387">The breaking of the fast, people were very tired or slowly coming out of synagogues, they were praying all day there.</span> <span id="s388">This I remember with a great deal of pain.</span> <span id="s389">The Klezmar would come, to pray for us, a happy, ah, these people were very poor.</span> <span id="s390">These are older Jews.</span> <span id="s391">Very poor, and they would go from house to house.</span> <span id="s392">It was my job, because I was the youngest at home, I didn’t go to synagogue and because I was there while my parents had to come from the synagogue, to give them some food to break the fast.</span> <span id="s393">I remember as a child carrying that tray of honey cake.</span> <span id="s394">And they would pray, they would pray and then they would go, sometimes they came back later at dinner time.</span> <span id="s395">I still mourn these Klezmar because they were so poor.</span> <span id="s396">It was so wrong that a night like that, after fast, they had to go and pray.</span> <span id="s397">The Klas-mas(ph) music has not survived, the type of pain when I hear, it’s not good, it’s not authentic enough for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">01:42:03 I must be honest, there’s very few people who remember how it was.</span> <span id="s399">They played in short sleeved outfits, I can’t even, Perlman plays.</span> <span id="s400">He’s doing it well I suppose but he’s not good enough for me because I remember the authentic players.</span> <span id="s401">Who could teach these young people here, they all went to the ovens.</span> <span id="s402">This is the story of the Klezmar in our home town, they always played at weddings, the weddings for my family were very big, and none of them survived from what I know.</span> <span id="s403">Anyway, it was not right that people who have suffered so much poverty and so much indignity should ever have to end up this way.</span> <span id="s404">It wasn’t fair.</span> <span id="s405">But in our home town, this was the story, this was true for many of the other little towns too, all over Poland, particularly in these places.</span> <span id="s406">So, this was Yom Kipper, my parents would come home, always with headaches, tired, but breaking the fast was unlike here where you often have loks or these things, or there has to be hot chicken soup and the Klezmar would come back to play and then they ate with us a little, but it was a difficult, a very difficult holiday for us.</span> <span id="s407">There was no joy at all.</span> <span id="s408">Then came Sukkot and Sukkot I remember very vividly because the Sukkot(ph) in our home was big.</span> <span id="s409">The entry to the apartment was a very big hallway and it didn’t have windows but it had ceiling window, there was a name for it?</span> <span id="s410">When there’s a windows in the ceiling, you know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: Sky light?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Sky light.</span> <span id="s413">There was a very big room with a sky light and actually two of the other rooms, one was a children’s room, also had a sky light.</span> <span id="s414">Anyway, the sky light in the foyer, the very big foyer was removed for Sukkot and branches of trees, it was covered with tree branches because Sukkot is a special holiday.</span> <span id="s415">My father would being in many people from the synagogue and they danced, everybody!</span> <span id="s416">By the way, every Sukkotbot, I had to bring an Oye Nak-a-dom (ph) home and Oye (ph) was a guest from the synagogue.</span> <span id="s417">There wasn’t a time that there wouldn’t come an Oye (ph), my father had to bring an Oye (ph).</span> <span id="s418">Somebody who was poor, who was stranded in the city and needed a meal.</span> <span id="s419">A shabbat meal.</span> <span id="s420">Once my father came without an Oye (ph) and I remember how upset my mother was and he had, poor man, he had to go back to the synagogue and find an Oye (ph).</span> <span id="s421">There were always some poor people stranded.</span> <span id="s422">One Oye (ph) I’ll never forget.</span> <span id="s423">It must have been 1938 by then because he told us that he came from Zbaszyn.</span> <span id="s424">Zbaszyn was a place, you know about it, to which the Polish Jews were thrown by the Germans and he somehow or other, he wandered and wandered around, he came to Kolomyja, a long way from Zbonsheen, which was on the Zbaszyn border and he began to tell us a little bit about what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">01:45:20 But I think it was hushed over in some way, at least I don’t remember details.</span> <span id="s426">I remember that Oye (ph).</span> <span id="s427">Another steady one, every Sukkot-bot (ph) was the matchmaker in town.</span> <span id="s428">My sisters got married by matchmaker, through a matchmaker.</span> <span id="s429">The matchmaker, he was treated very well, but he always said, he’s not going to eat, he just came for Kiddish.</span> <span id="s430">But, to eat you had to wash your hands so he refused to wash his hands because he only came for Kiddish.</span> <span id="s431">So the Kiddish was a lot of appetizers, three or four appetizers, and a lot of sweets and he was not eating, but he came, every Sukkot-bot (ph) he came because my father had daughters to marry off.</span> <span id="s432">And he knew there would be money there so all my sisters married ______________ and when it came to me, he looked me over.</span> <span id="s433">The coming of age, he noticed my body, that it was getting ready for marriage.</span> <span id="s434">He started looking at me more seriously, but I escaped him.</span> <span id="s435">So I never married through a matchmaker, I married my husband, very independent wife.</span> <span id="s436">But the matchmaker was at our shabbat table every Saturday without eating.</span> <span id="s437">I always laughed because he ate about three appetizers you know.</span> <span id="s438">The Jewish food was gefilte fish and it was pitché and it was something else, chopped liver, three, four appetizers and he ate all of them without washing his hands, which means he didn’t eat.</span> <span id="s439">We all laugh about it, we still remember the shabbat and they all went into the ovens.</span> <span id="s440">But, this was part of my childhood which I resisted to a large extent because I wanted to be very Polish to him.</span> <span id="s441">Without being with Poles.</span> <span id="s442">Had a very mixed up mixture, but go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Did you loose the little accent that you had when you first went to school, so instead of speaking Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s445">My Polish is fine.</span> <span id="s446">I lost the accent and I must have made some sort of silent determination that I’m going to beat them at it.</span> <span id="s447">My Polish saved my life in some ways, in some places, some occasions when somebody looked suspiciously at me and I knew he was suspecting because I look Jewish, I would open my mouth, which helped occasionally because I spoke very good Polish.</span> <span id="s448">Now my Polish ain’t so good.</span> <span id="s449">But my German is better now, amazingly so.</span> <span id="s450">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: You went to University in 1936?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: 1936 I entered University again.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: And how did that happen, was this usual for young women?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s455">Very few, there was no gymnasium for Jewish women, there was only the gymnasium with the nuns, the Ursulanki nuns ran a Catholic, high school for Catholic girls and all Polish girls were Catholic.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">01:48:09 So there was nothing for me but that when my parents together with nine others created the gymnasium.</span> <span id="s457">I came to the University, I certainly wanted to go to University and I wanted to study Polish literature, there was no question about what I wanted to study.</span> <span id="s458">I was the youngest at home, the only one at home.</span> <span id="s459">My sisters were married by then.</span> <span id="s460">And lived away.</span> <span id="s461">So for them, the lose of their mezunka, the youngest is the mezunka, usually the favorite child in many Jewish families, but with me it was doubly so.</span> <span id="s462">They were extremely unhappy about it, they wouldn’t hear about it.</span> <span id="s463">Well, how could I make my parents hear me this way?</span> <span id="s464">I went on a hunger strike.</span> <span id="s465">For my parents, a child wouldn’t eat, was the greatest tragedy.</span> <span id="s466">They could not stand my, they couldn’t stand the separation from me, I suppose.</span> <span id="s467">They worried about a girl going away to a big city, what will happen to her?</span> <span id="s468">They worried about kashrut, where will I eat there?</span> <span id="s469">And they worried about themselves, I’m sorry, I’m sure they couldn’t face each other all alone.</span> <span id="s470">All the sisters were gone and they were still young people but they felt as if they felt old.</span> <span id="s471">So my father made a decision to go to his Rabbi.</span> <span id="s472">At that time the Rabbi didn’t come to us anymore.</span> <span id="s473">He was old and he didn’t travel, I suppose.</span> <span id="s474">He lived some where near Sigit, somewhere very far, it was Romania at that point.</span> <span id="s475">And to go to Romania from Poland you needed passports by then, you needed visas, you needed foreign currency, it was both the Polish government and the Romanian government made it very difficult.</span> <span id="s476">But my father found a way and he went to the Rabbi.</span> <span id="s477">To consult with him, what to do about this stubborn, little daughter.</span> <span id="s478">So the Rabbi, in his wisdom, I doubt if his experience was questioned, he said, if she is as smart as a boy, you treat her as if she were a boy, send her to study.</span> <span id="s479">Father came back and I went to study.</span> <span id="s480">And that is the story on how I went to study.</span> <span id="s481">My parents outfitted me and I was always outfitted for every occasion, and I went to live off and they made arrangements with a distant relative to house me.</span> <span id="s482">She was in Boughf, Lemberg.</span> <span id="s483">She was married to a man who didn’t make a living, the name was Fisch, so there was hidden poverty, a little hidden poverty.</span> <span id="s484">I had a small room there, kept extremely well for me.</span> <span id="s485">The woman worked very hard, again, I had a lot of pain because she treated me exceptionally.</span> <span id="s486">I had to have the best meat and the best food and they skimped and it was very painful for me to look at all these things.</span> <span id="s487">But that’s how it was and she was getting 100 zlotys a month, which in those days was much money, and the whole family lived off it.</span> <span id="s488">There was one daughter, a little younger than I.</span> <span id="s489">So this was what they lived off.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">01:51:10 The first day, I get outfitted, my new outfit, and I go to the University and I’m small and I look very young.</span> <span id="s491">I look much younger than my seventeen and a half years, I looked a little childish in a way.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: How old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: Seventeen and a half.</span> <span id="s494">Close to eighteen, in fact, when the Rabbi, when he married me later he wondered whether my father was telling my age, I looked so young.</span> <span id="s495">But, I come to the University, it looked so big.</span> <span id="s496">It looked so tremendous and here in front of the big door stand two Polish goons and Endeki, Polish Fascists.</span> <span id="s497">And there are big posters in front of the door saying, this is a week without Jews.</span> <span id="s498">This, as I remember, is October, 1936.</span> <span id="s499">A week without Jews, I don’t understand what they’re talking about, so I’m trying to get through and I see they’re hostile faces.</span> <span id="s500">Anyway, I came to my classroom and I recall they wanted me to sit down on the left benches.</span> <span id="s501">The classrooms were very big, at least to the eyes of the young girl from a small town, and they arranged that all Polish students were to sit on the right side and the Jewish students were to take the ghetto benches, the left side.</span> <span id="s502">Before I went to them, I already had some information from the Jewish-Polish society of students, and they told me about it, and they told me Jewish students will not take the left benches, the ghetto benches, but we will stand.</span> <span id="s503">So I looked for the Jewish students, there was no body else, I was the only Jewish student.</span> <span id="s504">And to the right side were about, 200 perhaps, Polish students and I’m the little thing standing at the door.</span> <span id="s505">To cut it short, for the next three years, I stood at that door.</span> <span id="s506">I took all my University classes in the standing position.</span> <span id="s507">I never sat down.</span> <span id="s508">It was getting worse every day.</span> <span id="s509">There were weeks without Jews, there were special treatment of Jews.</span> <span id="s510">The professors were unbelievably anti-semetic.</span> <span id="s511">The professors stood and they could see around, they were a little high on the podium, and it was a requirement of each student to hand over the indexes, it was a little book in which you would put a signature that you had attended classes, we had to have that to attend every class in Polish literature.</span> <span id="s512">And as I put, and he would pause at the end of the session, he would put his signature.</span> <span id="s513">One of them, Professor Tasycki, he was the expert in the Polish language, not literature, but language for say, phonics.</span> <span id="s514">He saw my name, Matylda Hirsch, he took a look, he threw it at the floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">01:54:00 And the students applauded.</span> <span id="s516">I don’t know what made me go back.</span> <span id="s517">I just don’t know.</span> <span id="s518">It was sheer anger, I suppose.</span> <span id="s519">Or sheer sukkotme of going home without finishing it.</span> <span id="s520">I was so defenseless.</span> <span id="s521">I was in such a fright.</span> <span id="s522">Everyday, I would literally vomit with anxiety, of entering that University.</span> <span id="s523">At one point, they pushed me and they pushed me down and something I held on that I didn’t break my body.</span> <span id="s524">One point I remember, a highlight in my University studies.</span> <span id="s525">Professor Julius Kleiner, may his memory be blessed.</span> <span id="s526">The saying was that he was half Jewish, a quarter Jewish, one-eighth Jewish, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s527">He was a very famous professor, an expert on the famous poet, Julius Slowacki.</span> <span id="s528">His name was Julius Kleiner, and it was the same, Julius and Julius.</span> <span id="s529">He introduced us to some understanding of the influence of Freud on literature.</span> <span id="s530">To me, it was all very new.</span> <span id="s531">But he was extremely prestigious lecturer of Polish literature, particularly about Slowacki.</span> <span id="s532">And he saw me, every time, standing at the doorway, all alone, as I was very insignificant little looking, very small.</span> <span id="s533">One day, he moves from his katedra, all the way down to the doorway, I thought he was walking out, he takes me under his arm, he brings me up to the podium and he asked me to take the chair.</span> <span id="s534">Well!</span> <span id="s535">I refused to take the chair.</span> <span id="s536">I just stood, he finished his lecture, as he walked down, the students threw eggs at him.</span> <span id="s537">Lucky they didn’t throw stones.</span> <span id="s538">Many times, they carried stones.</span> <span id="s539">Most of the time, by the way, he was later killed, I believe, but I have lost contact.</span> <span id="s540">The Endecki would take, would carry sticks, what do you call it?</span> <span id="s541">Sticks?</span> <span id="s542">With a Gillette at the bottom of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: A razor.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: A razor, yes.</span> <span id="s545">And they would always try to hurt some Jewish student.</span> <span id="s546">Once he killed one.</span> <span id="s547">This was a friend of my husband’s, came later.</span> <span id="s548">Well, these were the days, I would get home extremely depressed.</span> <span id="s549">Would study in this extremely small room, which they kept very clean, special for me.</span> <span id="s550">I would study, my mind was everywhere else, but I still had all these papers, sometimes were very good.</span> <span id="s551">We had a professor of Polish phonetics, this was a woman, she was a docent, a docent meant an associate professor, docent to Professor Taszcki, so she didn’t have as much power as he but she was a miserable creature, she looked like a monkey.</span> <span id="s552">She was horrible in every way and she focused on me.</span> <span id="s553">And she focused on my podzigbienie.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">which means, old church Slavonic.</span> <span id="s555">The old church Slavonic, she wanted to test it in some way and she made experiments.</span> <span id="s556">Only years later did I realize that these were experiments taken out of racial books, but I wasn’t aware of it.</span> <span id="s557">She put powder on our, what do you call that part?</span> <span id="s558">Of the most podzigbienie, I’m saying it in Polish, podzigbienie, and she would have us pronounce vocals.</span> <span id="s559">And she wanted to study it and photograph, all were experiments, which I couldn’t understand, but she wanted to tell us how we pronounce this vowel, how we pronounce, what is the other, the consonant.</span> <span id="s560">This was all taken of Nazi books, which occurred to me only many years later.</span> <span id="s561">This was Professor Dluga was her name.</span> <span id="s562">Terrible creature!</span> <span id="s563">And who does she play with?</span> <span id="s564">The one Jewish student, that was me.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Tape II</span></p> <p><span id="s566">02:01:06</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Maria, we were talking about the three, it was three years, in Lvov, four years before you graduated?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: It was four years, but the fourth year the Russians were there and the University has changed totally by then.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Let me ask you a little bit about the three years.</span> <span id="s570">What gave you the strength to go to school, I mean, talking about throwing up everyday before you go, I mean, was extraordinary stress!</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: I did not throw up everyday but I felt nauseous and I threw up occasionally, but the nausea was part of the anxiety.</span> <span id="s572">I felt some sense of resistance, that I cannot leave.</span> <span id="s573">The Jewish organization helped us to a large extent because I knew this was happening to other students too.</span> <span id="s574">The thing that mobilized my anger rather than my anxiety was a funeral of a student in the medical studies.</span> <span id="s575">He was literally killed in the classroom.</span> <span id="s576">His name just escapes me, I wish I could remember, but he was a close friend of a man who later became my husband.</span> <span id="s577">This was a tremendous funeral, somewhere or other, I felt this solidarity of people and I wasn’t alone.</span> <span id="s578">It was very unfortunate that in the study of Polish literature I was the only Jew and that feeling of isolation was the worst part of all of it.</span> <span id="s579">But then, I suddenly found myself in that procession of hundreds of students and I got this sense of strength from the numbers.</span> <span id="s580">But it was extremely difficult and I always prayed that the class be over and vacation come, each time there was a holiday, naturally I would go home.</span> <span id="s581">My parents were overjoyed in seeing me, I never told them the story of what was going on.</span> <span id="s582">I recall, they would bring back the big, big pots and pans when I came because for themselves, they were on diets, and the cooking was very limited, so when I came there were again celebrations.</span> <span id="s583">There was some joy in the house again.</span> <span id="s584">I think it was in my, let me see, it was in my third year of studies, second or third, I can’t remember, that I went to the library to pick up a Polish book and the librarian told me that the book was just checked out.</span> <span id="s585">I said, who took it?</span> <span id="s586">She said, this man, this young student.</span> <span id="s587">I walk over to the student and I say, I need this book.</span> <span id="s588">He says, he wants to read it too.</span> <span id="s589">And I said, are you a student of Polish literature?</span> <span id="s590">He say, no, he studies pharmacology, the medical school.</span> <span id="s591">So I said, but I’m a student of Polish literature and I need the book for an exam.</span> <span id="s592">He says, well, you're quite stubborn about it.</span> <span id="s593">I say, yes, please help me with it.</span> <span id="s594">We started talking.</span> <span id="s595">He was from my home town, I never knew him, but I knew of his parents because people knew of the businesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">02:04:03 His parents had a apotheketer (ph), pharmacy and everybody knew the pharmacy and I did.</span> <span id="s597">So he was one of their sons, the youngest son.</span> <span id="s598">Well, arguing over the book, we became lovers.</span> <span id="s599">And this changed my life immediately.</span> <span id="s600">I wasn’t alone.</span> <span id="s601">Nunek and I were going home, at least for vacations, my father was very unhappy when I declared I wanted to marry him.</span> <span id="s602">Because his family, unlike my own, was extremely assimilated to the extent that I think they would eat on Yom Kippur, which was unusual.</span> <span id="s603">They carried it to an extreme.</span> <span id="s604">His father was for generations, they had that pharmacy.</span> <span id="s605">They prided themselves in being extremely assimilated Jews.</span> <span id="s606">Well again, in my usual stubbornness, my parents had to give in, so my father remembered that as a very young child, he went to the chedet together with this man who had a few classes there, so they patched it up in some way and they came and there was an engagement.</span> <span id="s607">It was 1938 or 1939.</span> <span id="s608">We became engaged and my life naturally changed because I wasn’t alone, he was just about to finish his study, I had another two years to go.</span> <span id="s609">That summer.</span> <span id="s610">.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: Tell me when you met?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: I met him, I think it was 1938, two years after.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Was he your first man?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: My first boyfriend.</span> <span id="s615">Well, I had some boyfriends before.</span> <span id="s616">My first crush was on the teacher, then I had a boy that, my parents arranged for me to meet boys in their house, which means dancing, so it was always chaperoned.</span> <span id="s617">And I remember a crush on a young man who was later killed.</span> <span id="s618">And this was my first crush, but my first intimate relationship was this boy, my fiancee, Nunek Najder.</span> <span id="s619">It wasn’t engaged really, we started living together in a way, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: What attracted you to him, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: He loved Polish literature and yet he was in a different profession, so definitely yes, he was very assimilated and I always struggled with this thing, you know?</span> <span id="s622">We had a lot in common because of Polish literature.</span> <span id="s623">And we belonged to the Jewish Student Association, life changed.</span> <span id="s624">I wasn’t alone.</span> <span id="s625">And I think, my later years, being alone was a real tragedy.</span> <span id="s626">When I was hiding, later.</span> <span id="s627">But, Nunek was extremely affectionate with me, extremely devoted to me.</span> <span id="s628">We just seemed to be the right kind of a couple, both young, he was two years older than I.</span> <span id="s629">We would go home for vacations and there were always celebrations about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">02:07:03 One day, for a long vacation one summer we decided to go into the wild mountains.</span> <span id="s631">I was very much into hiking.</span> <span id="s632">Until a few years ago I was into it.</span> <span id="s633">And he too.</span> <span id="s634">This was the major sport for many young, Jewish people.</span> <span id="s635">He didn’t belong to an organization, he was the assimilated sort of category of Jews.</span> <span id="s636">But when he saw what was happening in the University, he became extremely angry at those Poles.</span> <span id="s637">But one day we decided to go to a new, brand new hostel on one of the highest mountains on the Carpatian Mountains, this was called the Chomiak.</span> <span id="s638">It was just discovered recently and they built a hostel there.</span> <span id="s639">Hard to get there, after a point we were able to go by a car, later had the march and was very far away.</span> <span id="s640">It was brand new, it smelled delicious I remember, there was one more couple from Warsaw, Polish people.</span> <span id="s641">And I recall the distance we had from them and, we were the only four people, very far away.</span> <span id="s642">No body could get there.</span> <span id="s643">I do recall that they had a sort of sense of superiority over us.</span> <span id="s644">They knew immediately that we were Jewish, although I looked Jewish, my husband never did and he spoke Polish beautifully.</span> <span id="s645">He came from a family of long, of long history of assimilated Jews.</span> <span id="s646">But somehow or the other, they sensed it.</span> <span id="s647">So although we ate together, there was a sense of distance and there was our sense of looking up at them.</span> <span id="s648">This I still remember.</span> <span id="s649">Well, it was a great experience, to be all alone in this stunning part of the mountains, this is above Bor-auk-na (ph), Bor-auk-na (ph) was a village and from there we went to the Chomiak.</span> <span id="s650">Later on, Chomiak became a popular place.</span> <span id="s651">When the vacation was over, it was the 1st of September, 1939.</span> <span id="s652">Vacation was over, we went back to the village to take the train to Kolomyja.</span> <span id="s653">It was a Sunday afternoon, we saw many, no, don’t remember why I think it was a Sunday, I thought it was Sunday because many Ukrainian peasants were trying to read posters.</span> <span id="s654">When we came to the posters, it was a Declaration of War.</span> <span id="s655">That Germany has just declared war on Poland.</span> <span id="s656">It was September 1st, 1939.</span> <span id="s657">Shows you how totally unprepared we were for it.</span> <span id="s658">People lived in Warsaw, not the cities, knew much more.</span> <span id="s659">We seemed to have been totally isolated from it, particularly when we were up in the mountains there for many weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: Were you aware of what was going on in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: We knew a little, what was going on in Germany, it was Nazi Germany.</span> <span id="s662">We didn’t know how much impact they had on our, on Polish students.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">02:10:01 Actually, when I later studied it, the tactics of the Polish students were cut out of text books from the Nazi literature.</span> <span id="s664">We didn’t know enough.</span> <span id="s665">When you lived in the western part of Poland you certainly knew more about it.</span> <span id="s666">You didn’t, I didn’t, and my husband didn’t know either.</span> <span id="s667">But I recall that day, later in the afternoon, I don’t know why I think it was Sunday, the only reason that I think so is that when peasants just be all together in the center of the square.</span> <span id="s668">We read this, we didn’t really realize the importance of it.</span> <span id="s669">We were Polish patriots, strangely enough.</span> <span id="s670">Both of us had military preparation, I had it in my high school days.</span> <span id="s671">All boys and all girls had to have military preparation.</span> <span id="s672">Which meant we were taught how to wear uniforms, how to march.</span> <span id="s673">He had to be taught, I’m sure, how to shoot.</span> <span id="s674">I wasn’t, but to march in parades and to march in case of a war.</span> <span id="s675">We knew all these things, there was, forgot the name, Polskin, gosh how could I remember, forget these names, anyway it was war preparation, that every high school student had to participate in.</span> <span id="s676">We took the train and we thought perhaps we’ll go into the war, perhaps we’ll march, we just didn’t understand any of it.</span> <span id="s677">When I came home I saw the gloom on my parents face, they knew more.</span> <span id="s678">They had participated in World War I and they knew that war is not only songs and marches.</span> <span id="s679">This was September 1st, 1939.</span> <span id="s680">Within weeks, the Russian army moved in.</span> <span id="s681">I didn’t know then, but there was a pact between Ribintrope (ph) and Molotov (ph) and they declared that Poland should be divided.</span> <span id="s682">Our part of Poland fell to the Soviets.</span> <span id="s683">This was within two or three weeks that the Soviet army marched in.</span> <span id="s684">I remember the night when they marched in.</span> <span id="s685">It was very, what was the word for it?</span> <span id="s686">The song sounded very attractive, it was mesmerizing.</span> <span id="s687">They were marching and their songs were beautiful, I still remember their songs.</span> <span id="s688">And I was very much pulled somewhat or other, I always was liberal, I was always poor.</span> <span id="s689">Many of their ideas, it seemed that, they were bring some employment and dignity to the poor people.</span> <span id="s690">But, on the other hand, I could see from my parents expression that they were worried and we didn’t know what the future would be, so it was strong.</span> <span id="s691">I remember distinctly that night when they marched in and I recall the song, they sang these songs, for some reason.</span> <span id="s692">Well, we went back to Lvov to study.</span> <span id="s693">My husband was just finished then, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">02:13:05</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: Can you sing one of the songs?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: Gosh, [singing], oh, I can’t remember anymore.</span> <span id="s697">If tomorrow is war, we will defend Stalin and everywhere we will be the victors.</span> <span id="s698">So, it had a mesmerizing quality for some reason because I was in conflict.</span> <span id="s699">But I did go back to finish my studies.</span> <span id="s700">The University was totally different by then.</span> <span id="s701">By the way, I was married by, this was 1940, I was just married by then.</span> <span id="s702">Well, come back to my wedding for a minute, it was already a very quiet wedding.</span> <span id="s703">I never wanted a wedding in a white gown, I was a very feminist kind of a woman, liberal kind of a women.</span> <span id="s704">I was not interested in all these trappings of the bourgeoisie, which was very much the bad and good part of my background, mainly through my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">02:14:02 So I always dreamed that I’ll just escape with my husband or I’ll have a very small wedding, but anyway when the time came it was, the Soviets had just come in at that point and I was married, I can’t remember the month which is insane, but I know it was 1940.</span> <span id="s706">It was the year when I was just about to graduate.</span> <span id="s707">The Rabbi of our town was a close friend of my father, Rabbi Lowe (ph).</span> <span id="s708">His nephew is the chief Rabbi of Israel now.</span> <span id="s709">The other nephew was chief counsel of Israel for New York, the United States, I knew both of them, I met them later.</span> <span id="s710">But that Rabbi questioned my father, he said, you say she’s of age to marry?</span> <span id="s711">She looks like a child.</span> <span id="s712">I just happened to look very young.</span> <span id="s713">So the outfit for my wedding was a nice little navy suit and flat-heel shoes and a little veil, I think.</span> <span id="s714">The wedding was in our own apartment in our parents home.</span> <span id="s715">There were hardly any guests, the Soviets had just come in and the business was already taken over by the Soviets.</span> <span id="s716">My father kept saying that he cannot give me much a dowry because of the war, because the Soviets have taken over everything, but after the war he will reimburse me for it, I’ll get more dowry than any of the other girls, and all the girls got good dowries.</span> <span id="s717">And I didn’t think of a dowry at all, to me this was all very uninteresting.</span> <span id="s718">All I remember that, the day of the wedding, later we took the train and went back to study and, in Re-volf (ph), and sitting on the train I wore that wedding band and he did too and a Polish woman sits there across from us, she says, these days children have such a way of lying.</span> <span id="s719">You wear wedding bands, you're both children!</span> <span id="s720">He looked very young too, strange as it all sounds now.</span> <span id="s721">But we finished our studies and the University was a totally different institutions.</span> <span id="s722">The Soviets have changed it totally.</span> <span id="s723">While anti-Semitism was somewhat there, it certainly was there, it was not official but there are no more Jewish students in my department.</span> <span id="s724">I mean, there was no question in what I mixed with others.</span> <span id="s725">What I recall was extremely cold winter of 1940.</span> <span id="s726">The Soviets suddenly did not have any steam anymore, everything was just taken away, including the steam, how they managed that I don’t know.</span> <span id="s727">But whatever they could put their eyes on was taken back to Russia.</span> <span id="s728">I recall going to the opera house, we were involved in opera, and seeing the Russian ladies in nightgowns because they thought these were evening gowns, and I recall in our, when they took our store they removed everything so my father still removed some dishes for bartering later which helped us for a long time.</span> <span id="s729">The Soviets nationalized the store, actually local people who became communist, who were communist, but now became very important officials, they came to help the Soviet soldiers to nationalize the store.</span> <span id="s730">For my father it was a terrible tragedy because to him the business was his life to a very large extent and suddenly he was without anything.</span> <span id="s731">The same happened to my father-in-law, his ________ was also nationalized by the Soviets.</span> <span id="s732">To these people, they suddenly became old, and they were really not older at that point but everything was taken away from them, they felt.</span> <span id="s733">So, the study was very different.</span> <span id="s734">I had my final exams, they had to be in the Russian language.</span> <span id="s735">We all had to study from the green book, I remember under my arm, and every student had it under their arm, every University student has this green book.</span> <span id="s736">Very cheap paper in green cover, it was called the korr-up-tik qual for Bolshovitski Party (ph), which means The Short Course of the Bolshevik Party and was full of propaganda which I didn’t realize at that time that it was propaganda, but it was about Stalin and it was about the Revolution.</span> <span id="s737">One chapter I liked very much was the Marxist dialectic philosophy, it was very well written.</span> <span id="s738">It seemed to have some, no, actually the Hagalien (ph) dialectic philosophy, it made sense.</span> <span id="s739">It had some large expressions to be a lot of propaganda.</span> <span id="s740">But we had to study every page and every word of it and the final exam, when they examined me in Polish literature, I had to talk in Russian.</span> <span id="s741">I mastered the language very quickly.</span> <span id="s742">I forgot it very quickly too, you know I hardly know any.</span> <span id="s743">But this was a year in Re-volf (ph), the final year.</span> <span id="s744">I was a newly wedded woman, my parents were depressed over what happened, what was going on, they were forever feared that they may be deported, that the Russians would deport them.</span> <span id="s745">At one point, they actually would go home from time to time, at one point they came to take my parents away.</span> <span id="s746">They always did it in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s747">They were classified as bourgeois and this was a very bad certification and, in the middle of the night they came always with their rifles, rifling at the door.</span> <span id="s748">We always were afraid.</span> <span id="s749">And they took them to the railway station to take them to Siberia.</span> <span id="s750">I recall I was home at that point and my sisters was home at that point, and we ran to the railway station.</span> <span id="s751">It was a lot of bribes to get them back home.</span> <span id="s752">I wish we didn’t, but that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s753">The bribes were always vodka and chof-socks (ph).</span> <span id="s754">Chof-socks (ph) were watches, they loved watches.</span> <span id="s755">The Soviets had absolutely nothing, it’s unbelievable, how they took everything, taken back to Russia.</span> <span id="s756">For the first time they saw goods, which they haven’t seen.</span> <span id="s757">We didn’t realize how the revolution had changed life there in those politics in poverty, unless among the highest officials, I suppose.</span> <span id="s758">So, they always ordered leather coats and when they ordered leather coats, they had to be to the floor because they figured when they go back and the winter is cold, they will cut and make a pair of boots, this was ___________.</span> <span id="s759">So, chof-socks (ph) and leather coats and our fine porcelain, all of it went somewhere with the Russian families eventually back to Russia.</span> <span id="s760">This was the Soviets, but I finished school and then they didn’t permit me to live in Re-volf (ph), didn’t permit me or my husband, because we were categorize as bourgeois.</span> <span id="s761">And the Soviet law was that if you were in this category, you weren’t quite an animal in Socialism but you were somewhere not to be trusted so you had to live fifty miles away from a large city.</span> <span id="s762">Everybody wanted to live in a large city, so they punished us.</span> <span id="s763">Instead of taking us to Siberia like they wanted to take my parents, who were considered useless, they figured two young people, these professionals, will be useful.</span> <span id="s764">So the law was that you had to move fifty miles away from Re-volf (ph) and there were these centers.</span> <span id="s765">They had a very bright idea, good idea, is to open up hospitals and pharmacies in the villages of the Polish Ukraine, which had nothing.</span> <span id="s766">There was never a school there, never a hospital, never a pharmacy, and the Soviets had a network of these things, very smart, the Poles never give them any credit for it.</span> <span id="s767">But they did, so they opened up a hospital in a place called Glen-na-novaria (ph).</span> <span id="s768">You never heard of it, I never heard of it.</span> <span id="s769">It was a real loss, it was a village in where there was no sidewalk.</span> <span id="s770">When a train, your shoe got stuck right in the mud.</span> <span id="s771">It had a name, mud was a part of the name, so this is where they sent us to work.</span> <span id="s772">My husband, they wanted to open a pharmacy, how did they open a pharmacy?</span> <span id="s773">They took from the Russian church, from the parochial house, they took the house and they opened a pharmacy.</span> <span id="s774">My husband opened the pharmacy and me, they wanted to teach in school and, because I wasn’t prepared to teach young children, I was prepared to teach at gymnasium, I had a Masters Degree by then, my gis-trof-o-sovisia (ph) which was a high Degree.</span> <span id="s775">So I was not versed in high school or anything, so they said I could be an assistant to my husband.</span> <span id="s776">I learned how to make ca-go-cheekie (ph), was a little medication against headaches.</span> <span id="s777">And I would wrap it.</span> <span id="s778">Very often at night we heard them, heard the Soviet soldiers knock at the door with the rifle.</span> <span id="s779">Each time we were prepared they would take us to Siberia.</span> <span id="s780">What they wanted were condoms.</span> <span id="s781">In the middle of the night, they would rifle at the door for condoms.</span> <span id="s782">This was 1940.</span> <span id="s783">I thought we were lucky to have jobs, we had enough food.</span> <span id="s784">There were three Jewish families, us, a Jewish doctor from Germany who was somehow or other came there and opened a hospital, it was all public works, and a Jewish teacher from Ha-riza (ph).</span> <span id="s785">That’s where all your Ukrainian peasants, everybody was illiterate there, absolutely illiterate.</span> <span id="s786">So the three of us, sometimes they played cards, I was reading books always, but anyway, one day we went to vacation and my father, you know, was so desperate about once more to stand behind a pharmacy counter.</span> <span id="s787">Once more to be an upper taker.</span> <span id="s788">So with a great deal of difficulty, we arranged for him to come to our place in Glen-na-novaria (ph) for two weeks vacation and we would go to their home in Kolomyja.</span> <span id="s789">It took us a lot of work to arrange that exchange.</span> <span id="s790">Well, it happened.</span> <span id="s791">We went there, home, we stayed in their home for two weeks and my father and mother-in-law went to our little place and took over the pharmacy to the greatest joy for this old man.</span> <span id="s792">And we were suppose to, after two weeks vacations we were suppose to go back.</span> <span id="s793">And it was the 21st of June, 1941, and you know the rest of the story.</span> <span id="s794">We didn’t expect any of it.</span> <span id="s795">We said good-bye to my parents, we had railway tickets to go the next day back to Re-volf (ph) and from there by horse and carriage to go to Glen-na-novaria (ph) and, in the middle of the night, I hear a lot of noise.</span> <span id="s796">I look out of the window, it was one in the morning, I see Soviet women and children being put on trucks.</span> <span id="s797">I woke my husband, I say, they must be going to summer camps.</span> <span id="s798">But it seemed to be so noisy and so many trucks, middle of the night.</span> <span id="s799">I opened the radio and here Hitler’s voice comes across.</span> <span id="s800">Today I declared war on Bolshevism and the Jews.</span> <span id="s801">And I knew things were very bad.</span> <span id="s802">The first thing in the morning, we ran to the railway station to get to that place.</span> <span id="s803">The trains did not run anymore.</span> <span id="s804">Nothing for civilians.</span> <span id="s805">We were stuck in Kolomyja, his parents were stuck in that little hole.</span> <span id="s806">Two weeks later we got a card, they were both shot.</span> <span id="s807">The Germans walked into the pharmacy, they were renounced as Jews and they were shot.</span> <span id="s808">This was the end of my husband’s parents.</span> <span id="s809">We were stuck in Kolomyja and first the Hungarians came to cover our city.</span> <span id="s810">I remember them wearing these very high hats with feathers.</span> <span id="s811">They didn’t do much harm at that point yet.</span> <span id="s812">Somehow or other I recall a truck of children, a truck with children.</span> <span id="s813">I had no idea who these children were, but the children, the truck was covered but you could hear cries.</span> <span id="s814">We were living then at the home of my parents and I remember my father said to me and my sister, my sister had run away from Nova-som (ph), from the western part where the Germans had been already for two years, she came to our home town.</span> <span id="s815">And the Russians first were looking for her to send her to Siberia but anyway she got out of it and the Hungarians were there and my father said, bring the children a little hot water, it was a cold day.</span> <span id="s816">So we run with a china of hot water and we hear the whimper of the children and suddenly shots come.</span> <span id="s817">They were directed at us, at my sister and myself.</span> <span id="s818">I remember we threw this hot water, the china, on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s819">This was my first confrontation with real terror.</span> <span id="s820">But the Hungarians by and way were pretty innocent at the beginning, a least we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s821">Within a few weeks, the Germans marched in.</span> <span id="s822">And now I know from history but those days I didn’t know that right in the back of the soldiers came the SS.</span> <span id="s823">They always were out and we didn’t know the difference between an SS and a soldier and everything has been blamed on the SS but I now know that the soldiers were indistinguisukkotble from the SS because they participated as much.</span> <span id="s824">But anyway, everyday there was a new directive, a new poster.</span> <span id="s825">Today the Jews have to register and tonight the Jews have to observe curfew, and then Jews had to deliver all the gold and silver and then Jews have to deliver all the fur coats.</span> <span id="s826">And I remember standing in a long, long line on a very cold day, shivering and delivering fur coats.</span> <span id="s827">When I got married my parents bartered some of their porcelain things with a furrier who made two fur coats for me, not one but two, during the last year of my studies.</span> <span id="s828">It helped immensely because the University was so cold and I recall taking classes everyday bundled up in that fur coat.</span> <span id="s829">Anyway, with these two fur coats I stood in line, we all stood in line to deliver to the Germans.</span> <span id="s830">And I recall coming to the window, the German official, and he would register my name and address and the fur coat, the length of the fur coat, what it was made of.</span> <span id="s831">One was a tweed lined with beaver, the other was a sealskin coat, and he gave me a receipt of it and I figured, well, if after the Winter passes I’ll get it back, whatever.</span> <span id="s832">My ivory tables endless.</span> <span id="s833">And then came the ax-e-on-a (ph), the activists.</span> <span id="s834">All these names, we didn’t know, we called them ax-e-on-a (ph) because the Germans called it ax-e-on-a (ph).</span> <span id="s835">The raids.</span> <span id="s836">There was not a ghetto yet.</span> <span id="s837">I remember in the beginning, one of the raids was suddenly we saw people being dragged with ropes around their bodies.</span> <span id="s838">This was the action against the intellectuals, the doctors.</span> <span id="s839">We knew the Jewish doctor so well.</span> <span id="s840">This was a diversion, when sometime in 1940 when the Soviets were there, I was an assured vacation, Passover vacation at home.</span> <span id="s841">We were married then and my husband left at 6:00 in the morning I was suppose to take a later train, I do not remember why.</span> <span id="s842">I leaned out of the window, this was 1940 in Kolomyja and it was a sukkotrp, cool morning and I felt a terrible pain in my breast, in my lungs, my chest.</span> <span id="s843">And within a few hours, the doctors were there and they told me I have pneumonia, double pneumonia.</span> <span id="s844">In those days there was no treatment for pneumonia.</span> <span id="s845">My husband came back immediately, my father-in-law who still knew a lot about ___________, anyway, they got together.</span> <span id="s846">Sulfur was a way of treatment, but the medical knowledge at that point was if you lived seven days, I was pretty much unconscious with an extremely high fever, if you lived seven days, if you lived through the seven days you survive, otherwise you die at the seventh day.</span> <span id="s847">So they put cups, what they called cups, glass cups on my chest, which I hated, but worse, they brought leeches.</span> <span id="s848">And the leeches were always used medicinally by a barber, I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s849">The barber has a jar of leeches.</span> <span id="s850">I can’t remember, half conscious as I was, I kept sukkotking my head, I don’t want leeches but he put leeches.</span> <span id="s851">And whether the hot cups or the leeches or my father’s prayers, whichever it was I woke up saying, I’m hungry, and this was the end of my pneumonia.</span> <span id="s852">Almost the whole town was involved in my pneumonia.</span> <span id="s853">The three doctors were day and night and at my bed.</span> <span id="s854">Their names I do remember, Dr. Tye-sukkot (ph), Dr. Fry-gar (ph) and Dr. Fleish (ph), all three of them.</span> <span id="s855">When I got well, and I recovered pretty quickly I was young, and my mother took good care of me, I recovered, they insisted that the town should see me.</span> <span id="s856">They took a fee-ak-a (ph), and-drosh-kind (ph) and a pair of horses and here were the three doctors with me and we traveled across the city so everybody knew I was truly alive.</span> <span id="s857">In those days, you didn’t pick up a phone [to call anyone].</span> <span id="s858">_____________ because I would like the names of these doctors to be remembered somehow or another, they were all killed.</span> <span id="s859">Dr. Fleish’s (ph) daughter went to school with me, gymnasium, is still alive in Stockholm.</span> <span id="s860">So coming back to the German times, this I remember, famous doctors were in that aux-own-der (ph) being dragged.</span> <span id="s861">We didn’t know where people were being dragged, there were all kinds of rumors.</span> <span id="s862">Later we found they went, dragged outside of town to a forest called Sukkotp-a-roth-sa (ph) and they were shot there.</span> <span id="s863">They had machine guns there.</span> <span id="s864">There were all kinds of rumors that they went somewhere but somewhere or other it began to bother us that perhaps really the rumors that they were killed were true.</span> <span id="s865">We didn’t quite want to believe it.</span> <span id="s866">Every few weeks there was another action.</span> <span id="s867">One a very sad one was a moc-row-seat (ph), a very poor neighborhood where they dragged out all the Jews and for some reason they focused on them and then there were, food was already beginning to be rationed, there was little food.</span> <span id="s868">And in 1942, it was Passover, 1942, when the posters on the wall announced that all Jews have to go to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: Can I ask you a little bit about part of this period?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: First of all, you couldn’t go back to where you were living.</span> <span id="s872">Did you live with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: I lived with, we stayed with my parents.</span> <span id="s874">We occasionally stayed with his parents when the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s875">But we mainly stayed with my parents.</span> <span id="s876">My oldest sister, __________ was also, she had her own apartment, she and her husband and Menek lived there.</span> <span id="s877">We stayed with my parents at a big place.</span> <span id="s878">Occasionally we stayed with the Knight-ess (ph).</span> <span id="s879">This was the beginning when the Germans came and, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: Did you talk together about what happening or whether?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: Yes, we were very, very worried.</span> <span id="s882">We could see what was going on.</span> <span id="s883">We began to, well, we never saw that all be killed, this was very hard.</span> <span id="s884">Some of us would disappear, we thought, the way they did.</span> <span id="s885">People talked about the fact that these Jews were taken to the Ukraine, to the west-eastern part of the Ukraine to work on farms and we latched on to these stories, we really wanted to believe that.</span> <span id="s886">Under no circumstances did we think that it would lead to gas chambers.</span> <span id="s887">We had no idea, when you read the memos today and they said, we knew they were going to Treblinka, they knew they were going, we didn’t know where they were going, it was a fact.</span> <span id="s888">But there were massive raids on people.</span> <span id="s889">And sometimes there was shooting right in front of us so we knew that things were terribly bad.</span> <span id="s890">And there was beginning to be massive starvation.</span> <span id="s891">People were going hungry, but there was always somebody who disappeared.</span> <span id="s892">You heard somebody, a cousin, an uncle, somebody just, just, he was taken away.</span> <span id="s893">The word, the expression was taken away and many survivors still talk this way because we really didn’t know the word, we don’t know where they were killed, most of the time we don’t know exactly when because taken away is the right expression for it because all we knew is we saw them disappear, being taken away.</span> <span id="s894">The Ukrainians were extremely involved with the Germans.</span> <span id="s895">Actually, they were shooting as much, they were rounding us up as much.</span> <span id="s896">But the round ups, called ax-see-on (ph), were the most characteristic part of that period.</span> <span id="s897">You were afraid of ax-see-on (ph) and you were beginning to think about hiding places.</span> <span id="s898">It never occurred to us that we would disperse among the native population.</span> <span id="s899">We just didn’t think of it.</span> <span id="s900">Everybody knew me, I’m Maria Heirsh from Kolomyja, where would I go?</span> <span id="s901">Then came the arm bands, the white arm bands we had to wear.</span> <span id="s902">The yellow stars we had to wear.</span> <span id="s903">The names that we had to take, the identity cards that came, the cam-carda (ph).</span> <span id="s904">Where with my name was Sarah, the man, I can’t remember the name for the man, there was another Jewish name, biblical name for man, which means we were identified this way.</span> <span id="s905">You couldn’t move without a cam-carda (ph), you couldn’t be out, you couldn’t be in the street after 6:00, you couldn’t walk on the sidewalks, everyday there were new restrictions of various serious natures.</span> <span id="s906">There was a you-den-rot (ph) established, they asked my father to serve but he didn’t want to serve, the chairman of the you-den-rot (ph) was a Mr. Horowitz.</span> <span id="s907">A Jewish police was established, my husband’s brother volunteered for it because you first thought you would save Jews, later he was involved in all kinds, I assume of horrible things, although he didn’t witness them.</span> <span id="s908">It was getting worse everyday.</span> <span id="s909">We didn’t know what a ghetto was.</span> <span id="s910">By the way, when the Soviets withdrew and the Germans were just about to come in my father in strange ways looked forward to it.</span> <span id="s911">He remembered the Austrians and he thought the Germans would be part of it.</span> <span id="s912">With the Russians he couldn’t communicate, they took away everything from him.</span> <span id="s913">It was the Germans he favored since he speaks German and he remembers this.</span> <span id="s914">Austria the whole while was for them the best part of their lives.</span> <span id="s915">Hammsburg, Austria - the Kaiser was good to them.</span> <span id="s916">I remember as a child when the picture of Kaiser Franz Joseph came down in our living room and they hung up the picture of Marsukkotll Pil-sook-ski (ph) and I was happy about it.</span> <span id="s917">And they did it for their children, I think.</span> <span id="s918">But they were very much attached to the German language, to the Austrians, so they didn’t think that the Germans could be so bad because they really didn’t know terribly much what was going on in Germany.</span> <span id="s919">And in Germany they didn’t have extermination camps, people immigrated.</span> <span id="s920">We knew someone from Bonn-sheen (ph) but our knowledge was limited.</span> <span id="s921">The Soviets kept the knowledge away to a very large extent too.</span> <span id="s922">They didn’t tell us what was going on in western Poland because then they already had some camps.</span> <span id="s923">They didn’t tell, the Russians kept it very sealed, very tightly.</span> <span id="s924">Any news from western Germany where many Jews lived.</span> <span id="s925">Some of them escaped during the Soviet period like my sister did, my sister Frania.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: When the Germans came in and started the ax-see-on (ph) and you saw things on the street, even though you didn’t think it would be exterminations because who if any could have thought of that, did you see certain groups or certain people or were men more vulnerable than women did you think, or were they going to be the target?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: It was mixed, first were men which reinforced our false beliefs that they were taken to work.</span> <span id="s928">Men, to a large extent.</span> <span id="s929">But there was special categories taken.</span> <span id="s930">At one point I saw the doctors, then came some of the lawyers, fathers of students with whom I went to school, one of them lives in California still, one is in Florida, they both were there.</span> <span id="s931">Their fathers were lawyers.</span> <span id="s932">Then it came for some workers, special workers, we were told the SS needs these workers.</span> <span id="s933">But you could see sometimes shooting in the streets.</span> <span id="s934">Oh, the children came much later and this was a real awakening at that point.</span> <span id="s935">But, there were food limitations, severe food limitations.</span> <span id="s936">We were beginning to be quite hungry, not starved yet, but hungry.</span> <span id="s937">I remember the first day of Passover, this is in my mind very much, 1942.</span> <span id="s938">There was an announcement that we all had to go to the ghetto and they established three ghettos and they assigned to us the very poor part of the city.</span> <span id="s939">We were permitted to take on carriages, I don’t know why they permitted some of these carriages still, permitted to take whatever we could in carriages.</span> <span id="s940">I remember I took a pillow, we took some dishes, a few potatoes, that’s all we had.</span> <span id="s941">And we settled in that one-room house at the end of the town, it seemed to me, a very extremely poor neighborhood.</span> <span id="s942">It was pretty dark, it was the first _______ at night.</span> <span id="s943">It must have been five o’clock in the afternoon, was still enough time to prepare something for dinner.</span> <span id="s944">I recall peeling potatoes, the potatoes I saved.</span> <span id="s945">And suddenly I felt smoke and I looked around and the ghetto was on fire.</span> <span id="s946">And we began to run.</span> <span id="s947">We saw people being shot, we saw houses on fire including our own.</span> <span id="s948">We began to run, we didn’t know where to run, people are running we are running with them.</span> <span id="s949">They were running to the other part of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s950">In the other part of the ghetto lived my sister Frania and her husband and their child.</span> <span id="s951">My husband stayed behind, he wanted to just catch something, still save something.</span> <span id="s952">As we came there he arrived a few hours later, I remember, and his eyebrows were all burned and he came with a half-burned chicken.</span> <span id="s953">He caught a chicken in order to feel us.</span> <span id="s954">It was terribly bad but we left, we were alive.</span> <span id="s955">And each time these things happen, we touched ourselves and touched each other.</span> <span id="s956">We are alive.</span> <span id="s957">This was Passover.</span> <span id="s958">I went to my sister’s place, she had a small place there.</span> <span id="s959">We all crowded in there, whatever food they had we ate it together.</span> <span id="s960">We later found that many people from that part, whom they caught, they took them away and that’s all we knew, they took them away.</span> <span id="s961">And most of the time they took them to sukkotp-a-rof-ska (ph) and sometimes in the distance you could hear this shooting.</span> <span id="s962">Still, it would be somebody they perhaps shot, they obviously must have taken for work, by then they took all of the children and families, whole families.</span> <span id="s963">This was the ax-see-on (ph) of Passover.</span> <span id="s964">Later on, we found out, and dreaded holidays, we knew they were always were around holidays.</span> <span id="s965">Was easy for them to drag all the Jews.</span> <span id="s966">Finally we got a little apartment assigned to us in that other part of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s967">One, your windows of that went to the air outside, but the inside of it was the ghetto.</span> <span id="s968">Very small and my husband and I got an extremely small, it was a little porch and my parents got another one in that building.</span> <span id="s969">Things were getting worse everyday.</span> <span id="s970">I recall getting up in the morning and looking at the panorama of the ghetto, what it was like.</span> <span id="s971">People were laying, some dead of typhoid fever or starvation.</span> <span id="s972">An older Jew with a little carriage and a horse, which we later named the Messiah horse, would take these bodies on, put these dead bodies on that little carriage and drive them out of town for burial.</span> <span id="s973">We called the horse the Messiah horse because it was the horse of liberation.</span> <span id="s974">By then we felt that dying, what you call of natural death, was a blessing.</span> <span id="s975">Some of my uncles had this death.</span> <span id="s976">I recall these bodies in the littered ghetto, they were littering the ghetto.</span> <span id="s977">I recall sometimes getting up the morning and seeing distorted faces hanging on the street lanterns.</span> <span id="s978">And these distorted faces sometimes I saw the face of a teacher, of a relative, of a stranger.</span> <span id="s979">This was the work of the SS or the common soldiers who knew where and what.</span> <span id="s980">At night they would raid the ghetto, they would come in for a sport kind of thing, and would just find a few Jews and hang them on the street lanterns.</span> <span id="s981">This I couldn’t understand.</span> <span id="s982">This jolted me.</span> <span id="s983">I could understand they would take away people because they need people to work in the factories, on the farms.</span> <span id="s984">Why did they hang these teachers of mine?</span> <span id="s985">By then I was pretty much fully aware of the tragedy, of the whole tragedy of it.</span> <span id="s986">Then came a tremendous ax-see-on (ph).</span> <span id="s987">This was in September, 1942.</span> <span id="s988">There were little ones in between.</span> <span id="s989">There was an announcement that all men have to report to the auto-bites-on (ph), that they have to take along some food and then they will be sent to the Ukraine for work.</span> <span id="s990">By then we were sophisticated enough not to trust them.</span> <span id="s991">Only men, not women.</span> <span id="s992">We figured still, if they want men only it must be for work, but on the other hand, everybody to register.</span> <span id="s993">There were thousands of Jews in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s994">By the way, our ghetto became augmented because the Jews from the providence’s like your friends Alice Shick-ee (ph), Kos-off (ph), Kou-tee (ph), Uram-sukkot (ph), all these places were bringing, the Jews were brought into my home town, in the ghetto, were all herded into the ghetto so the overcrowding was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s995">That all of them, all men had to register, we knew this much, every man in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s996">Well, I remember that dilemma that evening before.</span> <span id="s997">Who should go?</span> <span id="s998">The man in my family was my father, my husband, my two brothers-in-law, Frania’s husband and Cyla’s husband.</span> <span id="s999">Menek was too young to be, they unified in that Menek wouldn’t go.</span> <span id="s1000">We decided our father shouldn’t go because we were afraid that he wouldn’t be taken to work.</span> <span id="s1001">I recall this very sad day, he came in and I couldn’t recognize him.</span> <span id="s1002">He took off his beard, he sukkotved his beard to look younger and he looked horrible.</span> <span id="s1003">He was beyond recognition because my father, you see his photo, was a very handsome man and the beard was part of the handsomeness.</span> <span id="s1004">And he looked about 100 years older but he decided he wanted to go.</span> <span id="s1005">My husband we thought would be safe because he was permitted while in the ghetto, he was permitted to work outside of the ghetto in his pharmacy.</span> <span id="s1006">They didn’t know it to operate it so he had a Red Cross on part of his work clothes band, on part of his white band, he was permitted to go during the day so the Germans could have access to the pharmacy, but in the evening he had to come back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1007">Each evening, he was checked, he was trying to smuggle a little food for us, but each evening he was checked.</span> <span id="s1008">One day he was beaten up terribly because he tried to bring a few grains of rye, he had put them into his collar of his coat and they found it and they beat him up mercilessly.</span> <span id="s1009">But basically he was our contact with the outside world to some extent because he worked there and we decided to, he would be safe.</span> <span id="s1010">There was no question, they’re not going to take him because him they needed.</span> <span id="s1011">The man decided to go, I don’t know what made for the decision, probably there was still some sort of hope that they would go for work or something, and that, how could they hide?</span> <span id="s1012">We had a hiding place in that place.</span> <span id="s1013">My husband really installed us there, before he went, he put my mother, my sister Cyla who then had typhoid fever, her son, Menek, my other sister on the other side, me and Blancka Rosenberg.</span> <span id="s1014">He put us into that cellar downstairs and he covered the opening of the floor with a little rug, put a table on top of it and _________ was sitting then that day.</span> <span id="s1015">I’ll never forget that day, it was a horrible day.</span> <span id="s1016">The men were gone.</span> <span id="s1017">We hoped they would return, we worried about our father mainly because he was older and we worried about him more than the others.</span> <span id="s1018">We thought they would return or go to work somewhere.</span> <span id="s1019">Sitting there waiting, there were a few other families there, and Blanca’s child wasn’t there anymore, I don’t believe so, no.</span> <span id="s1020">She was alone.</span> <span id="s1021">And suddenly we hear some footsteps on top of that hiding place, with dogs.</span> <span id="s1022">And boots, German boots.</span> <span id="s1023">And the dogs stopped and started smelling and we knew this was the end.</span> <span id="s1024">I still don’t know what happened that they walked away.</span> <span id="s1025">Something distracted them, perhaps they didn’t trust the dogs enough.</span> <span id="s1026">I do recall that moment when everybody stopped breathing.</span> <span id="s1027">It must have been a second but it felt like eternity.</span> <span id="s1028">And how the mouths of these babies were covered with pillows and I was sure the babies would suffocate.</span> <span id="s1029">They didn’t, it was a moment.</span> <span id="s1030">By then we knew that our days are counted, that they meant us too, not only the men.</span> <span id="s1031">We were sitting there for hours, I say it felt like eternity, and suddenly we felt smoke.</span> <span id="s1032">The house was burning, they set the house to fire.</span> <span id="s1033">We decided we have to go up.</span> <span id="s1034">We walked out, our house was not on fire for some reason.</span> <span id="s1035">The neighboring houses were made of wood, our house was not as made.</span> <span id="s1036">So, there was smoke all over.</span> <span id="s1037">The Germans seemed to have been at the end of their day.</span> <span id="s1038">There were dead bodies all over.</span> <span id="s1039">We could still hear some shooting.</span> <span id="s1040">The Ukrainians were walking into the apartments, taking out everything they could.</span> <span id="s1041">Polish guns, Ukrainian guns.</span> <span id="s1042">We were alive, our men were not there.</span> <span id="s1043">I remember the moment my sister, Frania with her baby, with her child, she had typhoid fever.</span> <span id="s1044">Somehow or other, late evening, the men come back.</span> <span id="s1045">Who came back?</span> <span id="s1046">Unbelievably, my father came back and my husband came back.</span> <span id="s1047">The husbands of my sisters did not come back.</span> <span id="s1048">We didn’t know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s1049">We comforted each other.</span> <span id="s1050">They were sending the Ukraine’s to work.</span> <span id="s1051">The young men will be given food, they will be laborers.</span> <span id="s1052">We didn’t quite believe it, a part of us believed, another part didn’t.</span> <span id="s1053">We didn’t know where they were going.</span> <span id="s1054">All the stories that survivors say they knew, we didn’t know, nobody knew.</span> <span id="s1055">We found out later through an escapee that they went to Belzec, the extermination camp at Belzec which was not far from Re-vof (ph) and which eventually swallowed so many of the Jews from our town and from the neighboring towns.</span> <span id="s1056">And I’ve read a passage about it in the book by Hillberk and I found a long chapter about it many years ago in the book of the American historian called Oln-ingst Pol-ece fie (ph).</span> <span id="s1057">What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: Browning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: Christopher Browning.</span> <span id="s1060">He has a whole chapter on that deportation day but I want to mix it in right now because I like to remember what I remember because this was all later.</span> <span id="s1061">We had no idea.</span> <span id="s1062">For many of us after the war, we didn’t know that they, where they were killed.</span> <span id="s1063">We found out this much, much later.</span> <span id="s1064">But there they were taken, that is where they were taken, they were taken to the extermination camp.</span> <span id="s1065">This was the first time that we knew, we didn’t know exactly, but some witnesses came back.</span> <span id="s1066">Some people escaped from the train and they were telling us.</span> <span id="s1067">These were gas chambers, but he didn’t know because he escaped.</span> <span id="s1068">This came, this was later and I’m trying very careful to disassociate these two sources of information, what we knew then and what we knew later.</span> <span id="s1069">But this is what swallowed my two brothers-in-law.</span> <span id="s1070">Menek’s father and Alex’s father, both young men, one was only 29, the other I believe was 32.</span> <span id="s1071">I always thought, how did they shove these young men into gas chambers, but they did.</span> <span id="s1072">We never saw them again.</span> <span id="s1073">My sister Frania was then, was very high, typhoid fever, and she kept the baby next to her body and he was not infected, nobody understands how this happened.</span> <span id="s1074">We were all starved, we were hungry.</span> <span id="s1075">After that ax-see-on (ph) the Germans arranged for us to have a soup kitchen.</span> <span id="s1076">It’s reviewed in the Reich.</span> <span id="s1077">There were still thousands of Jews left, they were still being brought in from the provincial towns.</span> <span id="s1078">There seemed always to be more Jews.</span> <span id="s1079">Later I found out that on that day 8,000 Jews were removed but there were more.</span> <span id="s1080">I think they wanted to appease us, they wanted to appease us by making sure we will not hide, that there is still some life going on.</span> <span id="s1081">And actually after every ax-see-on (ph) which, after this extreme tension, this extreme pain, this extreme depression, a depression hung over the ghetto for hours.</span> <span id="s1082">After that you somehow recovered.</span> <span id="s1083">You got up in the morning and looked out, it was quiet, you went back to whatever you were trying to do, a little cooking, whatever.</span> <span id="s1084">By then it was potato peels.</span> <span id="s1085">You went back to pray.</span> <span id="s1086">You went back to whatever work.</span> <span id="s1087">I worked in a factory where Blancka worked, in a tre-po-tosh (ph) factory, they were making uniforms for the German soldiers.</span> <span id="s1088">Going out of the ghetto was permitted with a special permission.</span> <span id="s1089">Each evening we have to come back.</span> <span id="s1090">Jews were still permitted to go out to these work places, they always had to come back.</span> <span id="s1091">After each raid, after each ax-see-on (ph) there were days that you couldn’t talk to each other.</span> <span id="s1092">You checked out who was still alive but then there was some normalcy.</span> <span id="s1093">Normalcy of life.</span> <span id="s1094">Amazing, but it was there.</span> <span id="s1095">People tried to go back.</span> <span id="s1096">I think the soup kitchen, which they introduced so late through the yood-en-rod (ph) was a way of appeasing us, of making sure we would not be afraid to leave our homes, which would make their work easier, but these are hindsight.</span> <span id="s1097">We didn’t know what happened then.</span> <span id="s1098">All we knew, the yood-en-rod (ph) asked my father, it was so important to make sure that everybody would get the right kind of portions, that soup, so they asked my father to supervise that soup kitchen, to stand to dish out that.</span> <span id="s1099">He was too weak by then, he just didn’t want the job.</span> <span id="s1100">His legs were swollen.</span> <span id="s1101">He asked them whether they would permit his youngest daughter to do it and they did and so it was my job.</span> <span id="s1102">This I’ll never forget again.</span> <span id="s1103">Originally to, they gave us some horse meat.</span> <span id="s1104">They made hamburgers of horse meat, they put in some horse meat in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1105">The women there were making this into hamburgers.</span> <span id="s1106">It took me a long time to get use to eating it.</span> <span id="s1107">But soup, and I remember the long, long lines of Jews.</span> <span id="s1108">Sometimes I would recognize relatives, sometimes recognize the teachers, sometimes I recognize the father of another student.</span> <span id="s1109">They didn’t look like human beings, the way they shuffled their feet, the way they asked and the pleading tone, ged-dak (ph), ged-dak (ph) means sick.</span> <span id="s1110">The soup was, had a little vegetables but it was watered, there was a little bit, a few beans, a few other vegetables and everybody wanted to ged-dak (ph).</span> <span id="s1111">It was my job to be fair about it and to make sure everybody would get their right amount of food.</span> <span id="s1112">This lasted perhaps two weeks.</span> <span id="s1113">One day, it was close to this slaughter house in which was a Jewish slaughter house in which chicken were always killed.</span> <span id="s1114">There was a scream and I figured what are the Germans bring, chicken, they are killing the chicken?</span> <span id="s1115">A few hours later they found they slaughtered in this slaughter house, they slaughtered our children.</span> <span id="s1116">This was the end of the supplication, this was the end of me, this was just the end of me.</span> <span id="s1117">I ran home.</span> <span id="s1118">Couldn’t talk.</span> <span id="s1119">I couldn’t tell anybody what I heard.</span> <span id="s1120">The rumor came later and everybody heard it.</span> <span id="s1121">This was the end of my soup kitchen standing, I think it was the end of the total soup kitchen.</span> <span id="s1122">The soup kitchen, the people stay with me, the people who looked like sukkotdows of their earlier selves.</span> <span id="s1123">These people who were begging, ged-dak (ph).</span> <span id="s1124">I wish they wouldn’t be forgotten.</span> <span id="s1125">This was the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1126">I would like for a break, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">End of Tape 1</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: Maria, when you came back from that horrendous experience, I mean, both the soup kitchen and then listening to the children, the people being slaughtered.</span> <span id="s1130">You said you came back and you didn’t, to the house, and you didn’t tell anyone.</span> <span id="s1131">How were you able to keep it inside and, or not show anything, or?</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: I remember, I threw myself on the bed.</span> <span id="s1133">We had a very small place, one room.</span> <span id="s1134">I threw myself on the bed and I sobbed and sobbed for hours.</span> <span id="s1135">And then I went, and then my husband came in and I think we began to talk, and then the news was all over.</span> <span id="s1136">The city knew by then, the ghetto, but immediately I just couldn’t put into words, I couldn’t talk, I didn’t, I didn’t realize the extent of it.</span> <span id="s1137">I remember it was chronological I’m not sure that I remember exactly when it happened, but sometime in 1942, all of these things were towards the end of 1942.</span> <span id="s1138">A woman came to our apartment, to this small apartment that my husband and I stayed, and I recall she fell on her knees pleading with him to give her something.</span> <span id="s1139">I cannot remember whether he did or didn’t, I didn’t understand what this was all about.</span> <span id="s1140">I found out later that she pleaded with him to give her cyanide for the child.</span> <span id="s1141">She’s alive, this woman is alive and I think the child is alive, somewhere in Australia.</span> <span id="s1142">This I heard many years later.</span> <span id="s1143">I’m trying to remember, she was from a _________ in Kolomyja, Mrs. Hermann, I remember.</span> <span id="s1144">Apparently the news came that the children would be taken away.</span> <span id="s1145">I think the full tragedy fell upon me at that point.</span> <span id="s1146">When I heard children, that they’re planning to remove the children, then I knew that this was the end and there really is no way of escaping, there’s no more talk about going to the Ukraine for work or anything.</span> <span id="s1147">That night, it was after that butchering, that night sort of brought the full awareness, the full confrontation with the truth as to what was happening.</span> <span id="s1148">By then, I think Blancka who worked in that factory at _____________ was Lydia, the Polish woman who was the manager of the factory, it was about that time that she came home saying that Lydia is ready to give her papers to run away.</span> <span id="s1149">I still didn’t understand the business of running away, I couldn’t understand any of it.</span> <span id="s1150">A day later she brought papers and she showed me, she had a ken-card-da (ph), she had something which showed that she was, the name was Bruen-flower Per-nash-ik (ph) and we encouraged her to go away although I wasn’t sure because at one point earlier one of my colleagues was trying to get through the ghetto wall and she was shot on the spot.</span> <span id="s1151">So there was a great deal of conflict that we were encouraging about, we already knew by then that things were going very, very bad.</span> <span id="s1152">She had lost all her family by then, so we thought, perhaps she should go.</span> <span id="s1153">She asked me that I should join, I wasn’t ready to do anything.</span> <span id="s1154">My husband started talking about it.</span> <span id="s1155">He was nearly everyday on the other side and somehow or other he began working toward my escape without my knowledge of it because I didn’t want to hear about it.</span> <span id="s1156">This was towards the end of 1942.</span> <span id="s1157">By then, we began to talk about it, that you need some hiding places outside of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1158">The number of the people was narrowing down very much, there were just a few thousand people left.</span> <span id="s1159">At it’s height, I think there were 30,000 Jews in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1160">So we knew that things are narrowing very much, but there was some peace.</span> <span id="s1161">They didn’t do anything for a while.</span> <span id="s1162">Somehow or other we started talking about perhaps we could get some hiding places on the outside.</span> <span id="s1163">We had a friend and a woman who was a customer in our store, not quite a customer, she was a Polish woman, a very fine lady who was poor.</span> <span id="s1164">So, when she established a relation, my father who would give her some of the dishes whatever for, a little money, during the ghetto days she occasionally smuggled some food for us.</span> <span id="s1165">Her name was Wein-a-rof-ska (ph), and her place was across from the house in which originally my sister Cyla and her husband lived.</span> <span id="s1166">Somehow or other, he was in touch with her.</span> <span id="s1167">I found out these things much later.</span> <span id="s1168">But he was also in touch with another couple.</span> <span id="s1169">Well, I’m jumping a little bit ahead of time here, but actually came December of 1942 when we began to talk seriously about it.</span> <span id="s1170">That I should be the ice breaker in a way, I should be the first one in the family to get out, to join Blancka, and then my sister and her child will come.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: How would you describe peoples relationships with each other as things are getting so terrible?</span> <span id="s1172">And you describe this soup kitchen almost like they’re ghosts walking towards you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: Families are different.</span> <span id="s1174">I’ve seen a lot of, it’s painful to talk about it because I saw in families, how people were grabbing the portion of food.</span> <span id="s1175">These were families like my own where we always kept passing the food, I’m not hungry.</span> <span id="s1176">Particularly my parents, we were this kind of family, close family, always passing the food to the next one, we’re not hungry.</span> <span id="s1177">But in some families, they were fighting for the bite of food.</span> <span id="s1178">The people looked liked ghost, they were, all of us were in this, in this area there was no food left.</span> <span id="s1179">I remember when we started cooking the potato chips, potato peels.</span> <span id="s1180">My mother cooked it in water, she added a little salt to it.</span> <span id="s1181">This was the lunch.</span> <span id="s1182">Lydia Wen-a-rof-ska (ph), this is the Polish woman who sometimes smuggled in, in some way she smuggled in a little flour, so the flour had to be stretched.</span> <span id="s1183">It was mixed with, sometimes you had only potatoes.</span> <span id="s1184">But the starvation was everywhere, definitely.</span> <span id="s1185">I recall, somewhere or other I was younger and I think this helped because my parents legs were very swollen, particularly my father, he couldn’t get into his shoes, he wore slippers my then.</span> <span id="s1186">I took a look at them at one point and I knew they could’nt’t stretch it because of the starvation.</span> <span id="s1187">But more than that, I was just worried that they will be shot.</span> <span id="s1188">Sometimes I saw these weak people in the house, they didn’t even bother to take them out, they shot them right there.</span> <span id="s1189">So it was at that time, but you want me to come back to Lydia, right?</span> <span id="s1190">To Lydia, I guess?</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: I want to ask you, was your father still praying, was he still religious in a certain way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: Yes, he was still praying.</span> <span id="s1193">Many of the orthodox Jews were still praying.</span> <span id="s1194">I hope he prayed when he was going to death, I hope so, because praying you know, somehow or other gets into another orbit.</span> <span id="s1195">I read about it later, that many of the Has-sid-ims (ph) they went into the fire while praying so they didn’t feel what was going on.</span> <span id="s1196">I suppose that some of these behaviors anesthetized them, I am not sure it happened to my father but, I wish it would.</span> <span id="s1197">They were, I’ll tell you in a minute how they were killed, and that horrible death, but anyway, working in that part, in the ta-kosh (ph) factory we came home every day but then there were days that we were not permitted to leave the ghetto anymore.</span> <span id="s1198">And when Blancka left, she somehow or other, she put something into the mind of my husband in particular, that there is a way out.</span> <span id="s1199">But whether he’d thought about it earlier I’m not sure, he didn’t sukkotre it with me.</span> <span id="s1200">By the way, he looked extremely non-Jewish while I looked Jewish.</span> <span id="s1201">I didn’t know I looked Jewish until I got to the other side, but he did and his Polish was perfect too, so he had some ideas at that point, I think.</span> <span id="s1202">He started talking about me and I didn’t want to hear about it.</span> <span id="s1203">Finally, the arrangement was that I would be the first one to go to meet Blancka, then my sister and her baby would come, and then he would arrange for my oldest sister and her son and my parents, he will arrange a hiding place outside of town, through the help of this Lydia Wen-a-rof-ska (ph), and then he will come.</span> <span id="s1204">And he got himself papers too.</span> <span id="s1205">I can’t remember the name, but he said he had papers.</span> <span id="s1206">He had, he brought in papers one day, sometime in December, he brought in papers with the name of Julianna Gol-ska (ph), he showed me, that’s me.</span> <span id="s1207">He told me he obtained it through the help of some non-Jewish family and this was authentic.</span> <span id="s1208">Actually a girl who looked like me, who had died, and he purchased the papers, who he got them through I still don’t know.</span> <span id="s1209">There was so little talk about it.</span> <span id="s1210">Perhaps he talked more and the fright on my part really obstructed my thinking about it, or my memory about it.</span> <span id="s1211">I recall, the only way, I still don’t know how I decided to go.</span> <span id="s1212">The only way, because he worked so skillfully on me, that he’ll join me in two weeks, he’ll come and meanwhile he had arranged all these things, and it seemed, he told me the idea thing, that I will be the path breaker, that I’ll be the one to lead the way and they will all survive this way.</span> <span id="s1213">Whether I really believed it, I wanted to believe it, I still don’t know.</span> <span id="s1214">It was a very hard decision but there was no time for decision.</span> <span id="s1215">Somehow or other they told me tomorrow, these people will pick you up in the morning at 6:00 in the morning.</span> <span id="s1216">It was Christmas, 1942, the people I personally didn’t know but my family did.</span> <span id="s1217">They were landowners, Polish landowners, sort of an aristocracy, who had business with my father.</span> <span id="s1218">My father use to give them these fine porcelain things and they remembered him and they wanted to do something for the family.</span> <span id="s1219">How we got hold of them, I still don’t know.</span> <span id="s1220">Perhaps my father talked to him, some of these things I wish I knew but I do not.</span> <span id="s1221">It was Christmas morning, he brought in the night before a krosh-ock (ph), a krosh-ock (ph) is a Ukrainian fur coat, which is a peasant coat, which is skin on the outside and lambs wool inside.</span> <span id="s1222">Very, you have it on the photos you see of Kolomyja, peasant girls always wore these things, it was warm.</span> <span id="s1223">I remember he buttoned me up.</span> <span id="s1224">I remember he put into this sleeve, he put into five dollars into the sleeve of this krosh-ock (ph) we called it, the coat.</span> <span id="s1225">I said good-bye to my family the night before, at 6:00 in the morning, Christmas morning, 1942, these people were waiting outside in a pair of sleighs with horses.</span> <span id="s1226">I wish I could remember details, all I know is I went through the wall, which was not very far, the wall of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1227">I saw a policeman walking back and forth, he didn’t see me.</span> <span id="s1228">I recall removing the white arm band and all I know, I was in their carriage and they passed on the Aryan side and the windows of my parents room was through the Aryan side and I saw silhouettes of my parents in the window behind curtains.</span> <span id="s1229">And I had the strange sense that I’ll never see them again.</span> <span id="s1230">Despite the promises my husband made.</span> <span id="s1231">And I remember how I tried totally to deny that feeling, to stop that feeling, to stop thinking about it and to concentrate on the ride, and I was sure that somebody will identify me, after all, people knew me in the town, I supposed so.</span> <span id="s1232">But I was with these Polish people twice my age, they brought me to the railway station.</span> <span id="s1233">The man went out, he bought me a ticket to Re-volf (ph), I got on the train and I remember very little about the train ride except that I arrived in Re-volf (ph) in the home of their niece or cousin, it was a Christmas party.</span> <span id="s1234">Exactly what I needed at that point, but I came there, I was introduced as their friend from Kolomyja and it was a lot of festivity going on, there was food on the table.</span> <span id="s1235">I tried to join and then in the evening I left.</span> <span id="s1236">I was suppose to come back to their home.</span> <span id="s1237">And suddenly I saw a middle-aged man following me.</span> <span id="s1238">I remember he was dressed in a very warm way, there was a sort of kerchief on his head, and he said, Madame, he said in Polish to me, Mrs. Nei-dat (ph), you are the wife of the __________ night of Kolomyja you look very cute, something of this sort, and I started running, and he ran after me.</span> <span id="s1239">It was a cold night of Christmas in Re-volf (ph) and I think my young, and I could hear his breath against me, and this must have been a scene of running, nobody else was in the streets, there was quite a bit of sleet, it was cold, Christmas night.</span> <span id="s1240">But I was young and I was a good runner and somehow or other, I still don’t believe how this happened, he couldn’t follow my steps.</span> <span id="s1241">And he stopped somewhere, I ran into a courtyard, then another courtyard, and I saw him again, and I could hear his breath and then everything stopped.</span> <span id="s1242">I never went back to these people.</span> <span id="s1243">But I had an address of, Blancka gave me some address on High-lit-ska (ph) Street and I went there and I made up a whole story and she wasn’t there, I hoped to meet her, and without her and being all alone, it was the first experience, all I wanted the next day was to go home, to go back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1244">And I got in touch with that friend who helped her, Ad-ja (ph) was his name, a German Jew originally who had come from Kolomyja and he was very well entrenched as a Pole, he looked like Polish nobility, and I let him know I was here, he came to see me.</span> <span id="s1245">We locked the door, and I told him, I don’t want to hear about anything, all he can do for me was to go to the station and buy me a ticket, I was afraid to run around the station, and all I want is to go back to Kolomyja.</span> <span id="s1246">The man saved my life in strange ways by talking to six hours, he literally out-talked me.</span> <span id="s1247">By then, I was totally, totally passive and totally listless.</span> <span id="s1248">I pleaded, all I want is to die with my people in the ghetto and no argument really made sense to me, I wanted to get to Kolomyja and I wanted to die with my people, and he kept saying that I’ll never get to my people, you will not be able to get into the ghetto, they will shoot me at the station, and nothing penetrated.</span> <span id="s1249">Perhaps it did and I didn’t want to hear it.</span> <span id="s1250">I remember that after six hours, I couldn’t hear anymore.</span> <span id="s1251">And he didn’t go to the railway station and I passed another day and he made up a whole story, he was my fiancee, he was somebody that was interested in me, and he will visit again.</span> <span id="s1252">And then later was very interested in him, he looked like Polish nobility, I was figuring there was some money too, I stayed another day and another day.</span> <span id="s1253">And I had a story, the story was that I came to study ___________, I take a __________ course.</span> <span id="s1254">So, the classes are not held every day and it’s pretty flexible.</span> <span id="s1255">Anyway, with the Czech she looked away, she didn’t know, I still don’t know.</span> <span id="s1256">We don’t know these things, but she kept me.</span> <span id="s1257">A few days later Blancka arrives.</span> <span id="s1258">Things fell through for her in Warsaw, she had only been to Warsaw, they caught ____________ into Warsaw, and there things broke.</span> <span id="s1259">So she came back here and we started a life together in that apartment, in that furnished room, and he would visit us and was, she always was a charismatic student and so on.</span> <span id="s1260">And one day, and this is after Christmas naturally, I had news from the ghetto, from Maria Roman-o-rof-ski (ph), through that woman who pushed food into the ghetto, and that everything was still the same, no change, they were still alive.</span> <span id="s1261">And one day, Blanca’s looking for work, everybody said I shouldn’t walk in the streets so easily, but then people were conscious I looked Jewish, I didn’t know, but Blancka looked Polish, so she went for a newspaper very early in the morning to see what the ________, what or where were jobs, to look for a job.</span> <span id="s1262">And she hears somebody, calls her Blancka, and she got very frightened naturally because by then her name was Broom-ka Ba-nat-chek (ph).</span> <span id="s1263">She took a look in the doorway, sits my sister with the baby and her sister-in-law and they look like chimney sweeps, all covered with ashes from the ghetto, from running away from the fires in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1264">She brought them upstairs to her room and the story came out.</span> <span id="s1265">The story came out that on the 2nd of February, which I always remember for other reasons too, this was the time that Stalingrad was taken over by the Soviets, this was the first German defeat and was a change in the war, I didn’t know then what, all I knew is that on the 2nd of February, the night of the 2nd of February, my parents and my older sister and Menek were sitting in another part of the ghetto by then, in their room, all dressed.</span> <span id="s1266">For days they expected, they expected the SS or the Germans to come and take them.</span> <span id="s1267">There was no way out by then, it was a very cold night.</span> <span id="s1268">And Menek told me years later that somebody came in from the neighbor’s to tell about Stalingrad and that my father’s spirit was lifted, and I’m so grateful for that moment, that his spirit was lifted.</span> <span id="s1269">But it was 2 o’clock in the morning or so, they came, and they took all out of them, they took them out.</span> <span id="s1270">I found out later that they women were separated, my mother and my sister, her daughter and her distant cousin, a young girl, _______________, Tou-chie (ph) was her name, they were separated and the men, my father and his grandson, Menek, were taken separate.</span> <span id="s1271">And hungry they were, they were ill, they were not dressed well, it was terribly cold, sleet in the night, in the middle of the night, they dragged them through the streets of Kolomyja, they dragged them to Chap-a-rot-ska (ph) to be killed there.</span> <span id="s1272">Frania, who lived in another part of the ghetto, but then her husband had been taken away, she was with the child and she was with her sister and her husband’s sister-in-law, this woman left her baby in the ghetto, she ran without the baby.</span> <span id="s1273">She and my sister and Alex Schlessing, Alex’s name was Elee-ow (ph) then, they ran through the fire.</span> <span id="s1274">The ghetto was set on fire, they ran through the fire and half burned all, all covered with ashes, they found themselves at a neighboring railway station, they bought tickets and came to Re-volf (ph).</span> <span id="s1275">And they didn’t know where to go, they didn’t have an address or anything, so they saw one light, lit up, so they went into that building to find out about a hotel and the building was the criminal polizer, the police, the German police, nothing but.</span> <span id="s1276">Somebody prayed for them.</span> <span id="s1277">They said, there are no hotels, they walked out.</span> <span id="s1278">And they sat in a doorway and that is where Blancka met them and she found them.</span> <span id="s1279">My sister told us of the terrible details, that the parents were separated, and what happened to her and that they could hear the shots.</span> <span id="s1280">And she thinks, she thought perhaps Menek escaped, she wasn’t sure.</span> <span id="s1281">Nobody knew.</span> <span id="s1282">All I remember, this was late afternoon, listening to the story, all I recall was that all I hoped for was that the floor would open up and I will disappear.</span> <span id="s1283">I didn’t want to live.</span> <span id="s1284">She didn’t know enough about my husband, he was separated from my father and Menek.</span> <span id="s1285">She thought she heard something, that he was taken to prison, that they were beating him, she wasn’t sure, nobody knew.</span> <span id="s1286">I still don’t know.</span> <span id="s1287">Apparently, they either killed him in prison or took him to Chap-a-rof-sa (ph).</span> <span id="s1288">That was the night, the last night after that, no Jew was left in Kolomyja.</span> <span id="s1289">My nephew, Menek, wrote up about that night.</span> <span id="s1290">I recall that I couldn’t stand just being alive.</span> <span id="s1291">I stretched on that floor, Frania too, and I wanted nothing but for the floor to open and the floor didn’t open, that hard floor was there.</span> <span id="s1292">I couldn’t even cry.</span> <span id="s1293">I couldn’t take it in in any way.</span> <span id="s1294">Except Blancka woke me from that stupor I think sometime later saying that the landlady wants to bring us some tea.</span> <span id="s1295">And this meant we had to get up, wash up, and look pretty.</span> <span id="s1296">And I recall looking at the mirror and putting on lipstick and not believing it’s me.</span> <span id="s1297">She brought in tea.</span> <span id="s1298">We had to make arrangements for my sister’s place, they slept over that night, we made up a cock-eyed story and later we tried to find a place for them.</span> <span id="s1299">They found other people from my home town, other women, the men were all killed by then.</span> <span id="s1300">And the story of many came out much later.</span> <span id="s1301">What happened to him is a really fantastic story.</span> <span id="s1302">He was together with my father, being marched from that horrible night, and there was shooting and the dogs were barking and the dogs were biting some people.</span> <span id="s1303">And he was blaming my father in a way, saying, I told you we should have run away earlier, we should have gone to the place, whatever, and my father said to him, something from the Talmud, he said, the Talmud says if the sword is around your neck, a miracle may happen.</span> <span id="s1304">He was then 15 or 16 years old, he interpreted this as a sign from his grandfather he should run away, so he ran away.</span> <span id="s1305">For years he was trying to get hold of that quotation, found out about it rather recently, but he ran away and the people were being marched, they were marched to Sukkotp-a-rot-ska (ph).</span> <span id="s1306">By then it was early morning and the neighbors could look out and some saw the Jews.</span> <span id="s1307">And he was wounded in his leg, a shot came to, a bullet got into his leg.</span> <span id="s1308">He fell on snow and ice.</span> <span id="s1309">A Ukrainian policeman stepped over him and said to the Germans very stoically, he’s dead.</span> <span id="s1310">And as that colonnade of people marched and marched for hours, he was lying there, then he felt himself alive, just bleeding, so he crouched, he approached a house he knew in the ghetto where he had worked somewhere and he saw a baby in the fireplace.</span> <span id="s1311">This is a story he told me about five years ago, he couldn’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s1312">And he didn’t know whether the parents who ran, left the baby, hid the baby there because apparently there was no fire before, or whether the Ukrainians or Germans put the baby into the fireplace and set the fireplace afire.</span> <span id="s1313">This he kept secret.</span> <span id="s1314">Somehow or other, he jumped from that place because he heard the SS marching, and the Ukrainians, he jumped in the attic to another place.</span> <span id="s1315">He was jumping most of the time, he heard the shots and through _____________ in that snow he got outside of the ghetto to the house of the Polish woman, Bron-ra-off-ska (ph), who use to live across the street from their home and who use to take care of the plants of the flower plants of my sister-in-law when my sister went on vacation.</span> <span id="s1316">This Polish woman was poor and she supported herself by renting rooms to Ukrainian gymnasium students.</span> <span id="s1317">So she had a husband and she had two students who lived there because they went to the gymnasium and they paid her something, that’s how she lived.</span> <span id="s1318">Very early morning, he appeared at the door of this woman.</span> <span id="s1319">I’m sure he looked more animal than human, and he heard the shots going on the Chap-a-rot-ska (ph), he knew this was his mother, he knew this was his grandparents, and he pleaded with the woman to let him in for the night, he was bleeding.</span> <span id="s1320">And she said she can’t, she’s afraid because the Ukrainian students were there.</span> <span id="s1321">Somehow or other, I think, out of pity for this child-animal, she let him in for one night.</span> <span id="s1322">She put him in the barn.</span> <span id="s1323">Next morning she came to take him out and she was one who my father helped occasionally with some of the dishes to give her for a little money, I don’t know what moved her, she didn’t have the heart to take him out.</span> <span id="s1324">She left him, she covered him with straw and under straw he lived there for about six or seven months.</span> <span id="s1325">She kept him there.</span> <span id="s1326">She lived with great danger, her husband she apparently let on many months later.</span> <span id="s1327">The Ukrainian students never knew about it.</span> <span id="s1328">Every night she would smuggle a little food downstairs.</span> <span id="s1329">He was immobilized, he didn’t move, it was _________ then.</span> <span id="s1330">One day, he remembers, it was Spring by then.</span> <span id="s1331">Well, that night, he says, all he kept thinking, which of these bullets killed his mother and his grandfather and his grandmother because that’s all he could hear, all night and all day the shooting was going on.</span> <span id="s1332">This was the last of the Kolomyja Jews and he remembers that all he was, felt guilty that he wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s1333">But he was covered in snow, by straw.</span> <span id="s1334">And one day, toward the Spring in March, he saw the snow coming down the windows so it was a little light.</span> <span id="s1335">Until then, he didn’t see any daylight because snow and ice covered the windows.</span> <span id="s1336">And he looked around and he saw some books.</span> <span id="s1337">These Ukrainian students apparently when graduating they threw the books into the basement.</span> <span id="s1338">One of the books he took was a chemistry book.</span> <span id="s1339">He started reading.</span> <span id="s1340">That is why he’s one of the foremost bio-chemist.</span> <span id="s1341">He’s the one who is the developer of the ______________, __________, Menek Goldstein.</span> <span id="s1342">This was the beginning of it, the chemistry book.</span> <span id="s1343">He lived hungry there because very little food she could afford to give him, she was afraid, every night would bring down a little bit, he was a growing boy.</span> <span id="s1344">And he lived in extreme terror of discovery, always afraid of the Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s1345">And one day, the woman comes in, she says, there is a denouncement, somebody denounced that she’s harboring a Jew, he has to disappear.</span> <span id="s1346">That night, it was Spring of 1944, that he had to leave the basement, the shed.</span> <span id="s1347">And he remembered that Selik (ph), my husband’s brother, had told him some time ago that he and some others would have a hiding place.</span> <span id="s1348">In the middle of the night he ran to that hiding place, they didn’t want to let him in.</span> <span id="s1349">They didn’t want another person, they were afraid.</span> <span id="s1350">But my brother-in-law insisted, he had a gun with him because he was a policeman, so they let him in.</span> <span id="s1351">So he was liberated there by the Soviets.</span> <span id="s1352">When the Soviets came he couldn’t walk so they carried him.</span> <span id="s1353">The Soviet soldiers carried him on their arms to the _____________, to the municipality to show what happened.</span> <span id="s1354">Later on, is a long story.</span> <span id="s1355">But, there’s the story of Menek.</span> <span id="s1356">Later on still begins a long story, but that’s one of, this is how Menek survived and how he depicted it in his statement about the last night in Kolomyja.</span> <span id="s1357">And us he told little details each time, each time we commemorate in a quiet way.</span> <span id="s1358">My sister, Menek and I, we commemorate February 2nd.</span> <span id="s1359">We don’t have any celebration, we don’t do anything much, but we don’t go to cinemas and we don’t do any entertainment, we have dinner together and we sit down and over the years always some detail comes out.</span> <span id="s1360">Some of these details just came out within a few years.</span> <span id="s1361">He couldn’t talk about that baby, he couldn’t talk about some of the things.</span> <span id="s1362">But that book of chemistry had such an influence.</span> <span id="s1363">It’s a long story about Menek, another time perhaps.</span> <span id="s1364">So I worked because I wanted to make sure that the story of the last day in the ghetto, my parents horrible deaths, how they dragged them in that terrible, on ice, how they were falling around and I hoped they never reached that ______________, that they died on the road, but I’ll never know.</span> <span id="s1365">They were separated, men and women.</span> <span id="s1366">Can you imagine what happened to my father all alone.</span> <span id="s1367">Menek ran away, he didn’t know Menek would survive to tell this story but he did.</span> <span id="s1368">So, this was the end of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1369">I knew these details from my sister in that house, that evening, and I said, we have to get up because this lady decided to give us tea, we have to make up and look human.</span> <span id="s1370">Then we found a place for her and then started all kinds of troubles because somebody told her that she is harboring Jews and had to run away from the place.</span> <span id="s1371">Anyway, it was, one day I walked with my sister and her child, and she was in grave danger because the boy was circumcised and with two of her friends, women friends from the ghetto, and their children.</span> <span id="s1372">And we were looking for the place for them to live because they were denounced by then.</span> <span id="s1373">My sister had some diamonds sewn into the buttons of her sweater, she never removed the sweater.</span> <span id="s1374">Each time things happened, she sold the diamonds somehow or other.</span> <span id="s1375">Kept all of us, Blancka and me alive too.</span> <span id="s1376">At one point, I needed new documents and the diamonds bought it.</span> <span id="s1377">We need an apartment and the diamonds bought it.</span> <span id="s1378">We were looking for something and I notice a girl who looks at me very much, it was a former student from my home, a Ukrainian girl.</span> <span id="s1379">And before I know, I notice that she is bringing over a Ukrainian policeman.</span> <span id="s1380">It was very dangerous and I motioned to Branch and to the other women, it’s not good, we have to do something, we have to disappear, but how do we disappear?</span> <span id="s1381">He’s looking at us.</span> <span id="s1382">So we decided to disappear in the next store, which was a millenary store, selling hats.</span> <span id="s1383">This is 6 o’clock in the evening and we try on every hat in the store hoping that this man will disappear.</span> <span id="s1384">Well, sitting there and trying on hats is exactly what we need at that point, he did not disappear.</span> <span id="s1385">The store closed, we had to move.</span> <span id="s1386">He did approach us, in very quiet words, voice, not to make any noise, he said, come with me, I know your Jewisses.</span> <span id="s1387">He started marching us out, what helped us most was it was dark.</span> <span id="s1388">The darkness helped all of us at that point.</span> <span id="s1389">And he took us somewhere in an isolated area, he had a revolver with him and he said, I’m going to shoot you.</span> <span id="s1390">So we started pleading.</span> <span id="s1391">I started pleading with him that he shouldn’t shoot my sister, if he has to shoot someone, me, because she had a baby, she had a child.</span> <span id="s1392">Anyway, he decided not to shoot but to take everything we had.</span> <span id="s1393">Rings, jewelry, whatever we had, there were five women of us.</span> <span id="s1394">He got everything.</span> <span id="s1395">He even took my coat.</span> <span id="s1396">We couldn’t go back to that place were we lived anymore, we had to find new places.</span> <span id="s1397">This was continuous when they caught us, we had to.</span> <span id="s1398">Finally we got a place, things quieted down a little bit.</span> <span id="s1399">It was a better time.</span> <span id="s1400">Blancka and I got jobs in a German hospital.</span> <span id="s1401">This was a hospital for the treatment of returned soldiers from the front.</span> <span id="s1402">They had frost bite, they were sick, they had wounds, so Blancka became their scrub woman and I was assigned to the apothotacary (ph) which was very good for me because I knew something and I was handy about things, but I never disclosed that I knew German or anything so I was dumb.</span> <span id="s1403">It was quite a period in our lives except we sukkotred a room somewhere, a furnished room, and I developed a terrible pain in my feet.</span> <span id="s1404">I couldn’t walk, I couldn’t walk to the toilet.</span> <span id="s1405">And the question was, what do I do, how does one go to a doctor?</span> <span id="s1406">Finally things are so bad that they decided I have to go to a doctor.</span> <span id="s1407">It was Polish doctor and he said, I have flat feet.</span> <span id="s1408">Which I got because I was so swollen, I ate only potatoes, breads, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s1409">And I swell up to such an extent, I weigh so much more __________.</span> <span id="s1410">Anyway, he put me into some shoes which I wore through the rest of the war.</span> <span id="s1411">It helped immensely.</span> <span id="s1412">And things were pretty smooth at one point.</span> <span id="s1413">Frania was also set up somewhere and one day, in that apothecary, the Ukrainian girl walks in.</span> <span id="s1414">She must have followed me or whatever.</span> <span id="s1415">And she knew Stodge (ph), the chief of the Upper Taker (ph) German men in uniforms in the military hospital.</span> <span id="s1416">And she says, I know from _________ that she’s Jewish.</span> <span id="s1417">And he paled, I could see the blood was running down his face and immediately he reaches out for the telephone, I assume to call the military police, and I jumped through the window, it was a ground floor.</span> <span id="s1418">I don’t know, I don’t know how I did it, I did it!</span> <span id="s1419">How did I walk out of the ghetto, I jumped through, how did I did it, I don’t know?</span> <span id="s1420">And I run into Blanca’s other, to her and I say, let’s escape, and we run away, told our story, couldn’t get back anymore because we knew that we would be denounced.</span> <span id="s1421">We found out hours later, we find posters with our names and also in it they said Jewish Women and they masquerade for, they’re trying to fool the German government, and so much money is offered for our capture and so on.</span> <span id="s1422">We sat in doorways, Ed-au (ph), somehow it involved Ed-au (ph), he was with us, he helped.</span> <span id="s1423">He got us tickets at night we went to the railway station, we got tickets to go to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1424">I never knew anything in Warsaw, I knew nobody.</span> <span id="s1425">Blancka had been at Warsaw, she knew the city.</span> <span id="s1426">On the train people were talking about soap being made of Jews, we don’t understand what they’re talking about, we had no idea about these things.</span> <span id="s1427">I had a strange, weird feeling but I never understood what they talk was about.</span> <span id="s1428">Jewish muscles are being turned into soap.</span> <span id="s1429">Some primitive, very under-educated women sitting in the train with us.</span> <span id="s1430">We, our arrival, who I thought was a night train, the night train was the best things because it was dark, we arrive in Warsaw, and to just try to get through the railway station to a tram, and suddenly I feel two hands on my shoulders and I see two hands on Blanca’s shoulders.</span> <span id="s1431">These are Polish Secret Agents, they introduce themselves, they’re secret agents and in a very polite way, apol-solum pan-ya (ph) which means, would you kindly follow me.</span> <span id="s1432">We followed them right across the railway station, we see criminal polic-eye (ph), the police!</span> <span id="s1433">There were all kinds of polic-eye (ph), there was criminal police, there was shoo-pol (ph), there was Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1434">This is Good Friday, 1943.</span> <span id="s1435">We come to that station, there’s a lot of people there.</span> <span id="s1436">And they bring in men and we see the flames over the ghetto and to hear the ghetto is fighting.</span> <span id="s1437">The ghettos being burned, we don’t hear about the fights, being burned and the Jews, they are escaping.</span> <span id="s1438">And we see men being brought in and separated from us immediately, brought to another room, we don’t see them ever coming back.</span> <span id="s1439">Apparently because they are mounted to trucks or cars and ships and somebody immediately.</span> <span id="s1440">And they try to examine us.</span> <span id="s1441">They say we are Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1442">Blancka has a document, I have a document.</span> <span id="s1443">Where are you going?</span> <span id="s1444">Where are you from?</span> <span id="s1445">All kinds of lies, so they don’t believe us, and I say, let __________ call ____________ you’ll find out about us.</span> <span id="s1446">But there were no telephone arranged to make these calls, or they couldn’t get us, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s1447">A police comes in.</span> <span id="s1448">Blancka suddenly disappears.</span> <span id="s1449">I have no, where she goes.</span> <span id="s1450">I am alone.</span> <span id="s1451">A priest comes in and he starts examining me, in the catechism, it so happened that I studied it during those months.</span> <span id="s1452">And he says, I pass.</span> <span id="s1453">One question he asked, which I didn’t know, I later asked many Poles about it, even after the war, very few of them knew.</span> <span id="s1454">I forgot the name of it, _______________, if you give birth to a baby, viv-ia (ph) it’s called, the priest, you're not quite clean.</span> <span id="s1455">The priest has to come out of the church and with his belt he has to bring you in.</span> <span id="s1456">So, very few Poles know it, very few good Catholics know it.</span> <span id="s1457">Anyway, he asked that question which I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1458">The rest, I knew everything very well, and I stuck to my guns.</span> <span id="s1459">My grandparents name is this and my parents name is that and I live on that street, and so on.</span> <span id="s1460">I just told them believe me.</span> <span id="s1461">Blancka disappeared and I don’t see her anymore.</span> <span id="s1462">The documents we had to leave right there, if you had documents they’re not on the desk anymore, my documents are there.</span> <span id="s1463">My ken-carp (ph), my passport, my money is there.</span> <span id="s1464">Towards the evening, and I hear some noises and I see the flames of the ghetto, and they talk about it.</span> <span id="s1465">Says the ghetto is being burned, flames over the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1466">Towards the evening, one of the Polish policeman, his name is Stau-ck (ph), and he interrogated me a lot, he says, come with me.</span> <span id="s1467">I’m going to mail a letter.</span> <span id="s1468">He takes me to the railway station, he mails a letter, no, he takes me to the post office right across the railway station and he disappears.</span> <span id="s1469">And here am I alone, in the street, probably the most dangerous place in the world for any person, right across the railway station.</span> <span id="s1470">With the ghetto flames coming right our way, there was a sewer next to me.</span> <span id="s1471">I see many Polish and Ukrainians, no, Polish and Germans, right there watching the sewers and the top of the sewer comes off and Jews from the ghetto trying to escape and they’re being shot on the spot or taken away.</span> <span id="s1472">And my instinct is to run away but I don’t have a document, I don’t know the city, I don’t have a penny and whether I felt I was at the end of the rope, I do not know.</span> <span id="s1473">I am totally immobilized.</span> <span id="s1474">I wait for this man.</span> <span id="s1475">I didn’t care, I knew escaping I would be caught immediately, I would be shot right because the people from the sewers were bring shot right there.</span> <span id="s1476">And I stand there in that place, which is so unbelievable for me, that I’m standing there and waiting for my death.</span> <span id="s1477">And he comes out, the policeman, Stau-ck (ph), and he says, come with me.</span> <span id="s1478">He takes me back to the police station and he says, you prove to me you're not Jewish, you would have run away.</span> <span id="s1479">He returns to me the documents and the money, what little money I had, and he says to me, come with me.</span> <span id="s1480">He puts me in the car, he goes with me, he says, you have no place to stay I will get you a place to stay overnight.</span> <span id="s1481">I figure he probably is putting me at a place where I’ll be denounced or whatever.</span> <span id="s1482">He brings me there, it is right at the border of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1483">He opens the door, the landlady opens the door and she opens another door, it was French doors I remember, and there sits Blancka.</span> <span id="s1484">He re-united us until today’s day, we don’t know who this man is.</span> <span id="s1485">He came back next day, he told Blancka that I look Jewish, no, he didn’t say Jewish, he says, it’s better if you try to get out, let her stay home and it will stop something, the message was that I looked Jewish.</span> <span id="s1486">We later wondered, we still don’t know, that perhaps he was with the Polish underground, I wish I knew.</span> <span id="s1487">Certain things I so wish I knew.</span> <span id="s1488">I stayed there.</span> <span id="s1489">The screams from the ghetto were coming out, all night.</span> <span id="s1490">The trucks were being loaded with people and there was shooting going right there and the flames were very close.</span> <span id="s1491">I don’t know why he brought us there, perhaps he felt this was safe place, perhaps these were safe homes that they had for the underground, I say, this all comes from later reading.</span> <span id="s1492">I don’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s1493">He came back a few times, he told Blancka to go to the are-bites-aumph (ph) and look for a job and indeed, one day, she found a job through the are-bites-aumph (ph) and she became a maid, a cook in a German household.</span> <span id="s1494">The people’s name was Kinsel (ph).</span> <span id="s1495">The man was the chief representative of taxation for all of the government.</span> <span id="s1496">There were twenty people working for him, they all were CPA’s or accountants.</span> <span id="s1497">Blancka was cooking lunch for them and one day she tells me she needs help, she cannot do so much, so they say go and look for help, she says she has somebody she knows, she brings me and they have this scene in the book, I think.</span> <span id="s1498">I played the role beautifully of being a real maid from the worst parts of the city where I cannot speak any German, my mother is a laundress from that, I’m use to violence, I’m use to, I look a little bit like a whore, they said, when they interviewed me.</span> <span id="s1499">I didn’t understand what in German, I had to, ask Blancka put it, the translation.</span> <span id="s1500">And they look at me and they say, they’re not sure I belong here, I look like a whore, I look like a thief.</span> <span id="s1501">And with this background ___________, so Blancka says perhaps she’ll try out for a few days.</span> <span id="s1502">Anyway, when I came back to the kitchen we started laughing in unbelievable ways.</span> <span id="s1503">And since then, I was there to clean the rooms and she was my supervisor, she had a better job, she was the hausfrau, you know, she was the cook and she was the house maid, _____________.</span> <span id="s1504">The trouble was when they wanted to send me to buy something, I was afraid to walk in the street.</span> <span id="s1505">So, I would walk in the streets like this, with my nose up, because my nose was a give-away.</span> <span id="s1506">I had fantasies of getting plastic surgery on my nose but first I didn’t have a penny to do it and then I was afraid of these doctors.</span> <span id="s1507">So I didn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1508">But the nose was a give-away.</span> <span id="s1509">Polish girls in Warsaw look very different, broad cheeks, blonde, we may look different now but in those days, you could see a Slavonic face.</span> <span id="s1510">And besides, there were people just seeming to do nothing but looking at you to see whether they can catch a Jew.</span> <span id="s1511">I remember a child once attacking me, saying I’m Jewish and I opened my big mouth and I said, I’m going to call the police, you know, I threatened him.</span> <span id="s1512">This happened to me a few times, whenever I was accused of something, I would open a big mouth, but I was in danger all of the time.</span> <span id="s1513">We lived with these people in a very good neighborhood because the Germans occupied the best part of town.</span> <span id="s1514">We had a room to ourselves and they would travel very often to Germany, they had a baby.</span> <span id="s1515">And for us these were the best days, when they went away because we could invite some people, we found people like Lod-joy (ph) and High-lin-ka (ph) and Boil-it (ph), we found the underground.</span> <span id="s1516">I recall distinctly the day when I found out there was an underground.</span> <span id="s1517">This was one of the great days in my life.</span> <span id="s1518">My depression, my sense of extreme terror, lifted.</span> <span id="s1519">I knew if I’m going to die, I’m going to die in some way knowing that Germans are being killed.</span> <span id="s1520">There is a resistance movement.</span> <span id="s1521">It was a fantastic experience.</span> <span id="s1522">Until then, I didn’t know about any resistance.</span> <span id="s1523">They were the first ones to introduce me to it.</span> <span id="s1524">There’s the Polish resistance and Jewish resistance fighters and they’re actually attacking Germans.</span> <span id="s1525">To be connected with this was, lifted me up in ways that I didn’t know until that was possible.</span> <span id="s1526">I wasn’t afraid because I was not afraid of dying.</span> <span id="s1527">So many times that I wanted to die, I think that dying, it is the way to die, I was afraid of the way in which they’ll kill me.</span> <span id="s1528">If I’m detected as a Jew, there are particular kinds of brutalities against people who cheated the German government, these are the German SS.</span> <span id="s1529">So they had horrible ways of killing you and this is what I wanted to avoid.</span> <span id="s1530">But to be dead, it really did not matter.</span> <span id="s1531">At no time did I believe I would survive, at no time did I believe this was possible.</span> <span id="s1532">We didn’t see the end of the war yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">Q: Let me ask you a somewhat frivolous question perhaps.</span> <span id="s1534">Did you rehearse being this maid before you walked into the Kensel (ph) house?</span> <span id="s1535">Who was this character?</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">A: I rehearsed to some extent, I can’t remember that I rehearsed.</span> <span id="s1537">I was prepared in a way, that I’ll wear a, what do you call it, a dish towel around my body.</span> <span id="s1538">That I’ll speak that Polish slang.</span> <span id="s1539">I knew about enough Polish, although I didn’t think they will know the difference, really, but that I will be looking down at them with some sort of suspicion.</span> <span id="s1540">That I will take the job that fits me or I will not be interested, the job may be too heavy, I’ll see.</span> <span id="s1541">That I come from Mok-ul-tof (ph), Mok-ul-tof (ph) was a place, was a suburb which was working people with a lot of crime in it and prostitution and open bars and so on.</span> <span id="s1542">And that my mother is a washer woman there.</span> <span id="s1543">And this gave them, Blancka translated it all, and then they sent me out and then they called in Blancka saying that they’re not sure that they, that I belong, really.</span> <span id="s1544">This is background, I look a little like a thief, that I may steal.</span> <span id="s1545">And there was a guest of theirs there, no, she looks more like a prostitute.</span> <span id="s1546">So Blancka says she didn’t know, but she’ll hire me for a few days, see what happens.</span> <span id="s1547">And then there were twenty people working for this company, some of them were Jewish we found out later.</span> <span id="s1548">They were the CPA’s and the accountants.</span> <span id="s1549">And work, being sent on errands was a death sentence to me because I knew I’ll never come back, but they sent me to buy this and buy that.</span> <span id="s1550">And these kids in the street, saying Jud-ifka (ph), looking at me saying Jud-ifka (ph), the Jewiss.</span> <span id="s1551">How these kids knew immediately, it is in the blood stream.</span> <span id="s1552">When people are trained for generations to identify enemy people they know.</span> <span id="s1553">Same, I am sure it was here, with whites and blacks for centuries.</span> <span id="s1554">So every kid in the street identified me that easily.</span> <span id="s1555">And whenever I came home safe, it was a miracle.</span> <span id="s1556">Our greatest enemies were the people who, nos-trouch (ph), trouch (ph) is like a door man, but actually like a concierge, but lesser in status.</span> <span id="s1557">They were saying we had to register and he was on the out look for Jews because finding these Jews, there was money.</span> <span id="s1558">So there were always some stories, that the Jew was caught and there were always posters in the streets, they will offer $50, $100, whatever it is, if they would find the Jew.</span> <span id="s1559">So there was a searching for Jews going on continually.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">Q: There was a word that was used for these posters?</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">A: Sch-mol-siv-a-nik (ph).</span> <span id="s1562">Sch-mol (ph) means fat.</span> <span id="s1563">They assumed that people would live off the fat.</span> <span id="s1564">And they’re job, and there were too many of them, terribly many, might have happened in other countries too but in Warsaw it was a gang of Sch-mol-siv-a-nik’s (ph).</span> <span id="s1565">Some of them might have been rich, some poor, some just hated Jews, some just wanted the money, whatever it was, they’re job was to find a Jew and to extort money from him.</span> <span id="s1566">Sometimes they delivered you later to the police station but sometimes they let you go.</span> <span id="s1567">Sometimes they took your documents in addition to the money.</span> <span id="s1568">But Sch-mol-siv-a-nik (ph) was a profession at that point.</span> <span id="s1569">They stood in the streets of Warsaw and they observed you and they approached you.</span> <span id="s1570">Once on a tram, I saw a man looking very suspiciously at me.</span> <span id="s1571">And I jumped and I broke my nose and I bled in the street and the tram went further.</span> <span id="s1572">And Blancka later came out on the stop and she found me lying in the street bleeding, went to a pharmacy, I broke my nose.</span> <span id="s1573">We couldn’t go to a doctor, you were afraid.</span> <span id="s1574">You were afraid of those Polish doctors too, and rightly so.</span> <span id="s1575">I recovered, and then the same happened over and over again.</span> <span id="s1576">Stel-ma Hov-en-jev-ens (ph), the book about the story about Stel-ma Hovich (ph), his brother by the way just published a fantastic memoir on the Holocaust, not to be missed.</span> <span id="s1577">I’ll give you later the full title of it, I spoke to him on the telephone.</span> <span id="s1578">Stel-ma Hovich (ph) survived to become a big shot in Soviet occupied Poland as a chief bookkeeper for the government.</span> <span id="s1579">He met my sister, he told her that I might be alive, he wasn’t sure.</span> <span id="s1580">That from that house people were taken to Germany, he wasn’t sure.</span> <span id="s1581">He later found his brother, the brother that has that fantastic story about he and his brother ran away from Treblinka.</span> <span id="s1582">He later joined his brother in Italy.</span> <span id="s1583">A woman with whom he was involved rejected him, that was how the story goes, he came to Italy.</span> <span id="s1584">He was depressed, he committed suicide.</span> <span id="s1585">That was Stel-ma Hovich (ph), you ought to read the book, it’s a fantastic memoir.</span> <span id="s1586">But this was one later of how other people working in this place were Jewish, Blancka recognized someone from her home town.</span> <span id="s1587">They were all afraid of me because I masqueraded as a main of the worst background, worth Polish background, they were afraid of me.</span> <span id="s1588">But she told Stel-ma Hovich (ph) and a certain, years later, but anyway.</span> <span id="s1589">So to move from it, one day, a man that I had seen in Germany, and Blancka made very good strudels, oh, there is something?</span> <span id="s1590">To stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">Q: No, we have a few more minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">A: That’s all we have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">Q: Five more minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">A: For the rest of my story?</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1596">Just the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A: Oh, good, fine.</span> <span id="s1598">This man like her strudel and he offered to take her to Heidelburg to be a maid for his family.</span> <span id="s1599">Blancka decided to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">Q: Let me go back to something and maybe we’ll be able to stop the tape.</span> <span id="s1601">I want to ask you about how you met people in the resistance, how you met Voler (ph) and others?</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s1603">There was somebody in our house who was always under, always live under disguise.</span> <span id="s1604">I forgot her name now, but she introduced us to Hele-inka (ph) and Bowl-ick (ph) and they loved our place because it was a safe place in a German neighborhood, German people living in it, so occasionally they would come up.</span> <span id="s1605">Particularly when the people for whom we worked were in Germany and the place was closed.</span> <span id="s1606">On a Sunday, they would come up and they would teach us to sing partisan songs, from the Bont (ph), I couldn’t believe it, the whole thing!</span> <span id="s1607">I say this was the happiest days in my life during the Holocaust because I felt, I didn’t feel the fear, I didn’t feel the fear at all, I just felt the sense of resistance.</span> <span id="s1608">And I think if I’m not mistaken, Blancka once brought some documents for children because it was such a safe place, so we had ____________ all of the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">Q: So this is Latka-mead (ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">A: Latka-mead (ph), I think she brought some documents for children into our old room but I’m not sure, at this point Bowl-ick (ph) and Hele-inka (ph) were very much a part of our lives and Henrich (ph), he died later.</span> <span id="s1611">There was another man who wrote the beautiful memoir of ___________, Bear Witness, Bernard (ph).</span> <span id="s1612">He too was involved in some way.</span> <span id="s1613">So it was like I knew life, an unbelievable kind of new life where we felt even if we died there was a resistance.</span> <span id="s1614">The Germans are losing.</span> <span id="s1615">So Sunday afternoon, occasionally, these people were away, they would come and we would listen to the in British radio, which was certainly not permitted.</span> <span id="s1616">And we would sing these songs and one day, against our expectations, these people, the Germans, come back earlier from a weekend.</span> <span id="s1617">They use to go to Berlin, come back earlier for a weekend and here is this group, we are singing and they’re listening to the British radio.</span> <span id="s1618">Well, that fright was unbelievable, but they walked in.</span> <span id="s1619">We hid these people under our beds, we finally got them out, it wasn’t so simple.</span> <span id="s1620">We had many such occasions where we smuggled people in and then we had to offer them under the bed to a hiding place, and then to smuggle out through the door, all of these things were extremely anxiety provoking.</span> <span id="s1621">Scenarios, but they were a part of our life at that point.</span> <span id="s1622">Until the man came saying he was taking Blancka to Germany if she wants to go and she registered for a trip, the separation was very difficult for us.</span> <span id="s1623">I remember, we went to Bowl-ick’s (ph) home for a sort of a party, a get away party, and when I walked out of the party I was drunk and I kept saying in the tram, I’m Jewish, that’s all I needed to say.</span> <span id="s1624">And they following day she left and I was left alone, it was a terrible loss for me naturally, but she, we thought about the past, how to join her, everything was very uncertain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q: Maria, you talked about how difficult it was when Blancka was leaving for Hiedelburg.</span> <span id="s1626">Tell me something about your relationship and what it meant to be able to be together in a situation like this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">A: Extremely important to have another body.</span> <span id="s1628">Not to be alone.</span> <span id="s1629">Being alone, being isolated was one of the great dangers.</span> <span id="s1630">You just couldn’t hardly survive without having someone with you.</span> <span id="s1631">I remember days when I was very much isolated whenever things happened.</span> <span id="s1632">Blancka had to run, I had to run you know?</span> <span id="s1633">It was, it felt, you really couldn’t live through it.</span> <span id="s1634">But when Blancka left, it was a great loss to me.</span> <span id="s1635">We maintained correspondence in some way, she was able to write from Germany, and there was always some hope that perhaps I’ll find myself there, although I didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1636">She encouraged me to go but how could I go?</span> <span id="s1637">For me the greatest danger was to go to the official employment bureau to ask for a job because to go to Germany you had to apply for a job there.</span> <span id="s1638">There had to be proof for a job there.</span> <span id="s1639">For me just to show myself, show my face in these offices was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s1640">So we maintained our contact mainly through correspondence at that point, but until then, we were extremely inter-dependent.</span> <span id="s1641">Her looks were helpful, I had more sense of danger I think, of reality, I was quick this way for some reason.</span> <span id="s1642">I think we complemented each other very well this way, but we were very close to each other and as I say, we were intimate in our relationship and I knew of the losses she suffered.</span> <span id="s1643">She knew very much of my family life.</span> <span id="s1644">She tried to steal some oranges in the hospital to bring to Lash-ick (ph) so we were very intertwined, extremely so.</span> <span id="s1645">And her absence left a tremendous void in my life, but more than that, a sense of danger too, that I’m all alone here.</span> <span id="s1646">I had no idea the war was coming to an end.</span> <span id="s1647">Coming back to it, I remember Bowl-ick (ph) and Helene Ko-vet-all-lich-al (ph) and Lod-ja (ph), we had intermittent contact.</span> <span id="s1648">From the time she had left until I joined her wasn’t that long.</span> <span id="s1649">I’m trying to remember, I can’t remember exactly when she left but somehow within the next few months the Germans started running.</span> <span id="s1650">We heard about it, that the Soviets are approaching.</span> <span id="s1651">Even before that, Blancka and I celebrated each victory on the part of the Soviets.</span> <span id="s1652">At one point, we heard that Kolomyja was liberated and this came through the radio, the British radio, no, another city, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s1653">On the British radio, on that radio we heard it later in Germany.</span> <span id="s1654">So we celebrated each time, quietly.</span> <span id="s1655">We had such a double life, an official life and a life between each other.</span> <span id="s1656">We were extremely close, I would say, in a very intimate kind of relationship.</span> <span id="s1657">We maintained it later for many decades too.</span> <span id="s1658">But when she left, it was pretty, I did have some correspondence, I heard a little of it, that she was working in a household there.</span> <span id="s1659">She didn’t seem to be in danger of any kind, danger of detection.</span> <span id="s1660">It was very soon afterwards we heard rumors that the Soviets are approaching, they are taking over large parts of Poland, the eastern part.</span> <span id="s1661">And one day, I remember, the German family for whom I worked just took off to their town in Germany and they didn’t come back.</span> <span id="s1662">And within a few days, the office workers also left.</span> <span id="s1663">And then I was all alone when I heard that the Soviets are approaching Warsaw, they’re in Prague, in the suburb of Prague.</span> <span id="s1664">Being all alone, the telephone stopped working, I would have like to call Lodz, I would like to call Helena but I couldn’t, but I was all alone, I figured, well, in a few hours or so the Soviets are going to be here, so walk out of the apartment.</span> <span id="s1665">This was a German section, the Germans were not there anymore.</span> <span id="s1666">There were Poles, and I knew the Soviets are coming in.</span> <span id="s1667">I didn’t really think about my sister, Frania, she was involved with the child, I didn’t know about Menek, although we did have some intermittent communication.</span> <span id="s1668">At one point, pretty much everything stopped, we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1669">But I knew that I’m going to be free in a few hours.</span> <span id="s1670">But the Soviets did not come in.</span> <span id="s1671">And I was all alone in that big apartment, not understanding why they take so much time.</span> <span id="s1672">The following morning, I began to hear some shooting.</span> <span id="s1673">I later found out there was an uprising, the Poles started an uprising against the Soviets.</span> <span id="s1674">This was beyond my belief!</span> <span id="s1675">Well, before I knew, the Germans were coming back and the Poles seemed to be fighting both the Germans and the Soviets.</span> <span id="s1676">I walked out in the street to see what’s happening, I was terribly isolated by then.</span> <span id="s1677">I saw people running.</span> <span id="s1678">All the Polish people from the neighborhoods were running.</span> <span id="s1679">I joined them, I didn’t know why people were running.</span> <span id="s1680">And so we kept running, we moved slowly into sewers.</span> <span id="s1681">Suddenly I’m in sewers.</span> <span id="s1682">And then the Polish people began to talk about what happened.</span> <span id="s1683">That there was an uprising, that the Soviets didn’t come in, that the Germans are back.</span> <span id="s1684">And that the city is being burned down.</span> <span id="s1685">Well, I didn’t feel a minute anymore about being, the part about being Jewish.</span> <span id="s1686">This did not, somehow or other, I can’t remember, that Helin-ka (ph) and Bowl-ick (ph) joined me.</span> <span id="s1687">I think we ran together but this is what I’d like know, to see Helin-ka (ph) to find out these details.</span> <span id="s1688">I don’t remember whether we, how many days we were in the sewers, but it seemed like an eternity naturally.</span> <span id="s1689">And from time to time, the sewer door would open and you could see a street and you could hear some shooting and then it would close again and we were again in the sewers.</span> <span id="s1690">I don’t remember how we were fed but somebody, there was some crumbs of food going around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">Q: Were you in the water?</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">A: In the water, that high up.</span> <span id="s1693">And these were not the sewers of the ghetto, these were the sewers of the city of Warsaw, Polish people.</span> <span id="s1694">Some were in uniforms, some were civilians, all age groups.</span> <span id="s1695">I didn’t know how far we were going, what it was I thought a day, but it was more than a day definitely.</span> <span id="s1696">It was a good many days, the idea was, I found out later, that we will be going up to the vestibular where we will get out and get a boat to go to the Soviets, to Prague.</span> <span id="s1697">Finally we arrived at the vestibular and Bowl-ick (ph) and Hel-inka (ph) and I, by the way, we wrapped around ourselves a blanket so we wouldn’t be separated because there were lots of people there, we were afraid we would be torn apart.</span> <span id="s1698">And to come out in that bright sunshine, this was September of 1944, August, end of August, beginning of September, 1944.</span> <span id="s1699">And we tried to get into a boat, there were many people coming out of the sewers, and we see the city is pretty much in flames, and we try to get on a boat.</span> <span id="s1700">We cannot get in, it’s filled, Bowl-ick (ph) got on the boat, Hel-inka (ph) and I still waited for another boat to come.</span> <span id="s1701">The Soviets are right across the vestibular, some people were trying to swim it.</span> <span id="s1702">Suddenly from no where the Germans appeared, the vestibular is at the bottom of the city.</span> <span id="s1703">The important part of the _______ hill, the old city.</span> <span id="s1704">Suddenly, there are Germans in the old city and from no where I feel a bullet in my back.</span> <span id="s1705">They shot me through my coat, I was in a coat, and I’m bleeding.</span> <span id="s1706">And the same bullet goes into the arm of Hel-inka (ph).</span> <span id="s1707">I fell to the ground, she didn’t I think.</span> <span id="s1708">I was pretty unconscious, I was bleeding.</span> <span id="s1709">And then they have us get up, I still don’t understand how it was possible for me to be bleeding and get up, and we are being marched.</span> <span id="s1710">We were apparently, I found out later, the last group of the Polish uprisers.</span> <span id="s1711">And they are dragging us through the city of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1712">We see the city in flames, and they are dragging me, I can hardly drag.</span> <span id="s1713">And all of us have to put out a handkerchief or something to show to the Germans our surrender.</span> <span id="s1714">We had to show something white, flags we didn’t have, so everybody raises a hand with a little shirt or something, we’re surrendering.</span> <span id="s1715">I couldn’t walk, people helped me or what, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1716">All I recall, at one point, I was extremely thirsty, probably from loss of blood, and I bent down to pick up an apple.</span> <span id="s1717">Poland is full of orchards, of apple orchards, it was the season for it.</span> <span id="s1718">I tried to get an apple into my mouth and a German soldier hits me right in my back, march!</span> <span id="s1719">He didn’t know I was Jewish, but then I was totally unafraid of being detected as a Jew.</span> <span id="s1720">I was a Pole.</span> <span id="s1721">They marched us to a place outside of town called Poroskov.</span> <span id="s1722">In Poroskov they had a special detention camp for all the Poles who fought in the uprising and other Poles too.</span> <span id="s1723">Lodz eventually was in Poroskov too but I didn’t know at that time.</span> <span id="s1724">I was so sick that I wish I knew these details because I didn’t function mentally anymore.</span> <span id="s1725">But I recall waking up, there are somehow or other bodies on top of me.</span> <span id="s1726">It was so crowded there that they pushed people, we fell asleep and the bodies, somehow or other I sneaked out of it.</span> <span id="s1727">Before I know it, I was on some transport being marched again to a place to be, to a place to be, anti-loused, means cleaned of lice, a de-lousing station.</span> <span id="s1728">And then they put us on a train and I’m on a train with Hel-linka (ph) holding onto each other and with lots of other Poles.</span> <span id="s1729">Polish families, not children, Polish men.</span> <span id="s1730">On that train, and by then it is September I know, on the train were the only two women and the men are all in Polish uniforms, they were fighters.</span> <span id="s1731">The train was moving very slowly, I had no idea where we were moving, we fall asleep all of us.</span> <span id="s1732">Sometime in the middle of the night, or it was very early morning, one of the fighters wakes up and he starts talking to the other one, the Jews brought all the tragedy and the Jews will take over Poland because of the Soviets and they got us into all that trouble.</span> <span id="s1733">And one of these guys looks at the other and says, you know what, these two girls across from us, they look Jewish.</span> <span id="s1734">You better tell.</span> <span id="s1735">By then it was about four in the morning or so and it was just light, it was just coming, and then they fell asleep.</span> <span id="s1736">And without saying another word to Hel-linka (ph), we motioned to each other that we’re going to jump from the train.</span> <span id="s1737">I’m sure that the motivation was not to escape from that, the motivation I believe, but I’m not sure, was to just die.</span> <span id="s1738">Before these Germans come to take us.</span> <span id="s1739">We understood by then that the train was being shipped out to Stutthof, which was a detention camp where Polish people were shipped in order to work for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1740">And we knew the beginning of the day will bring the greatest horrors to us when the Germans arrived to take us out.</span> <span id="s1741">So without saying a word to each other, the window was open, the train was moving very slowly, I can’t remember who jumped first.</span> <span id="s1742">And I can’t remember anything else except that I wake up in the home of a Polish woman in a town called Toe-mash-off-maus-off-yetski (ph).</span> <span id="s1743">I never heard of the town, it’s south of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1744">These women had attended me, given me a clean bed, attended to my wounds, told me the story of what happened after I woke up.</span> <span id="s1745">I don’t know, it was a few days that I was pretty unconscious.</span> <span id="s1746">She said that when we jumped out a priest thought we were dead.</span> <span id="s1747">He was going to the cemetery to bury some body, he saw these two girls from the Warsaw uprising, so he figured he’s going to bury us, with a decent Catholic burial.</span> <span id="s1748">When he noted that we were breathing.</span> <span id="s1749">So first he buried these people who he meant to bury, then he brought us to this Polish woman on the outskirts of Toe-mash-off-maus-off-yetski (ph).</span> <span id="s1750">Poor woman but a very decent soul.</span> <span id="s1751">She was very happy to be able to be of service to these Polish revolutionaries, the Poles who fought, the Polish fighters who fought for independence of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1752">So she treated us beautifully, I could see how poor she was but she treated us extremely well, and one day a neighbor comes in and she opens the door to our room and she wants to tell him, these are two girls who were in the Polish resistance movement.</span> <span id="s1753">He takes a look at us and he says, she look Jewish.</span> <span id="s1754">That night, Hel-linka (ph) was sick of me because she looked Polish, she said good-bye to me and I haven’t seen her until years after the war.</span> <span id="s1755">I saw her again about two years after the war.</span> <span id="s1756">Hel-linka (ph) had blue eyes and she was blonde and she wanted out.</span> <span id="s1757">I stayed on, I didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s1758">The Polish woman was absolutely an angel, she said you have to go, you can’t be here.</span> <span id="s1759">She wrapped up for me half her bread in a kerchief and two apples and early morning I leave.</span> <span id="s1760">I didn’t know where I was going but, it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s1761">At that time, nothing mattered anymore.</span> <span id="s1762">I knew I wasn’t afraid at all because I wasn’t Jewish anymore, nobody would think of me as Jewish at that point.</span> <span id="s1763">Poland was falling apart.</span> <span id="s1764">I kept walking, so I walked into town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">Q: You just said that it didn’t matter that you were Jewish because people were, but this man noticed and this woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">A: That man noticed, but on the whole people were already running and life didn’t matter to me.</span> <span id="s1767">I was all alone, I was wounded, I had a pain in my back.</span> <span id="s1768">I had nothing.</span> <span id="s1769">I didn’t know where to go, I don’t think I had documents at that point because I was running in the sewers, I don’t remember what happened.</span> <span id="s1770">And I don’t remember because I was on the high fever.</span> <span id="s1771">So I walk into that town, I see Thom-ma-sla-sov-en-sky (ph), I never heard of it before, there are two Thom-ma-slick’s (ph), one is _____________ the other ____________ is the home of Rabbi Lowengers (ph) brother.</span> <span id="s1772">They preeminently gave testimony about their experiences as children in camps.</span> <span id="s1773">So I walk in, I hardly walk, but I walk with the apples and the bread.</span> <span id="s1774">I see an apothecary for pharmacy.</span> <span id="s1775">European pharmacies are very different than ours, they’re very formal.</span> <span id="s1776">I had nothing to loose, I walk in, I say I am a, I ran away from the uprising, I fought in the uprising because this was my new identity.</span> <span id="s1777">The man, and I know a little bit about pharmacological work because my husband was a pharmacist, I use to help him, he is delighted to see me, he says.</span> <span id="s1778">Well, first I wanted to rest up, I wanted to meet my family, tomorrow you come to work.</span> <span id="s1779">You can do bottles, you can wash up, fine.</span> <span id="s1780">He sends me upstairs to his family, a nice home they made, his wife was charming to me, the maid makes a luxurious bed for me, I felt so guilty to get into that bed with beautifully clean linen.</span> <span id="s1781">I haven’t seen that in a long time, starched linen I remember.</span> <span id="s1782">And they invite me for dinner and everything’s fine.</span> <span id="s1783">And I sleep through the night and in the morning the maid comes in saying, she’s very sorry but her landlady told her how sorry she was but I cannot stay here any longer.</span> <span id="s1784">I think, ah-oh, they discovered where I was.</span> <span id="s1785">So I say, what happened?</span> <span id="s1786">She says, in the morning when you got up I made the bed, I noticed there were lice in your bed.</span> <span id="s1787">And my landlady says you should go because you were wounded.</span> <span id="s1788">You should go to the clinic to clean out your wound.</span> <span id="s1789">Well, I still remember laughing to myself, lice!</span> <span id="s1790">Anything is better than being discovered as a Jew!</span> <span id="s1791">I dragged myself to that clinic and they started working on me and the doctor without any anesthesia they cleaned my wound, it was extremely painful I remember.</span> <span id="s1792">I screamed from pain.</span> <span id="s1793">And they took out the lice, they cleaned me out totally.</span> <span id="s1794">And I hear the nurse saying to the doctor, you know, she looks Jewish.</span> <span id="s1795">Here I’m in the hospital, in the emergency room.</span> <span id="s1796">Nothing happened and nothing mattered at that point, I walked out, I knew I was bandaged.</span> <span id="s1797">I didn’t have lice.</span> <span id="s1798">I figured should I go back there, it’s really not the place for me to go back, I’m afraid.</span> <span id="s1799">By then it was very late evening, I was extremely tired.</span> <span id="s1800">I was still so very sick.</span> <span id="s1801">I ate those apples and the rest of the bread and I stretched out on a bench.</span> <span id="s1802">It was a cold night, it was by then I think the end of September, beginning of October.</span> <span id="s1803">It was raining, drizzling, and I fell asleep and nothing matters.</span> <span id="s1804">Sometime in the middle of the night, somebody pushes me.</span> <span id="s1805">I open my eyes.</span> <span id="s1806">A German soldier, a German policeman.</span> <span id="s1807">Come, he says to me.</span> <span id="s1808">I wasn’t afraid.</span> <span id="s1809">He didn’t know in the middle of the night that I was Jewish or anything, he was collecting all these homeless people to ship them out to Germany.</span> <span id="s1810">So he brings me again to a place for cleaning, de-lousing, clean, I walk out clean.</span> <span id="s1811">I think they gave me something fresh to wear, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1812">And he brings me to an assembly hall where there are lots of Polish women.</span> <span id="s1813">All these women, collected from the street, are being shipped to Germany to work.</span> <span id="s1814">By then the Germans were loosing the war, their men where coming home on crutches.</span> <span id="s1815">Their women were sent to the front to work.</span> <span id="s1816">They didn’t have enough workers so they were collecting Polish people all over.</span> <span id="s1817">I’m among Poles, therefore nobody knows I’m Jewish.</span> <span id="s1818">But, we get on a train, and then the man who is a greeter tells us we are going to go to Germany to work but before we do we are going to stop in Pat-o-vich-a (ph), which is a border town which by then was Germany.</span> <span id="s1819">And he takes us out and he says, I want you to sit in this corner, we were a few hundred people by then, to sit in this corner and to wait for the evening.</span> <span id="s1820">We are going to take an evening train and I’ll come back in the evening.</span> <span id="s1821">We know you’ll sit and rest here, will being some food.</span> <span id="s1822">I took a look at the group and I didn’t know whether I looked at them or they looked at me but it didn’t look to me kosher that I could survive with these Polish groups.</span> <span id="s1823">So I said, if I have to be back and see if I could walk away a little bit, so I walked away.</span> <span id="s1824">And here I could see Germany falling apart.</span> <span id="s1825">Many Polish people of German extraction, falk-stoich-er (ph), are coming into the station.</span> <span id="s1826">They are running from the Soviets.</span> <span id="s1827">And at the station there are many soup kitchens supervised by German nurses, like the German Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1828">So I hear their story about how the Soviets are after them, how they ran away from rape and all kinds of things, so I figured, I’m also falk-stoich-er (ph), why not?</span> <span id="s1829">I speak German better than they.</span> <span id="s1830">So I go over and I ask for soup and I tell them that I’m running from the Soviets so they give me one cup of soup and another cup of soup and a third cup of soup.</span> <span id="s1831">I remember milk so distinctly, finally I am full, I’ve eaten good food.</span> <span id="s1832">And this is a Sunday afternoon I believe and I walk out of the station.</span> <span id="s1833">Pat-o-vich-a (ph) is not touched, it is a German city, it’s an industrial city, it was the biggest textile city after Manchester, I knew about it.</span> <span id="s1834">And I see the stores full of fabrics, I couldn’t believe what’s going on here.</span> <span id="s1835">I came from the ashes, literally from the ashes of Poland.</span> <span id="s1836">And I walk and I don’t know where to walk, I figure I have to walk away from that Polish group.</span> <span id="s1837">Let’s see if I can get to Heidleburg because I’m wanted in Germany, and since everybody’s running.</span> <span id="s1838">I’m not Jewish, everybody’s running, the German, the falk-stoich-er (ph) are running, the Poles are running.</span> <span id="s1839">The Poles couldn’t run they are too _____________ but the Germans were running from their home.</span> <span id="s1840">So I see a Hitler parade, and believe it or not, this is the funniest thing in my life!</span> <span id="s1841">I joined the Hitler parade and I go like this, Heil Hitler!</span> <span id="s1842">Heil Hitler!</span> <span id="s1843">_______________.</span> <span id="s1844">First they had soldiers in brown shoes, but then people talked, it was Sunday afternoon, I think it was for Hitler’s birthday, I’m not sure, but it was a special occasion.</span> <span id="s1845">So I walked with them until the evening, then they disperse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">Q: What’s your state of mind when you joined this parade?</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">A: Oh, I was so exhilarated.</span> <span id="s1848">I was absolutely exhilarated.</span> <span id="s1849">Imagine me to join a Hitler parade!</span> <span id="s1850">I’m in Germany!</span> <span id="s1851">This still brings to me laughter whenever I think about that moment!</span> <span id="s1852">How did I do it, but what else could I do?</span> <span id="s1853">I was in the safest place to be for me.</span> <span id="s1854">In a Hitler parade!</span> <span id="s1855">I’m together with all these Germans saluting the flag and all the things, and there are speeches and so on.</span> <span id="s1856">Many hours pass and the evening comes and they begin to disperse, so I have no place to go.</span> <span id="s1857">I figured these Poles must have left, but I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s1858">So I circle around the station.</span> <span id="s1859">I wasn’t afraid because people were on the march by then you see.</span> <span id="s1860">They were refugees.</span> <span id="s1861">This was the best feeling for me.</span> <span id="s1862">I come back, indeed, the people are gone.</span> <span id="s1863">So I take a look, what am I going to do?</span> <span id="s1864">Now I’ll try to get on a train and find my way to Heidleburg, I knew Blancka was there.</span> <span id="s1865">I had some idea of where, the place where people from Bolm-sukkot (ph) worked.</span> <span id="s1866">I got to, it’s late evening by then, I get on a train and I suddenly notice the military train from Russia, the Germans, all military, I’m the only woman.</span> <span id="s1867">I say, oh, that’s very dangerous, so I hide in the restroom.</span> <span id="s1868">In an hour or so, they need the restroom and start yelling to get out, I get out, they look at me, and by sheer luck because I have to think it was luck you know, the train stops.</span> <span id="s1869">It was the city of Dresden.</span> <span id="s1870">So I walk out at the station and the train goes away, it goes wherever they went.</span> <span id="s1871">I walk, it was very quiet I remember.</span> <span id="s1872">It was by then, was morning, early morning hours.</span> <span id="s1873">I walk into town and I sit down in a cafe, I didn’t have money but I figure I would sit down, rest stop.</span> <span id="s1874">And so the new bombs came.</span> <span id="s1875">This was the great bombing of Dresden, it was an earlier bombing.</span> <span id="s1876">You see R-A-F, this was the British Air Force.</span> <span id="s1877">The best feeling in this world, that I’m going to die of a bomb, what can be better?</span> <span id="s1878">I remember even bombs in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1879">At one point, the British were bombing Warsaw and I stayed in a household there, not with the Germans, it was in a Polish place, I had a furnished room, and people were running to shelter.</span> <span id="s1880">So these people called me, come!</span> <span id="s1881">Come with us to the shelter!</span> <span id="s1882">And I did everything possible not to go to the shelter, I wanted to be killed by a bomb.</span> <span id="s1883">Couldn’t be a better death.</span> <span id="s1884">And I recall doing this, putting my feet up and my head into my legs, hoping that when a bomb kills me that it will kill all of me rather than just some legs or the head separates.</span> <span id="s1885">This was my dream, to be killed that way.</span> <span id="s1886">I really didn’t want to live, so when people say they tried to survive, they wanted to live, I really didn’t want to live but I didn’t want to die detected by the Germans.</span> <span id="s1887">I was afraid of that death.</span> <span id="s1888">But I’ve seen before how people were killed and their leg was hung there and I was there and this to me was a horror, so I remember that night of bombing.</span> <span id="s1889">I didn’t go to the shelter but I waited for the bomb, the bomb didn’t come to me.</span> <span id="s1890">So this is Desden, and I sit in a cafe and the second floor of that cafe is coming down and I’m sitting there literally, seeing the bombs, and things happen, it’s like an earth-sukkotke, you know?</span> <span id="s1891">It sounds like an earth-sukkotke.</span> <span id="s1892">And I see many people are dead in the street and here I walk out alive.</span> <span id="s1893">I was meant to live and that’s all they can say, why I wasn’t killed I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1894">So hours later, I walked down to the railway station.</span> <span id="s1895">I still have in mind if I’m alive I want to go to Heidleburg, so I get a train.</span> <span id="s1896">It was some sort of a civilian train.</span> <span id="s1897">Nobody looked at documents, nobody looked at tickets, it was so chaotic.</span> <span id="s1898">It was mainly refugees from the falk-stoic-er (ph), from everywhere, and Germans too from the cities, there were bombs, they were moving west, that’s how it was going.</span> <span id="s1899">But mainly from the eastern part of Germany, which was originally Poland.</span> <span id="s1900">Finally I see this train stops at Frankfurt and before I get out bombs come over Frankfurt, this was a little bit too much, unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1901">But this was the time of the greatest bombing of Germany.</span> <span id="s1902">So the railway station is all in fire again and many passengers walk out alive and many passengers are killed right there.</span> <span id="s1903">And I’m alive.</span> <span id="s1904">It’s fantastic!</span> <span id="s1905">So I figured, now I have to go from Frankfurt to Heidleburg, certainly no trains anymore, the railway station is all in flames.</span> <span id="s1906">I see people walking, I follow them, they are walking to the highway to hitchhike.</span> <span id="s1907">So I hitchhike too, I’m a German you know!</span> <span id="s1908">I’m a falk-stoich-er (ph), poor, dear soul.</span> <span id="s1909">I’m better qualified to be falk-stoich-er (ph) than anybody else here because those who live for generations in Poland is falk-stoich-er (ph), that and German, they didn’t speak German they didn’t know a thing.</span> <span id="s1910">I’m certainly much more __________, so I go with them.</span> <span id="s1911">And they start hitchhiking, so I get on a truck, I remember the truck goes only a little place, he leaves me there, I had to hitchhike again.</span> <span id="s1912">Must have been six modes of transportation, finally a train goes somewhere between Mannheim and Heidleburg.</span> <span id="s1913">I arrive at Heidleburg, I arrive intact in Heidleburg.</span> <span id="s1914">I walk into the ladies room to wash up and I wash up and I look in the mirror and I see a chimney behind me, a chimney sweep, and I figure how does a man come into this?</span> <span id="s1915">I look around, he’s gone.</span> <span id="s1916">So, I wash my hands again, I look again and I see the chimney sweep is back!</span> <span id="s1917">And I look back, it’s not a chimney sweep.</span> <span id="s1918">What happened?</span> <span id="s1919">I did this with my hands and I noticed it was me, not a chimney sweep!</span> <span id="s1920">I was so black, I was so totally black covered with soot.</span> <span id="s1921">And it was my face, it was not a chimney sweep.</span> <span id="s1922">________________.</span> <span id="s1923">I wash my face, I suddenly had a face and it was me.</span> <span id="s1924">I still have that sense of terror in me when I think about it.</span> <span id="s1925">I walk out, the city is normal and beautiful and it was the month of October.</span> <span id="s1926">And in Poland, October as you recall here is lovely, the weather is lovely, it’s not cold.</span> <span id="s1927">I’m without stockings and wooden shoes and the coat through which went the bullet.</span> <span id="s1928">And I walk and I cannot believe my eyes.</span> <span id="s1929">And I see some Germans, former soldiers on crutches, a few women.</span> <span id="s1930">And I just keep walking towards the necht-a-some-a-risa (ph) because in walking toward the station’s center, usually it goes down the center of the street, you just walk.</span> <span id="s1931">Here I see the neck-er (ph) and I figure how can I find out where Blancka is?</span> <span id="s1932">I remember the name of her employer.</span> <span id="s1933">So I stop a little girl and I say to her, do you know Mr. Alber (ph)?</span> <span id="s1934">And she says, My papa!</span> <span id="s1935">Like that.</span> <span id="s1936">There are miracles in this world.</span> <span id="s1937">My papa!</span> <span id="s1938">She takes me by my hand and she brings me to Blancka.</span> <span id="s1939">Blancka nearly fainted when she saw me the way I looked.</span> <span id="s1940">She took me to the basement to wash me up and put something around my wounds, I was not in such good sukkotpe yet, and she figured I should wait a few days before I go to work.</span> <span id="s1941">She had meanwhile arranged for me to work for a couple, for a family, in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s1942">This was no one else but Professor A-had-es (ph), he was a dean of the medical school in Heidleburg.</span> <span id="s1943">A high ranking German official in a uniform, he was about 7’ tall.</span> <span id="s1944">He has a wife with four children, a stunning house, absolutely beautiful house.</span> <span id="s1945">There were bedrooms and attics.</span> <span id="s1946">They hired me on the spot, I started working.</span> <span id="s1947">The work was impossible for me, I was not well yet you see?</span> <span id="s1948">And they gave me an attic room.</span> <span id="s1949">I had to get the children, clean everything, there were many floors there, beautiful, their house.</span> <span id="s1950">And in the morning I would have to get the children to school, each child leaving for school with the, Heil Hitler, Maria!</span> <span id="s1951">This was the greeting, the morning greeting.</span> <span id="s1952">The lady of the house was sort of neutral.</span> <span id="s1953">She didn’t trust me with cooking, there was nothing to cook.</span> <span id="s1954">It was toward the end of the war, the Germans had very little, but they had a garden.</span> <span id="s1955">Everyday, I had to go to the garden and dig out potatoes and leek.</span> <span id="s1956">And everyday, we had an elegant lunch of potatoes and leeks.</span> <span id="s1957">I would scrape it off, prepare it, but she would cook it because you put a little bit butter and a little flour and make it look like more of a meal.</span> <span id="s1958">It was served in beautiful porcelain with silverware, you would never think what you were eating, it was great food.</span> <span id="s1959">Everyday the same until the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1960">We had all, for getting rations of food.</span> <span id="s1961">Everybody was assigned that many grams of bread, so I had a little.</span> <span id="s1962">He registered me as a falk-stoich-er (ph), which was great.</span> <span id="s1963">So which means I was entitled to a little bit more bread.</span> <span id="s1964">So, I would get whatever amount of bread, just a little bit less than they did.</span> <span id="s1965">On Sunday, everybody had pork.</span> <span id="s1966">A roast of pork and the Professor would slice it, trying to be fair to everyone.</span> <span id="s1967">Then he would slice a somewhat thinner part, this is for Maria!</span> <span id="s1968">He didn’t know much German, I knew, because just spoke it haltingly in a way, because she gets a little less.</span> <span id="s1969">But, I still had a portion.</span> <span id="s1970">This was one soup, they didn’t have either, except that he went a few times to Yugoslavia on trips.</span> <span id="s1971">And he would bring some peaches from there and he brought some assortment of foods.</span> <span id="s1972">Well, this household was a very elegant household.</span> <span id="s1973">They would have culture evenings, evenings of culture.</span> <span id="s1974">At which point they would invite about 20, 30 people like a symphony orchestra they would play.</span> <span id="s1975">These were doctors most of them, famous lawyers, jewelers, you know?</span> <span id="s1976">And I would set up the chairs and everybody would get a little bit coffee or something but everything was very elegant.</span> <span id="s1977">The setting was always very elegant.</span> <span id="s1978">One day, he comes home from one of his sudden trips and he brings some very special food and the lady wraps it up on a tray and she says to me to go to that neighbor, to bring a present from the El-hades (ph) family.</span> <span id="s1979">I walk there, one of the most stunning houses I’ve ever seen, I couldn’t believe the garden at that house.</span> <span id="s1980">I ring the bell and the maid says, no, no, the maid’s entrance is through the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1981">I come into the kitchen and I leave that present.</span> <span id="s1982">Then I find out who now was this family, was Speer.</span> <span id="s1983">Albert Speer’s parents.</span> <span id="s1984">I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1985">They gave me the name Speer, the name Speer didn’t mean anything to me.</span> <span id="s1986">They want the movement between history and personal experience but that’s true for all survivors.</span> <span id="s1987">Well, it was an extremely beautiful neighborhood, something like our Scotishville (ph), a very fine section of the city.</span> <span id="s1988">And Blancka worked in her household and I worked in mine.</span> <span id="s1989">For me the work was unbelievably heavy, I couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1990">I just didn’t have the strength of rolling out these very heavy rugs, carpets.</span> <span id="s1991">Putting them on the snow and beating them on the snow because most Europeans believed that when you beat these heavy carpets on the snow that they get special treatment.</span> <span id="s1992">To roll it up, to carry it from this, one day I remember I saw planes, allied planes flying over, very much over me.</span> <span id="s1993">I could nearly talk to them, I felt it was so, but I felt that day I remember, gee, the Americans are coming, or the British, or whoever it was, but I won’t live to see them, I was so sick of work, I was so tired of work.</span> <span id="s1994">One day I fell off the stairway, they had stairways to different floors.</span> <span id="s1995">And I ripped my face and I think I had a few days of rest and a hospital, the best time of my life!</span> <span id="s1996">I needed the rest so bad.</span> <span id="s1997">To dig out in the cold snow, to dig out potatoes everyday.</span> <span id="s1998">To take care of four children.</span> <span id="s1999">To do the laundry.</span> <span id="s2000">To clean the house.</span> <span id="s2001">To beat those carpets.</span> <span id="s2002">All of this was a little bit too much for one person.</span> <span id="s2003">Blancka was with six children and the German lord’s point was if a woman has a family of six children they were entitled to one and a half help.</span> <span id="s2004">If they had four children you were entitled to a foreign worker, I was a foreign worker.</span> <span id="s2005">If you had eight children you were entitled to two, if you had six you were entitled to one and a half.</span> <span id="s2006">So Blancka had another half there, that half later we found out was also Jewish.</span> <span id="s2007">She still lives in Tacoma, Washington, I knew her.</span> <span id="s2008">Blancka and I were very closely related in terms of our days off.</span> <span id="s2009">Our day off was Wednesday afternoon and occasionally we would go to the University, sneak in, but most of the time we would go to this beautiful forest because their houses, the suburb was in forest.</span> <span id="s2010">Most beautiful section of the city.</span> <span id="s2011">There was a lovely cafe called Bros-pron-eur (ph).</span> <span id="s2012">It was cut out of an idyllic kind of a place.</span> <span id="s2013">It wasn’t true, it wasn’t possible.</span> <span id="s2014">That is the place when we heard that the Germans have plans, according to their plans that they withdrew, they withdrew from our home town.</span> <span id="s2015">These were the news we would get, we knew that they were loosing.</span> <span id="s2016">But it was still very much inside Germany and little by little I felt I probably will not survive the heavy labor.</span> <span id="s2017">I was not afraid of being detected because I was only afraid of the Poles, I was not, the Germans wouldn’t know the difference, that’s a fact.</span> <span id="s2018">But going down to market for them and all these things, it was uphill, it was very difficult to carry all of that.</span> <span id="s2019">But I thought I would survive the war if I could survive my health.</span> <span id="s2020">I couldn’t take that heavy labor.</span> <span id="s2021">Well, one day, the man of the house comes in and he says, it looks as though there is some fighting going on, we would be better off being in the basement at night.</span> <span id="s2022">Not to stay above because you could see all the airplanes.</span> <span id="s2023">I didn’t listen to the radio, I didn’t know much, but I got it from their faces that things are not going well for the Germans.</span> <span id="s2024">I didn’t know how close.</span> <span id="s2025">So he said that night we should stay in the basement.</span> <span id="s2026">So we all go down to the basement and sometime early morning I see this man, who always wore the high military uniform, he use to be in Berlin with Hitler, you know, he was a very big shot.</span> <span id="s2027">But he’s in his civilian clothes, it hangs on him it just looks like a diminished man.</span> <span id="s2028">And he drive out of the garage with this car and the car has a little white flag.</span> <span id="s2029">And I still don’t understand what was going on.</span> <span id="s2030">Later in the morning, he comes back with a little bandage over his hand, he was wounded slightly in the street fight.</span> <span id="s2031">He and the mayor of the city and somebody else went to Mannheim to surrender the city of Heidleburg to the Americans.</span> <span id="s2032">That’s a great moment, I have to celebrate.</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">Q: Do you want to stop for a minute?</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s2035">It’s one of the joys, memories.</span> <span id="s2036">I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s2037">He came back and within hours we heard some people were moving, rushing, we went down to the highway, we saw American tanks rolling.</span> <span id="s2038">You couldn’t see anybody, you just saw the tanks, they were closed up.</span> <span id="s2039">Blancka and I stand next to the fields and suddenly one of the roofs of the tanks opens up and a young soldier, American soldier, in Yiddish which he thought was German, so he says, Fraulines!</span> <span id="s2040">Fraulines!</span> <span id="s2041">Fraulines!</span> <span id="s2042">We had to make now, Munich, he wanted the road.</span> <span id="s2043">So we hear this German Jewish and to say, Yidden!</span> <span id="s2044">Yidden!</span> <span id="s2045">Yidden!</span> <span id="s2046">We’re Jews!</span> <span id="s2047">Well he is, but he has to keep rolling, so he throws us two cartons of cigarettes, of the cigarettes the war was over, you know?</span> <span id="s2048">Well, I go back and I figure this the end of my working for the Germans.</span> <span id="s2049">Although the war was still going on, but I’m not going back to work there.</span> <span id="s2050">I went back and I refused to work, but I still have my little room.</span> <span id="s2051">So, Herr Professor in his civilian outfit by then, it was like a diminished man, an unbelievable change, what happens to the uniform, the high ranking uniform when you have to leave it?</span> <span id="s2052">He comes up, the Herr Professor, this is his wife, he sends her up to talk to me.</span> <span id="s2053">And he wants me, he’s concerned that his wife said I’m not working.</span> <span id="s2054">And that he wants me to, he wants to know what my plans are.</span> <span id="s2055">I say, I don’t know, I guess I’ll go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s2056">So he says, you know what?</span> <span id="s2057">It’s not so good for you to go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s2058">After all you're an ethnic German, the Poles may not treat you so well.</span> <span id="s2059">I said, I’ll take a chance.</span> <span id="s2060">He says, but I have a better plan for you.</span> <span id="s2061">Here in the village is a mort-k-eye (ph), a store of smoke products.</span> <span id="s2062">I have contacts there, they know me well, they will arrange for you to be a sales girl there.</span> <span id="s2063">You will have a _________.</span> <span id="s2064">And he notice along these lines and I figure I’m crossing inside and finally I say to him, Herr Professor, you know what?</span> <span id="s2065">I’m neither falk-stoich-er (ph), nor Polish, I’m a Jew!</span> <span id="s2066">And tall as the man is, he stretches out on the floor and fainted!</span> <span id="s2067">And my floor was smooth because it was a maid’s room, an attic maid’s room.</span> <span id="s2068">Well, he revived.</span> <span id="s2069">He went down, this was the end of my job.</span> <span id="s2070">No more talking about jobs or anything.</span> <span id="s2071">I don’t know how they dealt with that news, I have no idea because I realized at that point the danger soon to be there.</span> <span id="s2072">Although the Germans occupied the city by then, I didn’t know how much they occupied.</span> <span id="s2073">They were marching.</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">Q: You mean the Americans were marching?</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">A: The Americans, yes.</span> <span id="s2076">So I figured something may happen.</span> <span id="s2077">A night or two nights before, he wanted me to dig a hole in the garden where he put some guns.</span> <span id="s2078">He hid guns there.</span> <span id="s2079">And Blanca’s people hid wine.</span> <span id="s2080">Bottles of wine.</span> <span id="s2081">They were prepared for the Americans, you know, so the Americans may want, he hid guns there.</span> <span id="s2082">And I figured it’s not good for me to be there at this point.</span> <span id="s2083">We didn’t know where to go.</span> <span id="s2084">I said to Blancka, I say, I’m not working anymore.</span> <span id="s2085">She says, I’m not working either.</span> <span id="s2086">We go down to look at these tanks and the tanks keep rolling, but we have no money, there’s no money, there’s nothing to buy.</span> <span id="s2087">We went into town, everything is closed.</span> <span id="s2088">Heidelburg is totally closed up, not one store is open.</span> <span id="s2089">And so we decided to live in these fields near the highway.</span> <span id="s2090">We slept there and we ate grass.</span> <span id="s2091">I’ll never forget after the war, the first few days we ate grass.</span> <span id="s2092">It’s hard to believe it.</span> <span id="s2093">We decided not to go back.</span> <span id="s2094">And there was nothing to do but on the third day I think we realized perhaps we could do something with these cigarettes.</span> <span id="s2095">So we walked into town and indeed, we knocked at the doors and we told, cigarettes, cigarettes, trading something, and they gave us some food.</span> <span id="s2096">Finally we found our way to a place, an American Red Cross club.</span> <span id="s2097">That place was to serve donuts and coffee to American soldiers.</span> <span id="s2098">It must have been within a week or two, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s2099">We told the guys that we were Jewish and that we were slave laborers here and could they do something for us, could they give us a job?</span> <span id="s2100">They agreed to have us serve the boys.</span> <span id="s2101">So if I speak English in a funny way, that’s the place where I picked up my English.</span> <span id="s2102">I never went to school, this was my school.</span> <span id="s2103">I served coffee and donuts and Blancka too.</span> <span id="s2104">Was a great life.</span> <span id="s2105">We got a furnished room because for the donuts we were able to trade.</span> <span id="s2106">We brought dozens of donuts to a place where they had a furnished room all ready.</span> <span id="s2107">Then we decided we need to learn English.</span> <span id="s2108">So we went to a German woman who was a teacher of English.</span> <span id="s2109">Gave her a dozen of donuts and she taught us English.</span> <span id="s2110">To the beauty parlor for donuts, everything was for donuts because there was no food and we had access to as many donuts as we wanted to.</span> <span id="s2111">So this put us on our feet.</span> <span id="s2112">One day, a man comes in, in an outfit from Auschwitz, I didn’t know about Auschwitz, I had no idea where he was from, but he wore one of these pajamas and he told us he was in Auschwitz, told us his story.</span> <span id="s2113">And he says, he needs to talk to the military governor, he needs some document to go and find his wife, but he doesn’t speak English.</span> <span id="s2114">So I said, I speak English, I’ll take you there.</span> <span id="s2115">I come to the military governor and he has refugee assistant and I interpret for this man and the military governor turns to his assistant and says, what language does she speak?</span> <span id="s2116">That was my English.</span> <span id="s2117">I stopped going for English lessons to this woman, she taught me in a way that was no English!</span> <span id="s2118">I thought I spoke English.</span> <span id="s2119">Slowly I learned the language and slowly a man came in from underground, Mr. Volinger (ph), and he started helping us in whatever way.</span> <span id="s2120">Eventually, they organized, the American Red Cross organized a transport of trucks to go to Trencin-sch-stat (ph) and to bring back the Jews from Heidleburg, from, and they were in the ______.</span> <span id="s2121">Heidleburg, Frankfort, Manchester, some other towns, Offenbach.</span> <span id="s2122">And they ask if anybody speaks Russian, I volunteer to speak Russian.</span> <span id="s2123">So they attach me, they put me in a uniform, some American soldiers uniform, and I go with them to Trencin-sch-stat (ph) and I say, before you go we have to cross Russian borders.</span> <span id="s2124">We have to take cha-socks (ph), watches and a lot of Vodka.</span> <span id="s2125">They don’t understand, I say, trust me.</span> <span id="s2126">That is what we will need.</span> <span id="s2127">Well, the minute we cross the border into Czechoslovakia, they immediately saw these soldiers and they don’t let us through.</span> <span id="s2128">We need a stamp and that stamp, a round stamp, a green stamp.</span> <span id="s2129">I say, don’t bother with them, just give them the cha-socks (ph), well, they salute us, we go further.</span> <span id="s2130">We get to Karlsbad, where my sister use to live.</span> <span id="s2131">We come there, they cannot let us through because we don’t have the right kind of a stamp.</span> <span id="s2132">We have a square stamp, they want a round stamp.</span> <span id="s2133">And I say, where is your supervisor?</span> <span id="s2134">Oh, he’s taking a bath.</span> <span id="s2135">A bath?</span> <span id="s2136">We’ll wait.</span> <span id="s2137">They say, oh no, he likes to be in the spa the whole day and the whole night.</span> <span id="s2138">So, I figure that’s no way, this cost a lot of Vodka and cha-socks (ph), but we went further.</span> <span id="s2139">Finally, it was evening, we arrive in Tilsit-en-shot (ph), it’s high up.</span> <span id="s2140">This scene I’ll never forget again.</span> <span id="s2141">We come with a convoy of trucks, of busses actually.</span> <span id="s2142">And we had a list of people who were deported to Trencin-en-shot (ph), hundreds of thousands of names, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2143">They had, the Red Cross had collected it.</span> <span id="s2144">There’s a big, big courtyard, it’s towards the evening, and we see people sort of sukkotking.</span> <span id="s2145">These people were in a coma of dying.</span> <span id="s2146">The Soviets brought in food which they couldn’t digest.</span> <span id="s2147">It was a terrible scene and I have that list and they cannot read the list, they don’t know who’s alive, who’s not.</span> <span id="s2148">Before I know, a Soviet policeman, a soldier policeman, puts his hands on my shoulders, he says, please follow me.</span> <span id="s2149">He gets me into the big castle, an empty room, a tremendous room in the castle.</span> <span id="s2150">It’s all dark.</span> <span id="s2151">He says, wait here, I should wait.</span> <span id="s2152">He locks the door on the outside and I’m all alone in that place.</span> <span id="s2153">It was a horror.</span> <span id="s2154">My only thought was, in the morning, the truck will pick me up and I’ll go to Siberia because that was the Russian way.</span> <span id="s2155">I didn’t want to lie down, I was standing because I was afraid of rats.</span> <span id="s2156">I was standing there the whole night, waiting for the morning to be taken out, no matter where.</span> <span id="s2157">He comes in the morning, he takes me out, he brings me back to the American Red Cross.</span> <span id="s2158">Until today, I don’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s2159">I assume, because I spoke Russian and I wore an American uniform, that they took me for a spy.</span> <span id="s2160">Or perhaps these guys intervened for me, I still don’t know.</span> <span id="s2161">We came back with a handful of people, the worst of people from Heidleburg from these places.</span> <span id="s2162">All I recall, when I crossed the border into German territory, I nearly kissed the land.</span> <span id="s2163">That was how you do with Soviet Russia.</span> <span id="s2164">There, I met two girls in Russian uniforms from my home town.</span> <span id="s2165">They were in the army, they work with the victorious armies, they were marching.</span> <span id="s2166">And they told me that they saw Blanca’s husband in Krakow’.</span> <span id="s2167">So, I told that he come back from Russia, so I went back to Heidleburg, I told Blancka about it, she could hardly wait.</span> <span id="s2168">She wanted to go to Krakow’ to meet her husband, naturally.</span> <span id="s2169">So we both leave the job at the American Red Cross.</span> <span id="s2170">There was a big repatriation movement then, they were patroiting all of these people to Poland and there was a truck load of Poles coming back from Germany as slave labors into Poland.</span> <span id="s2171">And all that talk you hear is anti-Semitic talk in that truck.</span> <span id="s2172">We were just about to cross the border into Czechoslovakia to go to Poland and I hear these comments and it was a stop for us.</span> <span id="s2173">I say to Blancka, you know what?</span> <span id="s2174">I’m not going back to Poland.</span> <span id="s2175">I couldn’t go back to Poland, I couldn’t hear that talk.</span> <span id="s2176">Here I was already in America, in a way, the American Red Cross.</span> <span id="s2177">She was quite desperate about our separation, but she went, she wanted to find her husband.</span> <span id="s2178">She comes to __________ herself later, she found her husband with another woman.</span> <span id="s2179">He married a woman in Russia.</span> <span id="s2180">Anyway, so I went back to Heidleburg.</span> <span id="s2181">I stayed a while.</span> <span id="s2182">Somehow or other, they had displaced persons camps, you know?</span> <span id="s2183">I was going from one into another.</span> <span id="s2184">One day, I work for Ohrdruf, from the Red Cross they sent me to Ohrdruf because I spoke languages.</span> <span id="s2185">I knew a little English by then, I knew Polish, I knew German, so I was useful in an office.</span> <span id="s2186">And somebody approaches me saying, is there a Maria Neider here?</span> <span id="s2187">Maria Neider!</span> <span id="s2188">Menek phoned.</span> <span id="s2189">He literally walked through Poland and Germany from, so this was, how do you know?</span> <span id="s2190">It’s Menek and he brought news that Frania is alive and he mentioned that they all came to Germany and I got them a house near Heidleburg because I had the rations, food, I had all that stuff.</span> <span id="s2191">I’m in the uniform, you saw my years of __________.</span> <span id="s2192">And they sent me to A-rose-en (ph), after I worked in Frankfort first.</span> <span id="s2193">Frankfort on Hurst, that was the only building that was the G.I. farm and factory.</span> <span id="s2194">The only buildings the Americans left intact in Frankfort because they thought they’ll need it for their military government later, so it was.</span> <span id="s2195">So I worked there, Menek found me there.</span> <span id="s2196">And then they transported all of unknown people to A-rose-en (ph).</span> <span id="s2197">They had the Germans leave the city, this was a suburb of the city of Castle (ph).</span> <span id="s2198">There was big castles there, big village.</span> <span id="s2199">And Own-Rae (ph) took over the town.</span> <span id="s2200">And they sent me there and I had an apartment with another woman from America, she was of Polish origin, Maria Leiberskint.</span> <span id="s2201">We lived there and life was pretty good.</span> <span id="s2202">And my sister lived in Heidleburg, I would commute and bring food, I would always bring all these things.</span> <span id="s2203">I had a very interesting job, it was in the tracing, we were tracing children who were dispersed into Germany.</span> <span id="s2204">No Jewish children were in question.</span> <span id="s2205">But representatives of different governments, Polish, Yugoslavian, Hungarian, Croatian, you just name it, they came to our zone to claim the children.</span> <span id="s2206">They wanted to find their children.</span> <span id="s2207">And the job of the Onrah (ph) personnel which I supervised for no good reason but that I knew the languages and I had an education, all of this worked in my favor.</span> <span id="s2208">They were field workers to find children.</span> <span id="s2209">Many of these children didn’t speak any of their native languages, you had to identify them by some symbols or whatever.</span> <span id="s2210">Sometimes they uttered a word, sometimes they wore a cross which looked like a Slavonic thing.</span> <span id="s2211">Some of these things, we found many of them.</span> <span id="s2212">And we would always bring them to the attention of these liaisons from their countries and they were shipped immediately to their countries.</span> <span id="s2213">Today I am not sure I would do that as easily because you wanted to put children and were already observed by German families, what that separation meant, but those days there was no question that these children have to be removed from Germany, the belong to their families.</span> <span id="s2214">Sometimes the families were not available, but they belonged to their nations, to their countries.</span> <span id="s2215">So these things, my staff went to schools to find them, to churches, to orphanages, certainly it was most difficult with families because families didn’t want to tell us and it was detective work to find, because these kids were so assimilated into Germany that they spoke German.</span> <span id="s2216">Depending on the age too, all the children we could find easily.</span> <span id="s2217">This was my job for a very, this was 1945, 1946, and there was plenty of food.</span> <span id="s2218">I had a uniform of an American, Under Second Class because the First Class was those who came from the States or from the other countries.</span> <span id="s2219">These were Second Class, locally hired people, but we had all the privileges.</span> <span id="s2220">And one day, a man comes and sits with me in that restaurant there where we had very good conditions, we had a PX, privileges, cigarettes, coffee and so on.</span> <span id="s2221">And everybody was exchanging them for all kinds of goods.</span> <span id="s2222">I started smoking, I became addicted then.</span> <span id="s2223">And the coffee I use to bring to my sister so she had something, anyway, I fed a whole family on this.</span> <span id="s2224">But, one day, a man in another type of uniform sits next to me and to begin talking.</span> <span id="s2225">He said he’s a president from the Joint Distribution Committee, and he says, as I talk to you, you belong to the Joint.</span> <span id="s2226">This was the end of wandering for me, I go to Stuttgart to work with the Joint.</span></p> <p><span id="s2227">End of Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s2228">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s2229">A: Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s2230">Q: Let’s see, you’ve now changed your job to JDC?</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">Q: Tell me something, was JDC one of the places that, or group that were going into Poland to try and find Jewish children who were or had been in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">A: Not at that point at all.</span> <span id="s2234">That’s modern history.</span> <span id="s2235">Joint Distribution Committee was established as part of Onrah (ph), they were administered and dependent on Onrah (ph).</span> <span id="s2236">Their job was to identify, rehabilitate and help with the settlement of all the Jewish victims of Nazism.</span> <span id="s2237">People were coming out of concentration camps so they established, and from Poland some came, from other countries.</span> <span id="s2238">The large concentration of Jews who survived was in Germany.</span> <span id="s2239">The others we didn’t touch, that was Russia by then.</span> <span id="s2240">From all the concentration camps, from all the death camps in Germany.</span> <span id="s2241">In Germany there were no death camps, but concentration camps, they all came to the bigger cities of Germany.</span> <span id="s2242">Particularly they gravitated towards the American occupied zone, which was Frankfort and Heidleburg and so on.</span> <span id="s2243">Some went to the British zone, those who were liberated from Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s2244">Very few wanted to be in the Russian zone and very few wanted to be in the French zone even, but some did.</span> <span id="s2245">There were concentration camps in the French zone too.</span> <span id="s2246">Anyway, it was a job of the Joint to find these people, start feeding them, locating their relatives perhaps in other countries, help them with immigration, so they took out the Jewish displaced persons from the other camps because there was quite a bit of anti-Semitism in these camps.</span> <span id="s2247">And they brought them into their own camps, they established Joint camps.</span> <span id="s2248">You know, the anti-Semitism in these camps was an interesting phenomenon.</span> <span id="s2249">And they hired me as a second status employee of the Joint.</span> <span id="s2250">I also had to wear a uniform.</span> <span id="s2251">I was extremely absorbed in this work.</span> <span id="s2252">It was to me one of the great experiences of my life, to be able to serve people who survived.</span> <span id="s2253">I knew little about the concentration camp experience, they didn’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s2254">My job was mainly to help them with immigration.</span> <span id="s2255">I was stationed in Stuttgart, they brought me to Stuffgart.</span> <span id="s2256">The Director of that office was a Flora Levine, an American woman and I was her assistant.</span> <span id="s2257">And I recall hundreds of young people standing in line trying to get to me to get a referral to the visa department because I had to process them, help them.</span> <span id="s2258">I also helped with some of the counseling problems if they needed it.</span> <span id="s2259">I spoke German, I spoke Yiddish, I spoke Polish, I was ideal for this job in this respect.</span> <span id="s2260">It was a job of great satisfaction.</span> <span id="s2261">I couldn’t stop working, I worked literally day and night and everyday I would take these documents to the American Consulate in Stuttgart and he would put a stamp and here was a visa.</span> <span id="s2262">One of the jobs was also to help them reunite with families in America so they would get affidavits.</span> <span id="s2263">This is another long story.</span> <span id="s2264">We worked very closely with what was Ny-anni-no (ph) and then was called United Service for New Americans, and Patrick was director of it, a matter later in another capacity.</span> <span id="s2265">It was extremely committed and devoted work, I’ve never worked for an agency in which were such commitment.</span> <span id="s2266">I found a boyfriend there, we were suppose to be married, I later decided I didn’t want him.</span> <span id="s2267">He followed me, I mean, he was an American social worker from Brooklyn, and we met later in the United States but by then I withdrew from the relationship.</span> <span id="s2268">It was a period of extreme investment and work and helping and I’ve never been in this situation before.</span> <span id="s2269">My _______ was suppose to lead to teaching in the gymnasium level.</span> <span id="s2270">Somehow or other, this was social work.</span> <span id="s2271">I didn’t know it was social work.</span> <span id="s2272">So I represented the Joint in different places.</span> <span id="s2273">One of the places was to go to the deport camp, sometimes for whatever problems.</span> <span id="s2274">I traveled around the displaced persons camps in all of the American zone.</span> <span id="s2275">I had to go to births, I had to go to a wedding in the camps because there was tremendous activity in terms of marriage, in terms of having children.</span> <span id="s2276">Nobody understood at all and years later I understood, it was part of the need for replenishment, for not being alone, for not facing the new world all alone, so that everyday there was a wedding, everyday there was a birth and I was a representative of the Joint, I was invited.</span> <span id="s2277">Once I went to a very meaningful, extremely sad occasion.</span> <span id="s2278">In Bergen-Belsen, I think a few months after liberation, perhaps a year after liberation, the Palestine Agency send a monument to be put on the grounds of Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s2279">There was a reunion of all the inmates of Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s2280">I went as a representative of the Joint.</span> <span id="s2281">This moment I’ll never forget.</span> <span id="s2282">When the Rabbi said Ka-dish (ph), there came a moan from the people, nobody cried.</span> <span id="s2283">There was a moan, you could hear it on the steps of Russia.</span> <span id="s2284">This stays with me, that moan of people.</span> <span id="s2285">Nobody could talk, nobody could cry.</span> <span id="s2286">There was, it was all in that moan of people.</span> <span id="s2287">Another time I remember that moan was, I just heard two years earlier, when in Bremen-hoffin (ph), when I was taking the boat to America, we stayed in Bremen-hoffin (ph) a few weeks, waiting for the boat.</span> <span id="s2288">The boat in which I came was the Ernie-pile (ph), that was then name, these are military boats, broken military boats.</span> <span id="s2289">And again, I was a representative of this, this I’ll come to later because it was later.</span> <span id="s2290">But anyway, so this was the work in the Joint.</span> <span id="s2291">Extremely gratifying.</span> <span id="s2292">They treated me beautifully, they send me once to Paris for a week of vacation.</span> <span id="s2293">In those days, people didn’t travel to Paris on vacation, I did.</span> <span id="s2294">They send me to Switzerland once, anyway, it was all part of the job.</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">Q: Maria, you said that people didn’t talk about their camp experiences.</span> <span id="s2296">Did you try to get them to talk?</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">A: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s2298">My friends boyfriend was a man who was the son of a, who came from a German concentration, it was in Dachau or Buchenwald, I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s2299">This was in Stuttgart when I worked for the Joint.</span> <span id="s2300">And I accidentally met him and we stayed together for a while.</span> <span id="s2301">We were very close to each other in every way.</span> <span id="s2302">He taught me to play tennis.</span> <span id="s2303">But, we never talked about his experiences.</span> <span id="s2304">He told me about his father, who was a very famous _____________ in Berlin, Bebo (ph) was the name.</span> <span id="s2305">His mother was survived, he survived in the camp.</span> <span id="s2306">We never talked about the camp.</span> <span id="s2307">He was lately a symphony orchestra, associate directory of the Detroit Symphony.</span> <span id="s2308">He always wanted to be in the field of music, he had a career ahead of him.</span> <span id="s2309">I didn’t know what I wanted to be.</span> <span id="s2310">All I wanted was to work for the Joint for the rest of my life.</span> <span id="s2311">I mean, working with people, this was like, this was a true sense of doing something valuable.</span> <span id="s2312">Doing something meaningful after the job as a maid.</span> <span id="s2313">This was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, I didn’t imagine I’ll have another life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2314">Q: I’m trying to think of how to ask this question.</span> <span id="s2315">In most people who have, including yourself, who have suffered so much and lost so much, and of course there’s a desperation to begin anew.</span> <span id="s2316">But there’s also problems in trying to do it.</span> <span id="s2317">Did you see, not trends in problems, but did you see certain kinds of things that women, when they gave birth, was this difficult for them to be having children?</span> <span id="s2318">Even though that may have been one of their deepest desires, and the relationships between men and women?</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">Q: I think there was tremendous group support which helped.</span> <span id="s2320">These children were born in the sukkotdow of the chimneys, literally so.</span> <span id="s2321">I still don’t understand what courage these women had to start families.</span> <span id="s2322">I still admire their courage.</span> <span id="s2323">They forever have been psychoanalyzed as not loving these children because of the traumatic birth of these children.</span> <span id="s2324">I have seen it differently, always.</span> <span id="s2325">I think these families, these women survived emotionally only because of denial.</span> <span id="s2326">Because they didn’t want to think about it, because they didn’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s2327">And the power of denial can be very, very functional and adaptive.</span> <span id="s2328">I always teach my students this, so we don’t understand it.</span> <span id="s2329">Very difficult to teach mental health practitioners about it.</span> <span id="s2330">I do a lot of lecturing on the Holocaust and this is one of the major lessons.</span> <span id="s2331">That denial can be a very adaptive mechanism, very helpful and very useful.</span> <span id="s2332">In those days, the denial helped.</span> <span id="s2333">My own denial, here I had such an intimate boyfriend.</span> <span id="s2334">We didn’t talk about his camp experiences.</span> <span id="s2335">Here I interviewed hundreds, little more than hundreds of these young men.</span> <span id="s2336">Some of them came from, one place only recently discovered, from the city of Radom.</span> <span id="s2337">I knew they were from the city of Radom and I only discovered recently that the camp in which they worked was close to Stuttgart, so I got them all from Radom for some reason.</span> <span id="s2338">But I wanted to know what their first name, their second name, what they want to do in America and all these things but we, where, what camp were they but the camp was a name and nothing else.</span> <span id="s2339">There was no digging into it in any way.</span> <span id="s2340">There was a young, beautiful woman from the Joint from Brooklyn, beautiful!</span> <span id="s2341">She was the assistant of that man, my boyfriend, that, Omn (ph), the city of Omn (ph).</span> <span id="s2342">And one day, a horrible thing happened.</span> <span id="s2343">She stuck her head, she opened up the gas stove in her apartment in Omn (ph), she stuck her head in and suffocated.</span> <span id="s2344">Nobody understood the nature of her death.</span> <span id="s2345">I suspect that it was a very strong identification with the victims.</span> <span id="s2346">Rebecca was her name, or her second name, I don’t remember, but she should be remembered.</span> <span id="s2347">But there wasn’t suicides there, occasionally you heard a displaced person, a Jewish displaced person killed some German.</span> <span id="s2348">It was all rare.</span> <span id="s2349">The movement was towards life.</span> <span id="s2350">The pain would arrive, Sukkot-bot (ph) evening in lighting candles.</span> <span id="s2351">And naming a child.</span> <span id="s2352">This was the most painful decision for most families.</span> <span id="s2353">How do you name a child?</span> <span id="s2354">A Jewish child is named after dead family members.</span> <span id="s2355">How can you name a child a hundred names?</span> <span id="s2356">These were the big decisions and the big pain.</span> <span id="s2357">You named a child where a boy could have had a name of a woman, of a mother.</span> <span id="s2358">But these young people, they tended toward denial to an extreme extent.</span> <span id="s2359">Some of it later in life was dysfunctional, but at that point, it helped having a marriage.</span> <span id="s2360">I had to attend many marriages, I was a representative of the Joint.</span> <span id="s2361">Having a Rabbi at it, having a little party afterwards, having a birth, getting visa, getting together on that boat.</span> <span id="s2362">My sister got on the boat, and her son and her second husband.</span> <span id="s2363">She married in Krakow’ right after the war.</span> <span id="s2364">He adopted the child and here they go together with Menek to America, okay?</span> <span id="s2365">On one of the boats.</span> <span id="s2366">In the winter of 1946, I certainly helped with the arrangements, this was my job.</span> <span id="s2367">And here in Bremen-hoffin (ph) and I get a frantic call from Menek.</span> <span id="s2368">What happened?</span> <span id="s2369">He was on the boat and waiting, you were forever waiting for the boat to arrive and on the boat you were waiting for no good reason, you're waiting.</span> <span id="s2370">These were all military boats, hundred of Jewish displaced persons.</span> <span id="s2371">Many Jewish people.</span> <span id="s2372">This was the Truman quota.</span> <span id="s2373">We had no relatives in America.</span> <span id="s2374">Nobody could sent us an affidavit but beginning of 1946, Truman offered a certain number of affidavits and we were included in it.</span> <span id="s2375">That’s how I came to America.</span> <span id="s2376">And so did my sister.</span> <span id="s2377">What happened, they called out Menek’s name to come to the pursers office.</span> <span id="s2378">There he was told that retroactively the Stuttgart consulate noticed in viewing his x-rays that he had tuberculosis and he’s not permitted to enter America.</span> <span id="s2379">They removed him from the boat.</span> <span id="s2380">Here was an orphan, both his parents were killed.</span> <span id="s2381">My sister was on her way.</span> <span id="s2382">I ordered my visa to go a few weeks later.</span> <span id="s2383">Well, I picked him up in Bremen-hoffen (ph), I brought him to sanitarium in German.</span> <span id="s2384">A horrible thing, sanitarium for tubercular conditions, all Germans in the Sch-wa-daltz (ph), in the Black Forest.</span> <span id="s2385">He was terribly sick, all he wanted to die.</span> <span id="s2386">Every Sunday, this American boyfriend of mine and me went to visit him.</span> <span id="s2387">Bring him food.</span> <span id="s2388">He always pleaded with me to take the food back.</span> <span id="s2389">All he wanted was a pill of cyanide.</span> <span id="s2390">Every Sunday night I would go home with that pain, what to do?</span> <span id="s2391">Eventually, I extended my visa.</span> <span id="s2392">I got him through the Joint into Switzerland, into a Joint sanitarium near Lu-gone-au (ph).</span> <span id="s2393">There he got better, he got well.</span> <span id="s2394">American wouldn’t let him in, it had to be five years after the illness is arrested totally.</span> <span id="s2395">So we got stuck in Switzerland and the Swiss didn’t want him and America didn’t want him.</span> <span id="s2396">There was no money and he was hungry often.</span> <span id="s2397">We were in America by then, we would send him a little money, very little, we were making a little money, but we sukkotred.</span> <span id="s2398">One day, he advises us there is a new drug out, they say, his lung was collapsing, he had ____________, everything.</span> <span id="s2399">People were dying, all these kids from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2400">They were teen-agers, they were dying left and right.</span> <span id="s2401">He knew he was going to die, but he heard there was a new drug called streptomycin.</span> <span id="s2402">Can we send it.</span> <span id="s2403">1947, streptomycin had a tremendous price for us.</span> <span id="s2404">We couldn’t, it was still experimental, whatever, we couldn’t afford it.</span> <span id="s2405">Somehow or other we made it and we send it to him.</span> <span id="s2406">This began his healing process.</span> <span id="s2407">The Joint had ideas that you have to train these young people for jobs that are available so according to them, this was the time that they needed book binders.</span> <span id="s2408">So he went to them to become a book binder.</span> <span id="s2409">Since then, I’ve always been telling my students that you have to do rehabilitation towards not what is available but as part of the value system and his value system, a book binder was not for him.</span> <span id="s2410">In his value system there was a professional, to be a businessman, a professional, but not a book binder.</span> <span id="s2411">So he didn’t like book binder, they kicked him out, they didn’t want to entrance him.</span> <span id="s2412">That was the Joint, but eventually they helped him a little bit, very little.</span> <span id="s2413">The Swiss police was after him all the time, when is he leaving the country?</span> <span id="s2414">Finally he got a little better, he got himself into the University of Brussels, he passed tests!</span> <span id="s2415">Believe it or not, he passed tests.</span> <span id="s2416">He didn’t know the languages but he had a good mind for mathematics, for chemistry, he was a very learned person, but I still don’t know.</span> <span id="s2417">They accepted him on a trial basis.</span> <span id="s2418">He graduated Cum-sad-laud, Smugla-cum-laud I remember, in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s2419">Many days he was hungry there.</span> <span id="s2420">The Jewish community of Switzerland was very ugly.</span> <span id="s2421">They didn’t want to help these kids at all.</span> <span id="s2422">He had a close friend who is now a doctor in, he retired, but he was a doctor in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s2423">They had no money to live on.</span> <span id="s2424">They were hungry.</span> <span id="s2425">So the Jewish community in Brussels decided, no, he was in ____________, decided that they get them a night job to guard in the cemetery Jewish bodies since the people brought at night and they cannot be buried, they needed a Jewish guard.</span> <span id="s2426">So these two kids, who came out of the Holocaust, they gave the job.</span> <span id="s2427">I’ll never forget it, I’ll never forgive them for it.</span> <span id="s2428">The Swiss Jewish community.</span> <span id="s2429">They have no sense.</span> <span id="s2430">They were horrible to, total lack of charisma, total lack of passion or anything, so they give them this job.</span> <span id="s2431">So, this helps them a little bit.</span> <span id="s2432">A Jewish woman, a survivor opened a little kitchen, a kitchen where she fed, we sent a little money to this person.</span> <span id="s2433">But anyway, despite all of it, he was apparently brilliant, we didn’t know it because he was not a great student in gymnasium.</span> <span id="s2434">The motivation was how he did so very well.</span> <span id="s2435">And every year they would tell him he’s not ready yet to go to America.</span> <span id="s2436">Finally, finally after many, many years he came to America.</span> <span id="s2437">By then he was established in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s2438">He had a degree, he started working.</span> <span id="s2439">He hated America when he came but he made it eventually.</span> <span id="s2440">So this is the aftermath period, is really not known well and I’m very glad that they’re beginning to teach a little about it.</span> <span id="s2441">This was a period of extreme stress but stress which was pushed down.</span> <span id="s2442">Stress which was swallowed.</span> <span id="s2443">To run away, my own trip to the United States was September 24th, 1947.</span> <span id="s2444">I came to Bremen-hoffin (ph) and the boat wasn’t ready.</span> <span id="s2445">The boat had not come yet.</span> <span id="s2446">So what do you do on September 21st, whatever it was, in September in Bremen-hoffin (ph), everything was closed, you couldn’t buy anything.</span> <span id="s2447">I had a lot of German marks because German marks were very available.</span> <span id="s2448">So I remember, I wanted to spend it before leaving.</span> <span id="s2449">So I went to a beauty parlor and I got a permanent.</span> <span id="s2450">And it took so hard work, I came to America, I had to pay $10 to remove it.</span> <span id="s2451">But this is the way, what money meant in those days.</span> <span id="s2452">I got on the boat and the Joint assigned me as an escort to the people there, which means I had to be responsible for them getting, each one getting $10, each of them getting a prayer book, in time for the Holidays, each of them making sure that they would get kosher food.</span> <span id="s2453">I had to be distributing, I was the mach-hack (ph).</span> <span id="s2454">I was still a young woman but I had these jobs, as a representative of the Joint.</span> <span id="s2455">I recall sitting on that boat and waiting, finally the boat moved.</span> <span id="s2456">The anchor was cut, this is another memorable moment in my life.</span> <span id="s2457">Suddenly when the anchor was caught, it was cut.</span> <span id="s2458">A moment came from the people on that boat, they realized this was, what they were leaving behind.</span> <span id="s2459">They were leaving all their families buried there.</span> <span id="s2460">And it wasn’t important where they were going, but what they were leaving.</span> <span id="s2461">This stays with me, this moment, these moments of separation stay with me.</span> <span id="s2462">These are still the most difficult moments in the lives of survivors.</span> <span id="s2463">But I recall distinctly the moment of Bergen-Beelines, I recall the moment of the anchor cutting.</span> <span id="s2464">Then, I still feel that pain when I think about it because I didn’t realize what that moment really meant.</span> <span id="s2465">Leaving the people behind.</span> <span id="s2466">And going to American in those days, they swore they would never come back to Europe.</span> <span id="s2467">Many, many people stuck to it, they could never go back to Europe.</span> <span id="s2468">People were getting sick on the boat, it was a fourteen days ride.</span> <span id="s2469">I was the only one to show in the dining room, there was marvelous food but there was, I remember this waitress that, eat more!</span> <span id="s2470">Eat more!</span> <span id="s2471">There was so much food.</span> <span id="s2472">The Joint gave each of us $10, make sure to distribute everything.</span> <span id="s2473">There was a guy who told me he use to be related to the, who makes candy, kosher candy in America, who was it?</span> <span id="s2474">Not Manaschevits, who was the other group?</span> <span id="s2475">I forgot, no the other bar, you know, the Jewish.</span> <span id="s2476">He told me that for the rest of my life that I’ll be getting chocolate from them, I never did anyway.</span> <span id="s2477">People were already beginning to think, but you know they got very sick, they were laying sick.</span> <span id="s2478">They could take the seaside, er, ride.</span> <span id="s2479">I was well up to a point, the last few days I was sick too.</span> <span id="s2480">And then suddenly there is a great, jubilant voice all over.</span> <span id="s2481">We see the Statue of Liberty.</span> <span id="s2482">This too are great moments.</span> <span id="s2483">It was Saturday night and they wouldn’t unload us because on Sunday the workers didn’t work at the dock or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s2484">It didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s2485">We were all well by then.</span> <span id="s2486">People’s sickness stopped since the voyage stopped.</span> <span id="s2487">And that Statue of Liberty was the greatest sight in the world!</span> <span id="s2488">Well, I was, my sister was there waiting for me, and my brother-in-law and another friend, they took me to the Bronx, they had an apartment.</span> <span id="s2489">They wrote me to Germany, they live on Garden Street in the Bronx and I thought it was a palatial place.</span> <span id="s2490">Right across from the zoo.</span> <span id="s2491">I saw them barefoot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2492">Q: Where, near the Bronx Zoo?</span></p> <p><span id="s2493">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2494">Right across, off Southern Blvd. between 183rd Street.</span> <span id="s2495">I had the bare feet, I walk up, a horrible place, but anyway, all I wanted was to run back, but where do you go back, ever?</span> <span id="s2496">Well, eventually it worked out.</span> <span id="s2497">We were struggling financially, very much.</span> <span id="s2498">Sending half of our earnings, went to Menek later because for weeks he was hungry there.</span> <span id="s2499">It is unbelievable.</span> <span id="s2500">The Swiss Jewish Community, I cannot forgive for it.</span> <span id="s2501">But then I got a job, I immediately got a job.</span> <span id="s2502">I don’t know how immediately I got the job.</span> <span id="s2503">The Joint send me to the Knights of Jewish Appeal.</span> <span id="s2504">By the way, later on I suddenly get a check of a lot of money, $1300, in 1947, $1300 was a fantastic amount of money in my book!</span> <span id="s2505">They paid me for the time I worked in Germany.</span> <span id="s2506">They never told me they would pay me.</span> <span id="s2507">This happens to be their good personnel policies, this I found out later.</span> <span id="s2508">Loy-ja (ph) worked for them for years.</span> <span id="s2509">She still feels it, she has been treated extremely well.</span> <span id="s2510">They send me no job, they send me to the Knights of Jewish Appeal as a clerk.</span> <span id="s2511">Very dull work, terribly dull work.</span> <span id="s2512">But I remember the day when a telegram was sent to every employee, that they reached their quota of $250 million dollars, in 1947, signed by Morgan-tow (ph).</span> <span id="s2513">Henry Morgan-tow (ph) was the chief of the UJA then.</span> <span id="s2514">And here it said that the executive director was Henry Montor (ph), I don’t know if you know the name, it was a big name in those days.</span> <span id="s2515">You deal with forty, sixty bro-ter (ph), Henry Montor(ph) was in charge of the UJA.</span> <span id="s2516">One day, he has a fall out with his, with Morgan-tow (ph) so they had to separate.</span> <span id="s2517">So Morgan-tow (ph) remains as the director of the UJA and Montor (ph) goes to another organization called the Palestine Economic Operation.</span> <span id="s2518">They have been in business for a long time, about the waterways in Palestine.</span> <span id="s2519">The Director of Personnel at the UJA, Montor (ph) took her with him, to the other organization.</span> <span id="s2520">And she took me.</span> <span id="s2521">So I ended up there.</span> <span id="s2522">It was in a hotel which doesn’t exist anymore across the Waldolf Astoria, it was a fine job, the rooms were air conditioned.</span> <span id="s2523">They made me the archivist there.</span> <span id="s2524">For some reason I like it because I was very quick in getting the files they needed.</span> <span id="s2525">It was a good time until one day I had, I lived already in the city by there, until one day I get this call from the United Service for New Americans, which is known NYANA, New York Association for New Americans.</span> <span id="s2526">They’ve always been in the business of helping refugees.</span> <span id="s2527">And they say, when I first came to America I had one visit with them, asking for work, and they said, what I want to do?</span> <span id="s2528">So I said, what I want to do was what I did for the Joint in Germany.</span> <span id="s2529">They say, oh no, this is social work, for this you need a degree.</span> <span id="s2530">They were stupid because I had languages and all these displaced persons they were serving they needed a person like me that spoke these languages, they didn’t even stop.</span> <span id="s2531">So they say, a new school of social work is opening up in Adell-fy (ph) and the Dean was with honor in Austria and he wants to give a Jewish scholarship to a displaced person.</span> <span id="s2532">And we have many, many candidates who are more qualified than you are, but we will include you if you want to.</span> <span id="s2533">I thought about it, I didn’t want to give up the job, I had a good paying job.</span> <span id="s2534">This was another experience, which doesn’t exist anymore.</span> <span id="s2535">Since it was a new school, they had to be more pious than the Pope.</span> <span id="s2536">So they interviewed each candidate for six days, for five days.</span> <span id="s2537">Every day another interview.</span> <span id="s2538">Until it came to Dr. Serrett (ph), who was a very famous psychiatrist for the National Schools of Social Work.</span> <span id="s2539">I didn’t know a thing about social work.</span> <span id="s2540">And he interviewed me, he wanted to know my childhood and everything.</span> <span id="s2541">Just to put it on record.</span> <span id="s2542">They were so limited, they never asked me about my Holocaust experience.</span> <span id="s2543">My childhood, my relation with my mother, my relation with my father, my relation with my siblings.</span> <span id="s2544">This took hours and hours, everyday an interview.</span> <span id="s2545">The final one with Dr. Serrett (ph) and he apparently approved so I got in.</span> <span id="s2546">But to the sukkotme of the psychiatry profession, that nobody asked about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2547">It was a non-subject in those days.</span> <span id="s2548">This was 1949, 1950.</span> <span id="s2549">Well, for some reason he chose me and I got in and I was very unhappy.</span> <span id="s2550">I didn’t understand what this study was all about.</span> <span id="s2551">He usually came from the study of sociology, psychology, I was student of Polish literature.</span> <span id="s2552">They talked language which I didn’t understand and I figured, how can I withdraw, how will I get my old job back?</span> <span id="s2553">It was very painful to me until the second semester, things began to go extremely well, let’s put it this way.</span> <span id="s2554">Nothing helps like a little success and a teacher just read my paper, which I thought was nothing, they all thought was excellent.</span> <span id="s2555">Anyway, it was great and I was graded very well.</span> <span id="s2556">So this is how I got into the profession.</span> <span id="s2557">I had no money.</span> <span id="s2558">I lived in a, it was amazing, with a Jewish family in, near Columbia University.</span> <span id="s2559">Six dollars a week, I remember.</span> <span id="s2560">I didn’t have enough money to live.</span> <span id="s2561">My scholarship was paid by the University but there was a foundation for Jewish girls and they were giving me $25 a week, which would have lasted except that my field work in social work, three days a week you have to be in the field.</span> <span id="s2562">And this idiot arranged my field work to be New Jersey.</span> <span id="s2563">So I had a lot of expenses and the school was in Adel-fy (ph) so $20 or whatever, $18 of that money went for travel.</span> <span id="s2564">When I was finally selected by the committee to enter the school, the dean congratulated me and he asked me whether I want to study case work, and I didn’t know what case work was, so I say, what does social work have to do with cheese?</span> <span id="s2565">Because case in German means cheese!</span> <span id="s2566">He started laughing and was still laughing when I left, this was my preparation for social work, but I made it.</span> <span id="s2567">And I did well.</span> <span id="s2568">My second placement, they helped me, also in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s2569">They couldn’t find a place for me in New York, they were very stupid about it.</span> <span id="s2570">It was in a State Psychiatric Hospital.</span> <span id="s2571">Which means that I had room and board there.</span> <span id="s2572">I lived there, and every psychiatric condition I immediately absorbed as my own.</span> <span id="s2573">So one week I was schizophrenic, the next week I was manic depressive.</span> <span id="s2574">It was very hard on me but it was the second year and I hadn’t done very well, so I graduated anyway.</span> <span id="s2575">Since then I’ve had good jobs and been a social worker since then.</span> <span id="s2576">I retired.</span> <span id="s2577">I actually worked for Washington, for the Federal Government, I worked for nine years for the National Institute of Mental Health.</span> <span id="s2578">These were special projects and drug addition.</span> <span id="s2579">And I was a supervisor in a big agency then and I use to commute and come to Washington and they were very large with money.</span> <span id="s2580">This was the end of 1950’s, early 1960’s.</span> <span id="s2581">Johnson’s programs spent a lot of money for rehabilitation, for human services.</span> <span id="s2582">They insisted I should travel first class because I had a high rank, GS-12 in those days were the high rank.</span> <span id="s2583">It was not becoming for a person with this GS grade to, not to go in important ways.</span> <span id="s2584">Anyway, there was a lot of stupid money spending.</span> <span id="s2585">We didn’t rehabilitate too many people I can tell you, but it was an easy job and prestigious job.</span> <span id="s2586">They sent me to be trained at Lexington, Kentucky where they had the United States Public Health Hospital for tubercular diseases later on.</span> <span id="s2587">Our job was to visit every agency and hospital in New York City, open up the doors for drug addicts.</span> <span id="s2588">We did it, it was a whole new thing.</span> <span id="s2589">A new ball game for me totally, but we accomplished a lot in this respect, not that drug addicts were not rehabilitated easily but I have been involved in it for many years.</span> <span id="s2590">And then one day, again, I was re-married in 1962 and my husband was a teacher.</span> <span id="s2591">He had long vacations, he wanted his wife to go on vacations but I only had four weeks.</span> <span id="s2592">One day we came back from a summer vacation, there’s a letter from the then Dean of the School of Social Work at Tall-a-dot (ph) who remembered me because he was my research professor at Adel-fy (ph).</span> <span id="s2593">It was a new school then, he asked that I join the faculty it was that easy.</span> <span id="s2594">In these days, you would have to have all kinds of qualifications.</span> <span id="s2595">What happened, somewhere or other, for many years after I graduated, they used that paper for a record to teach from so they remembered me this way.</span> <span id="s2596">It was very hard at Hunter from the first.</span> <span id="s2597">I didn’t want to give up my job as an AMH but they were very generous with me so they permitted me to work half time only for five years.</span> <span id="s2598">The first five years were full time, and then four years later, half time for Washington and half time for Hunter and then the Washim Project came to an end and they paid me, I still get a little pension from them, which is nice.</span> <span id="s2599">I belong to the Federal Employees Retirement Section, or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s2600">So, I’ve connections to Washington no doubt!</span> <span id="s2601">I’ve been at Hunter from 1962, first five years were half time.</span> <span id="s2602">And I went there, I retired in 1970, my marriage dissolved in 1970, we separated for the new divorce and in 1974 he died.</span> <span id="s2603">He was younger than I, he got leukemia and he died.</span> <span id="s2604">And I retired from Hunter in 1989, but I still teach the Holocaust course so I remain very much in, connected to the Holocaust course.</span> <span id="s2605">I started it on my sabbatical year because I was emotionally more ready to confront that material.</span> <span id="s2606">Until then, it was always with me, but I couldn’t quite read.</span> <span id="s2607">I started digging into it and since then I cannot leave it, now and forever involved in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2608">Q: What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2609">A: This was, my sabbatical was 1978 and I started teaching in 1979 and I have been teaching it still since.</span> <span id="s2610">It’s always been an important part of my life and since then I have been lecturing all over because it’s the only school of social in the country which offers it, which is unusual.</span> <span id="s2611">Yes, which is very unique, so I’m still with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2612">Q: Were you unhappy to leave the case work that you were doing and go into teaching?</span> <span id="s2613">Did you do it because your husband wanted you to do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2614">A: By then I was not doing any, I didn’t care, I was a supervisor.</span> <span id="s2615">I had a big job, I published, I wrote something on drug addition and I didn’t want to leave because it was a very well paying job at that point and it was a prestigious job.</span> <span id="s2616">My husband wanted me to but this was not the major thing.</span> <span id="s2617">I was not a little woman ever in my life.</span> <span id="s2618">I think my parents sort of made me feel I’m okay and this really helped I think.</span> <span id="s2619">I’ve never succumbed this way, but my husband wanted it.</span> <span id="s2620">What was very nice was the prospect of long vacations.</span> <span id="s2621">We always traveled for ten years which was great.</span> <span id="s2622">But, no, there was always something in teaching that was prestigious.</span> <span id="s2623">I didn’t think they would take me but they did and there were lots of times there too, all kinds of politics in the University so I don’t need to tell you about it, very often they want me out.</span> <span id="s2624">Eventually I made my way in and eventually I did well, but I had rough years there too.</span> <span id="s2625">The work was overwhelmingly big, a lot of work.</span> <span id="s2626">And there’s so much competition there.</span> <span id="s2627">If you were on good terms with one, the other one was angry to you.</span> <span id="s2628">Not because of me but because of perhaps they didn’t like the other person because politics of the University are something to write books about.</span> <span id="s2629">But basically, it’s a decent school, it was a decent school and of all the jobs I had there admissions work, you know, you do everything.</span> <span id="s2630">I had faculty advisement.</span> <span id="s2631">The favorite thing for me was always teaching.</span> <span id="s2632">I liked accompanying the students and this saved me always, always.</span> <span id="s2633">There were rough years too.</span> <span id="s2634">When I retired they did something awfully nice for me.</span> <span id="s2635">They established a collection of Holocaust literature in my name.</span> <span id="s2636">And it’s there which is, and I wanted it in the name, I had a conflict of which name it should go, I wanted my parents too and I wanted my husband too.</span> <span id="s2637">So first we had it Maria Herr Schneider Rosenbloom, they said, but what became Maria Herr Rosenbloom.</span> <span id="s2638">And occasionally I lectured from it, books I bought, that is continuous sort of input which is great, couldn’t be better.</span> <span id="s2639">My parents will be remembered this way, my family will be remembered this way, it’s marvelous I think.</span> <span id="s2640">But since then I’ve always been in private practice a little bit.</span> <span id="s2641">But always Holocaust related.</span></p> <p><span id="s2642">Q: Private practice?</span></p> <p><span id="s2643">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2644">Always Holocaust related, always.</span> <span id="s2645">The first time I work with Holocaust survivors was in a psychiatric, I was working in psychiatry because it was a natural thing for me.</span> <span id="s2646">I was trained in a way, so my first job was the psychiatric clinic of the Bathesda Hospital.</span> <span id="s2647">And there I was the only Yiddish speaking person, none of the psychiatrists spoke Yiddish, or wanted to speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s2648">So I was very much involved with every patient, nearly every patient.</span> <span id="s2649">Many of these people were considered refugees from Europe.</span> <span id="s2650">These were all concentration camp survivors.</span> <span id="s2651">Nobody knew the term.</span> <span id="s2652">I remember many, many fantastic situations from there.</span> <span id="s2653">One man refused shock treatment so they sent him to see me, see Miss Schneider.</span> <span id="s2654">Because I speak the same.</span> <span id="s2655">And in my stupidity I thought, why not?</span> <span id="s2656">He says his mother-in-law disapproves, I said, I’ll talk to your mother-in-law.</span> <span id="s2657">And his boss, he doesn’t want his boss to know, so I say, okay, I can talk to him too.</span> <span id="s2658">I exhaust all of the possibilities and he says to me, to tell me the truth.</span> <span id="s2659">I don’t want to make con-a-des-ot-rich (ph), shocking, no, electric shock treatment of me.</span> <span id="s2660">Some of these scenes were unbelievable.</span> <span id="s2661">One woman, this I’ll never forget.</span> <span id="s2662">She should be remembered somewhere as a result.</span> <span id="s2663">One woman, an __________ from the Lower East Side, I didn’t know her background very much, but she told me that she needed an apartment.</span> <span id="s2664">They were in a horrible walk up and they so needed to, it was very difficult, it was after the war, apartments were not available.</span> <span id="s2665">So I did everything possible to move this family.</span> <span id="s2666">Finally, on Grant Street on the Lower East Side, projects came up.</span> <span id="s2667">Lower income projects and I got an apartment for them in a new building.</span> <span id="s2668">With elevators, with everything.</span> <span id="s2669">The day they move, to move, she runs into the clinic desperate, insisting she must see me.</span> <span id="s2670">Crying, falling down on the floor.</span> <span id="s2671">I’ve never seen such, what happened?</span> <span id="s2672">She cannot live there, she moved in and she, I have to being her back to the old place.</span> <span id="s2673">She cannot live there and I don’t understand what was going on.</span> <span id="s2674">This goes on for a while, that she cries, I must do something for her, she doesn’t want to live there anymore.</span> <span id="s2675">She didn’t say commit suicide, but she doesn’t want to live anymore.</span> <span id="s2676">Finally, I still didn’t understand, finally she says, the incinerators.</span> <span id="s2677">I, that was a moment of awakening for me.</span> <span id="s2678">I didn’t know about this revulsion, nobody talked about these things in those days.</span> <span id="s2679">She could not live with the reminder of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2680">She couldn’t live with the incinerators.</span> <span id="s2681">So, this was a point of learning for me.</span> <span id="s2682">Then I started taking histories which included the history, until then, he was born in Chop-kov (ph) and Poland and he went through the war, he was in a camp, he was in a war camp.</span> <span id="s2683">That was the level of knowledge.</span> <span id="s2684">But since then, I’ve got a lot of experience.</span> <span id="s2685">For four years I worked in psychiatric clinic.</span> <span id="s2686">Gave me a lot of experience in working with survivors.</span> <span id="s2687">One woman left her child in the hospital, she didn’t want the child.</span> <span id="s2688">I went on a home visit, she and her husband thought, she delivered there, they didn’t want the child.</span> <span id="s2689">Who would defend such a thing?</span> <span id="s2690">And then I heard them speak.</span> <span id="s2691">She was in a camp and she saw some horrible fate of children.</span> <span id="s2692">And he was so identified with her that he literally repeated all her words and all her ideas, he assumed all her ideations.</span> <span id="s2693">In those days we had a term for it, a-folly-adert (ph), he thought exactly like his wife.</span> <span id="s2694">So these were things none of the doctors understood any of it because it was a non-subject.</span> <span id="s2695">The Holocaust was a non-subject truly until Ish-metz (ph) story came through.</span> <span id="s2696">I was very lucky to have this experience and I always stayed with it in a way.</span> <span id="s2697">I started attending meetings.</span> <span id="s2698">There was some, what was his name?</span> <span id="s2699">A psychiatrist, Christal (ph) and Freidel-lander (ph), they began to talk about it.</span> <span id="s2700">And then when I established a course I became very much devoted.</span> <span id="s2701">But I’ve always had patients of this background, very few, but always to see some people with this kind of background.</span> <span id="s2702">I still see one, what do you call it?</span> <span id="s2703">Load-man-ish (ph), doesn’t really matter really, you know, but I’ve always kept a foot in the door with this so I’ve been always into it.</span> <span id="s2704">It helps in my teaching.</span> <span id="s2705">I need to bring the past experience, _____________ the survivor agencies.</span> <span id="s2706">I never left the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2707">It’s strange, but somehow or other, it became a central part of my life.</span> <span id="s2708">I am sure the central part of every survivor’s life, but I’m more aware of it.</span> <span id="s2709">You never leave the Holocaust behind really.</span> <span id="s2710">Those you see or those you don’t see.</span> <span id="s2711">Those who talk and those who don’t talk.</span> <span id="s2712">It is the same coin, it’s just the reverse side.</span> <span id="s2713">But if they don’t want to talk or whether they talk obsessently about it, it’s the same.</span> <span id="s2714">You don’t exorcise it, it is with you.</span> <span id="s2715">Some remember, some don’t want to remember.</span> <span id="s2716">You don’t want to remember because it’s so central to your life.</span> <span id="s2717">The pain is so strong.</span> <span id="s2718">Sometimes people don’t stop talking about it.</span> <span id="s2719">With me and with all of us it has been a central, we are very aware of the centrality of this experience in our lives.</span> <span id="s2720">The question always arises how is it possible, you know, but you can build on the trauma.</span> <span id="s2721">I always think of the Mexican cities, the Mayans, who talk about these things.</span> <span id="s2722">You can build on ruins, that be my point.</span> <span id="s2723">You never resolve it, you don’t work it through.</span> <span id="s2724">I teach my students this way, it’s new teaching to many of us, but they will learn it.</span> <span id="s2725">You don’t work through this kind of a trauma.</span> <span id="s2726">You don’t come to terms with it ever, I think.</span> <span id="s2727">But you work on top of it and you try to build some meaningful lives.</span> <span id="s2728">And this is really what’s important, this helps you I think.</span> <span id="s2729">Although I’ve seen many people have done very, very, obtained riches and I don’t consider their lives very meaningful but they kept going.</span> <span id="s2730">It’s really building on top of the trauma, like building on top of a ruin.</span> <span id="s2731">Starting up, what you're doing is there.</span> <span id="s2732">It doesn’t have to destroy your life, that’s my point.</span></p> <p><span id="s2733">Q: So the meaning that you build is always above what happened?</span> <span id="s2734">It’s not that you integrated this meaning?</span></p> <p><span id="s2735">A: I don’t think your fully integrated with the Holocaust ever.</span> <span id="s2736">But I do think that to have, to give some meaning to it.</span> <span id="s2737">To whatever you do, like our lecturing, people come to see you, you have to give testimony.</span> <span id="s2738">We all find some meaning in doing something so the people will not be forgotten.</span> <span id="s2739">This helps us.</span> <span id="s2740">Now, I never feel that this is beneficial emotionally because survivors refuse to get any emotional benefits from the tragedy.</span> <span id="s2741">But to find some meaning in it, either through remembering, through testimonies, through writing, through supporting the State of Israel, through supporting the Museum.</span> <span id="s2742">All of these things give some meaning and they help in going on, I think so.</span> <span id="s2743">It’s mainly helping in transmitting something to the new generations.</span> <span id="s2744">But there are many victims of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2745">People could never really start living again.</span> <span id="s2746">Some have ended up in the State hospitals.</span> <span id="s2747">I give lectures there, at Manhattan State Hospital, Lochin State Hospital, some of the doctors told me that they have casualties of the Holocaust for forty years, they came.</span> <span id="s2748">Nobody understood it there.</span> <span id="s2749">Their tragedies, nobody understood them or somehow or other nobody helped them and they may be there or may be dead but, many people have nightmares.</span> <span id="s2750">My sister still suffers from nightmares.</span> <span id="s2751">I have enough of repressive potential in me that I don’t suffer from that but many people have nightmares, many people have suffered continuous migraine headaches, many people have extreme fears, many have many phobias.</span> <span id="s2752">Many, many gastro-intestinal symptoms from eating glass which was put into bread in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s2753">There are many, many physical and psychological manifestations but, by and large, while we have a large number of these people that are still alive, we have many more, we have many more who have done well.</span> <span id="s2754">Who use this experience in more positive ways, particularly the second generation are very impressive this way.</span> <span id="s2755">They try to give some meaning to their parental experiences.</span> <span id="s2756">I teach along these lines, which means I don’t deny the tragedy and I don’t bely some of the consequences of psycho-pathology nature, but I think that the positives of it, the strength of survivors, is quite impressive.</span> <span id="s2757">Even if they have conflicts of all kinds.</span> <span id="s2758">Many have literally risen from ashes, let’s face it.</span> <span id="s2759">And have formed good families.</span> <span id="s2760">In some families, the Holocaust has led to a lot of conflict, has lead to prejudices, has lead to exclusion.</span> <span id="s2761">But by and large, survivors have had to pave the way.</span> <span id="s2762">Take a look at the Armenians.</span> <span id="s2763">They didn’t have an Armenian Genocide Museum until the survivors built one in Washington, or whatever.</span> <span id="s2764">We are taught a lot of people have suffered massive tragedies to find the meaning in the tragedy.</span> <span id="s2765">I think that Holocaust survivors have truly lead the way to it.</span> <span id="s2766">You and I, we are starting so much more.</span></p> <p><span id="s2767">Q: Let me ask you one question here.</span> <span id="s2768">Given what happened after the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2769">If I just name, Cambodia or Bosnia, or Rwanda, Tibet.</span> <span id="s2770">What, is there a conflict in you about the world you may have learned, maybe it was a lesson you never had to learn, about how wrong this is, but, there seems to be something in the world that repeats.</span> <span id="s2771">And now the world has learned how to do this.</span> <span id="s2772">And it hasn’t said, we won’t do it.</span> <span id="s2773">Only certain people have said it, we won’t do it.</span> <span id="s2774">Is there a kind of conflict in you about, what meaning can you create after the Holocaust if such things can keep repeating?</span></p> <p><span id="s2775">A: I’m not sure I know, definitely, I do not know.</span> <span id="s2776">However, in my course, I integrate the lessons, like some of the experiences in Rwanda.</span> <span id="s2777">The newest, at earlier times when I first started teaching, it was Cambodia.</span> <span id="s2778">Actually, every one of these events triggers off the students questions about it, so I want students to look at it, that it continues.</span> <span id="s2779">What will ever stop it I definitely do not know.</span> <span id="s2780">I do not think it is a psychological thing, I think that it’s in politics, in economics, in geographic dislocations, there are many, many things that brings it to that eruption.</span> <span id="s2781">I think that Yugoslavia was somewhat of a different kind of ball game.</span> <span id="s2782">I don’t compare with it with Rwanda or with Cambodia.</span> <span id="s2783">I have on my bookcase here a book from a girl who survived Cambodia.</span> <span id="s2784">She has a Polish name, She-man-ski (ph) and she’s of Polish parentage I think.</span> <span id="s2785">You know the name?</span> <span id="s2786">It’s called, The Stones Cry Out.</span> <span id="s2787">And it is as tragic as the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2788">And Rwanda certainly is, we’re just so far removed.</span> <span id="s2789">The lesson we haven’t learned is to be identified, is to feel with them.</span> <span id="s2790">Important as you are, I think affect is important, to feel is very important.</span> <span id="s2791">This, I don’t know very well, how we can transmit it.</span> <span id="s2792">That it appears in the New York Times, a very few in this, and then it disappears.</span> <span id="s2793">Some of these things should be held forever in the country for the people.</span> <span id="s2794">We should never forget Rwanda.</span> <span id="s2795">Whom do I know that really knows about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2796">Q: One small question, at the end.</span> <span id="s2797">For example, you mentioned a last name of yours, it appears, Schneider.</span> <span id="s2798">Is that Schneider?</span></p> <p><span id="s2799">A: Neider, my husband’s name.</span> <span id="s2800">Never Schneider!</span> <span id="s2801">His parents name has the German spelling which is N-E-I-D-R.</span> <span id="s2802">His parents already Polandized it, an A-J.</span> <span id="s2803">I had a job once in a very anti-Semitic hotel in the Androdic’s (ph).</span> <span id="s2804">These people hired me, they were Jewish people with a Jewish name, they hired me because my name sounded very non-Jewish, Maria Nedja.</span></p> <p><span id="s2805">Q: Maria, thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2806">A: Thank you for listening.</span></p> <p><span id="s2807">{Viewing pictures]</span></p> <p><span id="s2808">A: This is my father and this picture was taken sometime in the 1930’s.</span> <span id="s2809">I think he was in his late 40’s then or early 50’s, I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2810">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2811">A: Samuel Hirsch.</span> <span id="s2812">Okay.</span> <span id="s2813">This is a picture taken when I was an adolescent, I think, a teen-ager.</span> <span id="s2814">To my right is my sister, Frania, five years older and to my left is Menek’s aunt, his father’s sister, she was killed in the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s2815">Q: Where is Menek?</span></p> <p><span id="s2816">A: Oh, Menek is sitting right there.</span> <span id="s2817">Menek is right there at our feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2818">Q: And who’s the person in the middle?</span></p> <p><span id="s2819">A: That’s me!</span> <span id="s2820">To my left or to the left is my picture taken in early 1943 upon escape from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2821">I wear a Ukrainian shirt and my name then was U-lee-ana Gol-ska (ph).</span> <span id="s2822">The next picture was taken a few months later, I believe.</span> <span id="s2823">I had to change my name to Kash-e-mair Shul-ko-vif-ka (ph), both are 1943.</span> <span id="s2824">This is my husband, Noonik Neider.</span> <span id="s2825">This picture was taken sometime in the middle 1930’s.</span> <span id="s2826">He was killed on February 2nd, or a day later, 1943.</span> <span id="s2827">This is my sister, Frania, and her son, I believe three years old.</span> <span id="s2828">I think this was taken sometime in Re-volf (ph) in 1943, I assume so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2829">Q: And her son’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2830">A: Her son’s name, the Jewish name was Ale-ya-ho (ph), his name under assumed identity was Lash-ick, now he is Dr. Alex Gutterman.</span> <span id="s2831">A professor of social work at Columbia.</span> <span id="s2832">This is me in an army uniform in 1946 in Auto-en-sign (ph), Germany.</span> <span id="s2833">This was called script money, it was money used by the American military personnel and those attached to them, like ANRA or the Joint Distribution Committee.</span> <span id="s2834">It was not available to the population in general.</span></p> <p><span id="s2835">Q: Available in DP camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s2836">A: No, it was not available to DP camps, it was only available to people who were with the American army or the attaché’ personnel like ANRA and the Joint, and it was possible for them to use the money to buy in military stores called PX.</span> <span id="s2837">This is our house in Kolomyja which I photographed, unfortunately, I cut off half of it.</span> <span id="s2838">I photographed it in Kolomyja four years ago when I first visited for the first time after the war.</span> <span id="s2839">It was an extremely difficult trip for me and when I walked up the staircase, I walked up and down, I couldn’t quite make it to the apartment.</span> <span id="s2840">Somehow or other I pushed myself extremely much and I finally went in.</span> <span id="s2841">Downstairs in the olden days was the business.</span> <span id="s2842">The first floor was occupied by the family and on top of the floor was a very big attic which was the maga-zeln (ph) where they kept all the business things.</span> <span id="s2843">But too, this balcony was a very important part of our life.</span> <span id="s2844">It was overseeing the car-so (ph) so we could see what was going on in town, who was dressed well, who was not, and so on.</span> <span id="s2845">To the right, the right windows were what you called the salon or living room.</span> <span id="s2846">To the left were the, was the bedroom of my parents.</span> <span id="s2847">In the back were rooms which had no windows but sky lights.</span> <span id="s2848">One of the rooms was considered the living room one summer and the other was the children’s room.</span> <span id="s2849">And in the back of that was a very big hallway which was used in the summer for all kinds of gatherings.</span> <span id="s2850">On top of it was a tremendous attic and this attic I say was part of the business.</span> <span id="s2851">Now we lived there, the apartment has been divided and was given right after the war by the Soviets, was given to their two Generals so, one of the General’s still lived there, he didn’t want to let me in and the other part belongs to a widow of the General.</span> <span id="s2852">She too refused to let me in, but with a lot of persuasion from the guide, she did open the door.</span> <span id="s2853">I could see inside, it was very neglected and I could see one of our rugs still hanging on her wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s2854">Q: What year was this taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s2855">A: This was 1992.</span> <span id="s2856">I cut it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2857">Conclusion of Interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s2858">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0379 PAGE 10</span></p></body></html>
