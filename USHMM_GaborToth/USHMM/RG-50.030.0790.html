kind of – was your father a very friendly person, or a more reserved person?</span> <span id="s77">What were some of the values that he had?</span> <span id="s78">And I guess the same question about your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Okay, let’s – Mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: The only thing that she was – I call her my gold, my silver, my pearl.</span> <span id="s82">I always call her like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: She – and then I would jump on her leg, hug her and will say that, and I love her so much, she was very, very good to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Now Dad, I think when I was five years old, then he moved in here – to there, to live with us before we work in Wolkowysk, and my sister says that I – when he wanted to ke – to hug me, I would run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: So – so I was always running away from him, until when he stay for good, then I got to know him, and he was very, very good father.</span> <span id="s89">He let us do more things than my mom would –</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: So she was stricter?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: – you know, more dangerous.</span> <span id="s92">Oh yeah, because she worried that we will get hurt, and he would say, that’s okay, let them do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: That’s all – that sounds so much like a mother and a father.</span> <span id="s94">A mother thinks of protection, a father thinks the child has to stretch and grow.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s96">One time we were playing hi – hide and seek, and he put me high on the shelf behind the door in the kitchen, and told me don’t move, sit there.</span> <span id="s97">So I was sitting there and the – and di – the other children were looking in the house, outside, can’t – running forth and back to f – and they couldn’t find me, and I – I was sitting petrified.</span> <span id="s98">So anyway –</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: So did he finally come get you, or did you climb down?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s101">No, no, he – he had to take me down because they couldn’t find me.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s103">So tell me, why did you call Mama – your mama, your gold, your silver, your pearl?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s105">Because I loved her, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: She was everything to me, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s109">Was she a warm person?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: They both were really good parents, you know.</span> <span id="s113">And I remember the last Christmas, that’s 19 – no, 19

decorated, so we came in and then sang the songs, and then opened the gifts, and then my dad would – took me on the lap and started telling story about Jesus, Blessed Mother and Saint Joseph.</span> <span id="s123">And I know it – next morning, I end up in bed.</span> <span id="s124">So apparently I fall asleep.</span> <span id="s125">That’s the best, best time I remember.</span> <span

school with, something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: No, not much, because I kind of was friends with my next door neighbor girl in my age, and those other children just were t – they

id="s186">But I could overhear lot of things, and they were talking that looks like – about Germany, because – and i – at that time, the – we heard airplanes flying close to us, and things like that.</span> <span id="s187">And dogs, they were saying dogs would howl, stand a – heads up, and they said that’s for the war, bad things are coming.</span> <span id="s188">That’s what people were talking, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: That’s what people were talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: And

id="s201">But when they came to arrest my dad first time, I remember that they took all the pictures from the wall, anyplace they could find my dad’s, and took with them.</span> <span id="s202">And then – wait, that was second time –</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: – because first time I wasn’t there –</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Yeah.</span></p>

id="s208">But anyway, they went through – through the house, and then told my dad to dress up good, and you will be coming with us.</span> <span id="s209">And the last day when he was hugging me, he had tears in the eyes, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: And you remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: And we –</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A:

id="s294">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: In village, which was, I don’t know, three, four kilometers away, and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s297">And after your father was taken away, what happened in your family?</span> <span id="s298">What – how – what – how did things go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Well, I know that my brother and my sister tried to help my mom, took care of the fish in that winter pool, and feed the animals.</span> <span id="s300">They did all that stuff, I didn’t, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s302">So you had – as your sister explained earlier, you were – your father had ponds where he raised carp.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Y-Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: And he had to move them from the summer pond to the winter pond.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: And after he was arrested, then – then your sister and your brother were taking care of these chores.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Of that, and the animals –</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: – and the farm, okay.</span> <span id="s311">And did you – did your mother still have help around the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: No, not any more, because that lady came from village Brantowce, that was across the river, I don’t know how many kilometers, and demanded help.</span> <span id="s313">Dad, he lived there too.</span> <span id="s314">So once the Russians came, everything stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Everything stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s318">What’s your next memory then, of that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: When they came to pick us up.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Well, what happened – what I remember, I was in bed sleeping, and then all of a sudden I woke up.</span> <span id="s322">I was covered up with my head with the blanket.</span> <span id="s323">Apparently my mom wanted to hide me.</span> <span id="s324">So all of a sudden that noise next room, doors were closed, and I try to sit down.</span> <span id="s325">And then – and baby crying and all that stuff.</span> <span id="s326">And underneath that door I saw light in the next room.</span> <span id="s327">So I sat down and that minute when I sit down, door open, and the police – that was a soldier, and he saw something moving in bed, right away pointed the gun with bayonet at me.</span> <span id="s328">And from that time, he was after me.</span> <span id="s329">Then I wanted to go to washroom.</span> <span id="s330">I ha-had to go outside.</span> <span id="s331">So he follow me.</span> <span id="s332">And halfway I turn around to see, and he was there walking with the gun after me.</span> <span id="s333">So after I was done, went back to the house, and then that – all noise and, you know, troi – the things were laying on the bed – floors, and bringing in the stuff.</span> <span id="s334">Then the only thing what I did, try to save my pictures that I have f-few pi-pictures in envelope of myself from school an-and that.</span> <span id="s335">So I was protecting them, and I put in the pocket, my jacket pocket, and then apparently, when the soldier put my dad’s long coat on me, and carry me to the sled, apparently somehow that must fall out, that pictures, because when I was on the sled I started looking, couldn’t find.</span> <span id="s336">So I cry, because that’s only – I treasure the pictures, you know.</span> <span id="s337">That’s all what –</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: That’s all you had.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: And that’s all.</span> <span id="s342">And then when they took us, I know that they said that two hours we have to get ready.</span> <span id="s343">But how long it took for them to come back, because some of them had to go and pick up neighbors from our settlement.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: That’s why they had to go and bring them to join us.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Oh, I see, so it wasn’t that the neighbors were outside in the sleds waiting for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: No, no –</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: – they had to – and then bring them back.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: And so by that time, you know, we were already packed too.</span> <span id="s352">And then when we were on this sled, and that when sled tip over, and that one good soldier, he was in charge of group of them.</span> <span id="s353">And when he saw that, he came running, and he starts scolding the driver.</span> <span id="s354">He says, don’t you see they have baby.</span> <span id="s355">Why don’t you be more careful, don’t – you know.</span> <span id="s356">And then he start helping us.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: This is the second day.</span> <span id="s358">That is, the first day –</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: – you’re taken by the sled to this place, this palace.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: And then the second day, as you’re taken to the train station –</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: – your sled tips over.</span> <span id="s365">And why did it tip over?</span> <span id="s366">Was the driver driving too fast?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Or maybe the hole was the in ground, and that’s covered up with snow.</span> <span id="s368">That could be the reason, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A2: It was a turn.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: Yeah, or turn, okay.</span> <span id="s371">But something like that, that if he would be careful, it wouldn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: It wouldn’t have happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: But that one soldier was like – probably he has the family –</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: – left the family, you know, and had to go to, you know – but he was the one to rub us, faces, and this, to protect us –</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: So he would ru –</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: – from freezing.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: – he would rub your faces so they wouldn’t be cold?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Yeah, i – because when he saw that they are turning white, then he knows that it’s – could freeze, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: With the snow sometimes, you know.</span> <span id="s382">And that’s how, you know, they – we were taught in Siberia how to protect ourselves too, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Well, that sounds – it truly does sound like this – this was an amazing soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Yes, that – and then he – sometimes he would come and sit with the driver, where my mom sat, and they were talking – with my mom he was talking, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Oh, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: For – from time to time, because my mom fluently –</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Spoke Russian?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: – spoke Russians, you know.</span> <span id="s389">So he was unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: Wouldn’t be for him, we will be really in bad shape.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: And so I’m going to repeat a little bit of what your sister had said, is –</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: – what made him special is that when, at four o’clock in the morning, everybody in your house was woken up to get ready –</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: – because you’re being deported, when the other soldiers left, he helped – he stayed and he helped your mother pack what she needed to pack.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Right, that I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: So, ge-get items and so on, and helped move them into the sled.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: And in the meantime, the other soldiers were going to your other neighbors’ houses, because they were being deported, too.</span> <span id="s401">Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s403">There are few –</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: From the settlement.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: – I don’t know, two or three other families.</span> <span id="s406">I don’t know, one –</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A2: Two.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: – two.</span> <span id="s409">Two more.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Two other families.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: But they live farther away, so it took time for them to get there and come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: So – and that is why you had this extra time?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s417">All right.</span> <span id="s418">So, tell me if – of any other memory you had on – of the trip going to that train station?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s420">When we get – came by the train, I know that aunt or the grandma, since they found out that – that we are there in that procession, that she follow.</span> <span id="s421">And then when they were putting us in the train, she was there with her husband, and she talk with my mom and then she said, I will take Irena to when gi – it will be il – it – il – easier for you with three children than four children.</span> <span id="s422">But I hanged my mom’s hand so tight, and she was pulling on the other hand.</span> <span id="s423">She couldn’t pull me off.</span> <span id="s424">I cry.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: You didn’t want to go with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: I cry, and beg my mom not to – so I won.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: You won.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: But without my mom and my sister, I’d – I wouldn’t survive, you know, because I was very close with, you know, them both.</span> <span id="s429">Even I was treating bad my sister, but I love her.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Do you think you made the right decision –</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: – at an age nine.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Even though it meant Siberia?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Oh yeah, but I was with Mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: And when you have Mother, you have everything.</span> <span id="s440">Once you lose, you lose everything.</span> <span id="s441">It’s – you see, we lost Father, we lost country, but we had Mother, and that what kept us, you know.</span> <span id="s442">And we try to help her, you know, as much as we could.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Tell me about the journey.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s445">The first train in Białystok, when we boarded –</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A2: Wolkowysk.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: – Wolkowysk, I know was very tight, and I think my mom was on the first –</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Level?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s450">But we – I don’t n – remember in the first train.</span> <span id="s451">I remember good in second.</span> <span id="s452">And then when locomotive make the noise, beep and that, that real – real terrible sound letted out, and then trains start pulling, and my mom fainted, because she knew where they are taking us.</span> <span id="s453">So I think twice she – she fainted.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: She fainted?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s456">That I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: And was your brother crying, your baby brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: At that time I don’t know, but maybe not, at that time.</span> <span id="s459">But we knew that – my mom, we thought that she died, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: You were frightened.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: So that I remember, because she went through World War I, orphan and all that stuff, so she knew what was waiting us, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Tell me about the second train.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Okay –</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: You say that – what happened that you moved from one train to another?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Because of the tracks.</span> <span id="s468">I don’t know, did we had wider tracks, or Russia has wide –</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: I think Russia has wider tracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: So they had to move us –</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: – change.</span> <span id="s473">And there they had two –</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Platforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Plat – yeah, and we were on – my sister and I was on top.</span> <span id="s476">I think my – the same my – with on top, and my moth – moth – mom and brother was on lower.</span> <span id="s477">And we had that little door – no –</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Window.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: – window that was narrow but longer, and we were the lucky one there.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: You could look through the window?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: Yes, take turns, you know.</span> <span id="s482">And was so cold, and you have the big screws on the wall.</span> <span id="s483">They were rusted, and we were thirsty, so I was licking that, because I wanted to drink.</span> <span id="s484">And when – on station, when – on bigger station, the train will stop, then my brother would run and pick up snow.</span> <span id="s485">They let us, I think 10 minutes to – that we can go out.</span> <span id="s486">And like my ti – sister says, you had to go number – you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: You had to go to the bathroom, then it was outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: But sure, I just would turn around to the pu – to the soldier, because th – they always stood with those rifles, and make my business and went back to, you know, at that time, when we were going that way, you know.</span> <span id="s489">Okay, that’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: And that’s what you remember from the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Oh yeah, yeah, that I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: It’s pretty frightening.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: Well, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: Oh yeah, but we had Mother.</span> <span id="s496">That’s why for us – for us, you know, we didn’t worry, because we have her for protection, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: And do you – do you remember how long the tourney – the journey took?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Yes, that – I think March five, or six, or third – I think – wait a minute.</span> <span id="s501">March seven, we arrive in Teshuava(ph), and left on February 10.</span> <span id="s502">So that’s a month without three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Okay, so the journey took almost a month –</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: – to get there.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: And what else – what can you tell me about how things proceeded after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Okay, when we came to the end of the train station, I don’t know the name of that, my sister should know, then we had to leave the train in the – on the sleds, then we had to go – transfer to the sleds.</span> <span id="s509">And like my sister said, the same thing, for night we would stop in the village, and we had to – my mom had to pay something to those people, and so that’s about it, and they gave us hot water that was good, you know.</span> <span id="s510">But they didn’t had much food for themselves, so they didn’t treat with that.</span> <span id="s511">And on the floor we slept.</span> <span id="s512">But it – on – in one house, that older lady, she kind of liked my mom, I guess, and she – I know – I remember because I was following my mom and she was holding the baby, and she says, I want to show you something.</span> <span id="s513">And she went through the house and came to the corner of one room, and she showed her, uncovered, and she showed that holy picture.</span> <span id="s514">And she says, I cannot show to my own children or grandchildren, because they would tell in school, and they will come and arrest her.</span> <span id="s515">So she kept – you know, they kept themselves, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Very quiet.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: Yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: But they bil – tell me, do you remember what that little house looked like?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: I just remember that the room where that – she had that holy picture, that’s all.</span> <span id="s522">But what she had, those things didn’t interest me, just that –</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: The picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: – holy picture, you know, that she had hidden.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s526">And tell me what happened after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: Okay, so the next day, get back on the sled, keep going.</span> <span id="s528">Going there, I could ride.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: Mm-hm, on the sled.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: And I think my sister could ride, I don’t remember if she all the time she could ride.</span> <span id="s531">And when we came to – few times we stay for the night, you know.</span> <span id="s532">Then when we came to our camp Teshuava(ph), then, like my sister told you, with those barracks, they had four and four – you know, one entrance on each side, and they had four rooms in each.</span> <span id="s533">And on the end they had barrack with – if somebody – if they would arrest, they will put you there, in that barrack.</span> <span id="s534">And like if the mother would – wouldn’t want you – send the child to school, Russian school, then she will be arrested and put there.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s536">Were there a lot of people who were –</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: I – that I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: – kept in those barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: That I don’t know, but the – we were told that’s what – and that – that guy that came, bra – brought – drove the taxi to came to pick da – my dad up, you know, to – he lived someplace in that area.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: So when he – was he on another transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: That I don’t – I don’t know if they – he came on the same transport.</span> <span id="s542">Probably.</span> <span id="s543">Prob – but not in our car, not – you know.</span> <span id="s544">It could be in the same transport, you know, because I think just one transport they brought –</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: Everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: – right there, you know, to our camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s548">So he’s the one who had come to first arrest your father, or – or did he arrive to second arrest your father, the second time –</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Second – wait –</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Second time.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: – second time, because the first time I do – he went to the village –</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: – get my dad, so I don’t know what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: And that was January fifth, and a month later, he himself gets deported –</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: – along with that – those neighbors of yours.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s558">What do you mean –</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Well, his aunt – he had an aunt who was your neighbor.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: No, no, not the aunt, no, she wasn’t our aunt, his aunt –</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: That’s right.</span> <span id="s562">Was she deported too?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: No, they stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: They stayed, but he himself was deported.</span> <span id="s567">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: That – but he lived with her in the village – I don’t know Markhelowsta(ph) or something, with hi – whi – he was raised there, and his parents were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: So the –</span></p> <p><span

No.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: Did you have any contact with him while you were in Tushela(ph) – Tushelova(ph) or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: Oh, I have to tell you that.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: They had the big family, he was the biggest one and I – nobody think that he was a son of that family.</span> <span id="s578">And every day I would sit by that little table by the window, just little table like – like this, from this to this, and watch people coming from the store.</span> <span id="s579">He was the only one, many times he would go for the bread.</span> <span id="s580">He was the only one bringing big loaf of white bread.</span> <span id="s581">And – and – and – and besides that lo – big white bread, because that’s well baked so you – you get more, and I think some of that black, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: You’d have a –</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: – and I was always sitting and dreaming, oh, if I could have that piece of bread.</span> <span id="s584">And my – one time my – my mom send my sister for bread and she says, ask them if they could give white bread so she could give to baby.</span> <span id="s585">And she came back, she says no, they wo – they didn’t gave.</span> <span id="s586">He says, we don’t have.</span> <span id="s587">But that family always could get, every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: Isn’t that interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Yeah, that’s – and I never forgot that, because I – you dream ya – how much food you had in Poland.</span> <span id="s590">So when you are starving, you always have that in mind.</span> <span id="s591">You see that big table with food, full of food.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: And why do you think he was able to get this bread?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: No idea.</span> <span id="s594">But I make sure that I will be in that window watching him, and thinking how must been really ta – good to have piece of bread like that.</span> <span id="s595">So that’s all what I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Did he ever speak to you, or you spoke to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s598">He wa – I was kid, and he was grown-up, I don’t know how old he was, maybe more than 20, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: No idea, but well-built, tall and well-built, you know.</span> <span id="s601">That’s a –</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s603">Hang on – hang on just a second.</span> <span id="s604">I know that you are sitting there in the background, Mrs. Stanisława, is this a gentleman – did he belong to that family that informed on other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A2: He was as – just related.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: He was related to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A2: But – but he came all the way here because he was the one of the people that was telling on other Polish meetings, and whatever.</span> <span id="s608">And so his – his treatment of the family was by – as a reward for – for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: Okay, so what – what your sister said is – in her testimony she said that there was one family who got better treatment because they would inform on others.</span> <span id="s610">And I asked whether this man who had been involved in the arrest of your father, was in any way part of this family.</span> <span id="s611">And she said yes, he is related to them, and he got better treatment because he informed on what other people were doing.</span> <span id="s612">Have I got that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A2: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: Yeah, okay.</span> <span id="s615">Thank you.</span> <span id="s616">Do you remember his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: His name, no.</span> <span id="s618">But that other name –</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A2: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: That other name of family, the boy was going with me to school in Mexico.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: He was with parents – oh, I think ho – he had both parents, I think, and I was in orphanage, but in school they kept together.</span> <span id="s623">Was very nice boy that – my age right away, too.</span> <span id="s624">So that [indecipherable] you know, what have you, was really nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: And so you remembered this.</span> <span id="s626">What was – what else do you remember about when you first arrived, and saw those barracks, and saw where you would be living?</span> <span id="s627">Can you tell us, you know, what that looked like?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Well, it was a cold place, that’s one thing, because when we came in there’s no fire, no nothing.</span> <span id="s629">So the on – I remember everything what was there.</span> <span id="s630">The bed, made from boards, bigger bed on one side, and one on that, and that little table with two – I don’t know, benches –</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: Stools?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: Stools, I think, on both sides – no, i – okay, but ther –</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: Stools.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: – for one person.</span> <span id="s635">And that stove was in that corner, and I think, like my sister says, that was – on our side, in that corner was that metal bed where my da – brother, when he came, would come when he had rheumatoid arthritis, he would hang to that bed, you know, from the pain, you know.</span> <span id="s636">And you could hear that movement he was making with that bed, from the pain, you know.</span> <span id="s637">So that – that’s – you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: That’s what you remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: Yeah, oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s641">Do you remember, did anybody come and tell you why you were there –</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: Mm-mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: – why you had been arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: No, not here, but in Poland we knew, because my dad was taking part in World War I fighting, and I think my – when they were collecting like gold or something for the country, then my dad and – gave his, and my mom’s wedding band, donated.</span> <span id="s645">And so that, for that, I think that’s what they put –</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: As the reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: – in his rec-record – record, you know.</span> <span id="s648">That I remember, because that’s what Dad was to – telling, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s650">So when he was released from the first arrest, he said that – that one of the reasons he was arrested was because of that, because of se – you know, his giving some things to support the Polish army.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s652">And they kept records so well, because they knew what he – what he did in the life that he – they knew that he had a gun, a rifle or something, but they took already that one, before the end, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s654">Do you remember when they took the gun?</span> <span id="s655">Were you in the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: That I don’t remember vividly, when they came for that, but I know that they did, because my parents were mentioning that, you know, few times.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s658">And now we’ve just digressed to talk about back in Poland, you know, before that – you were deported.</span> <span id="s659">So let’s go back to this area.</span> <span id="s660">Where – what did the forest look like?</span> <span id="s661">Were you in the middle of a forest?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: No.</span> <span id="s663">The forest, one piece was on the side, on one side of our settle –</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: Your settle – your camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: [indecipherable] camp, the houses, because we have house.</span> <span id="s666">We had three – three or four buildings besides that, you know.</span> <span id="s667">And so that was farther there.</span> <span id="s668">Then one far, far away there, in that direction, and then fields, and then on the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: So the forests were not close in –</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: – they were further away.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: Yeah, but this one was the closest because it fr – I think when they were building their house, then they were cutting that –</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: – forest by the house there.</span> <span id="s675">And you could see it there.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: And what kind of trees were they, were they –</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: Wait a minute, how you call them?</span> <span id="s678">Pines, yeah, pines –</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: Pines.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: – a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Pine tree, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Yeah, na – a lot.</span> <span id="s683">But in one section of the forest, on that side, they had, I think, brzozowy in Poland – Polish, quite –</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A2: Birch.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: Birch.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: Got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: And the only place that the mushrooms grew is in that –</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: – and that’s where we used to like to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Mushroom picking.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s692">And this one had a little blueberries, you know, and strawberries, wild, on the outskirts of –</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: On the outskirts.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: So – so we were lucky, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s696">So – so the settlement, it sounds like this camp area was in a – in an open place, surrounded –</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: Wait, you are talking about Poland, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: No, I was talking –</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: Oh, wait a minute, I was talking about Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: You were talking about your land in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: Oh, no, no, no, no, that’s your home in Poland you were talking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Yeah, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: No, I’m talking about where you were deported to.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Oh, okay.</span> <span id="s706">So, when we were driving, I think, with the train, and with this sled, what you saw, trees, trees, trees.</span> <span id="s707">When they came, that’s why they could transport people in the winter when is everything frozen, because in the area we were, it was swamps, lakes, trees.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: So that – otherwise, in the summer, you cannot escape from there.</span> <span id="s710">And then –</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: Because –</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: Are you surrounded by water?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: Swamps.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: And water, and trees, you know.</span> <span id="s717">There’s no end of the woods.</span> <span id="s718">And when they ke – brought us to camp Teshuava(ph), that used to be trees, but they cut that out for – to make the camp.</span> <span id="s719">So that’s – on one side is the lake, big lake, I think 26 kilometers long, and four or six ki –</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: Wide?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: – wide, yeah.</span> <span id="s722">So here we have lake, and then, surrounded by – by woods.</span> <span id="s723">But little distance, you know, for the camp f – we had f-for buildings.</span> <span id="s724">And that way is north, or what have you.</span> <span id="s725">Then hi – there was a hill, and there was a cemetery.</span> <span id="s726">And to the left, there was a field for them, that guy that was in charge of camp.</span> <span id="s727">So he grew there – I know one – tomat – potatoes he was grow, because one time, after they already collected th-the g – potatoes, harvest the potatoes, then I went, toward the evening, to cemetery.</span> <span id="s728">And then next to was the field, and I thought, maybe I will find something.</span> <span id="s729">So I was looking.</span> <span id="s730">I don’t remember if I found any piece of potato.</span> <span id="s731">But then, when I stood there on that hill on cemetery and looked down, I felt like I am bird in the cage.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: Just see the opening this, and then all woods.</span> <span id="s734">So that’s – that never – I never forgot that, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: So you felt – you were on the top of a hill.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Yeah, that’s cemetery was higher up.</span> <span id="s737">It wasn’t real tall, but it was a hill, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: Was it a large cemetery?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: Oh, pretty – pretty nice size, but how many?</span> <span id="s740">Tha – I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: And what – all else you could – under trees, when you walking – walk in that trees – woods, on some trees you ha – you could see they carved names.</span> <span id="s743">And also, in our room, under the table, when you go underneath, you see some names carved in, so that people, they were before us there.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: But on the trees, some of them, they had too.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: They also had their names.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s748">So we weren’t the first ones to be sended there and die in that place, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: What was the camp manager like?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: Well, I – I don’t know, but apparently he must be not too bad if he gave my mom a glass of milk for baby, because he couldn’t give you much, because if he had one cow, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: And he did that one time, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: I don’t know how many times, but my sister was saying that, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: He gave a glass of milk.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: So he must be not bad, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: Your brother – your older brother, tell me – tell me what he looked like when he went out to work, and when he came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: Okay, so next day they had to go, and they told him to pack, and you have to leave tomorrow with a-adults.</span> <span id="s759">And they took them about, I don’t know, I don’t – that stuck in my head somehow, 30 kilme – kilometers deep in the woods, where they had to cut the trees, and then bring that to the shores, when the lake was – or river was frozen.</span> <span id="s760">That’s what – whole winter they were doing that.</span> <span id="s761">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Was there a camp kitchen?</span> <span id="s763">Was there like a cafeteria?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: They had u – they had kitchen that they had big, big, big that kettle, and they make soup, using dry fish and some noodles, but – but when you got that soup, you were lucky if you had one or two noodles.</span> <span id="s765">You got more worms floating on that, because from dry fish, you know, they spoil, and the worms take over.</span> <span id="s766">So that’s – and one scoop, you know, like soup scoop –</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: Did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: – you get.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s770">Was –</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: And then 40 grams of bread if you had money to buy, for each child or person, that they didn’t [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: So you had – you had a ration, but you had to also pay for this ration.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s774">That’s why we try to help my mom.</span> <span id="s775">We’d go after school and cut wood to – to get some money, or go for cranberry – picking cranberry in the – deep in the woods, to sell, so we will get few ca – cents, you know, for that.</span> <span id="s776">Yeah.</span> <span id="s777">And then we had to – we wanted to help my mom, so we would go, two of us, take the sled, take the saw that’s for two people, and cut the tr-tree down, and then cut in pieces, put on the sled and drag, because it was maybe half hou – half mile, or – or more, yeah.</span> <span id="s778">And that’s – you see that in the summer, the swamps, so they put the big logs where you are walking.</span> <span id="s779">In the winter that’s frozen, so you could walk through –</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: You could walk on that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: – on that, you know, that help.</span> <span id="s782">But we drag that in.</span> <span id="s783">But my mom says, I told you don’t cut so big trees.</span> <span id="s784">It take – you know – but we wanted to do the best we could.</span> <span id="s785">And we knew how to cut because then, when tree was falling, when we found out and we’d [indecipherable] and we will shout, you know, some expression we had, and run to –</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: Run to that place, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: So, you know, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Tell me about your brother, your little brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: Oh, that – you see, when he die on the – the last minutes, I was in the room, and my mom – he was crying.</span> <span id="s790">He had wounds on the neck, and she said, hold his hand, so she wanted to get something.</span> <span id="s791">And I’m holding the hand, and he jerk, and start scratching, and that start bleeding.</span> <span id="s792">And when I saw that, I faint.</span> <span id="s793">And poor mother, I know that she pick me up, put me on the bed, and took care of the baby.</span> <span id="s794">But I don’t know if that was on that day that he die, or next day, but that’s what – I have bad memory of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: Was he very – had – did he – did he – had he lost – did he have any meat on him, was he skin and bones, was he starving?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: Oh, he was starving, for sure, because when my mom had leftover honey cake from Poland, when she finished that, the bread she couldn’t give him, because that was too hard for his stomach.</span> <span id="s797">So I don’t know what she was giving him, but not what he needed.</span> <span id="s798">And that’s why my mom sent my sister to the store, to ask for white bread if they could give at least one pe – little piece of it, you know, but he says no, we don’t have.</span> <span id="s799">But he had for –</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Somebody –</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: – for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: For them he always had.</span> <span id="s804">So I guess that’s, you know, what life –</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: That was very bitter.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: Yeah, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: And do you remember how you buried your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Tell me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: They had – I don’t know who put together the – from the boards, the box, you know.</span> <span id="s811">I say box because, you know.</span> <span id="s812">And the – a little girl died at this same time, so they put two together in the one coffin.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: In one bo – coffin?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: Yeah, she in one side the head, and my baby brother – A2: No, there were two coffins, there was not –</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: I don’t – I s – A2: The [indecipherable] was only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: I reme – oh, I don’t know, but I saw them two laying there.</span> <span id="s817">Because that’s winter, very – A2: They were in a grave, but not –</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: In the grave though, we had the one.</span> <span id="s819">So I don’t know, maybe, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: Your sister is saying that he had his own little coffin –</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A2: Yeah [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: And that she had her coffin.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: But I had something in the head like this, so that’s a –</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: Tha-That there were two of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: But then we went and – every day went to take care of the grave, and we really loved him, and t-took him for walks, and it was – and that’s what my mom said, wouldn’t be for him, she wouldn’t survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: Yeah, he was keeping her – because she knew that without her, he wouldn’t survive too, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s832">So what happened with her later?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: My mom?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: Oh, like when we were in Vologda –</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: No, no, I meant, not in Vologda, but I mean, after he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s838">Oh, she was very sad, but the life had to go on.</span> <span id="s839">Oh yeah, one time – I don’t know, was there two policemen, or what, two military guys, or what.</span> <span id="s840">Two – I think two of them came, and they were going through – all around, and looking for children to take to orphanage, especially the ones that the mothers couldn’t work.</span> <span id="s841">And they came, and they wanted to take my sister and me.</span> <span id="s842">And they didn’t – babies they wouldn’t take.</span> <span id="s843">And we begged my mom – they needed her permission, so we cry and beg.</span> <span id="s844">So he says, I will come toward the evening, and see what, you know, my mom will – what decision she will make.</span> <span id="s845">So whole day we just hang around her and begging not to give us.</span> <span id="s846">And when they came, she says no, I won’t give them, you take this baby.</span> <span id="s847">And they said no, we ca – we – we want those older ones.</span> <span id="s848">And they left.</span> <span id="s849">So we stay with our mom.</span> <span id="s850">So that second time that I almost lost – separated in Poland, and now second time.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: Right, right, from her.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: And it was – and they wanted – th-they – was it that they wanted that she be for – be able to go to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: No, because she couldn’t work.</span> <span id="s855">So this way they knew that she has hardship.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A2: They would kill her.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: So that’s – I think that’s the reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: Wait, I – I don’t understand, that she had ha – they wanted to take you, so that –</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: She will have easier.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: So that she would have it easier?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: Yeah, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A2: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: No?</span> <span id="s866">Well, you can ask her.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: Your sister is saying no.</span> <span id="s868">She thinks – what do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A2: I think they would take her and – and destroy her.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: Your sister is thinking –</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: – that they – if they took you two, then they would have been able to take her out and – and shoot her or destroy her in some way.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: That I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: Yeah, but you know – yeah, it sounds like in both cases, it’s supposition.</span> <span id="s875">You don’t know really why –</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: – why they –</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: – were doing this, or wanted to do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A2: They would do the same what they did with the old people there.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: I see, I see.</span> <span id="s882">Now, did you go to school in this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: Tell me a little about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: Well, we had two in Russian, and they were pretty good teachers because they would teach us how to write so nicely from one line to the other, the letters had to be.</span> <span id="s886">And math was good too, and like they were teaching the – that no – there is no God, we had in my class from the same thing.</span> <span id="s887">Now when the teacher would go and do inspection about each child, and when we – I had the medal, I would put underneath chair’s leg, to hide it.</span> <span id="s888">So this way – otherwise, he would take away from me.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: Oh, you mean a religious medal?</span> <span id="s890">A: Yeah, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s891">And – but – and then we had to learn a lot of poems, Russian poems, everything Russian.</span> <span id="s892">And one time, I was going to school in the morning, was very, very windy, and that gate was loose, had loose boards, and the wind blew, and that big nail, rusted nail went with – in my knee here –</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: In your leg.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: – in the bone, all the way to bone.</span> <span id="s895">So my mom kept me at home, because I was getting infection, and – and one time teacher came to check on me if I am really sick, because otherwise she would lock hi – her in that last –</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: That jail room.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s898">And she had to open up, and then show him that –</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: That you’re really sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Yeah, and with chamomile, she ra – she – she managed to heal that.</span> <span id="s901">But I had to lay all the time in.</span> <span id="s902">But that was the only mirac – thing that she could have.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: That she could think of, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: Yeah, and that we found – well, maybe from Poland we had some, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: Okay, so tell me about how you learned that you could leave the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: Amnesty came.</span> <span id="s907">Amnesty, in July 30, 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: Did you hear about it soon, the – in – on July 3rd, or it – that’s when it was given in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: I don’t know how we heard, but we heard, and then that’s why the man from deep, from the woods there, that my brother – where was my broth – they were coming because they say th-they don’t have any jobs for them.</span> <span id="s910">So ev-everybody at ki – in the camp didn’t – lost their jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: And people didn’t had money, they run out of what they have money.</span> <span id="s913">So that’s why, you know – and then in – when they – my brother heard about the Polish army forming, you know, then, like she told you about the few, those boys in his age, and older men, one or more, they join and went – left us.</span> <span id="s914">And that’s what, you know, you have your information there.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s916">And do you remember leaving the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: I know that the sleds came, but my mom wasn’t pack, and she felt – she has premonition, bad premonition not to leave, you know.</span> <span id="s920">And she didn’t want to leave the baby there, either, you know.</span> <span id="s921">And we beg her, and she just was walking forth and back.</span> <span id="s922">And then one man that was nice to us, you know, that many times helped, I think, with the trunk and things like that.</span> <span id="s923">He came and start hel – putting things, packing and taking to sled.</span> <span id="s924">But our mom didn’t want to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: She didn’t want to leave the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: No.</span> <span id="s927">Something – she felt that bad things will happen, something.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: Isn’t that –</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: I think she – she had, few times, you know, she mentioned, that came true later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: But eventually she did leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: And you did leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: And where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: Oh, to the first – that’s when we could – we – all of us couldn’t ride.</span> <span id="s938">My mom could, and I don’t know if one of – that both of us couldn’t ra – ride.</span> <span id="s939">I think the horses was probably very tired, or something.</span> <span id="s940">And so, like my sister says, we were walking, and one – I don’t know if which day was that, if that’s as first or second day.</span> <span id="s941">We wanted my mom not to worry, so we thought we will run ahead of the – all the – those sleds.</span> <span id="s942">So we ran, ran, ran, until we couldn’t see them.</span> <span id="s943">Then we got cold, and we waited, you know for them to come.</span> <span id="s944">And next morning, I woke up, I couldn’t stand up on my feet, my legs swell all the way here, like big, you know.</span> <span id="s945">So my mom had to carry me, and she, you know, she shouldn’t heavy – lift me at all.</span> <span id="s946">And so she begged that lady that was driving, if she could – one more person could get the ride.</span> <span id="s947">So she – something she gave her that finally she agreed.</span> <span id="s948">So I was sitting and my sister was walking behind.</span> <span id="s949">And in the snow, to walk, that’s not picnic.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: It’s very – and those – when you ride, that’s so many sleds, and that ro – the snow froze, and that makes that special noise when our sn – in Chicago we get below z – zero.</span> <span id="s952">When I went to feed my birds, when I walk, that’s the noise my feet was making.</span> <span id="s953">It’s special, that noise, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: Mm-hm, it crunches, in some ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: And you hear all that noise that, you know, because so many sleds riding.</span> <span id="s958">Anyway, so then on, my sister – and then from time to time my mom will exchange her, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: So – but – but basically – basically you were able to now ride, but your mom would sometimes let your sister sit further –</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: Yeah, because she felt so sorry for my sister, and my sister felt sorry for my mom, you know.</span> <span id="s961">And I felt sorry for both of them, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: And I felt guilty sitting there.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: What could you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: Yeah, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: [indecipherable] What could you do?</span> <span id="s967">And so eventually you reached what place?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: Oh, the first –</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: Place.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: Don’t ask me for names, because she is the one with the names.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A2: Was.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: Now the book.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: Yeah, the book, the book.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: So we stop for the night again, and I think that’s where my mom gave something to that woman to, you know, to bri –</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: You mean the knit hat?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: Maybe that, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A2: My skirt.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: Oh okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A2: Pleated.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: The pleated skirt.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: Oh, okay, it’s – so I could sit there.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: That’s right, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: To make her one like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s987">And tell me, when you got to the train station, what is that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: Oh, I – now, this one, we got – that’s where we – we got – that was di-divided into – so my sister and I on top, and my mom on the – we didn’t had the brother already, so my mom was on the bottom, I guess, I think, if I am not –</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: Mistaken.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: – or maybe she was – maybe – I don’t think she was on top with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: There were another two girls next to –</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: And was it – was this an open car, or was this covered?</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: Covered.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: Covered, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: We did long window, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: They –</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: So it looked the same as the other cars that you had come – been deported in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: And – and so, what happened after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: After?</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: After you got into the car –</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1007">Then, like she says to – I don’t know was Vologda first big stop, I think.</span> <span id="s1008">And because Germans were fighting close to Moscow, that’s why they didn’t know which way the train should go.</span> <span id="s1009">They planned the way we came, they brought us to Siberia around Moscow.</span> <span id="s1010">So they went – wait until they got orders, and so every day they were telling us, we are leaving, we are leaving, okay.</span> <span id="s1011">And then when they really took us, that we wer – they took us through Uran(ph) mountains.</span> <span id="s1012">So to escape –</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: And was your mom with your at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: Not any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: So, in other word –</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: After we left Vologda, we were two of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: So you lost your mom in Vologda?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: Vologda.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: And day before, my mom – we – she went to buy the bread, I went with her.</span> <span id="s1021">And when we were coming close to the – to the car, she says, what you would do when you lose me?</span> <span id="s1022">I said, I never will lose you.</span> <span id="s1023">But apparently she was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: She wa – felt something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: Something.</span> <span id="s1026">And when you si – we were standing, I think two of us, we were in to – standing in the line, when we still had my mom, for that soup and bread.</span> <span id="s1027">And there was wen – man came in, and he was begging you know, to give him something, you know.</span> <span id="s1028">And nobody pay attention to him, then he fall on the ground and start –</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: Shaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: – convulsing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: Convulsing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: And he died.</span> <span id="s1033">And what happened, because when you stand in the line there are windows, you can see what’s going on, in the early mar – morning, the sled comes with two guys, and they are just – one time, there were persons sitting on the bench, was dead, frozen.</span> <span id="s1034">So they just pick him up, throw on the sled, and keep going, and – but that we witness.</span> <span id="s1035">And you never forget that.</span> <span id="s1036">So – and then one – when we were still on the sled, I think going that way, ba – to the freedom, some – when we came to one station, and big noises were ca – somebody was making.</span> <span id="s1037">So my – our mom went to si – when they came to the stop, she went to see.</span> <span id="s1038">And that’s a person was freezing to death.</span> <span id="s1039">So they – he must die.</span> <span id="s1040">And they picked him up, throw on the sled, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: Take him away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: – where they took – take to some big hole, probably.</span> <span id="s1043">That’s the way, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: And so, describe to me how it was that your ma – describe ho-how – how it happened that you got split from your mom.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: Okay, like my sister was saying, that – now, that happened – I know what happened the last minute.</span> <span id="s1046">I woke up.</span> <span id="s1047">That’s what I remember, and that stay in my head.</span> <span id="s1048">I was sleeping, and then I heard soldiers coming and banging on the door, we are leaving.</span> <span id="s1049">So I – I knew that my mom is not there, when I open my – and so I put my jacket on my pajama, shoes without socks, and I wanted – I said, I know where she is, I will go and call.</span> <span id="s1050">And then some man caught me by the arms, and he held, and the doors closed, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1051">That’s what –</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: You remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: – remember what I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: But I know that some other boy went before that, to call those people.</span> <span id="s1056">That happened before, but this is the last time before they closed the door.</span> <span id="s1057">And then, when that happened – I think my sister says that the train back up a little bit, and this, and we thought that was stay in the station, so we were happy.</span> <span id="s1058">But then he changed the tracks, and took off.</span> <span id="s1059">And was just going so fast.</span> <span id="s1060">Never before like that, so fast.</span> <span id="s1061">To us, that’s what it felt, and so here we – we just cry all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: So it meant your mother had left the train to get some food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: Yeah, with few people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: With a few people –</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: Early in the morning –</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: – and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: – when we were sleeping.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: – and she had not come back yet, and the train suddenly starts leaving.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: And it had been stalled for a long time, where every day –</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: A mo – a week or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: For a week or something, where every day, people woul – it was said that the train would leave –</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: – but it never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: And s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: So people didn’t believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: And I think that one lady that was kind of pressing on my mom to – to come, because at first she didn’t want to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: To go to get food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: Yeah, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1082">Because she – you know, you never know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: You never know.</span> <span id="s1084">You never know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: But yeah, you take chances.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: So how did your journey continue?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: Well, I – on big stations, I don’t know how many times a day we stopped, I think 10 minutes they gave us.</span> <span id="s1088">So when we right away jump out, and try to cover as much land as we could, they have very long, wide tracks, you know, wa – many tracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: Platforms, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: And we would run around and call, Mommy, Mommy, where are you, as na – as loud as we could scream.</span> <span id="s1091">And then turn back, run to – because the train would be leaving.</span> <span id="s1092">So couple times it – we almost miss, you know, ourselves.</span> <span id="s1093">But we thought that we will find her.</span> <span id="s1094">So anyplace we went, we were looking for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: And how old were you at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: Eleven, I think.</span> <span id="s1097">It was that – yeah, that’s – 11 – wait, 10 e – yeah, 11.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: Yeah, because that’s ’41, in February, so by that time it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: No, if you left in 1942 –</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: If – wait –</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: You left in 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">A: Oh yeah, okay, you’re right.</span> <span id="s1104">Forty-one – July 30, ’41 was amnesty.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: Yeah –</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: – ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: So you were almost 12 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: You were almost 12.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1113">I think six –</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: And Stella was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: – days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: – yeah, and Stella was how old?</span> <span id="s1117">How old –</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A2: Thirteen.</span></p>

stones.</span> <span id="s1521">And then higher up for writing.</span> <span id="s1522">So after we did that, teacher gave us piece of paper and a pencil, and next day she says, everybody – girls, everybody comes in the dress.</span> <span id="s1523">I came the way I am.</span> <span id="s1524">Didn’t I tell you come with the dress?</span> <span id="s1525">And they didn’t – third day, she

id="s1704">A: Holy Family Academy in Chicago.</span> <span id="s1705">That was nazer – nuns of Nazareth.</span> <span id="s1706">Holy Family of Nazareth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">A: They – they ran this school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">A: And when we – they brought us to mexi – to – here to orphanage, actually I was just three months in orphanage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">Q: What happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">A: I end up in a convent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">Q: Did you join the convent?</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">A: I never dream, I never plan, but I think one time they took us to Rivervi-view, you know, for treat from orphanage, and lot of – I think wa – one girl from my class, she met the nun, and apparently she talked to her, and she says that she wants to go to join them.</span> <span id="s1715">So one time I was coming from dorm out, she was going in.</span> <span id="s1716">She says, I want to say goodbye to you, I am leaving for convent.</span> <span id="s1717">I said, ask my Mother Superior if she would take me.</span> <span id="s1718">I said that, and I forgot that I ever said this.</span> <span id="s1719">Two weeks later, two sisters came, called me to the office there, que – a few questions and they took me.</span> <span id="s1720">Then I had to run and look for my sister to tell her I am going to convent.</span> <span id="s1721">Poor sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">A: She was shock, so she cry and things like that.</span> <span id="s1724">So what I had, few pennies, I gave it to you – to her.</span> <span id="s1725">But that’s how – wouldn’t be for something like that, we probably never will part.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">Q: So did you actually zi – start taking, you know, your orders to become a nun?</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">A: I was too young, so for two years they kept us in school.</span> <span id="s1730">There was six Polish from orphanage, and six American girls.</span> <span id="s1731">So we slept in one room in school, and so I graduated from high school, and then I went to novitiate.</span> <span id="s1732">So I was two years there, in novitiate, and then one year I make the vows.</span> <span id="s1733">For one year you do, for six years.</span> <span id="s1734">And after one year my health was going really down, you know, I lost lot of weight and my blood was going down, down.</span> <span id="s1735">The doctor didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s1736">And something – something was telling me you have to leave.</span> <span id="s1737">So I told the Mothers Provincial that I would like to leave – and because next day they would renew the vows.</span> <span id="s1738">Now that I wanted to leave, I left in the evening, without any get permission, nothing, because you make vows for one year.</span> <span id="s1739">And every year you renew, if you want to stay.</span> <span id="s1740">And when you s – after six years, if you would make the vows, the last one, then if you want to leave, you have to get from Pope –</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">A: – permission.</span> <span id="s1743">So I didn’t had to – I call my sister and – and she told my dad – he already came to this country.</span> <span id="s1744">They came in the evening, pick me up, and that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">Q: Had you already seen your dad?</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">A: Yeah, not before.</span> <span id="s1747">Wait, when he came first time, a year before – well, maybe not even that, then they came – A2: Three months earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">Q: Yeah, three months earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">A: So they came to visit me.</span> <span id="s1750">I was working at that time in hospital.</span> <span id="s1751">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">Q: And then after that, how did your life develop, how did your life unfold?</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">A: I stay with my sister, she was married for two years, I think.</span> <span id="s1754">For two weeks she took care of me, make me breakfast, told me to sleep, because I lost a lot of weight.</span> <span id="s1755">Build me up fo – after two weeks her husband went with me and – to look for a job.</span> <span id="s1756">I got the job, and I still lived.</span> <span id="s1757">Then I met my husband, and that’s the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">Q: And when did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">A: July 11th, 1955.</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">Q: And your husband’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">A: Bernard Sobczak.</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1763">Do you have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">A: Four.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">Q: What are their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">A: Kristy(ph), Don, Sue and Michael.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1768">Is there anything else you’d like to add to what we’ve talked about today, that you think is important for people to know about your experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">A: Oh, the only thing, you have to believe in God.</span> <span id="s1770">Pray, believe and what else – believe?</span> <span id="s1771">I think there’s one more thing, I think – and everything will turn out okay.</span> <span id="s1772">But without faith, have faith.</span> <span id="s1773">If you don’t have faith – we always thought that we will find our mo – parents, and – but that was carrying us through.</span> <span id="s1774">And pray, and – oh, and cry.</span> <span id="s1775">We cry.</span> <span id="s1776">One cry, the other starts.</span> <span id="s1777">This one stop, the other s – and so our pillow was always wet in the night, you know, we cry in the night.</span> <span id="s1778">People didn’t know that we are crying, you know.</span> <span id="s1779">But that’s what the – crying, praying and faith, that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">Q: That’s what kept you going.</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1782">And faith when – anytime in the life you have hardship, that’s what faith helps you through, you know.</span> <span id="s1783">So – but help.</span> <span id="s1784">God plan everything.</span> <span id="s1785">I never planned to go to convent, I was very happy there.</span> <span id="s1786">They were very good to me.</span> <span id="s1787">They didn’t want me to leave, you know, but that’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">Q: Well, you had a voice inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1790">And my husband was writing to one girl that he met before he came to United States because he was born in United States, but caught by war.</span> <span id="s1791">So he was a citizen.</span> <span id="s1792">And he was writing for six years, and then he stopped, and – and I got out of the convent, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1793">And through my sister I met him because we were going to downtown for swimming suit, and we came off from the bus, we were crossing the street to pick up the subway, and in the middle – he was coming from the other side.</span> <span id="s1794">So we met each – in the middle, so we walk back to the edge with him.</span> <span id="s1795">My sister says, Bernie, meet my sister Irene.</span> <span id="s1796">Irene meet my friend Bernie.</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">Q: And there it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">A: Three months later we met by ourselves.</span> <span id="s1799">But that was the middle of the street, the – if I would then meet at that time, probably I wouldn’t meet him, because you know, I wouldn’t accept – if he would ask me to dance, maybe I wouldn’t accept.</span> <span id="s1800">But he was good-looking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">Q: Wonderful things can happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">A: Yeah, it is –</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">A: – bad childhood, but later on I was lucky to have happy, you know, life.</span> <span id="s1805">So – and 56 years together we live.</span> <span id="s1806">So that’s a –</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">Q: That’s a –</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">A: – blessing, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">A:
