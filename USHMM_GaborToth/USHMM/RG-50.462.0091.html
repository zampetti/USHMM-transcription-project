have to be on the rich people's bunkers, what they ask, or to run away somewhere in the forest.</span> <span id="s850">And I was the one, very much I bothered my husband, and said, "I want to live--I want to live!"</span> <span id="s851">He didn't got the patience.</span> <span id="s852">Oh, he was a good leader, he know where to go, he know the town and he knows how to be quiet, a good leader.</span> <span id="s853">So, I say, let's run away, and everyday he says, tomorrow, tomorrow.</span> <span id="s854">I got a good friend who was working with me and he promised me that he would take me to this bunker with no money.</span> <span id="s855">He liked me, and he told us that Thursday night he will come and he will take us.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">JF: This was a Polish

you going to take us?"</span> <span id="s862">and he said, "Friday for sure," and he didn't show up.</span> <span id="s863">So Saturday night we run away.</span> <span id="s864">There was seven of us.</span> <span id="s865">We decided to cut the fence.</span> <span id="s866">The fence was made from wires.</span> <span id="s867">My husband cut the fence.</span> <span id="s868">I was the only woman and five men--six men--there were seven people, and we run out.</span> <span id="s869">It was very hard to run out because a dog came and the dog was probably guided by police or something.</span> <span id="s870">So the dog started barking and the men run away and I stay with the dog and he walked away from me.</span> <span id="s871">He stays a little and then he walked away, and it was quiet and the men saw that I am not there and they came back and we start going.</span> <span id="s872">There was a field, from corn, you know, a field, how you say?</span></p> <p><span

Sunday.</span> <span id="s876">We hear all of the shoots.</span> <span id="s877">This guy who promised us to take us to Lemberg shoot them all.</span> <span id="s878">So I don't know how many survived.</span> <span id="s879">There were 500 people.</span> <span id="s880">They trusted him.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">JF: And, these were the only people that were left from the entire ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">LM: Yes.</span> <span id="s883">From our ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">JF: From your ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">LM: From our Zwangsarbeitslager because the ghetto was liquidated long ago.</span> <span id="s886">The seven people we fall asleep because we were so tired and disgusted, and when we woke up three had disappeared.</span> <span id="s887">Three disappeared; they went by themselves somewhere, and my husband, an older man and a son, 16 years old, we stayed together.</span> <span id="s888">And we went a little further and my husband decided to go in the direction of his father was years ago worked.</span> <span id="s889">He was agronom [agronomist].</span> <span id="s890">He told me that he had some friends there, some Polish people, and maybe they will help us.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">JF: When your father-in-law was involved in the agrarian development...</span></p> <p><span id="s892">LM: He died before the

from Tarnopol, a village.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">JF: Let me ask you one question before you go on.</span> <span id="s898">You had said that you were pregnant.</span> <span id="s899">Were you still pregnant at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">LM: I lost--the baby was born in this hospital.</span> <span id="s901">I don't know; they probably killed it or something.</span> <span id="s902">He was alive--it was seven months, you know because of the work--and they didn't want to help the kids.</span> <span id="s903">Like before I worked, I was a midwife there and a German man came to me and he said, "Don't let the little kids suffer.</span> <span id="s904">They will kill them anyway.</span> <span id="s905">Give them a pillow, put it on their faces.</span> <span id="s906">And let them better die," so I don't know what they did to my child.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">JF: This was in the hospital where you had worked in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">LM: Yes.</span> <span id="s909">When I got my baby, the baby was born and in the morning they came and told me that the baby is dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">JF: You saw the baby

baby right away and...</span></p> <p><span id="s914">JF: It was born alive though.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">LM: Yes, it was a seven-month baby.</span> <span id="s916">It was a little boy, and two days later I went to work.</span> <span id="s917">I worked on the building.</span> <span id="s918">So, I was carrying heavy things and I became very sick.</span> <span id="s919">I came to the same hospital and they told me that I had typhus and they wanted to take me to the typhus department where you never would go out, so I started begging them.</span> <span id="s920">I said--it was doctors I knew, there was still Jewish doctors around then, too--and I said, "It is not possible that I have typhus because I have high temperature.</span> <span id="s921">I think, it is my uterus because I worked hard carrying and I think this I have."</span> <span id="s922">And the next day I became better, the temperature went down.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">JF: Were they able to give you any type of medication?</span></p> <p><span id="s924">LM: They probably gave me something and they didn't put me in the typhus department, so I was so lucky.</span> <span id="s925">I survived this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">JF: Now, you are back, we went...</span></p> <p><span id="s927">LM: Yes.</span> <span id="s928">I am back in the fields where we went and we tried to find some place to hide.</span> <span id="s929">So walking around there we met a woman.</span> <span id="s930">It was evening, late, and we was very hungry; we didn't eat for three or four days.</span> <span id="s931">We didn't have anything to eat.</span> <span id="s932">So she says that she will give us some food if we trust her.</span> <span id="s933">And she told us, "You know what, not far away is a broken house.</span> <span id="s934">When the Russians came, they took out the rich people to Siberia and they burned the house.</span> <span id="s935">So go there, maybe you will find some hiding."</span> <span id="s936">And she gave us bread and she gave us some milk, and it was very nice of her and she say once in a while...</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Tape Two, Side Two:</span></p> <p><span id="s938">JF: We were talking about the family that, or the woman that directed you to this burned-out house.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">LM: So we find there like a great patch, where you put potatoes, and we went there all four of us, the man with his son, my husband and I, and we stayed there.</span> <span id="s940">And around was fields, so nighttime we took a look around and we got some cabbage, beets and potatoes.</span> <span id="s941">I couldn't eat the potatoes, but the cabbage was delicious, the best food.</span> <span id="s942">And we was walking around and stealing, to have something to eat.</span> <span id="s943">And once in a while we went to her, not too often because we was scared to go there.</span> <span id="s944">And she got a man whose name was Peter, and she told us, "Be careful with Peter, because he is Ukrainian."</span> <span id="s945">And she wants to be very good because her husband was taken by the Russians out, you know, and she wants to be good to us, and maybe later can help us when the Russians will come, you know.</span> <span id="s946">She liked my husband very much and she wanted him to come to live there, but he don't want to.</span> <span id="s947">So my husband made a poem; it says, [in Yiddish]: "In der finsterer Nacht Zwishen Felder und Welder</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Weit von Menschen</span></p> <p><span id="s949">gehen zwei Menschen Strecken mit a Messer in der Hand Sie gehen, sie suchen Sie willen gefinen epes zu essen Zu bleiben an Leben zu erzäblen der Welt</span></p> <p><span id="s950">was hot übergelebt" [In the dark night between fields and forests far away from people</span></p> <p><span id="s951">two human beings strain with a knife in hand They walk, they search They want to find something to eat</span></p> <p><span id="s952">to stay alive to tell the world</span></p> <p><span id="s953">what they survived]</span></p> <p><span id="s954">JF: Can you translate that for me?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">LM: My husband was always walking around between fields and forests and he was always saying, "In the fields, two people in the dark, dark night was walking around and digging and looking, maybe they will find some things to eat to keep our lives and be able to survive and tell the story of what happened to the European Jews."</span></p> <p><span id="s956">JF: Where were you sleeping during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">LM: In this hole.</span> <span id="s958">My husband always was a builder.</span> <span id="s959">He built.</span> <span id="s960">He took some branches and he made like a bed on the hole, and he digged out deeper and deeper and put this on the top of this bed to make place for the people.</span> <span id="s961">Now I have to talk about--we was there and one night going to the woman for food we met a man who he says, "Amchuh."</span> <span id="s962">[phonetic] Amchuh means, "I am a Jew."</span> <span id="s963">so we got another companion.</span> <span id="s964">We took him to our house.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">JF: Was this word a code name?</span> <span id="s966">Or was this a term?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">LM: It is Hebrew, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">JF: Amchuh.</span> <span id="s969">Is Hebrew?</span></p> <p><span id="s970">LM: Yes.</span> <span id="s971">So he was living with us for a while and then was going there to this woman for food once in a while.</span> <span id="s972">One night they decided to go just three of them, leaving me and the boy there.</span> <span id="s973">And they left.</span> <span id="s974">And it was a funny thing, I got a dream.</span> <span id="s975">I was dreaming, like, somebody is running after my husband, like, a German and he wants to kill him and I say--and the German, it was very dark and you couldn't see him and the German went to take a light (this was my dream).</span> <span id="s976">And I said, "Oh, thank God, he is not going to caught him because he will have time to run away."</span> <span id="s977">And I hear something and talked to the boy who was with me together and I said, "Leo, did you hear a shot?"</span> <span id="s978">And he said, "No, this must be the bed from the branches."</span> <span id="s979">And we didn't know the time, we didn't know anything, and we went back to sleep.</span> <span id="s980">It was already daytime, and I saw daytime and they are not here, and I said that something happened.</span> <span id="s981">Then my husband jumped in and his heart was beating like, how you say, boom, boom, boom and I said, "Boomek [phonetic]."</span> <span id="s982">And he said, "Where are they, where are they, the two men?"</span> <span id="s983">And he said, "People were after us, and they was shouting and shooting.</span> <span id="s984">And I don't know where they are.</span> <span id="s985">I went straight to the forest."</span> <span id="s986">He was the youngest one; they was two older people.</span> <span id="s987">They were shot.</span> <span id="s988">The boy became hysterical, he jumped out right away--not right away, we went to the forest and then later, at nighttime, he went to look.</span> <span id="s989">He said, "I have to see where my father is," and he find him burned to death, shot and burned.</span> <span id="s990">The other man we never found.</span> <span id="s991">So we decided to leave the hole and go somewhere.</span> <span id="s992">The son told us that he is going to Tarnopol, six miles, that he has some friends and, maybe, they will be able to keep him.</span> <span id="s993">My husband decided to go to the place where he was always vacationing when his father was alive, and there on the corner of the edge of the village was a shoemaker, a single man, Bolek [phonetic] was his name.</span> <span id="s994">And he says, "I will stop to Bolek, maybe, he will help us."</span></p> <p><span id="s995">JF: This was a non-Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">LM: We came, it was night time, to the barn, and went up to the attic and stayed there for three days, not telling him that we were there.</span> <span id="s997">And we was eating some seeds, like, corn seeds, and I was thinking that I am going to die.</span> <span id="s998">I got terrible pain in my...</span></p> <p><span id="s999">JF: Head?</span> <span id="s1000">Temples?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">LM: Temples, and I was begging my husband to let him know that we are in the house, and he was scared.</span> <span id="s1002">He said, "Maybe, he will kill us, who knows?"</span> <span id="s1003">We, you know, took over his attic and when it became dark, he started calling "Bolek, Bolek."</span> <span id="s1004">When Bolek hears our voice, he closed up all the doors and he came upstairs.</span> <span id="s1005">He was a very religious man, he crossed himself and he said to him, "Bolek, it is you, you have already a wife?"</span> <span id="s1006">He knows him from a little boy.</span> <span id="s1007">And he went and he gave us food, like, tea and bread, and we told him the whole story and he kept us for five weeks in the attic feeding us very nicely, bringing every day milk and bread.</span> <span id="s1008">And after the five weeks he told us that he is scared, he is scared to keep us, because his life was in danger.</span> <span id="s1009">"Go look around," he says.</span> <span id="s1010">"Find somebody, maybe, other people that were your father's friends, but remember one thing," he says, "my door will never be locked," and he left.</span> <span id="s1011">We left the dark night, it was very dark and rainy and it was maybe two o'clock and we hear somebody walking and it scared us very much.</span> <span id="s1012">It was another man who knew him, he worked with his father and he gave us an idea to go in the fields, as in the summer when they cut the corn, the wheat for bread.</span> <span id="s1013">They make a house like this.</span> <span id="s1014">He said, "Go in there and I will help you; stay there and I will bring you food."</span> <span id="s1015">He opened up some, pulling out pieces, you know, made like a hole and we went in.</span> <span id="s1016">We stayed in there all day and it was very hard to stay, so I probably pushed my foot back and forth and opened up the place and some people came and they discovered us.</span> <span id="s1017">They said, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s1018">We will take care of you.</span> <span id="s1019">You don't have to run.</span> <span id="s1020">Don't be scared."</span> <span id="s1021">My husband said, "Okay.</span> <span id="s1022">We will stay a while," and they left and we run away.</span> <span id="s1023">We run away.</span> <span id="s1024">We run back to the same hole where we stayed in before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">JF: Where the house was that had been burned down?</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">LM: Yeh, in this same hole.</span> <span id="s1027">We left because we was scared after the two people was killed; we was afraid that we would be discovered.</span> <span id="s1028">So we went back there and we stayed there and every three weeks when it was very, very dark, was very cold, rain or snow then we went to this Bolek's house and went to the attic and let him know that we were there and he gave us food.</span> <span id="s1029">He gave us potatoes, he baked up potatoes, and brought some bread and milk and the next night we went back to the same place to stay.</span> <span id="s1030">But we got food so we was very happy.</span> <span id="s1031">We was lucky, and this was in February.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">JF: February of what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">LM: 1944, and we came from Bolek's house and we discovered that our place was falling apart from the rain and from the snow, the water.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">JF: You mean the hole.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">LM: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">JF: It was falling apart.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">LM: Yes, it was falling apart.</span> <span id="s1038">So my husband says, "We cannot stay here, we have to run back to Bolek's."</span> <span id="s1039">We went back to Bolek's and we stayed there but not letting him know for two or three days and then we told him that we're there.</span> <span id="s1040">He says, "Okay, I am preparing food for you downstairs and you will take the food and go back.</span> <span id="s1041">Don't go back to the hole, it's dangerous."</span> <span id="s1042">But not far away was a woman and she was helping us with food, too.</span> <span id="s1043">She was a widow, her name was Mrozowa.</span> <span id="s1044">"She will probably keep you.</span> <span id="s1045">Go there in the attic and stay there; don't let her know."</span> <span id="s1046">So we went there and we stayed and we was supposed to go out, and in the meantime, there was knocks on the door, knocking and some noises and the Germans were knocking on the door to let them in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">JF: This was at Bolek's house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">LM: At Bolek's house the Germans came.</span> <span id="s1049">They was running away already.</span> <span id="s1050">In Tarnopol was already fights with the Russians with the Germans.</span> <span id="s1051">And this was near Tarnopol, it was six miles, and they was running away.</span> <span id="s1052">They stayed two days in Bolek's house.</span> <span id="s1053">And we couldn't reach the food; we was staying upstairs with no water and no food and already dying.</span> <span id="s1054">So it was my husband's birthday, and I say, "Today has to come the Mashiach [Hebrew for Messiah]."</span> <span id="s1055">And in the roof there was an opening from the straw--the roof was made of straw--so some snow came in, so we went and we picked up--my husband couldn't walk, he was lying, but I reached there.</span> <span id="s1056">I took some snow and we was, you know, all covered.</span> <span id="s1057">I don't have to tell you with all kinds of louse.</span> <span id="s1058">We was like skeletons already and we got this water, this little bit of snow and we was very happy to be alive.</span> <span id="s1059">And then, maybe it took a few hours we hear some Russian voices and I went and I saw some Russian people, but we was scared of Russian people, too, because there was a lot of Russians that in the time of the war they became friends with Hitler.</span> <span id="s1060">It was a special, I forgot, this general's name who came to Hitler's side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">JF: A Russian general who came and worked for Hitler and served under Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">LM: Yes, and the Russian people they was all around.</span> <span id="s1063">And a lot of Jews, they hear people talking Russian and they think the Russians came and they went out and they was killed this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">JF: Did this Russian general bring Russian troops with him to work for the German army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">LM: He was a general with the army.</span> <span id="s1066">But they went over--I forgot his name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">JF: So, the general and some of the Russian troops went over to the German side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">LM: Yes, this was in the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">JF: In the beginning of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">LM: Yes, and they was in the ghettos all over, and a lot of people was thinking the Russians are here so they went out and in this way they was killed.</span> <span id="s1071">So we was very careful not to go out.</span> <span id="s1072">In the meantime we was hearing, they talked, like, "Is Germans around here, Germans in your house?"</span> <span id="s1073">And he said, "No, no."</span> <span id="s1074">And they came to the attic and they didn't see us; we could be killed by them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">JF: By the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">LM: Sure, because--they came and they looked and they didn't see us.</span> <span id="s1077">This was our luck, too, and they went down.</span> <span id="s1078">Then Bolek came to us and he said, "Please don't go down stairs," and he gave us food.</span> <span id="s1079">"Stay here for a while because the fight is going on and who knows, maybe, in five minutes the Germans can be back, so be quiet and I will tell you when."</span> <span id="s1080">So, it took two days and we were still in the attic there.</span> <span id="s1081">And two days later, he took us downstairs, and we went to the other woman and she made a beautiful meal which she fed us and we met a lot of soldiers, Russian soldiers, and they was very nice, and one of them talked Jewish to us, and he said, "You are Jews?</span> <span id="s1082">You survived?</span> <span id="s1083">You better run away, right away.</span> <span id="s1084">Take a stick--because I was not able to walk--take a stick and run, because we are fighting now and a few hours, the fight can be, you know, the fight can be this way, this way."</span> <span id="s1085">In the meantime, Tarnopol was fighting six weeks--six weeks we were on the other side we couldn't go to Tarnopol, to our home, and we left the same day that he told us.</span> <span id="s1086">We met another Jewish man who came out from the forest, and all three of us went to Zbarazh, not far from this.</span> <span id="s1087">When we came to Zbarazh...</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">JF: How do you spell it, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">LM: Z-B-A-R-A-Z, and when we came to Zbarazh, we want to go in, in the town, and some Jews came out and they told us, "Run away from here, run away.</span> <span id="s1090">They will take this man and this man and even you to the Russian army."</span> <span id="s1091">My husband was with a long beard, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">JF: The Russians would take you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">LM: Yes, to the
