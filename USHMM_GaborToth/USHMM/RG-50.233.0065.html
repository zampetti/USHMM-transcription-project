in Zdzieciol, Poland.</span> <span id="s5">He says it always had anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s6">In 1937, signs were posted demanding a boycott of Jewish-owned shops.</span> <span id="s7">After war broke out, Jewish property was confiscated, including the Laro’s six-room house.</span> <span id="s8">Aaron and others hid weapons in the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A ghetto was built in January 1942 in Novogrudek (Navahrudak, Belarus), and Jews had to move there and wear the yellow Star of David.</span> <span id="s10">He says there were two massacres, but speaks of only one, in April 1942, when 800 people were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">He escaped from the ghetto and joined partisans in the woods.</span> <span id="s12">He was a machinist, and repaired tanks and other vehicles they found.</span> <span id="s13">They also found Jewish families hiding in the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Russians split the Jews from the partisans.</span> <span id="s15">Anti-Semitism was strong in the woods.</span> <span id="s16">But a Russian major threatened to kill all partisans if any one of them killed a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Aaron made a detonator that derailed a train going to Vilna.</span> <span id="s18">Then, he helped derail three more trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">The Russian army liberated them in 1944, and without letting them wash or rest, incorporated them into their troops.</span> <span id="s20">Aaron fought in many battles, and still has a bullet near his heart, a piece of shrapnel in his head, and a leg injury.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">After a month in a hospital where he recuperated from the bullet wound near his heart, he was made a sergeant.</span> <span id="s22">He deserted from the Russian army in autumn 1944.</span> <span id="s23">He emigrated to the United States in June 1947, with the woman who had been with him throughout their time in the woods.</span> <span id="s24">They married in the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Aaron said that as a Jew, he “didn’t regret for one minute” the blood he spilled fighting against Nazi Germany “because I took revenge for my family and for the six million Jewish people.”</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Interview My name is Aaron Laro.</span> <span id="s27">I was born March 23, 1919.</span> <span id="s28">Zdzieciol, Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Can you tell me a little about your childhood?</span> <span id="s30">And also where you grew up, a little bit about your town, a little bit about your childhood and also about your parents, what your father did, you know, what your mother did … I was born in a small town in about -- actually by the end -- before the war we were about 4,000 Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">You remember anything that stands out in your childhood when you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">No?</span> <span id="s34">Okay, that’s all right.</span> <span id="s35">Did you have brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">I had one brother and two sisters… Don’t mind me when I’m writing, you can just keep talking, don’t worry about it.</span> <span id="s37">Can you tell me a little bit about your parents, what your father did for a living, and that kind of thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">My father did two things, he was a shoe maker and then had a shoe store partnership.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Who was he a partner with, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Well, one moved to Israel.</span> <span id="s41">His partner was Altavanietsky and Elovitch(?)</span> <span id="s42">(27).</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Do you remember, like, the street that you lived on?</span> <span id="s44">Do you remember much about the area you lived in before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">I remember, what… Anything distinctive that you remember about it, you know?</span> <span id="s46">What the houses may have looked like?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Well, we had in 1935 a fire, which a tenth of the town burned down.</span> <span id="s48">And after that came up a beautiful town; they made beautiful streets with sidewalks and nice homes made out of wood, and gold metal roofs, gold metal roofs mostly, and was nice painted, and government forced people to make picket fences and paint them white yes, was very clean, very clean.</span> <span id="s49">Was a big change in 1935.</span> <span id="s50">My father built a big six room house, beautiful house -- but it didn’t last long.</span> <span id="s51">In 1939 the war broke out, actually broke out in ‘41, and we lived only six years in the new house.</span> <span id="s52">Everything was taken away.</span> <span id="s53">Now gentiles are living over there, we had to just run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Do you remember when you were growing up?</span> <span id="s55">Oh, first let me ask you where did you go to school?</span> <span id="s56">Did you go to a public school or a private school or a… It was a private Jewish school.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A private Jewish school.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">What was the school like?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">What do you mean what was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">What did you study there?</span> <span id="s61">What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Well, Polish was what you say in English, compulsory, you had to.</span> <span id="s63">So we had every day one hour of Polish and Polish history, Jewish and Hebrew, we had a gym, we had a teacher for sport, gymnastic.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Did you play any sports?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Yeah, we used to have performances twice a year on Hanukkah and on Purim.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Do you remember any instances of anti-Semitism when you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">It was always anti-Semitic over there, in Poland and in Russia, everybody knows it.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Do you remember any, you know, instances that stand out in your mind that were that, you know, specifically remember that really you can recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">About anti-Semitism?</span> <span id="s70">Well, in 1937 when Hitler start spreading all over, they put up signs on the walls on the Polish church that the gentiles should boycott Jewish people, not shop from Jewish people.</span> <span id="s71">That’s the most outstanding moment.</span> <span id="s72">Otherwise was tolerable, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s73">Jewish people go ahead traveling the villages, buying from the farmers their product.</span> <span id="s74">I could hear sometimes a slur, or something else, but when my father was young they had pogroms.</span> <span id="s75">In Russian times, it was much worse.</span> <span id="s76">Poland was a democracy but the Pas Outsky [ph] was a general, and he had them under control, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s77">It was half democracy and ruled by a general so…and he was not a little bit sympathetic to Jewish people.</span> <span id="s78">But then the anti-Semitism was spreading all over Poland.</span> <span id="s79">Hitler penetrated Poland in the ‘30s and it was getting worse and worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Were people in your town afraid of the Nazis?</span> <span id="s81">I mean, did you know what was going on in Germany at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Well, obviously every German knew.</span> <span id="s83">Somebody going tell you they didn’t notice is baloney.</span> <span id="s84">Only if they couldn’t read and didn’t know what was going on in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Did people leave?</span> <span id="s86">Were they that frightened that they would leave Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">They weren’t that frightened?</span> <span id="s89">They just—</span></p> <p><span id="s90">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">But they knew what—you know, most people knew what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Wait one second, you see the Jewish people in western Poland, when they were occupied by Nazi Germany, they were escaping to Russia, in our territory.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Going the other way?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">That’s why every town where we lived we had a lot of displaced persons, what you call them, runaways?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Refugees, we had a lot of refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Who were coming—?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">But we had nowhere to run.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">We were ready.</span> <span id="s101">I remember that too.</span> <span id="s102">We got our bicycles, we took our belongings.</span> <span id="s103">When the war broke out, we figured we were going to run to Russia, but the Germany army was moving so fast— It caught up to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">It caught up to kill, they bombarded on the highways and a lot of our people came back, they came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Mmhmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">But a couple days later it was 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">The Russian army came over and we were liberated and under the Russians we didn’t show anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s109">Jewish people got better jobs.</span> <span id="s110">You know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Jewish people got better jobs and, while we were partisans, we had anti-Semitism again.</span> <span id="s113">And an aunt was raped and killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">And that’s on the Russians side?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Yeah, partisans, we were together in the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">They disarmed Jewish partisans for any little thing.</span> <span id="s118">If a gentile took boots from a farmer, it was nothing, but if a Jew took a pair of boots, they killed him.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Can you tell me, you were just talking about collecting you know, bicycles getting ready to run to the Russian side.</span> <span id="s122">Can you tell me about that period where, the Germans are coming and you know they’re invading and you’re running away.</span> <span id="s123">Can you tell me about that, like what kind of preparations you made to run to the Russian side, what you took?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">I took about… We went through that strategy twice, in 1939 but it lasted two days because soon we hear on the radio that the Russian army cross the border and are coming to liberate us, we weren’t scared anymore, because the Germans were still 150 kilometers from us.</span> <span id="s125">And we knew that they divided Poland (#102) in half, so we were jumping in the skies, we are so glad.</span> <span id="s126">The Russians are coming.</span> <span id="s127">We didn’t know at that time they were anti-Semites, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">But everybody thought communism is the ______ coming for Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Did your whole family try to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Run away or… No, no, you have small kids it’s very hard.</span> <span id="s133">But the worst problem was in 1941 when the war started with Russia, so people ran away and the Russian army cut them off, the German army, and they come back, and we were stuck in ghettos.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Right, Okay.</span> <span id="s135">Why don’t you tell me a little about when you start to run away and then the Russians come in and you first see the Russians the first time in 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">I’ll give an example.</span> <span id="s137">I was already 19 years old.</span> <span id="s138">I wasn’t so emotional, but my younger brother, I remember he was kissing the Russian tanks.</span> <span id="s139">Yeah, people were climbing on the tanks and kissing them, because it was difference between life and death.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Sure.</span> <span id="s141">How far did you run before you knew that the—just, you said something about two days, but how far did you get away from your town before… Not far, not far because right away we could hear on the radios, the Russian army’s coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Okay, can you tell me, when the Russians come in and take over that area of Poland, what was it like?</span> <span id="s143">I mean, what did they do?</span> <span id="s144">Did they, you said there was some anti-Semitism, did they enact laws against the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">No, no, no.</span> <span id="s146">In 1939, when they came in it was very good.</span> <span id="s147">Everybody suffered later on.</span> <span id="s148">You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s149">Communism meant nothing.</span> <span id="s150">They cleaned out, as a matter of fact, they cleaned out all our stores.</span> <span id="s151">They bought, they had money, but that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">But we didn’t suffer from anti-Semitism in 1939-40 until the Nazis came in.</span> <span id="s154">We suffered from them in the partisans (?)</span> <span id="s155">, from the Russians… Okay.</span> <span id="s156">What was the Russian—what was the rule like?</span> <span id="s157">How was—did your lives change very much because the Russians were there?</span> <span id="s158">Did they impose any of their, you know ...</span></p> <p><span id="s159">The lives changed completely after two month we realize, it is a __________ (#130) at us and we they nothing but, the only thing they have is propaganda.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Mmhmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">There was no food, no clothing.</span> <span id="s162">You couldn’t travel by train, you needed a permit to go from one town to another town.</span> <span id="s163">You were just a prisoner.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Okay, and this lasted, you said, the Russians come in late September of ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">And they were there until 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Until June 22, when the war broke out, 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Okay.</span> <span id="s169">Did they seize any of the businesses and try to nationalize them?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Oh, the Russians?</span> <span id="s171">Sure.</span> <span id="s172">They took over everything.</span> <span id="s173">They controlled every part of your life.</span> <span id="s174">Your heart and your soul.</span> <span id="s175">Your body.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">We had a six room house, for family of six it’s not too much.</span> <span id="s177">They wanted to nationalize the house.</span> <span id="s178">Take away the house, not take it away but we would have to pay like taxes on the house because the square feet, it was too big for a family of six.</span> <span id="s179">My father bribed the head from the finance department and my daughter—my younger sister got a job in that office, so we invited him for dinner.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">And it cut the meters, he said a 120 square meters and he made it 110, and the house was still ours.</span> <span id="s182">That was life in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Okay, why don’t you tell me a little about when the Germans come back in, in 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Well, when the Germans came back in 1941, we knew it was the beginning of our end.</span> <span id="s185">We knew it.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Did you, were people in that area did they know, I don’t know, most of the camps and things hadn’t been set up.</span> <span id="s187">Did they know of concentration camps in Germany and, you know that kind of thing about places like Auschwitz and… Do you remember if you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">I am not sure.</span> <span id="s189">We knew they were taking away a lot of Jewish people.</span> <span id="s190">We knew it.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">But you weren’t sure where they were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">We didn’t know that much by that time.</span> <span id="s193">But one man, the mayor in our town from Lodz, a big city in Poland, he was lucky he escaped and he came back because he married, his wife was from our town Zdzienceil and he came back and he told us, assembled a lot of Jewish people and told them to dig a big grave with spoons…</span></p> <p><span id="s194">With spoons?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">With spoons, and he came and he told us it’s tragic, he says it’s our end.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Did people not believe him, when he told those things?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Ah yes, ah yeah, ah yeah, but there was nowhere to run?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">You see the population, all the population was against us.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Mmhmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">So, at the moment, you didn’t have where to go.</span> <span id="s202">If the population is with you, then it’s okay.</span> <span id="s203">But when the population is against you, the moment that you [the Jew?]</span> <span id="s204">walked out from the ghetto, they were pointing to the Germans, Jude.</span> <span id="s205">A Jew.</span> <span id="s206">You could recognize a Jew, always.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Sure.</span> <span id="s208">It’s interesting you say that, because I’ve had interviews where people say, “They didn’t fear the Germans so much as they feared, especially in Poland, their neighbors.”</span> <span id="s209">Because the Germans seemed, according to these people who I’ve talked to, seemed not to really know who was Jewish.</span> <span id="s210">But the Poles could point them out.</span> <span id="s211">You know, who knew exactly who was Jewish so there was, so they didn’t really fear the Germans as much as they feared…their neighbors.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">They didn’t fear—the soldiers weren’t so bad.</span> <span id="s213">You remember the soldiers were standing near your house, stopped to rest for a while, and one young German came over and was talking to them a little.</span> <span id="s214">He said, “Now it’s not going to be bad for you.</span> <span id="s215">When the S.S. are going to come,” he warned, “then it’s going to start a lot of trouble for you.”</span> <span id="s216">But he was looking with a little sympathy, you could… right?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Wife: Yeah.</span> <span id="s218">Excuse me, can I talk?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Interviewer: Sure, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Wife: We had to wear yellow marks… Aaron Laro: Star of David now?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Wife: Because we are Jews and we are not allowed to walk on the sidewalk.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Interviewer: Now this is after the Germans…?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Aaron Laro: That’s in the ghetto, that started in the ghetto, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Interviewer: When the Germans (were in)?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Wife: There was one German, where she was working cleaning then, he once said to her and a friend, “maybe you should run away in the woods, but how will you survive the winter?”</span> <span id="s226">[Cannot understand her words here - #184] Aaron Laro: No, no, no, he was short.</span> <span id="s227">I remember him, yeah.</span> <span id="s228">Short-headed guy ...</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Wife: Said, “I don’t know why Hitler doesn’t like the Jewish people.”</span> <span id="s230">Interviewer: He said this?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Aaron Laro: Yeah!</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Wife: Turned back to me and that they stink in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Aaron Laro: He said, “In Russia, in White Russia, Polacks they stink,” he says.</span> <span id="s234">“You are intelligent people, what does he want from you?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Wife: “They stink they’re stupid, they stink.”</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Interviewer: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Wife: That’s what he said to me.</span> <span id="s238">He cared for the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s239">He was a nice guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Interviewer: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Wife: A policeman, a gendarme.</span> <span id="s242">He’s a policeman.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Interviewer: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Aaron Laro: So I was working over there—I was starting to learn for a machinist, an electrician in a power station.</span> <span id="s245">So when the Germans came in, the power station was supposed to run.</span> <span id="s246">Then they gave me a permit, I was walking during the night by myself and I used to turn off the lights, we had lights until one o’clock, I think.</span> <span id="s247">And the Germans used to come across me, but they were patrolling the town.</span> <span id="s248">I used to see, with ____________ (181).</span> <span id="s249">He never touched me.</span> <span id="s250">_______ (194) and I used to go through the gates, back to the ghetto—he never touched me.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">It was interesting.</span> <span id="s252">Why don’t you tell me a little bit about when the Germans first get there and what you did and what your family did when the Germans come through in 41?</span> <span id="s253">Before we get to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s254">We can talk about the ghetto later.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Well, when they came in they were bombarding, so we run away in the outskirts of the town where my father’s friends, White Russians, we go over there for two days.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Interviewer: What did you take with you when you ran?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Nothing.</span> <span id="s258">We were in the same town, I took my bicycle.</span> <span id="s259">A lot of people even didn’t run from the town.</span> <span id="s260">People were resigned.</span> <span id="s261">We knew there was nowhere to go.</span> <span id="s262">And then we came back.</span> <span id="s263">We were lucky we were still in our homes from July until January 1942, then they made the ghetto for us.</span> <span id="s264">I don’t know why we were so lucky.</span> <span id="s265">Some other towns they made ghettos right away, and we were living, going on with a normal life.</span> <span id="s266">The only thing, we couldn’t walk on the sidewalks and the Star of David we had to wear.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">So they made you wear the Star of David after they came in.</span> <span id="s268">Was it immediately or did they make you wear an arm band as soon as they came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">I think it was maybe a month after, as soon as they came in.</span> <span id="s270">I don’t remember exactly or two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Why don’t you tell me a little bit about the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">The ghetto in order to go into the ghetto they gave us from eight in the morning till two in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s273">We had no machine, nothing, no trucks, no horses.</span> <span id="s274">So how much would you take on the sled?</span> <span id="s275">It was winter time.</span> <span id="s276">So we moved in our aunt’s house, she had only three rooms.</span> <span id="s277">We were sharing two families in, so whatever we could—furniture, forget about.</span> <span id="s278">So we took clothing and I don’t remember, I think no furniture even, there was nowhere to put it.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Was it just a matter of space, or did the Germans not allow you to take certain things?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">I don’t think they didn’t allow, but they gave us six hours, from eight until two, so how much furniture could you take, there was nowhere to put it, because my Aunt had a little apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Did you take food with you as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Whatever we had, we took with us.</span> <span id="s283">Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Was the ghetto fenced, closed?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Fenced.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">What was the fence?</span> <span id="s287">Was it stone or picket?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Picket.</span> <span id="s289">It wasn’t, look how many people escaped.</span> <span id="s290">You could jump over, it was a picket that high, that‘s all.</span> <span id="s291">But the local police were patrolling around it.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Were you allowed—you weren’t allowed to leave, legally.</span> <span id="s293">You were supposed to, you had some sort of pass to leave?</span> <span id="s294">Was that how it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Yeah.</span> <span id="s296">They took Jewish people on the highways.</span> <span id="s297">They took Jewish people to cut trees in the woods so they used to take them out in groups.</span> <span id="s298">They used to take them out and uh, the Judenrat used to supply them.</span> <span id="s299">They needed, let’s say, 100 people to go to the woods, they needed 100 people, so they counted 100 people and they took them, used to march like soldiers to the highways and to the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Now, were these people guarded by Germans or were they guarded by, like, Polish police?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Police.</span> <span id="s302">One German, the rest police.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">How large was the ghetto itself?</span> <span id="s304">A few blocks?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">The ghetto, one, two, three, four, five.</span> <span id="s306">I would say a kilometer and half long and not too wide—ten square blocks.</span> <span id="s307">Ten, eight square blocks.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Did you go out on some of these work details?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Did I what?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Did you go out on some of these work details?</span> <span id="s311">You were talking about when they took people out to the woods or to fix the highways, did you do any of that?</span> <span id="s312">Any of that work?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">No.</span> <span id="s314">I was working at the power station.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">You were working at the power station.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">What did you do at the power station?</span> <span id="s318">What was your job?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">My job was to take care of the machines.</span> <span id="s320">I was 18 years old and I could take apart the big machines.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">So, did you do that—is that something you’d worked on before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">I started in Poland to learn that trade.</span> <span id="s323">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Wife: When he came here, he couldn’t get a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">When he came here, to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Yeah.</span> <span id="s327">Because it was a closed union.</span> <span id="s328">It was a non-gentile [?]</span> <span id="s329">union, an electrical union, I couldn’t get in.</span> <span id="s330">The United Jewish Appeal gentleman told me, “Lie if you want, but forget about electrician.”</span> <span id="s331">When a father dies, the son comes in in his place, they are so strict.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Why don’t you tell me about -- you said that many people were able to escape.</span> <span id="s333">Did you notice people leaving, did you know people who left before you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">No, not many people.</span> <span id="s335">We used to sneak out and take weapons in the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Oh, really.</span> <span id="s337">Why don’t you tell me something about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Well, we used to realize that we don’t need so much clothing so we used to exchange with gentiles, give him a suit and get from him a rifle, bullets, grenades, revolver, whatever we could.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">And did you hide these things, you hid these things in the woods?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">We had it in the ghetto, in the basement in a dry place and we used to—we were in touch with a Russian lieutenant and he was working in a village near the forest, so he had cabin that he made in the woods, so we used to bring it in over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Was there somebody who was kind of running this operation?</span> <span id="s342">I don’t want to call it an operation because I don’t know exactly… Was there somebody, like, in charge of gathering the weapons and everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">I know what you’re pointing at.</span> <span id="s344">Our president of the Judenrat (279) was a lawyer—Alta Boretsky (?)</span> <span id="s345">.</span> <span id="s346">Why did we pick him?</span> <span id="s347">Because he was a smart man and he was the president of the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s348">So we picked some of the Jewish militia in the ghetto in that organization so we could know better what was going on around, because they were patrolling the ghetto.</span> <span id="s349">They would not betray us.</span> <span id="s350">Like in some other ghettos a lot of Jewish people were betrayed.</span> <span id="s351">Not in our town.</span> <span id="s352">We were a different breed.</span> <span id="s353">And because of him, while he was in the Judenrat and he had a lot of money because the Germans were asking for money, for gold, for fur.</span> <span id="s354">So through him, we could get some money and buy weapons to arm the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s355">He was a smart man.</span> <span id="s356">So he was actually our leader.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">How many people, that you know of, were involved in trying to procure these weapons?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Well, we were few groups.</span> <span id="s359">I don’t know exactly what was going on in the other group, but I know they had workers, too.</span> <span id="s360">They had rifles bought, but we were about eight guys.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Can you describe for me, like, from start to finish, what you would do in order to try to get these weapons?</span> <span id="s362">Like the eight of you, what the organization was like, where you got the money, you said you got some money from this lawyer, he would collect some money or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Yeah, but we used to exchange, give him clothing, shoes, whatever we could, a sewing machine.</span> <span id="s364">You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s365">Who needs a sewing machine?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Sure, right!</span></p> <p><span id="s367">So we give the family (?)</span> <span id="s368">, for them a sewing machine was like a million dollars.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">You had to sneak out in order to do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Did you do this at night, or mostly in the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">I have to put one thing.</span> <span id="s373">The White Russian population was different, a quieter people than the Polacks.</span> <span id="s374">That’s why some Polish people told you they feared the Polacks, the local population more than the Germans.</span> <span id="s375">Our people, the White Russians were—it’s a quieter element but they didn’t, you know what I mean, they didn’t point their fist or a finger on a Jews and the Polacks.</span> <span id="s376">That’s why we could operate easier.</span> <span id="s377">You know cigarette holder, chromium was in Europe?</span> <span id="s378">If you kept it like that, you took it out from pocket, it is shiny and you could get from the farmer whatever you want, bread and butter, everything, they were shaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Boichikes, don’t kill me, don’t kill me, I’ll give what you want.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Okay.</span> <span id="s382">You said something about getting rifles and things, and guns and pistols.</span> <span id="s383">Were you able to get anything else, like grenades?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Where did you get the grenades from?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">See, when the Germans destroyed the Russian army, they dropped everything on the fields.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">The Russians did?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Yeah.</span> <span id="s389">The major population, they picked from the field whatever they wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">They had grenades?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">They had plenty.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s393">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Some of them were communists, leftist sympathizers.</span> <span id="s395">They gave us for free, just to help us.</span> <span id="s396">You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s397">Some wanted money.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Why don’t you tell me a little bit about how you got involved with the partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">How?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Did you get involved with the partisans while you were in the ghetto or after?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">I’m telling you when I was in the ghetto there was still no partisans.</span> <span id="s402">We met a Russian, I mentioned before, we met a Russian in our town, he brought logs, wood to sell and we got acquainted with him, and he was a lieutenant, and that’s when it started.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">I remember the first meeting we had a friend of mine and he was afraid too.</span> <span id="s404">It was a short meeting and he told us we should start to get weapons.</span> <span id="s405">And that when we started to buy weapons and we used to bring it over (?)</span> <span id="s406">about six kilometers from our town.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">In the woods?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">In the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Do you remember the date, roughly, about when that was when you had that first meeting?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Yeah.</span> <span id="s411">It was cool, we were buying a lot of wood for the winter.</span> <span id="s412">It must be in October, October.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">In 1942 or?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">1941.</span> <span id="s415">We still didn’t have a ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Oh, so this meeting took place before the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Before the ghetto.</span> <span id="s418">The ghetto started January 1942.</span> <span id="s419">Thank God, I still remember dates.</span> <span id="s420">You know a lot of town people still call me, when was the shooting, when was the massacre?</span> <span id="s421">And when did they take us in that ghetto?</span> <span id="s422">They are younger than me and they don’t remember any dates.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">You remember them all?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">I remember them.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">You got a good memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">I’m bad to remember names.</span> <span id="s427">It’s funny thing, how a brain works.</span> <span id="s428">I’m not so good in memorizing names.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">But you know numbers?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Dates.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">You said there were about eight people who were involved in getting these weapons.</span> <span id="s432">They were all involved with this Partisan person?</span> <span id="s433">The person you had the meeting with.</span> <span id="s434">Did they all know him?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">I don’t believe they all know him.</span> <span id="s436">I don’t remember exactly how many of us were at the meeting first—three or four.</span> <span id="s437">But then we took in more boys, we needed more.</span> <span id="s438">We were not afraid because there were no informers, like in Hebrew we call it “Amussian” (?)</span> <span id="s439">.</span> <span id="s440">We were neighbors, we knew him.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">How many Germans, like either S.S. or German army persons were in the town at this time?</span> <span id="s442">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">(344) Not many, there were about eight, nine Germans and the rest were local militia, black uniforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Was there a larger German contingent somewhere in the area, not far away?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">In Novogrudek (Navahrudak, Belarus).</span> <span id="s446">Yeah, Minkat (?</span> <span id="s447">Nothing found) was over there...?</span> <span id="s448">(379).</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Why don’t you describe for me a little bit about more go on with what you were doing in the ghetto collecting these weapons, and then when I guess, when you escaped, or they took you to Novogrudek (Navahrudak, Belarus).</span></p> <p><span id="s450">You want the whole story?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Sure, give it to me, give me the whole story.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">We got in touch with another Russian guy, a Russian pilot who was working for somebody in our town.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">About what time was this now, was this about the same time we were talking about before?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">We were about 1942, we were in the ghetto already.</span> <span id="s455">That was our biggest mistake.</span> <span id="s456">Even that lawyer, and he said we should stay in touch with him because I saw him once with a gun in the pocket.</span> <span id="s457">And then I became suspicious.</span> <span id="s458">I said how can you walk around with a gun in the pocket?</span> <span id="s459">In other words, he had a permit?</span> <span id="s460">Voretsky didn’t realize it, that lawyer.</span> <span id="s461">He betrayed us.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">The lawyer did?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">No, no, the Russian pilot.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">The Russian pilot.</span> <span id="s465">O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">He betrayed us.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">He betrayed you to whom?</span> <span id="s468">Who did he tell?</span> <span id="s469">The Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">See what can happen.</span> <span id="s471">We had a meeting in front of, we weren’t married by that time, we were young kids, we went to school together and we were friends.</span> <span id="s472">We are standing in front of her house in the ghetto and the slaughterhouse, you had to go through the ghetto, the gentiles, in order to reach the slaughter house.</span> <span id="s473">So he was working for one who was making the provisions, you know, non-kosher.</span> <span id="s474">Walking back he stopped and said that he had in the village, promising somebody two revolvers and grenades, and I would like one of you should go with me.</span> <span id="s475">And not the whole group was standing.</span> <span id="s476">It was me, and Sholom Pyolin (Sholom Pyolun and Ohat Zukotun?)</span> <span id="s477">, three or four of us.</span> <span id="s478">Until now I can’t understand why did he pick that Sholom Pyolun (?)</span> <span id="s479">.</span> <span id="s480">He was a refugee from Poland and he moved in our town.</span> <span id="s481">He ran away from the Nazis.</span> <span id="s482">A small boy.</span> <span id="s483">He picked him because he was not from our town and he said to him, Sholom [Russian words You will go with me] (?)</span> <span id="s484">(420).</span> <span id="s485">It means, you’ll go with me.</span> <span id="s486">And we all going to meet over there in ________ and I’ll wait for you.</span> <span id="s487">He was a brave guy, my friend, Sholom Pyolun.</span> <span id="s488">It was warm, it was summer.</span> <span id="s489">It was six, seven in the evening, the sun was still shining a little bit.</span> <span id="s490">He said goodbye to us and he went straight over the fields in the meadows in that direction.</span> <span id="s491">She was working for the Nazis cleaning their building over there and she was going into a little room where she had the brooms and the mop and everything.</span> <span id="s492">She opened up the door she sees that Russian guy jump out of the window because he saw her.</span> <span id="s493">The guy who betrayed us.</span> <span id="s494">So she realized right away that he is a spy.</span> <span id="s495">But she couldn’t stop the work to tell us.</span> <span id="s496">They would kill her, the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">The moment she finished her work and she came back home, she call me, “Aaron, I saw Vanya over there.”</span> <span id="s499">His name was Vanya.</span> <span id="s500">Oye, I said we are in trouble.</span> <span id="s501">We couldn’t call him back because he was gone, and he was waiting, the Germans made an ambush and they caught him alive, and they brought him in our town.</span> <span id="s502">See the story?</span> <span id="s503">A tragedy.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">What did they do after that?</span> <span id="s505">What did the Germans do after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">They tortured him to death in prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Oh my gosh.</span> <span id="s508">Now this is your friend, this is not the Russian guy they tortured?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">No, no.</span> <span id="s510">What happened to the Russian guy from then on, we don’t know, he disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">But the guy who went across the field, your friend, was the one who was tortured.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Do you know where they took him?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">He went to many places and I think they got the guns and the grenades, but on the way back they caught him with the grenades, they had proof, you know what I mean, with the grenades and everything.</span> <span id="s515">So he was arrested, like I told you, they tortured him to death, but he didn’t give any names.</span> <span id="s516">He didn’t give any names of us.</span> <span id="s517">A Jewish guy was going to get water from the well and he found that little note, he threw out the little window.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">From where he was being tortured?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">From the prison, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Wow.</span> <span id="s521">So the Germans basically, they knew that there was some sort of plan going on, but they didn’t know who it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">They knew, yes.</span> <span id="s523">It was in the evening, a friend of mine in the same group, comes over my house and he says, “Aaron, we have to run away because they uncovered the underground organization.</span> <span id="s524">And, come on, that lawyer and the rest of the boys were waiting in the main Schule in—the ladies.”</span> <span id="s525">You know, in Europe, the ladies were services having on the top separate, not the men together, it was an orthodox Shul.</span> <span id="s526">“Over there they’re a hiding, and make it fast, we have to retreat, we have to go.”</span> <span id="s527">And then I had a tragic moment.</span> <span id="s528">My mother and father came over—“you are leaving us in a tragic moment like now?</span> <span id="s529">You run away to save your life and you leave us alone?”</span> <span id="s530">I say, “Mommy, I am not trying to save my life, we are going to die anyway.</span> <span id="s531">I want to fight, I want to die in battle, I want to take a couple of Germans with me in the grave, but I don’t want to go alive in the grave.”</span> <span id="s532">It didn’t help.</span> <span id="s533">And there was another reason that I couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s534">If I would go away, I wouldn’t report to work the next day so the Germans would kill my parents anyway.</span> <span id="s535">They would know right away that I disappeared.</span> <span id="s536">So I said to my friend, “I am not going.</span> <span id="s537">I don’t want that on my conscience, they should kill my parents, my sister and brothers.”</span> <span id="s538">They said goodbye to me.</span> <span id="s539">They went away, they ran away that night from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s540">They came in the woods, they met, there was a small group of Russian partisans, but he was intelligent so he became the commander.</span> <span id="s541">A couple weeks later, I ran away too, for a couple of nights, and I came back and it was quiet, nobody ever looked for me, for my other friend and that Russian guy disappeared.</span> <span id="s542">They sent him away somewhere, I don’t believe they killed him, the sent him away in another town.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">To do something somewhere else.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Yeah.</span> <span id="s545">So I’ll go in another instance.</span> <span id="s546">I was working like nothing would happen, but over there one Sunday the Russian partisan went to the village, they had a good time with the girls.</span> <span id="s547">They were drinking, became high, intoxicated and they opened up a fire and started yelling, “Kill the Jew and save Russia.”</span> <span id="s548">An old slogan _______ (501).</span> <span id="s549">They killed that Boretskafy (?)</span> <span id="s550">(502), that lawyer, they killed two, three, four and the rest escaped.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">This was in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s552">They killed people in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s553">Is that where they killed them?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">No.</span> <span id="s555">In the partisans (?)</span> <span id="s556">.</span> <span id="s557">They killed my friend, that lawyer, and the other boys that joined him.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Oh, the other—oh, I see.</span> <span id="s559">I understand now, Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">They were anti-Semites, you know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Why don’t you go ahead and tell me some more.</span> <span id="s562">So, now you’re still in the ghetto, you didn’t escape.</span> <span id="s563">You decided not to escape because you did not want to endanger your family.</span> <span id="s564">What did you do after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">I was still working power station.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">How long did you work there?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">I worked there until the massacre.</span> <span id="s568">Until they killed all the Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Which was when?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">August the 6th of 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Why don’t you explain that, tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">About what?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">About August 6th.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">It was four o’clock in the morning and we suddenly hear people running.</span> <span id="s575">We looked in the window, we’re asking them what happened?</span> <span id="s576">We are surrounded by the Germans.</span> <span id="s577">A lot of Germans all around the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">So now these were Germans who weren’t in the town before?</span> <span id="s579">They came… No, armies, regular army, a lot of them.</span> <span id="s580">A lot were Lithuanians, murderers.</span> <span id="s581">They came with rolled up sleeves like butchers, and drunk, and they told us to come to the market, the center of the town.</span> <span id="s582">They had also another excuse, they wanted to check the “Arbishein” (?)</span> <span id="s583">(541).</span></p> <p><span id="s584">The workplace or whatever?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Like a document that you are working.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Right, work papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Yes.</span> <span id="s588">So we came together in the center of the town, and then when they got all of us, they took us—they chased us like cattle near the Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s589">The second one.</span> <span id="s590">We had an old cemetery and that was the newer one.</span> <span id="s591">And they brought us near the cemetery and they gave us an order to lay down face down.</span> <span id="s592">We were surrendered to Germans.</span> <span id="s593">Whoever tried to escape the ghetto, was killed right away.</span> <span id="s594">There were three lines of Germans.</span> <span id="s595">Three rings.</span> <span id="s596">Know what I mean?</span> <span id="s597">And then they started call skilled people and they warned us not to lift the head.</span> <span id="s598">If they ask for carpenter, raise your hand but keep your nose in the ground.</span> <span id="s599">So they called carpenters, blacksmiths, and here and there and I say to myself, I knew from my father that during the war, a shoemaker and a tailor was the best trade.</span> <span id="s600">I said to myself, what do they need an electrician, machinist?</span> <span id="s601">So when they were calling for shoemakers, I raise my hand.</span> <span id="s602">He told me to lift my head.</span> <span id="s603">When they have to lift your head, they wanted to see your age.</span> <span id="s604">If you are too young, they didn’t take you.</span> <span id="s605">So then he poked you with the rifle, they hit you in the back.</span> <span id="s606">Get up and run over there, face down.</span> <span id="s607">And then my father the same way and that’s all from my family.</span> <span id="s608">So officially they were supposed to live.</span> <span id="s609">We found out later on that about 120 people take to Novagrudek to that forced labor camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">That’s where they took them?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Yes, but they took us to the movies.</span> <span id="s612">They packed us in the movies and during the next couple of days they found a lot of Jewish people hiding and the movie was filled up.</span> <span id="s613">That’s when she came out with her family.</span> <span id="s614">She was hiding too.</span> <span id="s615">So they accumulated instead of 120, there was maybe a thousand.</span> <span id="s616">So then when they tried to pick who should live and who should die again.</span> <span id="s617">And then when the German pulled her out and saw she is a good tailor, see I’m coming to the point, and the rest they put us in trucks and took us to railway station and then they put us in the train and they took us to a camp.</span> <span id="s618">A forced labor camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">How long, or how far from your town is Novagrudek?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Thirty-five kilometers.</span> <span id="s621">Wires and you know, the rings (?)</span> <span id="s622">.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Barbed wire.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Yeah.</span> <span id="s625">Barbed wires and on each corner on towers was they were standing with machine guns.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">The people who they didn’t choose to take to the work camp, what happened to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">They took them, they went to the left and they shoot them.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">They shot them?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">They shot them.</span> <span id="s630">They took them back to the same cemetery.</span> <span id="s631">There was a big grave, mass grave, that the gentiles are digging.</span> <span id="s632">They never told us.</span> <span id="s633">I have good friends, Polacks, a kilometer and a half from my town and they never came to tell a Jew, that run away they are digging graves for you.</span> <span id="s634">It was so secret that nobody knew anything.</span> <span id="s635">And that’s in a big pit, a big grave where 2,500 Jewish people may be.</span> <span id="s636">We had two massacres.</span> <span id="s637">One was in April 1942 and they killed old people and widows.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">In April of 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Yes, they killed 800.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">They just killed people they couldn’t send to a work camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">The first massacre was just—they called it, they couldn’t work, useless people it was for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Why don’t you tell me a little bit about Nova (_______________________) But it wasn’t a cattle train?</span> <span id="s643">But, also it wasn’t a passenger train?</span> <span id="s644">It didn’t have seats.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">I think it was, benches on the side.</span> <span id="s646">But they squeezed us in so many people you couldn’t sit anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Like sardines.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">That’s what I wanted to know, if it was the same as most train rides that I’ve heard about.</span> <span id="s650">O.K., go ahead.</span> <span id="s651">I’m sorry I interrupted you.</span> <span id="s652">Go ahead and tell me about Novagrudek (?)</span> <span id="s653">.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">So when I was taken they dropped us in the working camp, I said to myself, Oh, my God, how will we escape from here?</span> <span id="s655">The first thing was I was looking around, how the fences were made and if there was any chance to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">What did you think when you came in and saw that?</span> <span id="s657">Did it look like it was promising that maybe you could escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">No.</span> <span id="s659">I became very pessimistic.</span> <span id="s660">Very pessimistic because it was a small place and the police were standing with machine guns all around in the towers.</span> <span id="s661">I was there a few days and the camp was, before we came over there, there were people there already from the same town, from Novagrudek, the natives were already there.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">So the camp was outside of the town of Novagrudek?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">It was a still town.</span> <span id="s664">It used to be Koht/called (?)</span> <span id="s665">(650) Poland, big building.</span> <span id="s666">So, they made a carpenter shop, a shoemaker shop and the villagers used to come and bring work, the Jewish people used to do all that work.</span> <span id="s667">I noticed that every day six Jewish people are being picked out without writing down names, you just counted six Jews are going with horse and wagon to ghetto, because there was still a ghetto in Novagrudek.</span> <span id="s668">They were baking bread for the forced labor camp.</span> <span id="s669">So every day there used to go six people and when they came back the police were counting six Jews.</span> <span id="s670">They didn’t care Aaron, Jack, no names, just numbers.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">As long as they had six?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">We realized it, we said to ourselves, from the ghetto would be a good chance to escape, because there’s just a picket fence and that’s it.</span> <span id="s673">So we organized.</span> <span id="s674">There was____ was in charge of our people from our town.</span> <span id="s675">So we asked him he should pick out six from our guys and send us to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s676">There were Jewish people from the ghetto who wanted to come to the forced labor camp because they believed there was a better chance to survive in the forced labor camp.</span> <span id="s677">So we went six over there, we sent six people from the ghetto with the horse and wagon with the bread.</span> <span id="s678">Next day the other group, my friends, came another six.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">So you were shifting people into the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">So we were 12 already.</span> <span id="s681">And another six came in the horse and wagon.</span> <span id="s682">And in nighttime, we found over there they gave us a shovel in the ghetto we dug holes, cat and dog (?)</span> <span id="s683">.</span> <span id="s684">Now a policeman was patrolling.</span> <span id="s685">But the fence in the ghetto was long, so when he started out on that corner until he comes over there and back, so we dug a hole somewhere here under the bushes and as soon as __ passed us, one by one we would jump out and we escaped all 12 of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Now is this ghetto similar to the one in your town?</span> <span id="s687">The one in Novagrudek?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">It was a higher fence, that was the difference.</span> <span id="s689">Wood, anyway.</span> <span id="s690">No barbed wire, it was a fence, that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">At this point you then went into the woods?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">We had a good guy.</span> <span id="s693">One guy, one of my friends, he was a carpenter, was working in the villages, that’s why he was a good guy.</span> <span id="s694">By two o’clock we were far away by a lake.</span> <span id="s695">I remember, I was so nervous, the tongue was so dry, stiff, we _______.</span> <span id="s696">It took us two weeks to reach the partisans.</span> <span id="s697">We knew where to go, we are not afraid even we knew there were anti-Semites and they killed some people, we had no other choice and we were so surprised we came over there, we found a lot of Jewish people.</span> <span id="s698">They run out from the hiding places under the floors, under the houses and everybody knew where to go.</span> <span id="s699">That’s when we join them.</span> <span id="s700">By the end of the summer, ’42, we were around over a 100 boys from our town.</span> <span id="s701">We had more than 200,000 bullets, we had machine guns, we had rifles.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">You said it took you two weeks?</span> <span id="s703">Was that traveling mostly through the woods to get to the Partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">How did you get food and things?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">From the farmers.</span> <span id="s707">One of our friends had a little revolver.</span> <span id="s708">For ladies, a little one with two bullets, that’s all we had.</span> <span id="s709">And I told you we had a cigarette holder so we used to keep it like that and they were shivering.</span> <span id="s710">We were boys, take a bread, cheese, milk.</span> <span id="s711">On the way to the woods, we were looking for Jewish people, we knew where Jewish people were hiding.</span> <span id="s712">My friend’s father was in the village and we found him.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">So you just collected these people and took them?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Yes.</span> <span id="s715">We took them with us in the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">O.K., why don’t you describe to me about the organization and the leaders of the partisan group and what you did with the partisans.</span> <span id="s717">What you were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Well, the first summer, our main objective was to arm a lot of Jewish people, there was a lot of Jewish people.</span> <span id="s719">We were just a Jewish fighting group in the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">In order to do that, what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Well, we used to buy, we used to go to friends, a lot of Jews had friends in the villages.</span> <span id="s722">They are buying from Jewish people in town, you know, customers.</span> <span id="s723">Asking for grenades or weapons.</span> <span id="s724">The problem was that we were not trained soldiers.</span> <span id="s725">I was too young for the Polish army, I was not kosher for the Russian army.</span> <span id="s726">They didn’t want to take me because my uncle was fighting against the communists in 1920.</span> <span id="s727">My father was a big shot in our town, they didn’t trust me.</span> <span id="s728">We had actually maybe five or ten percent professional soldiers who were in the Polish army.</span> <span id="s729">They knew how to keep a rifle.</span> <span id="s730">We didn’t know anything, we had to learn from a-b-c.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">So they trained you?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">They trained, you had to learn yourself.</span> <span id="s733">For instance, I found, we used to see on the fields standing tanks, burned down tanks, rotting tanks the Germans destroyed them.</span> <span id="s734">I used to take out the machine guns and bring them in the woods.</span> <span id="s735">They were still good, but the springs used to be nailed from the fire when the tank was burning, so they were soft.</span> <span id="s736">It didn’t work with the machine gun, so I took the springs and I used to heat it up in the fire flame and wrap it in oil to temper it.</span> <span id="s737">Sometimes I succeeded and sometimes not.</span> <span id="s738">That’s the way we used to make machine guns put together from three to one.</span> <span id="s739">You know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">So basically that’s what you did, you were ...?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Because I am a machinist, it was in my field already.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">So you collected weapons or whatever you could use.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">This is still the summer of 42?</span> <span id="s744">What kind of operations did you carry out?</span> <span id="s745">Did you, like, try to fight or attack any German places or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">From beginning in November 42, we had the first fight.</span> <span id="s747">In the center of our forest, there was a village and they sent in Ukrainians and Germans and they made outpost, they call it.</span> <span id="s748">They call it a garrison, outpost.</span> <span id="s749">And they sent us in a letter we should surrender, get rid of the Jews, the Jewish people, they were writing like to the gentiles.</span> <span id="s750">So they got an answer, if you’ll hit us with the clean bullets, we’ll cure it, but if our rusty bullets are going to hit you, you’ll die from infection.</span> <span id="s751">Nobody surrendered to them.</span> <span id="s752">And there was not, we were not under one command.</span> <span id="s753">Every group was for himself.</span> <span id="s754">It was no good.</span> <span id="s755">Sometimes we were fighting each other too.</span> <span id="s756">It was no good.</span> <span id="s757">But we had to destroy the Germans.</span> <span id="s758">We got united under one command.</span> <span id="s759">And it was one morning, I remember, in November and we had two tanks that the Russian boys fixed them, but the Russian army left them.</span> <span id="s760">It had tires like a car, it is made out of steel and a little cannon, you know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Like an armored transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">The top turns like in a tank, a little one.</span> <span id="s765">We had two of them and we __________ (736).</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Where did you hide those?</span> <span id="s767">Did you hide those in the woods also?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">In the woods.</span> <span id="s769">The woods were about 4 x 4 kilometers—it was pretty big.</span> <span id="s770">And we had two big rivers, the Yennen(?)</span> <span id="s771">that flows into the Baltic Sea.</span> <span id="s772">So we attack in one, a Russian lieutenant officer killed only.</span> <span id="s773">We destroyed them, our first fight.</span> <span id="s774">We took a lot of trophies.</span> <span id="s775">That’s the way we could help our Jewish people who lived, a lot of groups lived in the woods.</span> <span id="s776">Whole families.</span> <span id="s777">Husbands, wives and children who survive.</span> <span id="s778">So we gave them one quilt to cover—big beds, the kitchen was cooking for the soldiers, we took away the horse with the kitchen and a lot of bullets, rifles, a lot of trophies.</span> <span id="s779">But we did it a couple times more, then we got an order from Moscow not to do it anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">To stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">To stop because one partisan’s life is more important than 100 Germans.</span> <span id="s782">But what they wanted us to do is hit and run, hit and run.</span> <span id="s783">You couldn’t keep up a long fight with the Germans.</span> <span id="s784">Like I had 50 bullets, how long can you fight?</span> <span id="s785">Oh, and by that time came an order to split up the Jewish group.</span> <span id="s786">See Stalin, he didn’t trust the Jewish group.</span> <span id="s787">We couldn’t resist.</span> <span id="s788">They were in the thousands and we were a few hundred.</span> <span id="s789">So they split us up.</span> <span id="s790">Part of us between the gentiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">O.K. when they split you up, where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">In the same forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">You stayed there?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Yeah, a couple of kilometers there was another group.</span> <span id="s795">So the first damage we tried to do the Germans, we burned down all the bridges.</span> <span id="s796">The transportation, they would drive the trucks.</span> <span id="s797">Telephone lines we used to cut down.</span> <span id="s798">Then we started learning the rail trains.</span> <span id="s799">That was the most important thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">How did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">There was a Ukrainian captain and he had a Jewish wife.</span> <span id="s802">When anti-Semitism was very high in the woods, a group of Russian, there was a major—what was his name?</span> <span id="s803">I still remember him.</span> <span id="s804">He had a lot of Jewish people with him from Russia.</span> <span id="s805">He was a communist.</span> <span id="s806">When he heard what was going on, anti-Semitism, and was killed, and so forth.</span> <span id="s807">All the partisans were called in one place and he give an order, if you kill one Jew, will be killed all of you, it’s an order.</span> <span id="s808">We have to kill Germans, we came to fight our enemy.</span> <span id="s809">It quieted down.</span> <span id="s810">So, I’ll come to the point.</span> <span id="s811">That Ukrainian captain, called me.</span> <span id="s812">He said I heard you are a very handy boy, you know electrical work.</span> <span id="s813">Would you like to make mines in the rail trains?</span> <span id="s814">I said right away, “sure.”</span> <span id="s815">He said to me, “lay down.”</span> <span id="s816">It’s summer time in the tents.</span> <span id="s817">I remember laying on the ground, he took out the piece of paper and a pencil and he made a sketch.</span> <span id="s818">What we needed was a detonator and a battery and a big shell—a 125 millimeter shell he gave me.</span> <span id="s819">And he said, “Here go make it.”</span> <span id="s820">I picked three or four Jewish guys, my friend who lives in Houston, Texas, Morris Abrams, he still is over there, and we went to a group over there living in the woods.</span> <span id="s821">What I needed was plywood to make a little box.</span> <span id="s822">So I made up the box and I made everything with a battery, with a button sticking out just to go under the rail and we went not far away, about 20 kilometers from us was running a train from Lemberg (L’viv, Ukraine) to Vilna.</span> <span id="s823">From south Poland up to the north, north Lithuania.</span> <span id="s824">And one boy was watching the Germans on one side and one boy was and the other one we toOkay our coats to cover up because I had to turn on a flashlight.</span> <span id="s825">You have to see what you are doing, otherwise you would explode and you’ll get your ____________ (787).</span> <span id="s826">And I put in mine, you have to be very careful because you have to put detonator four millimeters under the rail.</span> <span id="s827">When the train comes, the weight of the train settles eight millimeters, it sinks.</span> <span id="s828">So you had room only four millimeters.</span> <span id="s829">The most dangerous thing.</span> <span id="s830">So when I made it and then we put in the shell, I remember we dug a big hole.</span> <span id="s831">Now you have to keep the dirt, not leave a mark that you dug the dirt because the Germans are walking back and forth.</span> <span id="s832">So we left the gravel, everything is put aside.</span> <span id="s833">And when I put it in the ground then I put with the chisel I made a little hole in the shell and I put in the detonator and carefully cover up with the dirt and put back the gravel, we covered it up and we run away in the woods.</span> <span id="s834">About three kilometers, two kilometers we lay down, we’re waiting.</span> <span id="s835">Eleven o’clock in the morning, I should live, I still remember 11 in the morning, we hear chug, chug, the train is coming.</span> <span id="s836">In our territory it used to go slow, in the beginning it used to go fast, but since we started to derail them, they got smart, the Germans, they go slow because the damage is smaller when you go slow, like 40 miles, but it used to go 80.</span> <span id="s837">And suddenly, we heard an explosion.</span> <span id="s838">We were so glad, my first successful job.</span> <span id="s839">So, in the night we went to the village and the gentiles said, what happened?</span> <span id="s840">So they told us it was the train with medication.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Oh, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">And three cars jumped down, not all of them, three, three cars.</span> <span id="s843">So by the same time, the train was destroyed, damaged and it would take a week to fix it, so it slowed down the supplies to the battlefield.</span> <span id="s844">That was my first job.</span> <span id="s845">The second successful job was we were sent to the Third Reich.</span> <span id="s846">You know part of Poland was next to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">________ was Germany, over there it was very hard to fight because the population was mostly Polacks.</span> <span id="s849">Over there we were walking two days and finally we came over there, we were very lucky we had a very good guide.</span> <span id="s850">I still can’t understand how come he knew so well our territory.</span> <span id="s851">He was a Russian.</span> <span id="s852">He was living like Moshe Rabinim (sp.), the Jewish people from Egypt.</span> <span id="s853">And I’ll make it short, we derailed three trains over there too.</span> <span id="s854">Two with shells and one with gasoline.</span> <span id="s855">Because two groups went over there before us and never came back they were killed over there.</span> <span id="s856">And we were lucky, we came back.</span> <span id="s857">We had a local paper in the woods, they were writing about me operating.</span> <span id="s858">In the worst circumstances I used to clean my machine gun, I had a machine gun.</span> <span id="s859">It wasn’t rusty because when we came back, the White Polacks were shooting at us.</span> <span id="s860">So my machine gun was working and I opened fire on them.</span> <span id="s861">And I kept my machine gun in good shape.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">So it worked when you needed it?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">So how long, so, you were with the Partisans until the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s864">I was, we were liberated by the Russian army in July 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">So July of 44 you, did they make you go in the army, is that what they did?</span> <span id="s866">The Red Army.</span> <span id="s867">So you were kind of incorporated into the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">We were incorporated, they didn’t ask us.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Did you want to go, did you not want to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Actually, we were bitter with them.</span> <span id="s871">I’ll tell you why.</span> <span id="s872">We were living under abnormal conditions.</span> <span id="s873">We had all kind of skin diseases.</span> <span id="s874">Sometimes you wear underwear for four, five weeks.</span> <span id="s875">We had, excuse me, lice and all the hell.</span> <span id="s876">And they didn’t let us to go back to the town to a bath to wash ourselves and change the clothing.</span> <span id="s877">They took us right away to the battlefield and did not give us a chance to rest two, three days.</span> <span id="s878">That was what we were angry at.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">O.K.</span> <span id="s880">Did you see any action while you were in the Red Army before the end of the war?</span> <span id="s881">Did you fight against the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Did I see action?</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Yes.</span> <span id="s884">Were you involved in battles?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">In the Red Army, the Russian army?</span> <span id="s886">Sure.</span> <span id="s887">It didn’t take long and we were fighting in Bialystok.</span> <span id="s888">We knew that the Germans were going to start the next morning and offensive.</span> <span id="s889">And they, I went to artillery.</span> <span id="s890">When I saw that infantry is just cannon meat, flesh, so they were looking for artilleries, so I raised my hand and I went over there.</span> <span id="s891">We were standing battery, four of us, suddenly we hear the German tanks in the morning.</span> <span id="s892">And they were moving slowly, slowly and we open up a fire with our cannons.</span> <span id="s893">The shells were too small.</span> <span id="s894">We used the biggest tanks, tiger and panther.</span> <span id="s895">Like one family houses, so big.</span> <span id="s896">And that’s what they were waiting for.</span> <span id="s897">The moment they saw us shooting, they opened up the fire on us.</span> <span id="s898">We were four times six, twenty-four, all of them were killed.</span> <span id="s899">Me and three Russian boys survived.</span> <span id="s900">That was my first battle.</span> <span id="s901">And I had shrapnel in my temple, right here.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">That was my first battle, then we were fighting continuously.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Could you tell us at this point, did you know the Germans, could you tell that they were losing the war?</span> <span id="s905">You know what I mean, that the war seemed to be going bad for the Germans at this point, or was that not evident?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">I think they knew it.</span> <span id="s907">They didn’t have any more airplanes, seldom you saw an airplane because they lost a lot of airplanes over England, and we were not afraid of them anymore.</span> <span id="s908">But you still had to watch out.</span> <span id="s909">They were very good fighters, the Germans.</span> <span id="s910">They started a couple contra-offensives and they wounded a lot of our boys and they killed a lot of our boys.</span> <span id="s911">And we had a very heavy fight in Poland, in Solinka.</span> <span id="s912">Oh what a fight we had over there.</span> <span id="s913">The big river, the river was named Solinko.</span> <span id="s914">We crossed the bridge and we had just a platform.</span> <span id="s915">Two kilometers deep and maybe five in the width.</span> <span id="s916">And the Germans are shooting at us and it was just like an earthquake, like an earthquake.</span> <span id="s917">After a nice couple of hours it quieted down.</span> <span id="s918">My lieutenant and the guys were hiding in the trenches.</span> <span id="s919">And when I searched for the little window in each cannon, when I looked and I saw the Germans running, I became wild.</span> <span id="s920">I said, now I have a moment to take revenge.</span> <span id="s921">And I’m yelling to the window to bring up shells, they were hanging and we couldn’t hear each other.</span> <span id="s922">Because from the airplanes and the bombs and everything, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s923">So I was carrying myself the shells and shooting them so much that the paint on the cannon was burning, believe me, smoke was coming out.</span> <span id="s924">When it was quiet down, two boys, Russian young soldiers, 18 years old, kids, come over to me, I should help them to take out Germans, surrounding the white flag from the trench.</span> <span id="s925">I said I have no right to leave my cannon.</span> <span id="s926">They said it’s your job, infantry, go take them.</span> <span id="s927">So I see them standing and talking, so I stood up too because I was on my knees.</span> <span id="s928">I could hear many times bullets hitting the spires, it makes a “Whoooo”, it’s singing.</span> <span id="s929">What I see, I thought the Germans were running away.</span> <span id="s930">The moment I stood up, knocked me a bullet here, through and through, and I fell like a rock.</span> <span id="s931">I was wounded in the hospital and I was taken from the battlefield.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">It missed your heart?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">That’s what the doctor told me.</span> <span id="s934">Mendel was following you.</span> <span id="s935">Right here it went in my blade and my shoulder.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">And you were in the hospital for a month?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A month.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">And then they put you right back out?</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Yes.</span> <span id="s940">Then they sent me to the military school.</span> <span id="s941">I was a month in the military school and I came out I was a sergeant and I was a commander of a cannon.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Where was the military school?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Not far from the battlefield.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">And then you came back as a sergeant?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Yes.</span> <span id="s946">(Wife: He won a lot of medals.)</span> <span id="s947">Do you still have the medals?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">It’s a long story.</span> <span id="s949">I deserted in Russia, in Poland we lost, we were going back to Russian, I deserted so I throw away all my medals, who needs it, because the __________ (911) were looking for me all over the town.</span> <span id="s950">I was running from one house to another.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">So you’ve been wounded and you go in the hospital and you’re back on the battlefield, about what time was this, when was this?</span> <span id="s952">Late ‘44, early ‘45, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">No that was ‘44 it was still warm, it was maybe in September, because end of September, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Can you tell me a little bit about the end of the war?</span> <span id="s955">As the war starts to wind down, did you go, did you remain…?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">I will try to make it shorter because you can talk another week if I have to tell you everything.</span> <span id="s957">We go to central Poland, northern Berlin, and we came in East Prussia and we split in half and we came out to the Baltic Sea, near Koenigsberg (Kaliningrad, Russia).</span> <span id="s958">Heavy fights over there.</span> <span id="s959">Germans resisted, we were arrested in four days and then they threw us over into Germany, like I said, north of Berlin and soon Berlin fell, the resistance was very weak already.</span> <span id="s960">And slowly we were moving on and moving on and it was dangerous because the German army fell apart.</span> <span id="s961">So you could hear Germans talking in the front of you, in the back of you.</span> <span id="s962">We were scared, so we couldn’t sleep even.</span> <span id="s963">But I was fighting until we came close to the American army.</span> <span id="s964">I actually didn’t see because I was in the artillery.</span> <span id="s965">I wasn’t on the first line.</span> <span id="s966">I’m glad I was privileged to have the opportunity to fight against Nazi Germany.</span> <span id="s967">As a Jew, I didn’t regret one minute for the blood I was spilling.</span> <span id="s968">Because I took revenge for my family and for the six million Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Do you remember the day when the war ended, where you were?</span> <span id="s970">What you were doing when you heard the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s971">I’m telling you, in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">So you were right outside Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">West of Berlin.</span> <span id="s974">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Can you tell me a little bit what you did after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">After the war, we were going back to Russia.</span> <span id="s977">In Lodz was parade; a general was standing, there was a big parade.</span> <span id="s978">While we were marching I look sideways, I see the people are jumping on the sidewalk, waving hands, ________ (951) on I turn my head, and I look, my ex-friend passes, they recognized me, they recognized me waving their hands.</span> <span id="s979">What can I do, it is a parade.</span> <span id="s980">But there was a lieutenant in charge of us, marching first, he was young.</span> <span id="s981">I said to him comrade lieutenant, I want information to get out.</span> <span id="s982">He said what happened?</span> <span id="s983">I said to him I see my friend over there and they are jumping, he said go, catch up with them and I never saw me again.</span> <span id="s984">They told me what goes on in Russia about anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s985">And my wife and my father were still over there.</span> <span id="s986">They told me send a telegram and come over.</span> <span id="s987">They never got my telegram.</span> <span id="s988">I had a lot of the _______________ (963) looking for me.</span> <span id="s989">I had to wait for them until November.</span> <span id="s990">(Wife: Excuse me, we came looking for him, in town, ask for him, actually we don’t know.</span> <span id="s991">I ask how is he doing, how is he feeling, he said he’s good, he’s fine.)</span> <span id="s992">But he knew I deserted.</span> <span id="s993">So finally we came, I sent a letter and that letter reached them on my military address.</span> <span id="s994">They made papers.</span> <span id="s995">As Polish immigrants, they couldn’t leave Russia.</span> <span id="s996">So they came to Lodz and they found me and I got in connection with a guy, a friend of mine, took us by truck to Berlin, we came to __________ (976) to Germany by train and from there to Berlin.</span> <span id="s997">I registered with the UNRRA and they took us in big American trucks, they brought us to Hamburg in Germany and over there an American lieutenant came out and said now you are a free people and go wherever you want.</span> <span id="s998">So I knew a couple of townspeople are in _____ near Frankfurt am Main, so I went to them and settled and then we got in touch with my relatives in America and Canada and they sent to us a visa and in 1947 we came here.</span> <span id="s999">June 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Have you been in New York all that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">When did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Here, in 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">She was with me all the time with the partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">You were with the partisans also?</span> <span id="s1006">So you were in the woods also?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">All the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">People here can’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1009">They say they can make a movie out of it.</span> <span id="s1010">For awhile we went to the same school, free tuition, a government school.</span> <span id="s1011">A cousin of mine with the same name sneaked in in the camp in Grudack.</span> <span id="s1012">I still can’t understand how could he sneak in with a cut-off rifle and he sneaked in under the wires, at night we were sleeping, he sneaked in.</span> <span id="s1013">How could he come over there.</span> <span id="s1014">He was 17 years old, a young kid.</span> <span id="s1015">He had a father over there too.</span> <span id="s1016">He told us what was going on and he run away and he came to the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Well, I think I’ve asked all my questions.</span> <span id="s1018">Is there anything else you want to say before I cut off the tape?</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Like I said, I’m proud of myself, I have so many wounds, a wound in my leg, a bullet in my heart.</span> <span id="s1020">I had something wrong with my nose, I went to the doctor he took x-rays he said, “Mr. Laro, you know you have a piece of metal in your head?”</span> <span id="s1021">I think for a while and I said, oh, that must be when I fought in Bialystok.</span> <span id="s1022">I still have it, I feel it.</span> <span id="s1023">He said, “If it don’t bother you, leave it alone.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">That’s great.</span></p></body></html>
