Sippy.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: Yes my -- madam?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: I want to ask you a bunch of sh -- sort of short -- I don’t know whether they’re short questions, but they seem --</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: How sh -- yeah [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: -- they seem like little -- they seem like little questions to me.</span> <span id="s19">So, we’ll see whether -- cause I went through all of our conversations, so I have some small questions, and I have some larger questions.</span> <span id="s20">So, here’s my first question, okay?</span> <span id="s21">You said, when you disembarked, when you got to Auschwitz, you disembarked in the town of Oswiecim.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Correct.</span> <span id="s25">Out -- outside of Stohn, I would say, it’s very -- very -- very ofsa town, compared like New York, and maybe Welfare Island.</span> <span id="s26">Yeah, a little bit.</span> <span id="s27">Just close enough, but outside of the center of the -- of the town, yeah.</span> <span id="s28">There wasn’t all -- actually, now, after 50 years, I can even show you a map which we have produced, together with the Auschwitz Museum.</span> <span id="s29">They have asked me the same question, so we produced some little diagram, a map.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Of where you disembarked?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Of where it is in the location, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: It was outside -- I would say it was not the railway station, but it was the railway station for -- for goods, yeah.</span> <span id="s34">Like cattle.</span> <span id="s35">They have embarked merchandise, and like here, for example, I don’t know how -- how railway stations work [indecipherable] we have people, and we have cattle, and we have all kind of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: Now, in Europe, people -- as the railway stations in Europe are small, because they have the railway stations in -- for little cities, and larger cities, concentrated mainly for people.</span> <span id="s38">And everything else is a little bit far out.</span> <span id="s39">It stops before the -- before the general railway station, so I would say a couple of miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Couple of miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: And that what happened to us.</span> <span id="s42">We were not e-embarked -- disembarked?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Bark?</span> <span id="s45">Embarked, or disembarked?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Dis-Disembarked.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Disembarked where people were used to travel, and -- and -- and come or go, but we were disembarked where the cattle --</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Cattle go.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Right, that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Let me -- I’m going to stop the tape for one second.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: I-In Auschwitz --</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Okay, we’re back.</span> <span id="s53">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: In Auschwitz, I produced -- I had the same question from the people of the Auschwitz museum, so I predi -- produced together a plan, and the route how we were then walking by foot from the place of disembarking --</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: -- over to the camp in the -- because Auschwitz, one camp where we were taken, there were only a couple of -- half a mile -- well, ish -- well [indecipherable] close.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: It was close?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Very close, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Tell -- tell me what your condition was when you got off.</span> <span id="s60">You were with a thousand women, about.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Y -- but today we know we were a little bit less than thousand women, but it’s supposed to arrive thousand women, and some of the people were taking off before the -- before the people that were put into the cattle cars.</span> <span id="s62">[indecipherable] maybe two or three of thousand girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span> <span id="s64">And do you recall how long a trip it was?</span> <span id="s65">A few days?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Oh, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Or less?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: It was for us -- in those days, it appeared longer than it really was, yeah.</span> <span id="s69">We have been in the car at least one night for sure, yeah.</span> <span id="s70">And the whole day trapped, we embark in late afternoon, so we traveled the whole afternoon, then we traveled the whole night, then we traveled a whole day.</span> <span id="s71">So that was for sure.</span> <span id="s72">Maybe i-if -- today I cannot even bet.</span> <span id="s73">I s -- remember that we arrived on -- on Sunday, late afternoon, and we eb -- embarked on a Friday afternoon.</span> <span id="s74">So how much is that?</span> <span id="s75">Tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: From s --</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Friday afternoon, Saturday -- Friday night, Saturday, then it must have been Saturday night, and over to Sunday.</span> <span id="s78">And that -- what it -- what it peared -- appeared to me then, I even mentioned that in the borders -- borders interview.</span> <span id="s79">Today, after 50 years, somehow it is -- it was shrinking in my mind of one day, one night, and another day, yeah.</span> <span id="s80">But I don’t remember certain night any more, yeah, today.</span> <span id="s81">But I d-definitely remember one night.</span> <span id="s82">So, that’s how it goes.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Do you remember the mood that you had on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: The -- your mood.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Food?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Mood.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: Oh, so mood?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: There was no mood.</span> <span id="s91">Fif -- you know, fi -- we have been one week in -- on stage of isolation in [indecipherable] point, which was cold, but dronga, on the old factory hall.</span> <span id="s92">And wi -- we had enough to eat, because everybody who was there brought some food along from home, so that we were living on.</span> <span id="s93">They did not supplied us any food.</span> <span id="s94">You are not asking an important question, but the people somehow managed to -- everybody had something from home, yeah, and somehow that was our -- that kept us somehow in a mood, yeah, if you are talking about mood.</span> <span id="s95">I don’t even remember, there was nothing to drink.</span> <span id="s96">I don’t remember anything to drink, and we went probably the whole week, nothing to drink.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: From the time you --</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: -- got into Petronka until --</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: No, there was no --</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: -- nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s103">There was no food distribution.</span> <span id="s104">That means whatever we had, maybe some fruit or so, replaced the -- some water, and it was -- there was no mood, it was some very strange situation, because we were -- we -- we have never experienced anything like that.</span> <span id="s105">We went as young people to -- to summer camps as children, and as teenagers.</span> <span id="s106">We -- they were -- we were told we have to -- we will go and do some work in the fields, or whatever necessary, because there’s no -- not enough manpower, or woman power, or whatever power, work.</span> <span id="s107">There -- there is not enough of -- there are not enough of people for certain jobs available, because everybody’s -- the male are on the front, and the women in that -- to work in factories, so do other things, the civilians.</span> <span id="s108">So we were actually selected to do jobs wherever we need it -- wherever we are needed, yeah.</span> <span id="s109">So, nobody was com -- very excited.</span> <span id="s110">The war went on, and so what?</span> <span id="s111">But for weeks or months we’ll survive and come back home, that what we are told.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: So there was not a -- really no -- no mood.</span> <span id="s114">Just we have taken things [indecipherable], we -- we realize that something must be done, and that is what they want us to do, to do some odd jobs, and [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: So there was no suspicion about something terrible --</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: -- going to happen?</span> <span id="s118">Nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Not at all, not at all.</span> <span id="s120">The only people who knew about the terrible things which are in front of us, were -- was the Jewish community’s board of -- the so-called Jewish centers, the Juden Centrales, they knew that things aren’t going too good for us.</span> <span id="s121">But they never disclosed anything.</span> <span id="s122">But I know we know that they knew, after the Wannsee Conference, yeah, what is in front of -- what’s in front of the population [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s124">And you think they knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: They knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: They knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: They knew.</span> <span id="s128">They didn’t know about the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s129">They didn’t know about the real f -- that -- that factory, because they knew that it doesn’t look good for us, but they couldn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: -- they said they really didn’t know.</span> <span id="s132">Because when the first people escaped from Auschwitz, those four boys, you know, Wirbra, Vetsla, Mordavich, and Rossi, and when they returned, to report, you wouldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s133">All Jewish people --</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Don’t do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: -- wouldn’t believe.</span> <span id="s136">So, that’s why I know and suspect that, you know, they didn’t know the real techniques of Germans [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: But when you -- by the time you got on the train --</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: -- to go to Auschwitz, you must have been weak, all of you.</span> <span id="s140">Were you weak?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Weak?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Weak?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: You weren’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Even though you weren’t eating much or drinking much?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: We are eating or not, because everybody brought --</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Brought something?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: -- some food along.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: So when you get -- you get in the train --</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Is this -- this is a cattle car train, or you’re sitting in s -- how -- what sort of a train did they put you in?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: Cattle car train.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Sitting on the floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Floor.</span> <span id="s157">And did they pack you in, or was it not so bad?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: It wasn’t nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: It wasn’t nice, but even that, we couldn’t -- so we were only young girls, you see.</span> <span id="s161">The other -- other people went with families, husbands and children.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: We were young people, couldn’t care less.</span> <span id="s164">Even if it was only with [indecipherable] for to work, but not youngsters -- very similar to those f-festivals we had, where the youngsters were squeezed together, and were happy and singing, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Th-though we were not singing, and we were squeezed together, yeah, but it [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Did people get beaten?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Were people beaten, were you treated brutally, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: No, no, no, they were very careful, very careful not to -- not to s -- give us any feeling of -- to become suspicious.</span> <span id="s171">No, we were just left alone, I would say.</span> <span id="s172">There were no guards inside.</span> <span id="s173">Yeah, they left us alone.</span> <span id="s174">No screamings, and no -- no beatings, nothing.</span> <span id="s175">So first real rough situation occurred when we arrived in Auschwitz itself.</span> <span id="s176">Because before, on the trip we were -- I think that was an combined -- combined operation between the guards of the Slovakians, and the Germans.</span> <span id="s177">The Slovaks took us to the border, and after the border, the Ger -- the bor -- not the border, it’s in Poland already, so Germans, they took over.</span> <span id="s178">But -- so, disembarking went very rough, yeah.</span> <span id="s179">Un -- un -- unexplainable rough.</span> <span id="s180">Obvious different types of people, different uniforms, different commands, everything changed, and then we still didn’t know what it is all about.</span> <span id="s181">So, it took us a couple of days to get used, while arriving in Auschwitz, and th -- we went through the procedure, in the first couple of days.</span> <span id="s182">So, that taught us gradually, that life -- the prior life of ours, is behind us, yeah.</span> <span id="s183">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: -- we have entered a new world.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Did you understand German then?</span> <span id="s187">Did you know -- you knew German.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: I have German schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: After the --</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: So, all the girls --</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: -- [indecipherable] school -- pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: -- all the girls understood German?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: But many.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Many.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: The girls -- as most of the girls were from our capital city, where -- which is an German speaking city, among others.</span> <span id="s199">It’s ambu -- multilingual city.</span> <span id="s200">But most of the Germ -- of the Jewish girls, of course, went to German elementary schools.</span> <span id="s201">If nothing else, they went to elementary schools, because the German elem-elementary schools -- the Jewish element-elementary schools were German --</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: -- in those days, it was shortly after World War Two, the people were born, the G-Germans --</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: You mean World War One, they were born shortly after --</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: World War One, correct, sorry.</span> <span id="s206">Th-Those girls were born, the parents enrolled them in Jewish elementary schools because they were good.</span> <span id="s207">They s -- have just transferred that from the Austrian system into the Slovak system.</span> <span id="s208">So that -- you must realize people, like Jewish parents, always prefer to send their kids to good schools, yeah.</span> <span id="s209">They have preferred the German, because that wa -- the elementary schools had the teachers, the language -- I mean the system was already established, while the Slovak system had to be established.</span> <span id="s210">There was not even a Slovak grammatic.</span> <span id="s211">It has to be developed in those days.</span> <span id="s212">But we spoke all -- we had to speak Slovak, and the city had a large Hungarian population from the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, but the Jewish people never -- ne -- in our city, Bratislava, never had any -- that -- they preferred the German.</span> <span id="s213">The Hungarian was mainly in the hands of non-Jews, yeah.</span> <span id="s214">It was the old fa-fashioned m-monarchies, yeah.</span> <span id="s215">We had none -- nothing in -- in our community like that.</span> <span id="s216">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: So, let me ask you someth -- I just thought of this.</span> <span id="s218">What were you wearing, on your -- do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: It was wi -- it was early -- it was early spring, March in Europe, and in that part of Poland was rough, and cold.</span> <span id="s220">So, not knowing where we are going, we all had -- definitely we had no high heels.</span> <span id="s221">A-As a matter of fact, I can show you a picture of the shoes which I wore.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Because they were the shoes I have picked just from prior years, during my -- our times in camps, and so on, where I had some special, very good mountain climbing shoes, yeah.</span> <span id="s224">I put that on, and not knowing -- I knew that we are not going into a city, but maybe into the fields, or other [indecipherable] rural areas.</span> <span id="s225">So I accordingly dressed myself, and shoes were always of importance wherever you went, even -- I mean, those shoes, I took the best and most durable, strong shoes I had.</span> <span id="s226">And as a matter of fact, I have a picture of those shoes [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s227">So, what else?</span> <span id="s228">And I had on good winter coat, a wool winter coat.</span> <span id="s229">I -- and I had gloves, and on cover of a knitted angora -- kind of an turban, something what we wear today, knitted, very nice, in dark green, I don’t know if -- in bottle green, I never forget that.</span> <span id="s230">So gloves, and the cover of my head.</span> <span id="s231">No, that was all I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: You don’t remember were you wearing a skirt?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: Ah?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Were you wearing a skirt, or you were wearing pants, do you have any -- remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: N-No, no, I had no -- I’ve a -- I wore skirt and one pullover.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: And most of the other women that you were with?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Similar, very similar.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Similar dress?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Very similar, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: And people were not wearing high heels, they didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Oh no, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: No.</span> <span id="s245">You knew, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: Sporty.</span> <span id="s247">Yeah, prepared for some -- a rural -- a rural environment.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Now Sippy, you told me that you saw a sign --</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: -- when you were walking into the area.</span> <span id="s251">The sign say, KZ Auschwitz, or Concentration Lager, what does it say?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: No, that was lots of sign when we went that was exactly on the door entrance.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: At the entrance.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: At the entrance, and it was hitting me like you would have hit me over the head.</span> <span id="s255">You see, I told you that I was an trained sandwriter.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: A graphic artist.</span> <span id="s258">I always looked at letters, and signs, and that’s why I could remember so many other things, even now where I don’t see, the first thing I’m looking at an area where I am, I’m looking at the road signs, and if I cannot see, then I’m asking people to read for me.</span> <span id="s259">Signs are something of importance.</span> <span id="s260">And I was reading everything what I could at the entrance.</span> <span id="s261">There was one little white sign with black letters.</span> <span id="s262">So little, I would say like an standard American --</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Foot?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Letterhead, [indecipherable] but sheet of --</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Paper?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Of paper, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: Like eight by 11?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Eight by 11, or something like that, in white.</span> <span id="s269">And there was on pr-printed, or painted wording -- the wording, it said, Concentrationes Lager.</span> <span id="s270">Concentration Camp, yeah.</span> <span id="s271">No more, and no less.</span> <span id="s272">I have never -- and that was -- I could not share that with anybody because those girls didn’t know what it is all about.</span> <span id="s273">I had experience with ex-German Jews, who were leaving, and Austrian Jews who left, all immigrants from all parts of Europe, they were coming through our city for awhile, and then left again.</span> <span id="s274">And they told us what a concentration camp is, because some of them were even relieved just under one condition to leave Germany, yeah.</span> <span id="s275">So, I knew that I entered an concentration camp, in spite of the fact that we really went through the door which said [indecipherable] fry.</span> <span id="s276">There were the stop signs, hahlt, yeah.</span> <span id="s277">All kinds of -- of warning signs, and important to the whole entrance of the camp, which even today I think you can see.</span> <span id="s278">But that little sign of concentration camp, was there, I don’t know why, it must have been there for the -- to the rules, yeah, or to international rules.</span> <span id="s279">It was there, and I noticed it.</span> <span id="s280">And then I know I’m in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s281">In the beginning, I didn’t -- we knew that after awhile, but the moment I entered that gate, I knew where I am.</span> <span id="s282">That was an --</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: So that must have been shocking.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: It was, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Don’t do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s287">It’s [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s288">I forgot.</span> <span id="s289">Yes, it was.</span> <span id="s290">And even then, so we -- look, it was the end of our private, previous life, we knew that.</span> <span id="s291">We didn’t know what’s in front of us, we didn’t know how to cope with our past, yeah.</span> <span id="s292">But I knew that I’m in a concentration camp, from the very first moment on.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: In this group that you came in with.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Were there close friends of yours, or these were just acquaintances?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: No, it’s -- you could -- look, it was funny.</span> <span id="s297">Nearly everybody knew everybody, but we were shifted forward and backward, and pushed around.</span> <span id="s298">So if you had a little group of people, two minutes later you belonged to another group, yeah.</span> <span id="s299">My very first contact in co -- it’s very strange.</span> <span id="s300">My very first contact with somebody whom I haven’t known before, and somehow drove -- drove us close to each other, was Katya, who became then the top administrative inmate of the women’s camp.</span> <span id="s301">Katya Singr, now how -- what happened?</span> <span id="s302">While we were still laying on the straw, on the floor in that factory hall the first day, she’s -- had an very deep voice, and that woman started to cry, and to scream loud, and crying, and crying --</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: This isn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: -- like an bad baby, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: This isn’t Petronka?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Nonstop.</span> <span id="s307">No, she -- there was a reason to cry, of course, we all could have cried, but she just cried, no.</span> <span id="s308">I went over to her, just ask her to stop to cry, we are all in the same boat, yeah.</span> <span id="s309">And she has no right to scream, and to cry, and to -- it will not help.</span> <span id="s310">And I was sitting next to her, and she stopped crying.</span> <span id="s311">So we became friends.</span> <span id="s312">I was the only person who spoke to her, and so then, we shared our belongings, the food, until we were put into the cattle car.</span> <span id="s313">She was in the same cattle car, we stick together somehow, as close as we could, because I felt I can in-influence her in making her a little bit more comforta -- feel comfortable, and she needed something like that, okay?</span> <span id="s314">Now, while in Birkenau, when we arrive -- no, sorry, while in Auschwitz one, when we arrive, somehow it’s her deep voice, and all that, she took -- she took control over some of the girls in one of the rooms, and was made immediately an Stubendienst in charge of one room.</span> <span id="s315">After awhile they made her charge of the whole half of the barrack.</span> <span id="s316">And then she asked me -- yet -- but I went out to work.</span> <span id="s317">She asked me if I would like to stay with her, and to help.</span> <span id="s318">And I refused, because I thought I ge -- don’t want to deal with people.</span> <span id="s319">That’s about it.</span> <span id="s320">I didn’t know how horrible the outer work really --</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: You didn’t want to deal with people?</span> <span id="s322">What is --</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Yeah, I did not want to deal with people, to be in command of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Ah, aha.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Because you would have to do things you didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: I -- I -- I simply -- it was not -- I did -- I have no desire, yeah, to tell people what to do, or to distribute food, or -- I didn’t like it.</span> <span id="s328">I wanted to go out to work, and come back and sleep, yeah.</span> <span id="s329">In -- but, then I had an accident, a -- a whole chimney -- while we were demolishing houses outdoors, an old chimney was falling on my back, and I felt very bad, and I had enough.</span> <span id="s330">So I approached somebody in charge of work detail, of the -- the -- one of the women of Ravensbrück, an German political prisoner, to help me to stay indoors, and if she could, arrange something.</span> <span id="s331">If somebody would believe that [indecipherable] and that’s my profession.</span> <span id="s332">And -- because I still didn’t wanted to stay with Katya, yeah.</span> <span id="s333">I didn’t wanted to become a blockelteste, it’s too [indecipherable] or whatever.</span> <span id="s334">I simply had no desire.</span> <span id="s335">It would have been nice if under normal conditions, but not there, where you had to be rough, or not even rough, but you had to scream, and you had to push people, and all right, that was it.</span> <span id="s336">Katya, I refused to help her.</span> <span id="s337">But the other one, whom I approached, she helped me, and put me into -- into charge of -- s-some painting --</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: The painting.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: -- the red stripes.</span> <span id="s340">That story of the red stripes you have, correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Right, right, yes.</span> <span id="s342">But I want to -- I want to go back a -- a little bit.</span> <span id="s343">When -- when you first arrived into Auschwitz one.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Did you go -- you went into barrack 10, or barrack nine?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: One of th --</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Upper -- upper part of barrack nine.</span> <span id="s349">Which -- all upper parts, which most people don’t know, administratively, there’s A barracks, and the lower part --</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: Was the B.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: No, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: No A and B, only A.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: A.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Now, block nine, barrack nine was down, and barrack nine A on top, first floor [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s357">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: And 10 the same, and eight the same, the upper ones, they are always the A one.</span> <span id="s359">So early writings will mention the A numbers [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: And that means the upper, that means --</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Yeah, the extra floors in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: The upper one was always an A -- A -- A [indecipherable] always an A.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s365">Now you mentioned to me that when you first arrived, it was clear that nobody knew how to organize this camp --</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: Nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: -- that it was completely chaotic.</span> <span id="s368">It’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: Extremely chaotic.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: And wh --</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: Extremely, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: As if they weren’t expecting people?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Who -- who sh -- who expect the people?</span> <span id="s374">They never -- people coming in by the thousands?</span> <span id="s375">An transport consisted of thousand men or women, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: They were used to have first people -- prisoners from jails, yeah.</span> <span id="s378">Poles, or Germans, who were transferred out of ja -- from jails to the camp.</span> <span id="s379">But never transports of certain groups by the thousands.</span> <span id="s380">And they were -- th -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Tape number one, side B, September seventh, with Sippy Tichauer in New York City.</span> <span id="s382">Okay, so -- so they were not expecting, except sort of normal prisoner movement?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Correct.</span> <span id="s384">And that was the first time that the a-a-ar -- arisar -- RSHA --</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: H-A.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: -- transports arrived to Auschwitz, yeah.</span> <span id="s387">The very first time, so they had no idea how to go about, and were trying to leave everything to the ex -- to the prisoners from Ravensbrück, who were specially brought over to Auschwitz to help to organize, because they had experience, while spending many years prior to that transf -- transfer to Auschwitz, in Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s388">But even they were not trained, or prepared for such mass influx of prisoners.</span> <span id="s389">So they depended practically on whatever we created there by ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: If people were -- and -- and the prisoners who became, or who wanted to be in charge, they had no experience of handling people, or the -- not at schools, they were not teachers, there were no -- so they’re just ordinary house girls, yeah.</span> <span id="s392">Never with an -- hardly professionals.</span> <span id="s393">Some of them had training in -- in office work, yeah.</span> <span id="s394">They succeeded because eventually the SS started to organize, together with the prisoners.</span> <span id="s395">I mean, food -- food had to be distributed.</span> <span id="s396">They didn’t know how to go about that.</span> <span id="s397">So they had to learn how to distribute food, they had to learn by -- by experience, day by day, how to go about everything.</span> <span id="s398">So, it was not easy, it was in horrible chaos for weeks, and weeks, and weeks.</span> <span id="s399">And eventually, after months, when the relocation of the women, in August ’44 -- no, ’42, occurred, th-the relocation to Birkenau, it was still cow -- chaotic, but people were already used to it.</span> <span id="s400">Roll call was -- lasted hours.</span> <span id="s401">The SS was never trained, they were not very intelligent people.</span> <span id="s402">Very simple, primitive people, and they s -- expected that the inmates will do the job, but the inmates were not trained for such an -- a bi -- big masses of people to handle.</span> <span id="s403">They -- I mean, if that would have been -- in the men’s camp, in Auschwitz, it was different.</span> <span id="s404">See, you had the prisoners, the male prisoners, were all ex-Polish officers, yeah.</span> <span id="s405">They knew how to handle their troops, how to control.</span> <span id="s406">They were obey -- they obeyed commands, because they were treating each other still like in the army.</span> <span id="s407">But that was the difference of the Polish male, and the older German male, of prisoners, and the women, yeah.</span> <span id="s408">Not because they were more capable, but it was an different background, yeah.</span> <span id="s409">We had -- many of the Poles were soldiers, ex-soldiers.</span> <span id="s410">The Germans were ex-soldiers too, or had military training, or had the -- were -- for example, we had a lot of s -- people who were in the Spanish Civil War, amongst the Germans.</span> <span id="s411">So they had -- there wa -- th-there was no problem with the German male -- male pr -- with the -- the male prisoners in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s412">But the problem occurred only among the women, because they had no -- no military training.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: So that when you were in Auschwitz one --</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: -- what’s going on with the men is totally different from what’s going on with the women?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Yeah, definitely.</span> <span id="s417">And there was no contact, and that there was an policy from the first day on, that if there is any job which a woman can do, in the woman’s camp, or the woman’s section, than the woman had -- will have preference.</span> <span id="s418">But if they don’t find a woman, then a male will be brought over to do the job, yeah.</span> <span id="s419">And that’s how I got my job, because I had a male profession.</span> <span id="s420">I was the only male -- woman in -- in -- in my country, in my profession, and when they were looking for somebody who could mix paint out of raw material, and produce those red stripes on the clothing, which I explained in prior interviews with you, they preferred me, because I was a woman who worked with -- perform in the woman’s camp.</span> <span id="s421">If they wouldn’t have found anybody, then the male would have brought.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: He would have done it.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: They would have brought in a -- a man to do the work.</span> <span id="s424">So that was the difference.</span> <span id="s425">I -- now you understand why we had such an hard life in the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Not because we were women, we had -- we had no military training, that’s what I want to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Sippy, around the area in Auschwitz one, where you -- where the women were staying --</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: -- was there a barbed wire around it?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: No, a wall was built.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: A wall?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: A wall was built.</span> <span id="s434">We -- we were located in todays blocks from one to 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Yeah, after 10 comes 11, th-the black wall.</span> <span id="s437">There were the women.</span> <span id="s438">And then, between us, parallel with those -- with the whole row, there was an wall erected.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: I brought -- I brought so --</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: I’ll show you that on the map, if you like.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Yeah, maybe we’ll do it later.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s443">Let me see if I can see.</span> <span id="s444">What have you marked here, neela?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: That’s what I marked, I marked what I think is the women’s camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: Now, where’s from one to 11?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Here.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Where’s 11?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: 11 is here.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Good.</span> <span id="s451">The wall was here.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: And when we left, they removed the wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: They removed the wall.</span> <span id="s457">So you had, presumably, your own kitchen?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: It’s a separate kitchen, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: -- it’s all coming -- the food is coming from the kitchen -- the same kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: I couldn’t tell you that, because I really couldn’t te -- no, no, the kitchen was not an separate kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: It wasn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: No.</span> <span id="s465">There was no kitchen on the map, either.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s467">Now, did you get somehow registered those first couple of weeks, or what did they do?</span> <span id="s468">They --</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: No, we were -- were registered very soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: You were registered very soon?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Very soon.</span> <span id="s472">I would say even after two days or so, only we were not tattooed --</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: -- straight away, but they have then -- we were registered.</span> <span id="s475">They thought we were with that little apparatus where they press the numbers in.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: And it didn’t last.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: Which disappeared after awhile, and then we had to do it with the double needle.</span> <span id="s478">I explained that to you many times, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: So, we were registered, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: And the registration was on paper, and they also gave you some -- some -- the insignia [indecipherable] nothing</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: The registration was all -- that was an experienced -- experienced situation because the German concentration camp registration goes back to old times, so if you had here an couple of women were asked several questions, and you received your number, of course, and you received -- so that number you carry through the rest of your stay in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: And you had to sew this on your --</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Did you have to sew it on?</span> <span id="s486">Sew.</span> <span id="s487">You have to sew it?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s489">And th-this -- you see, we had in the beginning, Russian uniforms, you know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: From there the Russian prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s492">See --</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: And these were pants and a shirt?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Striped?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Striped?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: No, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: The Russians --</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: They didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: The Russian soldiers in striped uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: Oh look, think.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: No, I’m assuming they didn’t, but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s506">When you say Russian uniforms, what is it -- what --</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: Russian uniform from --</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: The ar --</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: -- their prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s510">Prisoners --</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: So they’re army uniforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Army uniforms, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: And were they heavy, were they light?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: No, they were light, pretty light.</span> <span id="s515">So -- the Russian uniforms were cloths of cotton, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: And -- but they were sh-small, because they have used some disinfecting technique which was shrinking.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: A steaming, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: Even the steaming -- steaming of -- facilities are still there in Auschwitz, in Birkenau, if you go for a visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: The -- the big one at the --</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: In the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: The wa -- in the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: Yeah, even the machine’s there.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: And everything which went in are shrinking.</span> <span id="s528">No, anyhow, we had those uniforms, and when the uniforms -- when the influx of prisoners -- of newcomers, was so big that the Russian uniforms wouldn’t last, then they introduced civilian clotheses of people who brought their stuff.</span> <span id="s529">They have taken all the stuff away.</span> <span id="s530">The good things went over to -- transported to Germany, and the less good ones were distributed for newcomers.</span> <span id="s531">And they have -- they had to be marked with the red stripes, and there where my career started, by mixing the paint and painting the stripes.</span> <span id="s532">That was the beginning --</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: -- of my real artistic --</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Your career.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: -- career.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: No, we’ll get that for a minute.</span> <span id="s538">Di -- were you able to keep your shoes?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: Yes, because every times they were -- somebody wanted to take my shoes away, especially with the German women, stopped me constantly, and they wanted to take my shoes off, because they looked so good and heavy.</span> <span id="s540">But they always too small, I had a small foot, and a small number, and not one of the German women was lucky enough.</span> <span id="s541">So I kept those shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: So this was good for you.</span> <span id="s543">This was --</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Oh boy, that saved my life in the beginning, in spite of the fact that in -- outdoor work, we were not allowed to march to the workplace with shoes, you had to go barefoot.</span> <span id="s545">You could only use the shoes during working time.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Why were they doing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: You ask me why?</span> <span id="s548">Ask me why.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: And did you have to take them off when you walked back?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Carrying -- carrying the shoes with you, forward, and backward.</span> <span id="s551">What is it?</span> <span id="s552">Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: How soon did they try to tattoo you with a -- those -- that ink stuff that --</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Which one?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: The first time.</span> <span id="s556">And it --</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: Soon, very soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: Very soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: But I want to know something.</span> <span id="s561">Were they tattooing the men, or were they experiment --</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: No --</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: the men were tattooed.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: They were?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: They were tattooing the men, and then the men were coming over to us, and started to tattoo us.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: So how come it didn’t work?</span> <span id="s568">They had men there for a long time.</span> <span id="s569">How come it --</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Wait a minute, wait a minute.</span> <span id="s571">They never used those stamp for the men, yeah.</span> <span id="s572">They only started us to stamp.</span> <span id="s573">Somebody of the SS had an idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: That this would be easier or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s576">Bang, bang.</span> <span id="s577">But it didn’t work.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Then they have send us s-some man to do the tattooing.</span> <span id="s580">I was tattooed by -- by a man who -- whom -- who is still alive.</span> <span id="s581">I know him.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: And you asked him to do a nice --</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: You asked him to do a nice tattoo, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: And I told him to make me a smaller tattoo.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: Small, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: He was my second cousin, so he obeyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: Were you surprised when Katya sort of started supervising in this room, given how frightened she was before?</span> <span id="s589">D-Did her behavior in the beginning surprise you, that she was --</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: That she --</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Started -- took over like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: That she had leadership qualities, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Yes, was that surprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: It wasn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s597">No, she was coming from a non-Jewish background, from an different world, yeah.</span> <span id="s598">I didn’t know her background, but I knew that she -- she was good in -- in managing.</span> <span id="s599">She was management trade.</span> <span id="s600">I think I realized that she was trained in management, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s603">And she was mo -- good bookkeeper.</span> <span id="s604">She had an good background, and she put -- she had so -- understanding of American bookkeeping, yeah.</span> <span id="s605">For her to prepare a new system of roll calls, was nothing else like the knowledge of American bookkeeping.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: What do you mean she came from a non-Jewish background, I thought she was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: She was -- she had no Jewish education.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: Uh-uh, but her parents were Jewish?</span> <span id="s609">Or somebody was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: It’s -- we don’t know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: We don’t -- I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: I have -- she did not know anything about Judaism.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s614">But you had told me a long time ago that she was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: She was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s617">Is it the case -- this -- this it seems -- this I wrote down somewhere, that who -- well, let me ask it this way, who was in charge of the outside commandos?</span> <span id="s618">Was it different from the people who were in charge of the inside commandos in the beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s620">If you have, first of all, the whole structure, you must understand that you had an -- the SS structure, from top to bottom, was a military -- military-like business, or managerial-like business.</span> <span id="s621">You had top management, you had middle management, you had lower management.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: And each SS level had their inmate assistance, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: So, if it comes to work, yeah, is a section of inside and outside work, belonged to the German expression I’m going to use, the Abbatz einsatz.</span> <span id="s626">The work sec -- the section of -- which a-arranged your employment, yeah, it was like an employment office, where there was an SS man in charge, and an assistant, which was always of -- an inmate.</span> <span id="s627">The inmate had to expedite the orders of his the -- the SS person who receives the order from my level, or from -- or from, yeah, higher level of s -- he -- of -- I mean, on higher authority, which was negotiating this private companies, for work -- for -- for wer -- manpower.</span> <span id="s628">If an factory needed workers, 500 women, for example, especially women, they have asked for it, then it went over to the top man of the SS.</span> <span id="s629">He was giving the order to the camp, a representative of his command of work det -- work work, like an department of work, an office where you -- where you apply for work, yeah?</span> <span id="s630">Or an office which is -- I don’t know the American word of comparison, a civilian comparison --</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: -- but it’s an department of work.</span> <span id="s633">You have -- say you have --</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: So, like an employment office.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: It’s like an employment office.</span> <span id="s636">We have had in our bu -- camp office, an section of after the registration of the newcomers, which went by profession, yeah?</span> <span id="s637">So if they were looking for people who could sew, or tailors, they need 50 tailors for an factory, they have coming to us --</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: To find -- to get them.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: -- that we had the -- the registered people under this -- under -- the women who were telling us when they were registered they were tailors, yeah, or dressmakers.</span> <span id="s640">So we had our section by profession.</span> <span id="s641">We had [indecipherable] by profession.</span> <span id="s642">We had the [indecipherable] and the -- so where -- where am I now, I’m not -- I’m lost.</span> <span id="s643">What was the question?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Well, I w -- I -- I think I was -- I was asking a question before the camp office is actually formulated.</span> <span id="s645">I’m trying to get some idea of --</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: Of who was in charge of the indoor and the outdoor.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s648">In the be -- in -- before you had the camp office, before it beca -- becomes more ordered.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: I’m trying to figure out the kind of chaos that you’re describing.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: So yes, the chaos was settled gradually, by introducing the old German concentration camp system of abbatz dinkst, and abbatz einsatz.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: Two people -- two SS sections, which were dealing with -- with like an employment office, and the office was supplied --</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: The people.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: The people.</span> <span id="s656">Now, if they needed 500 road workers, they were just asking for 500 women next morning, to be ready to march out.</span> <span id="s657">And then they were just taking the people from the barracks, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Right, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: -- put 500 together, and off they went.</span> <span id="s660">But that went always first to the SS commander, who asks them his counterpart of the inmate who was in charge of those [indecipherable] and -- and -- and the work -- work force, yeah, office.</span> <span id="s661">Now we have no words -- I mean I’m -- it’s very hard to compare something with our civilian life, and our civilian structure.</span> <span id="s662">I’m trying to be --</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: -- as simple as possible, and to make the comparison, so it should go into your head.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: But does it answer the question?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Yeah, well let me ask -- let me ask it in another way.</span> <span id="s668">When -- when you’re talking about these first few months, including the time you’re going out --</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: -- on the demolition crews.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: What’s the effect on you and the women in b -- in it being so chaotic?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s676">We -- we knew in the morning there were -- if you were in on work detail -- on constant work detail, and the SS leader of the work detail, because each work detail had an SS leader, too, in charge, if he was happy with you, he ask for you, and you --</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Again?</span> <span id="s678">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: -- you reported every time -- every morning to the same group of work detail.</span> <span id="s680">If you didn’t wanted to go, then you were not going, yeah?</span> <span id="s681">Nobody -- they never knew where you are, and it wasn’t big to [indecipherable] what is said on big, big [indecipherable] in the morning after roll call, the formation of work details.</span> <span id="s682">So they just grabbed the people, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: 500 here, and 600 here, and 30 here, and that went e-every day the hunt, it was just like a hunt, yeah.</span> <span id="s685">I -- well --</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: What was the -- what was the name of that -- the soldier who gave you an aspirin after you’d injured your [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: I didn’t know his name, but rank was --</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: You told me it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: -- finner his rank was an finnerish in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Oh, that’s his rank?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: Yeah, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: I thought that’s is his name.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: I tell you why, I tell you why.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: The inmate who was an kapo, a German woman, is her name there, Elli -- Elli Meyer?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: Yes, the -- some -- I have it somewhere, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: She called him her finnerish.</span> <span id="s698">Now, she could not know his name, or you never a-addressed some SS person by his name, yeah.</span> <span id="s699">You called the SS people by their ranks.</span> <span id="s700">And that was the usual thing.</span> <span id="s701">So when she said to him a finneri, it couldn’t be his name, it was his rank.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: And I don’t know what’s an finneri, you have to look that up in an German dictionary --</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: -- what an finneri means.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: But he got you an aspirin?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: And not only that he got me an aspirin, he grabbed -- he took me in his arms, and put me on an -- on an pile of -- of straw, high, yeah.</span> <span id="s708">And was looking into his pockets for something, and took an aspirin.</span> <span id="s709">He didn’t even know that you have to take an Bayer aspirin with water.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: And you went into the infirmary?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: And is that when this S -- you s -- were next to an SS woman, and she hit you?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: They hit me -- they hit -- she hit me, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Because you were next to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: Because what?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Because you were next to her, or she just --</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: She was standing there, in front of the entrance of the infirmary, and she was hitting everybody, but she caught -- she hit me badly, and I knew who she was.</span> <span id="s718">She was hanged in Bergen-Belsen, and yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s719">One of he -- her name was Viningher.</span> <span id="s720">Folkenrat -- Folkenrat.</span> <span id="s721">Her maiden name was Viningher.</span> <span id="s722">Anyway ---</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Viningher was her -- her ma --</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: No, she was Folkenrat --</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: Folkenrat?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: She was known as Folkenrat, yeah.</span> <span id="s727">In any case, she was hitting me, and I never returned, and that saved my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: Because you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: Because I left.</span> <span id="s730">Because those people who were admitted, were -- never made it to Birkenau during the relocation.</span> <span id="s731">So I -- I left, and then I approached another German woman, and told her about my profession.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: So, is this -- what -- approximately how many months were you doing this demolition work, a few months?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: Demolition work I did, I would say til end of May.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Til the end of May.</span> <span id="s735">And then you went, and you said that you have this profession, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Enough is enough, and I went -- she was in the lager aredest, her name was Ava Weigl, an woman from Berlin, and I told her --</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: And it’s W-e-i-g-l, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: W-e-i-g-l, yeah.</span> <span id="s739">Now, she said, “I -- look, I know what your profession is, because my husband,” or my lover, whoever he was, “has the same profession in Berlin.”</span> <span id="s740">Now, a couple of days later, she comes -- wait -- yeah.</span> <span id="s741">But she said, “Stay at home, don’t go out to work, and if the SS woman Drexel,” was then in charge of the roll call, “if she would ask you why you are at home, just tell her that Ava asked me to stay at home, because she has an job for me in the making.”</span> <span id="s742">Now --</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: So was that where you recuperated, then?</span> <span id="s744">You just --</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: How did you recuperate?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: That was all.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: That was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: That was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: You just stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: I had -- I had no time to recuperate, I have been fighting for my life.</span> <span id="s752">It was -- I was badly, badly hit.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: In any case, next -- four days later, one of the top SS men was coming and looking for somebody who can mix paint, and all that, so custom that -- it was custom tailored for me, that job, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: And in between newcomers were coming in, and the -- the Russian uniform were going to an end, and so those clotheses were -- had to be marked with red stripes.</span> <span id="s757">So that was quite an career, it started this way, and it was an coincident, everything, that I spoke German, that I approached her, and she --</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: At the right time.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: At the right time.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: I’m going to stop the tape now, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: This is the end of tape number one, side B with Sippy Tichauer.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: This is tape number two, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Helen Tichauer, conducted on September seventh, 2000, in New York City, with Joan Ringleheim.</span> <span id="s765">I think we’re okay here.</span> <span id="s766">Sippy, why -- first of all, who was it who wanted you to paint the red stripe, is it --</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: I beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: Who was the SS who wanted the red stripe?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: It was Aumeier.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: And you spell that A-u-w, or A-u-m-e-y-e-r?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: No.</span> <span id="s772">You can look him up.</span> <span id="s773">I think it’s A-u-m-e-i-e-r.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: Uh-huh, e-r.</span> <span id="s775">Okay, I’ll look that up.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: But you can look that up again.</span> <span id="s777">He was sentenced --</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Why did he have -- wa -- oh, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: Why did he what?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: Why this idea of the red stripe?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: Ah.</span> <span id="s782">You see, people who are working outdoors in the fields, or wherever, if they wear civilian clothes, then they could have been taken for any civilian person.</span> <span id="s783">If they escape, they would have been able to mingle among the civilians, and nobody would have known who they are.</span> <span id="s784">But being marked with an special red stripe, the -- even the male -- male prisoners, who some of them, the officials had no stripe th -- on upper clothing, they had the dark blue jackets, yeah, at wintertime, or some of them had -- yeah, dark blue jackets, they had the red stripes in the center of their jacket, so to be recognized as an inmate.</span> <span id="s785">That was very, very known in the -- in the system of -- of concentration camp inmates, the red stripe --</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: Suits?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: They were marked with the red stripes from top -- from top to bottom, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: So this was sort of typical in the concentration camp system?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: It was.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: Right.</span> <span id="s792">If you had something which was not --</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: A uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: -- striped --</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: -- then it had to be marked --</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: Marked.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: -- to be recognized as inmate.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: So -- so tell --</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: Sometimes the pants on the sides were marked with red stripes, yeah.</span> <span id="s801">And women, well we had to distribute to the newcomers, civilian clothes, had to be marked so to distinguish them between civilians and -- and inmates.</span> <span id="s802">It was --</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: So tell me --</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: So te-tell me what sort of paint did you use, so that it would adhere to the cloth?</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: P-P-Paint which does not -- which does not dissolve in water.</span> <span id="s809">Some kind of oil paint with an drying agent, to -- to -- to dry quick enough, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: H-How long did it take you to figure out what -- how to put this paint together?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: To what?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: How long did it take you to figure out how to put the paint together so that it would work, or did you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: I didn’t need to figure out, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: You knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: -- have been an trained painter.</span> <span id="s816">That was part of our training.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: And who came up with the color red?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: They.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: They came up with it?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: It didn’t glow in the dark, did it?</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: No.</span> <span id="s823">In those days they -- they were not devel -- they had not developed the colors which are gl -- no, we -- we have developed that glowing business very, very late.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: Late, yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s826">Pretty late.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: So when -- when you first -- when you first developed this, did you -- were you the only person who was painting the stripes?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: Yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: So how many women do you think you did in a day?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: Oh, everyone who had a stripe was ready to go to work.</span> <span id="s831">Those who had no stripes, couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s832">The others in dozens, by the hundreds, yeah one, two, three, from top to bottom down.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: And would this happen at the end of a registration process?</span> <span id="s834">Is that where -- or where would it happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: No, it happened even before the registration, the moment you received your dress.</span> <span id="s836">It depends.</span> <span id="s837">Sometimes they had -- so they were selected for work, or for work detail, and they were standing there, and I had to go from one to -- to -- from one to -- and to -- from one to the next, and do the whole [indecipherable] the whole group, and then some -- and when there were no people after th -- after they went out to work, during the day I had -- I -- I had to do the stripes in the store, and prepare that for the next person who received that dress of -- as a newcomer, yeah.</span> <span id="s838">So, I had to make things in stock at the beg -- at the -- under -- in the s-stores, where those dresses were prepared for newcomers, that I did during the day, and -- and when -- when there were -- were not enough, and we had more people to go out for work than we could paint.</span> <span id="s839">And supplies, oh, I had to do that while standing in -- in -- before -- standing outdoors, and I had to do that on their body.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: You mean when they had the --</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: But -- yes, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: -- when they had the clothes on?</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: -- they started -- I started actually to do that in the store, in the store.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: So they would already get clothes with the paint on it, all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: And they would get the clothes -- clothes wi-with the stripes, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: So, did this start happening before you moved to Birkenau?</span> <span id="s847">Before August?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: Oh yeah, oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: So, in May?</span> <span id="s850">May - June?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: It started very soon, very soon.</span> <span id="s852">The moment we had no more Russian uniforms to supply, then the -- some of the Russians uniforms appeared again, because people were killed in the gas, and we received the business back, only the numbers had to be removed, because they were the numbers of the dead people.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: Dead people, yeah.</span> <span id="s854">So, Sippy, during this time --</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Mm?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: -- they were gassing in Auschwitz one?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: During this time --</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: -- before you moved to Birkenau --</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: -- they’re -- they are gassing in Auschwitz one?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: That, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: They’re not?</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: They were gassing in Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: But that in --</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: [indecipherable] house.</span> <span id="s868">Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: No, no.</span> <span id="s870">But before you moved to Birkenau --</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: -- between March and August, is there --</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: See, it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: -- are there some gassings?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: -- it was -- there were rumors, but we -- we had no proof.</span> <span id="s876">We didn’t know.</span> <span id="s877">We had no --</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: You didn’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: No, we didn’t.</span> <span id="s880">We knew that non-Jews were gassed, too, but I can’t -- we -- we don’t know where they were gassed, yeah.</span> <span id="s881">We had no sondercommando in our switzwan.</span> <span id="s882">So that’s why we suspected that even if they have gas in our switzwan, the corpse were not burned in our switzwan.</span> <span id="s883">They were sent -- take to Birkenau, yeah, and to -- burned in open pits, or wherever.</span> <span id="s884">But they did not -- there were -- there were never people from the sondercommando working in Auschwitz one.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: Auschwitz one.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: They only burned the people -- non-Jewish people who died, and then supplied the urns to their relatives, yeah.</span> <span id="s887">They were dead people, not gassed people.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: So that is an whole story which has to be explored, and to -- read, how they have developed their killing process in Auschwitz one, and then later in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s890">But all I know is that non-Jews were gassed, too, yeah, in the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: In the beginning, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: Did you believe the rumors?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: Of course, we -- we knew that they were gassed, because we received their clothes in -- back in the -- after the gassing, with their numbers.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: So you didn’t think they just died?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: [indecipherable] just died --</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: You assumed it was too ma --</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: -- you see, in the beginning it was very hard to -- to control and check rus -- what really happened, because there was no even interest in, or -- I mean, we had no need to distinguish one from the other.</span> <span id="s899">If they were non-Jews, then they have returned to earth with some dirt, so they are not even the ashes.</span> <span id="s900">But otherwise, I have -- I had very little interest in the whole business, because we have learned of the gassing pretty late, yeah.</span> <span id="s901">And -- then later, while in Birkenau, and while I had been engaged, and I received an drawing office in the camp office, and I was engaged to pr -- to produce some diagrams with all the movements in the camp -- in the women’s camp.</span> <span id="s902">He said I had to produce those diagrams who were then sent over to Berlin.</span> <span id="s903">It was only then that I became more interest in the gassing process, because I had to register the daily gassing of women in the camp.</span> <span id="s904">And that, I re -- I had reported every -- every end of the month I received some daily reports of those gassings, and had to enter that on the diagram.</span> <span id="s905">So that’s why I knew about it, and why sometimes we had to -- the people who were already pre -- prepared us, or -- not prepared, but people who were decided o-of their killing, through gas, were still alive while I already had to enter them on my diagram as -- as dead people, yeah.</span> <span id="s906">That wasn’t -- that wasn’t bad, the hardest part of it was between the selections in -- in -- in those selections, yeah, not of newcomers, but those who were living in the camp.</span> <span id="s907">The selections, the transfer to the gas chamber, it took sometimes on whole, maybe 12 hours, but in advance, we already had to register them as dead, because they were not alive any more, was in the trans-transfer process.</span> <span id="s908">It’s very hard to explain, and hard to -- to bel -- to -- to understand the -- psychologically how hard it was on my system.</span> <span id="s909">Couldn’t do much.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: Can you explain how hard it was on you?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: Can you explain how hard it was on you to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: How hard it was for you to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: Could you speak a little bit louder?</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: Can you explain how hard it was for you to do this?</span> <span id="s917">What did it do to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: Hard that you had -- that you have known the people are still alive, and they were registered already, had to be registered already for the next day’s dead, yeah.</span> <span id="s919">It -- that is hard to explain, yeah.</span> <span id="s920">Just like I would say compare with you have in front of you, people who are dying, yeah?</span> <span id="s921">You only don’t know when they are going to die, but they are in the stage of dying.</span> <span id="s922">You feel very strange while you are still here in front of you the living body, and you know they may be dead tomorrow, or after tomorrow, but they are already in -- theoretically, in your mind, dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: That is more or less the -- the same situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: But did you ever have anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: Yeah?</span> <span id="s929">You see -- and if you have masses of people, even if you have -- didn’t know them, but you have an group of people by the hundreds, yeah, sometimes even healthy ones, and here they are, already dead on paper, and they’re standing outside still on the -- on -- on th -- on the ground, and are still alive and breathing, and -- and -- and don’t know that they’re going to be dead tomorrow, yeah.</span> <span id="s930">That was hard.</span> <span id="s931">And just -- just like with an dying person who -- whom you know, and who -- where you know he is going to die, but he doesn’t know, yeah?</span> <span id="s932">Or she doesn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: And it’s sometimes just a question of hours.</span> <span id="s935">Niya, is that an comparison?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s937">Yeah, I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: But let me go back to the painting for a moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: To what?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Painting.</span> <span id="s942">The painting of the stripe.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: Oh, you are an artist all of a sudden.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: I want to know f -- you did it for a certain amount of time alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: And then you brought in one woman, two women?</span> <span id="s947">Other people did it as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: No?</span> <span id="s950">Only you?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: Only me, because I knew -- I knew how to -- to paint, how to mix the paint from raw material, yeah.</span> <span id="s952">That was on -- something you had to learn in -- as an professional, and not to -- like an housewife who can cook.</span> <span id="s953">Within -- it was the difference like between an chef, and the primitive peasant woman, both could cook, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: But the difference how to cook, is between an chef and then -- and then any -- any housewife can cook, right, or learn to cook, now --</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: But you weren’t the only one who put the stripe --</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: Yes, I was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: You was?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: Later on --</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: -- when I was entrusted with -- of the printing of the numbers --</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: I trained some other people to do the stripes, but it was me who mixed the colors.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: Always.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: The paint, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s967">And for how long was this done?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: All the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: All the time.</span> <span id="s970">So, if someone did not wear a uniform, the striped uniform which was common, they always had the red stripe.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: But you said that you never had the red stripe?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: But yours would re -- you -- yours would come off in the rain?</span> <span id="s975">You -- yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: I did my red stripes with water -- on a water bases, so that it would come off, in case I would like to remove it.</span> <span id="s977">And I did it before we went on the Dead March, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: Then I got myself a new coat from the [indecipherable] yeah, on other -- on coat, on warm coat, I painted the red stripe, which came off in no time, and I was prepared for any situation, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s981">So let’s -- let’s talk about the camp office.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: The camp office?</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: Which camp office?</span> <span id="s985">Now listen very carefully.</span> <span id="s986">I have here --</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: Not the stopskaboida.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: Uh?</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: Not the stopskaboida.</span> <span id="s990">Yours.</span> <span id="s991">Your office.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: What are you saying?</span> <span id="s993">Not what?</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: Not the stopskaboida.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: Now wait a wi -- wait a minute.</span> <span id="s996">I have an dilemma.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: There is an group of people who worked, the secretaries for SS people.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: As secretaries for the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1001">Each Gestapo man had one woman who worked -- was his secretary, whom he -- whom had to -- who was forewarned not to disclose anything what they are doing, otherwise they are going to be shot.</span> <span id="s1002">It was an -- you must understand, and you will not understand, but nevertheless, Auschwitz and Birkenau had sub-camps -- so-called sub-camps.</span> <span id="s1003">Now, to make you -- give you an idea, those sub-camps, in our English language they are sub-camps, but there is no German word for it, yeah.</span> <span id="s1004">The German system of the camp in Birkenau and Auschwitz, in the German language, in their own language, had two types of sub-camps, yeah.</span> <span id="s1005">That is now hard to explain, but there is no -- again, no word for sub-camps.</span> <span id="s1006">They were -- if I would like -- if you would like me to translate that by the wording, I’m going to give you the German name.</span> <span id="s1007">There was one type of camp which was -- one type of sub-camps, which was called a branch camp, Zweig lager, and Zweig, Z-w-e-i-g, is a branch of a tree, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: For example.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: And then there was an other type of camps, of sub-camps, which were called Abschnitts lager, A-b-s-c-h-n-i-t-t-s, Abschnitts lager, that means -- abschnitts -- I don’t know what -- what it means in English.</span> <span id="s1012">It’s not always wise to translate exactly, because sometimes you get some stupid results out of it.</span> <span id="s1013">But lets call the other one sub-camp, yeah?</span> <span id="s1014">Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: An Abschnitts mean -- would -- I would even say section, yeah?</span> <span id="s1017">So whatever it is, it is still an sub-camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: Only, but we don’t -- but you and all other big shots don’t know, is that one of those two were always -- the one will belong to one -- the one group, even if they were allocated two yards from the crematorium, belonged to an -- to heads of privilege -- privilege, in -- in commas, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: Quotes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: In quotes.</span> <span id="s1022">Not to be exposed for gassing.</span> <span id="s1023">As a matter of fact, they were forbidden to gas the people who belonged to those camps.</span> <span id="s1024">While those who were part of the section -- what I’m calling section, underwent selections and could have got -- been gassed.</span> <span id="s1025">Now comes an example, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: Let’s go to the women’s camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: Harmense, Boody, Ricekoff, Shtopskaboida, B-Beetoogee, were all privileged branch camps.</span> <span id="s1030">There’s no history in the Auschwitz -- there’s no -- no example in the whole Auschwitz women’s camp history, that there was ever a selection in those sub-camps, which I am calling an branch -- branch camp.</span> <span id="s1031">Never, there was never in the whole history, an selection in Ricekoff, or in Harmense, or in Boody, or in the Shtopskiboidi, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: Beetoogee.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: In Beetoogee.</span> <span id="s1034">That is the [indecipherable] camp, which was next, between crematorium five and four.</span> <span id="s1035">Good.</span> <span id="s1036">While the other branch, or the other category of s -- of what am I calling --</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: Don’t do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: Don’t touch that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: Don’t touch that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: What?</span> <span id="s1043">Ah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: You’re touching my mi --</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: -- while the other category, what am I calling that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: The section.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: You could be gassed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: Could be gassed, there were selections going on.</span> <span id="s1050">For example, to that group belonged the sealava, yeah, b-b-b-B1C, B2B -- B -- B1 -- B2B, that was a Czech camp, was a Gypsy camp.</span> <span id="s1051">The C lagers of Czech camps, the Gypsy camp, both camps -- both parts of the women’s camp, B1A and B1B, but they were -- that was a -- no, that was -- forget about B1A and B1B, that was the main women’s camp, and all others belonged to us, to B1A, and B1B, up to the women’s camp.</span> <span id="s1052">So, I’m giving you here a small example why -- yeah, and they were all administered by the women’s camp -- camp office.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: Sections.</span> <span id="s1054">The section -- what, everything was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: Everything, both sections, and had to report every day to the roll call -- for the roll call, to our camp office.</span> <span id="s1056">We were the leading administrative entity --</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: -- for the women’s camp.</span> <span id="s1059">It was not the Shtopskaboidas --</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: -- they were an bloody, unimportant, but Laura Shelly brought an -- was giving the impression if they would have been headquarters of everything.</span> <span id="s1062">They were the SS headquarters, yeah.</span> <span id="s1063">And they -- there was no cola -- col -- cooperation or camaraderie among those SS secretaries, whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1064">I have no idea how to explain that to the Whitman girl.</span> <span id="s1065">He misunderstood the whole -- she had -- she was, what you are calling in German, spinning, yeah.</span> <span id="s1066">Now, is that clear, what I explained to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: Yes, but not --</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: Is that new?</span> <span id="s1069">Is that new?</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: Yes, that’s -- that -- you haven’t said that to me before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: You haven’t said that to me before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: I never said it to you before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: Of course I’d not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: How else could I have said to you during all those years?</span> <span id="s1078">But I hope that you understand now, better than you would have understood 10 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: But explain something to me.</span> <span id="s1080">Why -- why would there be a group of privileged prisoners from which there would never be a selection or a gassing?</span> <span id="s1081">Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: Don’t ask me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: You don’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1085">You couldn’t ask any -- that -- you couldn’t ask the system somewhere in Berlin why.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: It was actually so -- we were so sure that we helped our ca -- our friends to be transferred to those camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1090">You were two yards away from crematorium five, and were not all -- and were not gassed.</span> <span id="s1091">Where people had to come from Holland, and from France, and I don’t know -- know where from, to -- to be gassed in that crematorium, while the camp around --</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: They were not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: -- two yards only, had never one case of selection, yeah.</span> <span id="s1094">And we knew it, but very few in the camp office, maybe it was me and Katya, who knew what the real -- and that why we could help.</span> <span id="s1095">That why we were transferring friends constantly to those parts of -- of the camp where we knew they will never be exposed to the selection.</span> <span id="s1096">Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1098">So, is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: Now, anything to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: About this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1102">Is that -- that is now -- are you surprised what I told you, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: Yeah, it’s -- in one sense it’s surprising, in another sense there -- there’s some recognition that there was a certain kind of -- I don’t -- I don’t know whether I want to call it protection going on, if you had a certain standing.</span> <span id="s1104">But that it would be particular commandos is a surprise to me.</span> <span id="s1105">I mean, I understood from what you told me, that having been in the camp for x number of years --</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: -- would mean something to the SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: No.</span> <span id="s1111">No, because [indecipherable] so few, that you did -- had no -- that means they didn’t know who -- who was who, if you have an -- that -- what would mean to the SS?</span> <span id="s1112">The headquarter SS, they can -- they had nothing to do with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: But in a certain way, this doesn’t make any sense.</span> <span id="s1114">Do you know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: No, it’s just --</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Do you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1117">Not that the s -- the system doesn’t make any sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: The whole system didn’t -- the whole system didn’t make any sense.</span> <span id="s1119">But I’m telling you now something which was the real -- the real issue, it -- that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: So how did you -- how did you know?</span> <span id="s1121">I mean, at what point did it become clear to you and Katya, that these are protected commandos?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: From the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: From the beginning?</span> <span id="s1124">Because they didn’t treat those people in the same way they were treating other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: No, we -- we -- we knew -- Katya was close to the top SS woman, o-or man who were in charge.</span> <span id="s1126">What are you looking for?</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: I’m just -- because the tape is going to stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1129">No, we knew it.</span> <span id="s1130">I don’t -- I knew it.</span> <span id="s1131">I didn’t even investigated why I know it, where from.</span> <span id="s1132">I knew it.</span> <span id="s1133">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1135">Let’s -- let’s stop for a second.</span> <span id="s1136">This is the end of tape number two, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: This is tape number two, side B, with Helen Tichauer, on September seventh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: Look, I give you an example.</span> <span id="s1140">In ’43, we were tr -- always trying from the beginning, once I got into the -- into the -- with the position of the camp office, how I got into the pen -- office is another story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: Yeah, we’ll talk about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: But, once I’ve been in, and I have noticed that there are no selections going on over there, yeah, in those camps -- in those part of the camp, we have started [indecipherable] I was running to Katya, Katya, I need a job, let -- let’s transfer her, let’s do that.</span> <span id="s1145">So we did it.</span> <span id="s1146">We have transferred the people to safeguard them, and to save them, yeah, into those comma -- into those work details.</span> <span id="s1147">And only once in my lifetime, for which I’m even today very unhappy, is that very good friends of mine, in the beginning, when everything was still very bad, and the new art [indecipherable] work detail in -- of those branch camps were established, and among them, one was called Boody, and I have helped an lot of girls to go to Boody, because we knew it is one of the branch camps, and there were never selections in Boody.</span> <span id="s1148">Unfortunately, some of the German kapos started to massacre the Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s1149">But that had nothing to do with the system, yeah.</span> <span id="s1150">And there were -- I still have sometimes sleepless nights, because my best friends wouldn’t be helped, yeah.</span> <span id="s1151">They got killed.</span> <span id="s1152">So what can I tell you?</span> <span id="s1153">But that’s the only place where they died -- the only time they died prematurely, and they were not killed by the SS.</span> <span id="s1154">They were killed by German inmates who were in charge there, as kapos, and so on.</span> <span id="s1155">You know the story of Boody.</span> <span id="s1156">But otherwise, you show me one camp -- sub-camp, where there were selections of those I have mentioned to you.</span> <span id="s1157">Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: Did the women know when they got there, that that was the case, they su --</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: Did the -- when the women got into these -- into this -- the branch camps --</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: They understood?</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: They knew they in a good --</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: They’re in a good place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: -- they’re in a good place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: They knew, very much so.</span> <span id="s1170">They are all alive, they all survived.</span> <span id="s1171">I [indecipherable] my problems, you know the -- the Whit-Whitman girl, yeah.</span> <span id="s1172">She made a job out of her paper, and telling about the camaraderie, and the solidarity, and I don’t know what nonsense about that group of people, and they were the -- they -- they are all alive, you can ask one by one, if she ever had a friend among them.</span> <span id="s1173">They were afraid of each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: In these dif -- in these branch camps, or just in sta --</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: No, in -- no, in the Shtopskaboida, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: In the stop -- in the Shtopskaboida.</span> <span id="s1177">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1178">Did Susan work in the Shtopskaboida?</span> <span id="s1179">She did for awhile, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1181">And ask her about the camaraderie, ask her.</span> <span id="s1182">She’ll laugh into your face.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: Yeah right?</span> <span id="s1184">Tell me about the beginning of the camp office.</span> <span id="s1185">How di --</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: How do you remember the camp office starting?</span> <span id="s1188">How was -- how -- how did it happen that you had this tripartite --</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: It -- we already had an camp office in Auschwitz one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: And there were some women from Ravensbrück, who were engaged in the starting of the system, yeah, who keeps the Haupt book.</span> <span id="s1192">There was an -- in each camp they had an ha -- principle book, a big one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: That’s a howt book?</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: Haupt, yeah, was principle book that was in every camp, so they had to enter that by day and by number, by professions.</span> <span id="s1195">Whole story on one -- one big book, like that.</span> <span id="s1196">They kept that, then they had already mainly they engaged th -- the -- i-it was an very, very wishy-washy system, and when we relocated to Birkenau, there was an German woman still in charge, but in October [indecipherable] September, end of September, she was replaced, and obasarin Drexler, who --</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: Drexler, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A: Drexler.</span> <span id="s1199">No drek --</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: Drexel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: They calling her Drexler, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: So it isn’t -- I can’t figure out who it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: Drexel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: It’s Drexel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: Yeah, Drexel, no Drexler.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s1207">Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1209">As she became the rapport fuhrering, so that was an rank, in charge of the roll calls, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: Drexel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: Drexel became in charge?</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: Drexel, in charge.</span> <span id="s1214">And this charged the -- all other women, they were -- they were engaged, and got herself Katya, to become the rapport shabering.</span> <span id="s1215">That means, you had an rapport fuhrer, or fuhrering to lead that, that was always an SS woman, or an SS man, and you had the inmate who was then the one who did the job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: And I have been, during those couple of weeks in September, hospitalized, because I had typhus, and all kinds of junk in my body.</span> <span id="s1218">I was very sick.</span> <span id="s1219">And the whole block was selected, just ready to be gassed.</span> <span id="s1220">And I have been taken out as the only one from the whole selection of I don’t know how many thousand, on that particular day, and transferred to the camp office.</span> <span id="s1221">What is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: There’s the phone.</span> <span id="s1223">We’ve now returned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: We’ve now returned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: They transferred me immediately to the camp office.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: Who -- who took you out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: The Drexler, and Katya was standing there.</span> <span id="s1229">Yeah, who took me out?</span> <span id="s1230">The camp leader, because his secretary was an friend of mine, and when she saw me there on that big heap of people to be -- just to be taken on the truck, she was running to him, and asking if he would help me.</span> <span id="s1231">Because a couple of weeks before, I used to paint some numbers in his office, on the wardrobes for the individual SS men.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: But I haven’t finished, because I -- I had to -- I was transferred to the hospital, and she was an -- an --</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: Was her name Honey Yaeger?</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1236">She -- she was -- she had an yellow and purple star, because she had an Jewish lover.</span> <span id="s1237">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">A: And he was Mueller.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: Mueller.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: Yeah, and his first name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: Ha -- I think -- no, I must look him up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: He only was two months there, two months in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: And he was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: He’s a very -- very seldom that he is mentioned in any literature, but I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: And why do you think he responded to her, to hon -- to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: Because he knew me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: He knew you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">A: And she -- he took -- he asked Shtevitz, was another famous SS man, to come over, and to check if I am capable to carry on with the work.</span> <span id="s1252">And so he asked me several things to do, up and down the bed, and jumping over the -- what is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">Q: A pit?</span> <span id="s1254">A ditch?</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: Ditches, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: A ditch.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: Little he knew that I was an very sporty type, and that I was used to go up and down the ladder, yeah.</span> <span id="s1258">For me, all that, even as sick as I’ve been, was no big deal, yeah.</span> <span id="s1259">So I passed everything he wanted me to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: Even though you weren’t feeling well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: Even though you were not feeling well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: I was very sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: There comes the man who was in charge of the selection, and of the whole business then, on that day, that was that Heinrich Schwartz, another SS man, an ugly one.</span> <span id="s1266">And so when Stevitz told him that this Mueller want me to -- out, he said, okay, only if I have no fever.</span> <span id="s1267">So go to the -- they commanded me to go over to the hospital station, and there they had to measure my fever, my temperature.</span> <span id="s1268">Now, I nearly collapsed, but they told me not to worry, because even if I have fever, they won’t tell.</span> <span id="s1269">They took me int -- so they were selecting the people, the whole barracks, complete, even the blockelteste went.</span> <span id="s1270">And -- no I don’t think some of the blockelteste -- no, they -- no, they left the blockelteste behind.</span> <span id="s1271">But what happened is that -- that Schwartz wacom -- was coming every five minute.</span> <span id="s1272">Has she fever, or hasn't she?</span> <span id="s1273">He was so concerned about one person, yeah.</span> <span id="s1274">And they constantly said, she is not ready yet, not ready.</span> <span id="s1275">They were pumping in me some medication, Bydrian, I remember that, and Anna Weiss was the physician.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: Anna Weiss?</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: All -- Olly was there, Gerda Sneider, the whole hospital hierarchy, they just assured me they will not say that I have fever.</span> <span id="s1278">And finally, when -- when he returned, and everybody was already gone, so he was just waiting for me, so when they ask him -- when he asked if I have fever, they said no, okay?</span> <span id="s1279">And there was an SS man, who witnessed the whole business inside the hospital compound.</span> <span id="s1280">And he was coming then, and brought me pen, and a piece of paper, and said sit down and do some drawing, start to work.</span> <span id="s1281">So I s -- I was totally deaf, and blind, and I couldn’t remember the letters, how they looked.</span> <span id="s1282">I was tot -- look, I was out of the world, with high fever.</span> <span id="s1283">So I said, “But I don’t know how the letter looks.”</span> <span id="s1284">He said, “Do whatever you want.”</span> <span id="s1285">You know, if I would have today be able to keep that, what I draw, it would have been a wonderful analysis for some of those psychiatrists, yeah.</span> <span id="s1286">The results of my -- the condition, and the results of my whole situation, and what I did.</span> <span id="s1287">In any case, the moment all everything was gone, I had my -- yeah, and the SS man said to me, “Look, do anything you want, but just work.”</span> <span id="s1288">So okay, I did -- I don’t know what I did, but after awhile the door opens, in comes Katya, and [indecipherable] and Drexel, with an sheet of paper in the hand to transfer into the camp office.</span> <span id="s1289">And that was the beginning of my career.</span> <span id="s1290">Two months later, Mandel arrived as an oboffsairen, yeah, in charge of the whole camp, and Mandel cat -- was really -- respected me from the first day on, and made my life very tolerable.</span> <span id="s1291">Her boyfriend was in charge of the bowlightung of the camp -- building office, yeah.</span> <span id="s1292">And he established me my drawing office.</span> <span id="s1293">He supplied me with wonderful instruments, and material, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">Q: What did she see in you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: What did she see in you, do you think?</span> <span id="s1297">Why --</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: I was the one who was [indecipherable] it’s the only one, and she didn’t know why.</span> <span id="s1299">The only one from the whole thousands and thousand of people, yeah.</span> <span id="s1300">And she couldn’t -- she didn’t know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: She didn’t know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: She didn’t know why.</span> <span id="s1303">But they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: How -- how was she with other people?</span> <span id="s1305">Was she a very cruel person?</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: She was an very beautiful woman.</span> <span id="s1307">I wouldn’t say she was cruel, no.</span> <span id="s1308">But she didn’t like the prostitutes, the German prostitutes.</span> <span id="s1309">She didn’t liked -- she liked -- I don’t know what she liked.</span> <span id="s1310">I don’t know why she liked me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: But sh -- but she liked you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: I will never forget -- yeah, I helped to organize the orchestra too, during -- under her -- under her time.</span> <span id="s1313">When she noticed that I’m artist by profession, that I’m a musician, so she -- she -- and I spoke good German, and so once she called me and asked me to put an dedication in an book.</span> <span id="s1314">So th -- I noticed she made another SS man an birthday present, but normally, I don’t know what people are -- what the SS was giving each other.</span> <span id="s1315">She made him a present of books.</span> <span id="s1316">So I was starting to think, yeah, that was one quality which I never expected, yeah.</span> <span id="s1317">And asking me to put an dedication in.</span> <span id="s1318">And on that day, I noticed -- I said, but [indecipherable] that is my birthday too, yeah, on the same day.</span> <span id="s1319">So she said, “Oh, so go [indecipherable] you have an sheet of paper, go to the package room, and get yourself the biggest parcel they have.”</span> <span id="s1320">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1321">And do you know who was in charge then, already, in the package room?</span> <span id="s1322">That SS woman who --</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: Who slapped you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: Who so she started to respect me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Q: You too.</span> <span id="s1326">What was Drexel like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">A: Ugly.</span> <span id="s1328">Oy, was she ugly.</span> <span id="s1329">And she want -- she ask me -- Katya is standing there, and I was coming, and walking, and she called me back.</span> <span id="s1330">You’re short -- your dresses are too short.</span> <span id="s1331">I want to see you tomorrow with I don’t know how many inches longer, and wanted to hit me.</span> <span id="s1332">And I was running away.</span> <span id="s1333">I don’t know what happened to -- she could have shot me, yeah.</span> <span id="s1334">And Katya c-comes later on and said, “Sippy, you know she -- she complained that Sippy’s [indecipherable].”</span> <span id="s1335">She was running away from me, and I wanted to hit her.</span> <span id="s1336">So, I don’t know what Drexel was.</span> <span id="s1337">She was -- I noticed that she did selections, she participated in selections, while Mandel did not.</span> <span id="s1338">But Mandel once signed an sheet of selected paper, and because of that she was hanged.</span> <span id="s1339">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1341">[inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: Look, it was an very hard -- well, it was very hard to understand, what really went on in the mind of the -- that Mandel woman, that she had, as an partner, an h-high official, and an trained -- an engineer -- an engineer by profession, or an architect.</span> <span id="s1343">And she -- as I had mentioned to you, that was an sign of -- on bit of an higher level -- mentally higher level than all others, while giving another SS man a book as an present, yeah, for a birthday.</span> <span id="s1344">But would -- how would you have judged that?</span> <span id="s1345">That they were thinking different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: Differently.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: She was from Austria, but with her, I had good luck.</span> <span id="s1350">In -- at the end of ’44, there was an friend.</span> <span id="s1351">The Germans wanted to establish the biggest women’s concentration camp in the world, in -- not too far from Dachau, yeah, in Kaufering.</span> <span id="s1352">And we have heard about it, and Mandel should have become the biggest shot -- big shot of the biggest concentration camp on earth.</span> <span id="s1353">So sh-she selected some of the Auschwitz people which she wanted to take along with her, and nobody from the camp office, and nobody knew what’s going to happen, whom she’s going to take.</span> <span id="s1354">It would have been an advantage, because there would have been no crematorium, yeah.</span> <span id="s1355">So they prepared a list whom she selected in the camp office.</span> <span id="s1356">We had one typewriter, and one woman typed the list.</span> <span id="s1357">So I wanted to know if I am on the list, because it was, after all, an big event to leave Auschwitz, and join the staff of the biggest SS woman in the world.</span> <span id="s1358">And -- but the woman who produced the list was mean, and didn’t wanted to tell us.</span> <span id="s1359">So, what am I doing, the list was prepared, and it went to Berlin.</span> <span id="s1360">And while she was carrying the list to deliver the list, I went into the wastepaper basket, and there were some carbon paper.</span> <span id="s1361">So I’ve been on the list.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: And Katya was on the list?</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: Katya was already gone, because she had an affair with an SS man, and was -- disappeared from the earth of -- from the face of the earth.</span> <span id="s1366">Katya was stupid, because I didn’t know that she had the affair.</span> <span id="s1367">He was coming there to the office to visit, every day.</span> <span id="s1368">And I went over to Katya, and I said, “Katya, who is he?</span> <span id="s1369">Who is he?”</span> <span id="s1370">What is -- no, I did-didn’t said who is he.</span> <span id="s1371">“Katya, what is he doing here?”</span> <span id="s1372">She said, “He’s coming to visit me.”</span> <span id="s1373">Her.</span> <span id="s1374">I said, “Katya, that’s an mass murderer.”</span> <span id="s1375">She looked at me.</span> <span id="s1376">I noticed him shu -- sh -- killing the people at the black wall, from I visited while still in Auschwitz, I went from block nine to block 10.</span> <span id="s1377">There are still today the wooden -- wooden timbers, yeah.</span> <span id="s1378">But in between the timbers you could look.</span> <span id="s1379">And I have witnessed the execution of hundreds and hundreds of people, which he performed.</span> <span id="s1380">And I said to her, “Katya, that’s a mass murderer.”</span> <span id="s1381">She never said anything to me.</span> <span id="s1382">Our relationship went -- slowly cooled off, yeah, because of that.</span> <span id="s1383">And then she was arrested, put into the bunker, and was sent away, and he was sent to the front.</span> <span id="s1384">So nothing really happened between the two of -- he was killed, and she was stupid enough to risk her good life she had.</span> <span id="s1385">She had an important -- she had an important life to car -- to -- to lead in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1386">She could help, she could do a lot of things.</span> <span id="s1387">And all for an SS man who was really a mass murderer.</span> <span id="s1388">But I’m glad that I told her that in my lifetime.</span> <span id="s1389">I was honest enough to forewarn her, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q: And what happened to her in the end?</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">A: She died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: She died.</span> <span id="s1393">In Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s1394">Or she was sent away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">A: No, she -- she was sent away, but she survived.</span> <span id="s1396">We have met after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: She visited me, I visited her in ’75 in Prague, but she died of an -- of an kidney failure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: Did you talk about it after the war?</span> <span id="s1400">What she was -- what she had done?</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A: Oh, every second that I have -- I have on record -- not a record, a tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q: Tape?</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">A: I have sent Susan --</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">A: -- over to visit her, and she didn’t wanted to speak to anybody, but when I told her that I’m sending somebody and she remembers Susan a little bit.</span> <span id="s1406">So, this Susan was stupid.</span> <span id="s1407">Instead to letting her talk --</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: Susan would talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A: -- Susan was talking all the time.</span> <span id="s1410">Not -- of -- in any case, that’s the story of my -- my entrance to the camp office, and it was relatively an important job, and we could do a lot, yeah, and we were helping a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q: Who decided that the -- the drawing office would be created?</span> <span id="s1412">Who made --</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">A: Mandel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">Q: Mandel?</span> <span id="s1415">She thought of the idea?</span> <span id="s1416">Because she knew what you could do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">A: She knew what I could do, and her lover was an architect, in charge of the architectural office, of whole Auschwitz, yeah.</span> <span id="s1418">I had equipment and material, and whatever I want.</span> <span id="s1419">I had a good life in that drawing office.</span> <span id="s1420">It was an independent, no competition.</span> <span id="s1421">Nobody was giving me the order except she, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: Not even Katya, so it was you directly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">A: Katya yes, but they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">Q: Together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">A: -- knew what I’m doing, and [indecipherable], as sometimes SS women were coming with a little of work, yeah.</span> <span id="s1426">And -- but it became too much, yeah.</span> <span id="s1427">I tried to s -- to satisfy everybody, but then it became too much, and I complained to Mandel, said, “I don’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s1428">Everybody’s coming, and wants some little work, and I cannot fulfill, I cannot do everything.”</span> <span id="s1429">She said, “Okay,” said, “if anybody comes in future, just tell her or him to see me first.”</span> <span id="s1430">That was the end, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Q: Tell me --</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">A: I could talk to her, that was funny, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">A: And she was the one, when she was arrested, she was Catholic, one of the Polish woman -- and I’ll show you on some photograph.</span> <span id="s1435">She is in that book too, “Fighting Auschwitz.”</span> <span id="s1436">One of that woman was arrested after the war by the Polish Communists, and sentenced to death because of her anti-government feeling.</span> <span id="s1437">And they put her together with Mandel in one cell.</span> <span id="s1438">So, they had enough time to exchange their views and so on.</span> <span id="s1439">And then Mandel one day ask her -- even what’s his name, Lankban describes the whole affair in his book, too.</span> <span id="s1440">One day, Mandel ask her if she would forgive her.</span> <span id="s1441">So both were Catholics.</span> <span id="s1442">She said, “Look, why are you asking me?</span> <span id="s1443">I forgive you, but He upstairs, it’s up to Him.”</span> <span id="s1444">So that was authentic, and she told me the story, too.</span> <span id="s1445">Rachwalova was her name.</span> <span id="s1446">Mandel ask her to forgive her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q: What was the woman’s name?</span> <span id="s1448">Raquel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A: Rachwalova.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">Q: Rach?</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">A: Rachwalova.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: Rachwalova.</span> <span id="s1453">That’s her last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A: R-a-c-h-w-a-l-o-v-a.</span> <span id="s1455">I forgot her f-f -- her first name, my God.</span> <span id="s1456">I have a photo here with her, we have met after the war.</span> <span id="s1457">And it’s in fighting for -- “Fighting Auschwitz.”</span> <span id="s1458">She’s in the literature at Forenzia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">Q: Katya --</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: How do you spell Katya’s last name, with a Z, or an S?</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: Was S.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Q: An S.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">A: S-i-n-g-r.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">Q: And her maiden name was Petronka?</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">Q: What was her maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">A: Singr.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: That was her maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1472">I think I’m going to stop the tape now, because there’s so little time left on this one.</span> <span id="s1473">So this is the end of tape number two, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">End of Tape Two, Side

id="s1486">Q: -- interview with Helen Tichauer, on September seventh, 2000, in New York City, conducted by Joan Ringleheim.</span> <span id="s1487">We were talking about the beginnings of the w -- the camp office.</span> <span id="s1488">The camp office actually was in some way in existence in Auschwitz one, and it moves to Birkenau, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: Is Katya working on it in Auschwitz one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: Katya was there on blockelteste.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: Of block nine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1497">So she only becomes involved with the camp office --</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">A: In -- in -- after October -- e-end of September.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">Q: Okay, and you come in and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">A: ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">A: I come out of the selection.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">A: I’m helping to establish the -- the camp office --</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">A: -- by designing the card -- cardex for different purposes.</span> <span id="s1507">We had an cardex system for the living, an cardex system for the dead, an cardex system for the -- for the work details.</span> <span id="s1508">Then there were many functions in that -- in the camp office, like again, the principle bookkeeping.</span> <span id="s1509">People were engaged by collecting daily dartas of nationalities so that they could supply me for my diagram, and for the statistics which I had to -- of whi-- of which I have been engaged on an daily basis.</span> <span id="s1510">There were many functions and many employees in that office, but I could start -- I mean, we had to -- I established the individual barrack books which each blockelteste -- I think Mrs. -- what’s her name?</span> <span id="s1511">S -- Sheila Romiano [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1512">Well, you interviewed Palarchik.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">A: She made an enormous mistake when she said they were keeping a book for nationalities, a book for professionals, a book for -- by number, and a book by names.</span> <span id="s1515">Now, as I have been in charge of putting the columns, and making the columns in those books, because they were blank sheets in the book, I don’t remember ever to have supplied four books to each barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">Q: Each barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">Q: You had one book?</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">A: It was one book, where we had the columns, yeah.</span> <span id="s1520">Now -- and because of that, I engage sometimes, people to help, and to draw those columns, and to mark the different columns.</span> <span id="s1521">Peop -- mainly people who were discharged from hospital and needed time to recuperate, and then time to be transferred to a m -- kind of an good job.</span> <span id="s1522">So that -- there were so many people who went through that drawing office, just in the stage of recup -- of re -- to recuperate, yeah.</span> <span id="s1523">So it was quite -- very satisfying.</span> <span id="s1524">Among others, what’s her name, Susan was working there with us, too, while she was just out of hospital.</span> <span id="s1525">That how we met, actually, in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1526">Okay?</span> <span id="s1527">Now you know, Susan Chernakshpatz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1529">But -- but she didn’t write very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Q: She did -- her handwriting was terrible, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">A: Horrible.</span> <span id="s1533">To -- her handwriting is now the one of an real old person.</span> <span id="s1534">Have any of you noticed that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: No, I said her handwriting then, I thought, was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">A: She was just drawing lines.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1541">No, I wouldn’t let -- no, who learned very nicely, and who did quite an good job, was Magba Helinger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">Q: So if I would ask -- what you’ve explained to me is that Mandel is the top.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">A: Ah, you mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">Q: Drexel is next.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">A: Ah, you want to have an -- an o-organizational chart?</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">Q: I have one, but I don’t know that it holds everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A: But Mandel, and -- you see it’s -- those jobs have changed, and sometimes people were on the same level.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">A: Well anyhow, what would you like to know?</span> <span id="s1552">You have on top, in the camp, always the oberhafsierens.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">A: The top -- top SS person, where they had positions and rank, so you must always use both.</span> <span id="s1555">With SS man is the same.</span> <span id="s1556">If somebody was an -- an rapport fuhrer, that was his position, but his rank was an military one, yeah.</span> <span id="s1557">So that is always to be taken in account, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q: So what was Mandel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A: His rank.</span> <span id="s1560">The military rank.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Q: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1562">What is -- what was Mandel’s position and rank?</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">A: She was no soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A: She was ober -- amongst the women, the personnel, there were only -- they only had one title.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Q: They only had a position.</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">A: She was oberhavsiehiden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">Q: Right, okay.</span> <span id="s1569">And Drexel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">A: Once -- she was, among others, oberhafsieren too, but before that, she was rapport fuhrering.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">Q: And what is her relationship, organizationally, to Mandel?</span> <span id="s1572">Is she under Mandel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">A: There was a time when they were on the same level, yeah.</span> <span id="s1574">There were times when they were on the same level.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: By the way, did you know the woman who was there before Mandel?</span> <span id="s1576">A lat -- Lang?</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">A: What?</span> <span id="s1578">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">Q: There was a woman who was in that position before Mandel came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">A: Yeah, but she was before -- she -- she was Langerfelt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1583">Actually died in between.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: She died?</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1586">She was a good woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">Q: She was?</span> <span id="s1588">Cause you know, in that Auschwitz book that the museum publi --</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">Q: That the museum published.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: Yeah, you do know.</span> <span id="s1593">The one that -- that was published -- you know, the book that -- that was the edited book about Auschwitz that came out a few years ago.</span> <span id="s1594">There’s a -- there’s a couple of articles about the women’s camp, and they describe her as being particularly brutal and disorganized, and the SS sent her away.</span> <span id="s1595">That’s not so?</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">A: Who described her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">Q: I’ll show you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">A: Yeah, but who described her, any specific person?</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">Q: No, the article does.</span> <span id="s1600">I don’t know where they got the information from.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">A: No, she was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1603">So underneath the oberhafsieren --</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">A: But it depends on -- wait a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">Q: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">A: You see, you must realize that there were times that that -- the picture has changed constantly, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1608">I’m not sugge --</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">A: Picture has changed, and I’d -- could -- while Mandel was oberhafsieren be-between then and then, yeah, you must realize that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: -- you have to bring those people how -- how the camp has developed, and that you will find -- I would not make now, or waste my time or yours, but they are working in Auschwitz now with a researching the development of the women’s camp, and they will have the datas much -- very well defined, very soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: Oh good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">A: Then we can use that.</span> <span id="s1614">Then we’ll be able to use that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">A: Partially, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">A: Ah, the ranutachek is not very reliable, because she can only report on things which are f --</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Q: Were reported to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">A: What -- reported to her, or what people have -- testimonies, and testimonies are sometimes so bad, I -- I’m have certain testimonies from Auschwitz that I would never use, yeah.</span> <span id="s1621">Brrr, what else?</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q: Alright, but let me ask you this.</span> <span id="s1623">The camp office that -- if there are three off -- at one point there are three off -- there’s the camp office, there’s the work detail [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">A: Al-All in -- all in one -- in one -- we had one barrack, and that was block four.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1626">I understand that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">A: B -- B2 -- B1B in block four.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">A: Most of the time.</span> <span id="s1630">In the beginning, in Birkenau, it was in the -- in B1A.</span> <span id="s1631">B1A on barrack I think 12, I have to check that, because from there I have been hospitalized, and there I had typhus, and there I lost my mind.</span> <span id="s1632">But the real camp office, in function, was after our relocation from B1A to B1B, and established in the -- in block four, where half of the block wa -- the camp wa -- were offices, and the other half were quarters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q: Quarters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Q: Quarters, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">A: And in the front, where all the offices were, all the offices, the work detail office, and the ca-camp office, and the drawing office.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">Q: Work service?</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q: And where was the work service office?</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">Q: The work service office?</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">A: W-Work detail -- work detail office, not work --</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">Q: Well wait a minute, but when you spoke to me before --</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">A: Ah yeah, [indecipherable] no, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">Q: But you distinguished between arbide zychen, and arbides deenst.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">A: Deenst yeah, but the arbides deenst had only one -- one f-female employee, and she had her office outside where the SS blockfuhresterwer was.</span> <span id="s1647">No, they -- they were combined.</span> <span id="s1648">The block -- it was the arbides einsatz who had many, many employees, and who had an cardex system.</span> <span id="s1649">The arbides deenst had only one thing to do to make available the -- the amount of people, but the -- to make available the people --</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">Q: Was the ar -- was the work service.</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">A: -- by -- by demand of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: -- qualifications, were the work detail office.</span> <span id="s1654">They had to collect constantly the people from different barracks, because they knew where they are, we had the cardex system established.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">Q: Now wait a minute.</span> <span id="s1656">Now, I’m confused.</span> <span id="s1657">What is arbides deenst mean?</span> <span id="s1658">Is that the works detail?</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">A: The service -- service.</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">Q: That’s service?</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">A: They made available the amount by asking the work detail office t-to get the people, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">Q: And so the work detail is arbides zychen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">A: Arbides einsatz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">Q: Arbide -- so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">A: And the arbides deenst, I would not even mention, because that was not a function, it was only one person who had many, many things -- was numerous and coordinator between the employer and the employee.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">Q: No, you got -- you got to go back, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">A: Oy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">Q: -- you -- you keep change -- either you keep changing the words, or I’m not hearing it right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">A: Look, it’s -- with ma -- me it’s hard, because you v -- I -- to translate from German into English, it doesn’t make sometimes sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">Q: I understand, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">Q: -- from a long time ago --</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">Q: -- you called the work detail --</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">A: Arbides einsatz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q: Didn’t.</span> <span id="s1679">You didn’t do it then.</span> <span id="s1680">You’re saying now it’s ar -- it’s arbide --</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">A: Einsatz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">Q: Einsatz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">Q: And that’s only one person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">Q: See, that -- this is where it’s confusing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">Q: Because what you originally told me --</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">Q: -- was that the work detail was where the cardex of all the skills.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">Q: So that’s work detail.</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">A: Work detail.</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">Q: But the work service was where they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">A: One person.</span> <span id="s1696">And actually, the li -- liaison between employer, and -- and employees.</span> <span id="s1697">That means the companies or individuals who requested the service, went through the one person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">Q: That person in the work service.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">A: Work service, they say --</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">Q: So they would say I need 50 road workers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">A: So the work service went to the arbides einsatz, and said select al -- your specialists of your people who can do or perform the job, yeah.</span> <span id="s1702">Because she had no -- you see, the work service had the request for 50 people who can do road work, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">A: She went to the work detail office.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">Q: To say who can do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">A: And ask, get me 50 people.</span> <span id="s1707">The work detail office went to the individual barracks, because they had in their cardex the road workers, good road workers.</span> <span id="s1708">Where are they?</span> <span id="s1709">They’re there, in there.</span> <span id="s1710">And had contact -- made contact with the blockelteste, and ask them to send so and so, and so and so, and so and so next morning, until they had the 50 together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">A: But the work service did other things, too, which is not really defined.</span> <span id="s1713">She made all kinds of jobs, she made all kinds of other things, yeah.</span> <span id="s1714">After all, you had to do a job for -- for hundred and thousand of inmates to -- to administer on every possible level, like food and -- and clothing, and -- and in -- it was -- it’s co -- a complicated business --</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">Q: Well, it’s -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">A: -- but if it comes -- now, let’s forget about the logistic, let’s do the work of -- of how to supply the work force to the employers, yeah, who are requested.</span> <span id="s1717">[indecipherable] requested.</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">Q: All right, so they request 10 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">A: They request.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">Q: They go to the work service and say, “I need 10 people.”</span> <span id="s1721">The work --</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">A: Ah, no, it could have happened that they went to the work -- they went to the head -- work service got the order, yeah, 10 people tomorrow morning, in from dobseldor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">A: She made sure that the right people were selected out of the cardex, and out of the availability of surplus.</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">Q: So, it would move -- the request goes to the work service.</span> <span id="s1726">She made -- I’m just talking about this one piece of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">Q: Okay?</span> <span id="s1729">She will then go to the work detail where the cardex exists.</span> <span id="s1730">Let’s say they need 10 tailors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">Q: They need something very specific.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">A: Correct, correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">Q: So they will look through the cardex --</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">Q: -- find 10, say here are the names, or do they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">Q: -- they say we will --</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">A: No, she -- she will go and ask for 10 tailors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">A: When do you need them?</span> <span id="s1742">Tomorrow morning.</span> <span id="s1743">They went to the different barracks --</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">A: -- selected -- got the 10 tailors, according to their cardex and names and numbers, and have asked the blockelteste to bring those 10 tailors tomorrow morning in front of the camp office, or wherever [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1747">Now, would the people in the work detail --</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">A: Wait a minute, then --</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">Q: Oh okay, all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">A: -- the 10 people, marching out the door to their destiny, which they received by the work service person, yeah.</span> <span id="s1751">The work detail did only the administrative job.</span> <span id="s1752">The work service physically delivered the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1754">And there was a specific place that the was -- that these 10 people were told to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1756">And [indecipherable] door, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">Q: [indecipherable] and wait there until the person from the work service came and said, this is your -- this is where you’re going.</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">A: Correct.</span> <span id="s1759">Because she requested it, and she got it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">Q: Right, okay.</span> <span id="s1761">Now, when the work detail looks in the cards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">Q: Do they have to go through Katya before they go to the head of the -- to the blockelteste or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">A: Of course, they had to go through our cardex, and either to transfer the people to other barracks, to other places, to other sub-camps, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">Q: Right, because you have to be able to -- to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">A: They had to be delivered to the -- to the -- they had to be made available to the people who re-requested the services, yeah.</span> <span id="s1767">Now, that could have been on transfer to another camp, or just to be available every morning, through the blockelteste, make her responsible that those people will be ready every morning, until they are going to can -- be cancelled, or until they die.</span> <span id="s1768">And that was one of the responsibilities of some blockelteste too, that if they had to be -- if they were selected for an particular job, an -- or an -- a steady job, to be there, yeah.</span> <span id="s1769">Once they have been told to supply those 10 people every day, they had to stick to the request.</span> <span id="s1770">There was a b -- v -- from the moment a blockelteste was involved with Katya, our office was involved, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">Q: [inaudible] Hm.</span> <span id="s1772">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">A: It’s very hard to -- it was -- those situations have changed constantly.</span> <span id="s1774">But the -- it is true that -- but if you were an real professional, and there were certain work details -- constant work details, that -- that the -- that was an routine -- it became routine, yeah.</span> <span id="s1775">Of certain work details had an certain number, yeah.</span> <span id="s1776">So they were registered as a work detail under that -- in that number.</span> <span id="s1777">10 people, and sometimes only eight could come, because two were sick, so she had to engage again two more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">Q: Two more, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">A: Through the same process, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">A: Look, it was not simple.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1783">No, I understand that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1785">It was not simple, and each -- really, it’s hard to believe that in an group of so many people with different situations, and different backgrounds, that we had manage -- that we have managed to bring law and order into the place.</span> <span id="s1786">And there were times then, that we have managed to -- to supply everybody with his ration.</span> <span id="s1787">Those times were gone that we were coming home from an outdoor work and the blockelteste told you, “We have no more food for you.”</span> <span id="s1788">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1789">That never occurred under Katya.</span> <span id="s1790">Rations were supplied, we had -- or they arranged special rations.</span> <span id="s1791">Katya really made what she could in the time of counting the work -- the -- time of counting the -- during the roll call time was cut down to an s -- minimum amount of time, yeah, and that meant more relaxation, more sleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">Q: I was going to get into this, but go ahead.</span> <span id="s1793">Go ah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">Q: -- go, continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">A: Yeah, that is all what I’m trying to say, that it was not so simple how people think, and to manage an -- and t-to manage the food distribution, the clothing distribution, the bedding, you name it, all s -- s -- clothing ides, including shoes.</span> <span id="s1797">That is -- was not -- was -- became always, during those years or th-those months, improved, improved enormously, yeah.</span> <span id="s1798">Then we had enormous [indecipherable] blacks of Hungarian Jews in the four -- middle of ’44, and so on.</span> <span id="s1799">That was an big problem, yeah, but as they were sep -- as those newcomers there, there was a lot of movement.</span> <span id="s1800">Newcomers were coming, and old-comers were sent on transport, because they were requested in factories in Germany.</span> <span id="s1801">A lot of people had been requested, but also a lot of movement, and we had to account for each person, and the roll calls again became more complicated, but the system improved by sticking to it well, and -- and selecting more intelligent blockelteste, and block administrators, so it was always the tendency of improvement, and of [indecipherable] re -- raising the standard of living [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">Q: In spite of -- in spite of the fact that you’re in a situation that is meant for people to die?</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1804">We had to carry on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">A: And we did not believe for one moment to give up, yeah.</span> <span id="s1807">Never.</span> <span id="s1808">That was an ama -- that I have learned to survive.</span> <span id="s1809">Even now, I can be half dead, and if I have a -- an job to do, I’m doing it.</span> <span id="s1810">But we -- we were carrying on, not knowing if you are going to live tomorrow, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">Q: Sippy, can you list the functions that the works -- th -- I understand that work detail only took down the cardex of information.</span> <span id="s1812">But the work service seems to be more complicated, and the camp office has many more different functions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">Q: The camp office seemed to -- is the largest --</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">Q: -- and the much more com --</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">Q: -- complex of all three, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">A: We had to di -- we had to control the punishment detail.</span> <span id="s1820">We had to control the supply of not only -- it was not enough to ask for people, and to supply the people for work, but it was an question of, as I said, food rations, clothing, bedding, hygiene, cleaning of the barracks, cleaning of each bed, a -- delousing, de -- and we had to -- we had to work very closely with the work detail people.</span> <span id="s1821">The work service had very little to do with the rest of those functions.</span> <span id="s1822">They only have supplied upon the request, those people they have -- that was an request for people, and they had to supply, and nobody could care less how we did it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">A: Or how they did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1826">Is Canada, the hospital sauna, also under the camp office?</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">A: Canada is an work detail, had -- the camp office -- not the camp office.</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">Q: Not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">A: Or the work detail office, had any influence on any -- on any work detail.</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">Q: So Canada had nothing to do with the camp office?</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">A: Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s1832">Canada was one of many.</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">A: Are you talking about the Canada camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">A: Camp, or the work detail?</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">Q: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1838">No, the work detail.</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">A: Work detail.</span> <span id="s1840">One work detail m-more or less.</span> <span id="s1841">Why Canada?</span> <span id="s1842">Why have you selected Canada?</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">Q: No, no, no, I’m just asking, are there --</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">A: Th -- nothing special, they were just another work detail.</span> <span id="s1845">They had their -- now, in those different work details, you had an structure.</span> <span id="s1846">You had the oberkapo, under -- underkapo, for-foremen, and all kinds of functions.</span> <span id="s1847">So Canada was just one of a work -- but just one among many work details.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">Q: All right, so, but then, what I’m trying -- what I’m trying to do is figure out what -- what is the function of the camp office?</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">Q: It’s to oversee all of the work -- no.</span> <span id="s1851">You explain it, I’m not there, you’re ex -- you explain it to me.</span> <span id="s1852">If you have to say to someone who doesn’t know anything, what is the camp office supposed to be doing?</span> <span id="s1853">They have a number of different functions, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">A: Now, can you imagine that you have s -- hundreds of barracks, correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">A: You have, first of all, the camp office had to administer all sub-camps, and branch camps, yeah.</span> <span id="s1857">We’re that start.</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">Q: All sub-camps and branch camps, okay.</span> <span id="s1859">Let’s -- let’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">A: So ther --</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">Q: -- let me -- let me turn the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">Q: This is tape number three, side -- tape number three, side B, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Helen Tichauer on September seventh, 2000.</span> <span id="s1865">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">A: Now, let’s start with the main procedure.</span> <span id="s1867">The very most important function in all concentration camps, were the daily roll call.</span> <span id="s1868">Once or twice.</span> <span id="s1869">Now, to have individual branch camps, individual sub-camps, or what -- service camps, or whatever I am calling that, had to be roll called every day, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">A: To do that, you had to report every day, once or twice, and every day once or twice, hours and hours were spent on the roll call.</span> <span id="s1872">Now, if the come -- if the people were, during the roll call time, in the camp, or working outdoors, or working outside, it made no difference.</span> <span id="s1873">The amount of the people had to coincide with the estimated amount which was set every day.</span> <span id="s1874">We had -- that was an very complicated and important, quote unquote, thing.</span> <span id="s1875">Only [indecipherable] to be busy, or to be engaged was already a -- a -- a big job, the roll call.</span> <span id="s1876">Hours and hours [indecipherable] you had to prepare the food intake and distribution, which -- I mean, the distribution was done by the individual blockelteste, but you had to order it, you had to request it, every day.</span> <span id="s1877">How could you do that?</span> <span id="s1878">According to the roll call.</span> <span id="s1879">The roll call -- you had -- for the roll call incoming transports, outgoing transports, transfers from hospital, to the -- to the camp, from the camp to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1880">The dying, the corpse, the gassing.</span> <span id="s1881">It was an constant report on check control and check control, yeah.</span> <span id="s1882">You had only the relationship between the hospital compound, and the releases, and the requests for transfers from the camp to the hospital, from the hospital to the camp.</span> <span id="s1883">There were functions which involved with the cardex system.</span> <span id="s1884">People were dying, out of the living cardex, into the dead cardex.</span> <span id="s1885">There were reports to be written daily, on certain thing which they requested by headquarters.</span> <span id="s1886">I had -- I myself had an lot of work to do, which I cannot explain right now.</span> <span id="s1887">You had the interaction between the work detail office, and the camp office, due to those movements, they are already an full time job, yeah.</span> <span id="s1888">And it had to be exact, and n -- we couldn’t -- you could not afford to have one person mislaid or misplaced, yeah.</span> <span id="s1889">So that was an very, very ups -- painstaking, or how do you call that?</span> <span id="s1890">Painstaking?</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">A: Event, and we were always concerned about one thing.</span> <span id="s1893">God forbid some -- the figures don’t coincide.</span> <span id="s1894">That means the whole night to stand until the figures -- until the -- the figures are right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">A: So that was not our fault, it -- the SS, the idiotic system, to build the whole, everything on that roll call business was taking -- was keeping us busy for hours and hours and hours, daily.</span> <span id="s1897">What can I tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">Q: Why do you th -- why do you think so many survivors, who were in Auschwitz --</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">Q: -- do not remember, or do not know that there was a difference between roll calls at one time or another.</span> <span id="s1901">All of them seem to talk about long roll calls.</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">A: Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s1903">I don’t understand your question.</span> <span id="s1904">Why do I se --</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">Q: Most -- most -- most aus -- Auschwitz survivors --</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">Q: -- who were ordinary prisoners, when they talk about roll call, they never talk about short roll calls.</span> <span id="s1908">They only talk about long roll calls.</span> <span id="s1909">Why do you -- why do you think that that’s so, when what you have is a very clear memory that the roll calls got shorter as time went on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">Q: Not longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">A: Because we improved that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">Q: But why do you think -- do -- do you think that they’re --</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">A: Because they have no memory, and they cannot distinguish the time -- span of time.</span> <span id="s1915">But we had our -- our stopwatch, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">A: And we were counting [indecipherable] working with a stopwatch, to -- to eliminate, and to improve the roll call.</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">Q: Can you explain how you improved it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">Q: I know you’ve explained it to me before, but do it again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">A: By being more efficient, by -- by preparing the roll calls in an -- with an special system of -- of pre -- pre-roll call -- pre-roll call report.</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">A: You -- we knew at evening, preparing the whole business that in the morning, barrack so and so, after the transfers were made from the barrack to the hospital compound, and from the barrack to an transport waiting at the railway station, and from that barrack on transfer to I don’t know where, and the same barrack receiving so and so many from the hospital, and receiving so and so many newcomers, must be 24, yeah?</span> <span id="s1924">And in the morning, those 24 report -- were reported by preparing that the whole evening, yeah.</span> <span id="s1925">So we have, before the roll call in the morning, every -- it was an system we established, every block administrator reported an hour earlier, we will have 24 people on our barrack, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">A: So when the roll call people were coming to count, they knew there must be 24.</span> <span id="s1928">They were not counting how many were there, but there had to be 24.</span> <span id="s1929">That -- we have called that an forappelle.</span> <span id="s1930">[indecipherable] the appelle, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">Q: So they were simply verifying what the report said.</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1933">Q: They were verifying what the report said.</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">A: What report?</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">Q: The -- the pre-report.</span> <span id="s1936">The pre --</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">A: The pre-report, they were very find what the pre-report said.</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">Q: What -- as opposed to just counting?</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">A: And there was nobody missing.</span> <span id="s1940">Couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">A: So that already had eliminated the unnecessary forward and backwards, and shifting and running, and -- and guessing, yeah.</span> <span id="s1943">We had everything prepared every evening.</span> <span id="s1944">It was an full time job of an whole staff.</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">A: Including the -- the -- it’s so people don’t have the slightest idea what went on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">Q: Bef-Before you would do these reports --</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1949">Q: -- what were they count -- I mean, i-if they didn’t -- it’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">A: Th-They didn’t know what they are doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">Q: If they didn’t know -- they di -- they didn’t know what they were doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">Q: So how -- what were they counting for?</span> <span id="s1954">They were simply counting, and -- but they didn’t know what they were getting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">A: Correct.</span> <span id="s1956">And if that was Katya who introduced all the whole system, we once went on with an stopwatch, and discovered that the highlights of one counting, took only three minutes.</span> <span id="s1957">You know how many lives they save?</span> <span id="s1958">How many people could relax instead to suffer in the snow, in the heat?</span> <span id="s1959">Now whatever the survivors are telling you, they have no idea.</span> <span id="s1960">I’m telling you, they have no idea, our researchers have no idea.</span> <span id="s1961">As I said, Yergen never entered an German concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1962">Is he an expert now on concentration camp?</span> <span id="s1963">Had -- what’s her name, of the woman Nerhamatek writes books now on concentration camp, has no ideas what’s an concentration camp is.</span> <span id="s1964">So you cannot always rely on the which -- on -- on the so-called experts, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">A: You have to go deeper, and ask them to -- to look in -- to do what you are doing right now.</span> <span id="s1967">It’s not easy to work with you.</span> <span id="s1968">It’s not easy to answer your questions, don’t you think so?</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">Q: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">Q: Only you can judge that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">A: But I don’t know if -- if you understand what I am saying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">Q: No, I think I do understand what you are saying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">A: Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">Q: And the effect on the SS, they were -- they were glad not to be outside either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">A: They were glad to go home, to be able to go home, yeah.</span> <span id="s1977">There was less beating, and less -- less -- less of everything, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">Q: Now, I remember when we were discussing this when Irwin was alive.</span> <span id="s1979">And he described the men’s camp as creating chaos.</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">A: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">Q: And the women’s camp as creating organization, and that it was a very different way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">A: Okay, but it was not always, yeah?</span> <span id="s1983">They couldn’t afford to do that always, because eventually they got tired of it, yeah.</span> <span id="s1984">And the people [indecipherable] they created that was just for awhile, while they were newcomers, and they were new -- numerologists, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">A: And I don’t know what.</span> <span id="s1987">But that was not an constant habit.</span> <span id="s1988">They couldn’t afford to do that all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">Q: All the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">Q: But that was something that they wanted to do, and that was not what the women wanted to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">A: Ha -- the women, they were [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1993">The women were just happy to go to bed, to go to sleep.</span> <span id="s1994">That was never on our mind to -- to make things complicated during that time.</span> <span id="s1995">You don’t know how hard it was for us.</span> <span id="s1996">We were still -- no.</span> <span id="s1997">Why the man did it, they were -- man is a religious man.</span> <span id="s1998">They were crazy, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">A: They were not allowed to count.</span> <span id="s2001">You know Jews --</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">A: -- are not allowed to be counted --</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">A: -- and things like that.</span> <span id="s2006">It was not an very heroic act whats is com -- what they committed there.</span> <span id="s2007">But after awhile that disappeared, that disappeared.</span> <span id="s2008">We had all kinds of situations.</span> <span id="s2009">In the beginning, everybody wanted to together with her sisters, her mother with her, cousins.</span> <span id="s2010">But then they have learned that -- that the appelle is not an social gathering, yeah.</span> <span id="s2011">Have learned it very quickly.</span> <span id="s2012">Anything else, please?</span> <span id="s2013">Carry on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">Q: You once said to me that the SS did not have any control over the camp office.</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">Q: It didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">Q: You guys ruled the roost, you created the rules?</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">Q: You guys created the rules?</span> <span id="s2023">How -- how could it be that they didn’t have control over you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">A: Because they had nobody who understood.</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">Q: What you were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">Q: So you created this -- not even Mandel understood?</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2029">Q: Not -- Mandel didn’t understand what you were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">A: Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s2031">Q: And when --</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">A: She just wanted results, yeah.</span> <span id="s2033">They couldn’t care less what we are doing, as long as they got what they needed.</span> <span id="s2034">So results, as long as Mandel had from me, at the end of each month, a beautiful made diagram with 18 or 20 different curves, which went to -- over to -- to Berlin, she couldn’t care less when I did that, how I did that, why I did it.</span> <span id="s2035">She once caught me in the middle of the after -- of an afternoon in bed, while making an surprise visit to the barrack, and I was in bed, yeah.</span> <span id="s2036">But I was known -- “Wh-why are you here?”</span> <span id="s2037">I said, “I have cramps.”</span> <span id="s2038">So she said, “Carry on, sleep, and get better.”</span> <span id="s2039">Yeah.</span> <span id="s2040">But she knew very well that I did my job, and I [indecipherable] what -- what I’m -- what they wanted from me.</span> <span id="s2041">And they have known me very well that I have worked during the night all the time, yeah.</span> <span id="s2042">Because I wanted to have the day for myself, to visit and so on, yeah, all the running around so that -- that what’s his name, Garovitch called me, I was a runner, he thought I was a runner, okay?</span> <span id="s2043">You remember--</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2045">A: -- on the tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">Q: But you didn’t sleep s -- you didn’t sleep very much, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">Q: How many hours did you get, you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s2051">A: I slept sometimes during the day.</span> <span id="s2052">I engaged sometimes an -- the guard, which watched the door, and I said I’m going to sleep, call me if somebody is in the vicinity, so I could sleep nearly every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">Q: So did you get four hours, five hours?</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">A: I mi -- more.</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">Q: More?</span></p> <p><span id="s2056">A: I -- I had my -- I slept, but I worked at night, and nobody knew when I slept, but as I said, they watched out for me, I -- I had the -- I slept that -- during the day a little bit, and then I was running a little bit.</span> <span id="s2057">At night I was working, so nobody disturbed, yeah.</span> <span id="s2058">And sometimes the SS was coming in at -- to those who were in charge, at night, cause there was lights in the barrack.</span> <span id="s2059">So they just got -- got used to it that I’m working at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">Q: And what did you do during the day when you were running around, you were seeing people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">A: Visiting my friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">Q: How could you be the -- weren’t the people on work details?</span> <span id="s2063">Weren’t there do --</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">A: Yeah, but those who were some blockelteste, some block administrators, nice people, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">Q: So what did you talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">Q: What did you talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">A: Everything.</span> <span id="s2069">Just like anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">Q: What do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">A: We were talking about anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">Q: Did you talk about what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">A: Yeah, and got reports from newcomers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">Q: About the war, and where --</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">A: What they were telling us, and w-we were just talking about it, and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s2076">Then they had news from their boyfriends, and also outside world, and all kinds of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">Q: Did you feel you were in sort of an Alice in Wonderland world, that it was really --</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">Q: -- it sounds very strange, Sippy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">Q: All of it sounds very strange, because it’s a very -- it’s -- it’s a fascinating combination of the completely macabre and awful, and the ordinary.</span> <span id="s2082">Do you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s2083">I mean sor -- a sort of ordinary life is happening in the midst of the most extraordinarily --</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">A: Yeah, but you must realize I have -- I myself had -- was -- had an creative job, yeah.</span> <span id="s2085">I was very creative.</span> <span id="s2086">On the other hand, I was building even one model of the camp, I told you that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">A: And then [indecipherable] creativity was therapeutic, I worked in the orchestra, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">A: So that was my -- my luck, that I could be -- that I could disengage myself from -- from the he -- from hell, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">Q: But part of your work you couldn’t possibly disengage yourself from the hell, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">A: Yeah, but for -- sometimes from -- for hours, it was good enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">A: Then you were back again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2095">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2096">And you never got depressed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">Q: Never?</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">A: No.</span> <span id="s2100">Just like now, I’m not getting depressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">Q: Did you get angry?</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">A: No.</span> <span id="s2103">No, I -- I -- I have a --</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">Q: Did you not have feelings?</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">A: Listen, I have an heart, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">Q: I know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">A: -- I had to protect my heart.</span> <span id="s2108">If I have the feeling of in an state of beginning to be angry, I -- I’ve had to stop myself, and to tell myself, don’t get angry, don’t get excited, save your heart.</span> <span id="s2109">I want to live, I -- you see, I -- if I would get excited and angry o-over everything, I could have -- I could have a heart attack, and I want to avoid that.</span> <span id="s2110">I was not -- never angry.</span> <span id="s2111">I’m avoiding anger, I’m avoiding fights.</span> <span id="s2112">I -- do you know -- do you know anybody with whom I am fighting?</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">A: That’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">Q: And you were -- and you were like this when you were in your 20’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">Q: You were like this when you were in your 20’s, in Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s2118">You did the same thing, you backed off of -- so you tried to maintain a level emotional field, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">Q: Did you cry?</span> <span id="s2121">No.</span> <span id="s2122">It’s rather amazing, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">A: What can I tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">Q: Does that surprise you when you think about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">A: No.</span> <span id="s2128">I th -- I am grateful that I am able to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">Q: You think it helped you survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s2130">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s2131">Q: You think it helped you survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s2132">A: It helps me to survive now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">Q: Now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2135">If I would -- if I would be angry over everything what is going on, yeah, I could -- I couldn’t -- I could -- could not live.</span> <span id="s2136">There were -- that Ben Mead, for example, just to watch what he is doing, and what he did all those years, and what really nobody hears, yeah.</span> <span id="s2137">And is on top of everything, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2138">Q: But that does make you angry in some ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">A: It makes me angry because I have approached him so many times.</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">A: That I would like to be engaged in something, yeah.</span> <span id="s2142">That makes me angry.</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2144">But you hold -- you hold back the anger.</span></p> <p><span id="s2145">A: I hold back the anger.</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">Q: See now?</span></p> <p><span id="s2147">A: And then I see Madonja.</span> <span id="s2148">The moment I start to hold back the anger, I see Madonja, think about something else.</span> <span id="s2149">Yeah, what are we going to do now?</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">Q: Want to take a break?</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">A: What’s the time now, three?</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">Q: The time is 25 of four.</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">A: Yeah, I don’t need a break, I can carry on.</span> <span id="s2154">You --</span></p> <p><span id="s2155">Q: Do you want some more water?</span></p> <p><span id="s2156">A: Not -- no, I had enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s2157">Q: Well, let me ask you a few more questions --</span></p> <p><span id="s2158">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2159">Q: -- and then I think I may need to take a break.</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">A: Are you tired?</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">Q: Not so much, not so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">A: Look, am I making you tired?</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">Q: No, no, no, you don’t make me tired.</span> <span id="s2164">You don’t make me tired.</span></p> <p><span id="s2165">A: Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">Q: Sippy, you sa -- you -- you mentioned the fact that one day when Mandel walked in, you were taking a nap, and you told her you had cramps.</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">Q: So that meant you were menstruating?</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">Q: That meant you were getting your period?</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">A: I had -- I had menst -- menstrual pains.</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">Q: Menstrual pa -- did you get your period?</span> <span id="s2173">You did.</span> <span id="s2174">But not for the first 14 months?</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">A: 14 months.</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">Q: So how do you -- to what do you attribute the change?</span> <span id="s2177">Do you have any idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2179">I started to eat differently, yeah.</span> <span id="s2180">I had mixed my camp food with an little bit of self-cooked food.</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">Q: And where did you get that food from?</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">A: I had a girlfriend with whom I worked together, and all she did, she -- we had our bread rations in -- divided into one part to eat, and one part to exchange for potatoes, that’s all.</span> <span id="s2183">And the potatoes we have mixed an little bit with margarine, which we obtained.</span> <span id="s2184">So we were eat -- the feeling that you can eat -- that you are eating a little bit differently, yeah, contributed to your well-being.</span> <span id="s2185">It was nothing special.</span> <span id="s2186">Then we had parcels received.</span> <span id="s2187">I -- I had two rations from the special rations from the orchestra, and the camp office.</span> <span id="s2188">And there were fruits and there were other goodies, yeah.</span> <span id="s2189">Those special rations, special parcels which people were receiving from the parcel section, from the pack -- package room, because there were all good things, they brang things which we did not had before, in the beginning.</span> <span id="s2190">So I had that.</span> <span id="s2191">Then this -- we have received from Switzerland, the Slovakian girls, there was by some of the organizations, of the Czech organizations, they paid through -- in Switzerland they purchased sardines, yeah.</span> <span id="s2192">We received those sardines, we received some chocolate from time to time, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">Q: The Jewish girls could get these?</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2195">Th -- there is even a description of the organization who sponsored that.</span> <span id="s2196">They had to pay for each person who was deported.</span> <span id="s2197">They had to supply and buy, even if they were alive or no -- if they were di -- regardless if they are alive or not.</span> <span id="s2198">The SS collected all the dead people’s parcels, but those who were alive were -- received the parcels.</span> <span id="s2199">So every -- every little bit added to -- to the body’s re-recovery, yeah.</span> <span id="s2200">And that was among [indecipherable] reason, but you know I even menstruated when we went on the Death March, with heavy cramps.</span></p> <p><span id="s2201">Q: So when you were in the camp office, how did you take care of the period physically?</span> <span id="s2202">Did they -- did they have --</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">A: Yeah, the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">Q: -- certain --</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">A: -- the package -- not package, but clothing barrack, yeah, had -- not --</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">Q: Napkins?</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">A:

don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2363">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2364">A: And later on it became unimportant, because we had so many good packages, that those mussels and mustard were not -- no value whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s2365">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2366">A: In the beginning, when there was nothing, it was very helpful.</span></p> <p><span

hospital, in so far as you know, how the hospital was run in the women’s camp.</span> <span id="s2372">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2373">A: I don’t wanted to know, I don’t want to know.</span> <span id="s2374">I had no good relationship with the hospital administration because they were Poles, and were Polish women, and anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s2375">But some of the doctors I have known, and I’ve kept touc -- in touch with them up -- up til now.</span> <span id="s2376">I am in touch with Dr. Schreiberwined, I’m in touch with Emma Pronska, Emma Weiss, and some of the nurses, but I tried to keep out of sight, because it was an very infectious -- infectious en-environment, so I never entered the hospital if I had not -- had to -- I mean, I tried to avoid the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2378">A: The whole business.</span> <span id="s2379">But they had their own systems, they had there every day the roll calls, they had to report to us every day, just like any other -- other sub-camp, to include the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2380">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2381">A: -- strength of their patients, and bed runs, and so ex -- the bed runs, the transfer to the gas chamber, the transfers from the camp to the hospital, the transfers from the hospital to the camp, back again.</span> <span id="s2382">So it was con -- in constant movement every day, every day, every day.</span> <span id="s2383">It all went on the appelle sheet, yeah.</span> <span id="s2384">On the roll call sheet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2385">Q: And what did you know then about what was happening with pregnant women and the babies?</span></p> <p><span id="s2386">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span

Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">Q: Both.</span> <span id="s2394">What do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s2395">A: The Jewish -- non-Jewish women, they could keep the babies.</span> <span id="s2396">The Jewish women who were pregnant upon arrival, or during the early st -- or post arrival time, were simply killed, with their babies.</span> <span id="s2397">That was all far as I know.</span> <span id="s2398">Then the Hungarians were coming, many of them were in -- pregnant in the early stages.</span></p> <p><span id="s2399">Q: So they --</span></p> <p><span id="s2400">A: There were abortions performed by the doctors, secretly, and that was all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2401">Q: Did the -- do you -- do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2402">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">Q: Did the women know that they were having abortions?</span> <span id="s2404">Did they realize what was going on, or was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2405">A: They wanted to have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2406">Q: They wanted to have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2407">A: They wanted to have it, otherwise, how would it -- would the doctors have known that she is pregnant?</span></p> <p><span id="s2408">Q: How in heaven’s name did they perform --</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2410">Q: -- how did they perform abortions there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2411">A: Mm, very simple, with everything -- they had everything for -- for instruments, and everything.</span> <span id="s2412">That Dr. Pearl is telling lies in her description of how she aborted baby with the dirty fingernails on the floor, I mean, that’s crazy.</span> <span id="s2413">There was soap, there was everything.</span> <span id="s2414">She didn’t -- she made an joke out of the whole business.</span></p> <p><span id="s2415">Q: And where did they do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2416">A: In the hospital compound.</span></p> <p><span id="s2417">Q: In the hospital they did it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2418">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2419">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2420">You s -- you said that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2421">A: Mm?</span></p> <p><span id="s2422">Q: -- that you did your reports very imaginatively and artistically.</span> <span id="s2423">What did you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s2424">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s2425">Q: You once told me that the reports that you wrote for Berlin, you did them imaginatively and artistically.</span></p> <p><span id="s2426">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2427">Q: Explain.</span> <span id="s2428">Don’t touch that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2429">A: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s2430">Q: Why?</span> <span id="s2431">How -- wh-what -- what’s that mean, you did reports imaginatively?</span></p> <p><span id="s2432">A: Imaginative, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2433">Q: Or artistically?</span></p> <p><span id="s2434">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2435">Q: Artistically?</span></p> <p><span id="s2436">A: Artistic.</span></p> <p><span id="s2437">Q: Yes, cause the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2438">A: Because an diagram, yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s2439">Q: Is beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s2440">A: -- if you have some material, if you have the colors, and if you know your graphics, and i-if you know your graphics, you produce something which looks -- I would say easy to follow, easy to read, and with taste, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2441">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2442">A: Professionally, maybe I s -- use the word professionally.</span></p> <p><span id="s2443">Q: Maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s2444">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2445">That I would -- would have used.</span> <span id="s2446">Of course, you’ve -- why not artistically?</span> <span id="s2447">It was important that it is just an diagram, it’s just like an composition.</span> <span id="s2448">If -- if I want you to understand something, I am using an simple dialog.</span> <span id="s2449">If I can transfer the message through graphics, then you have to do that on the simplest, and most -- the best way to make your recipient feel good.</span> <span id="s2450">Because otherwise you get an feedback which can put you into trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s2451">Q: And they liked your reports?</span></p> <p><span id="s2452">A: I don’t know, I’m -- have never had a compliment -- pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s2453">Q: They liked your reports, they never complimented you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2454">A: Who should have complimented me?</span> <span id="s2455">They were letting me live.</span> <span id="s2456">You know th-they liked my work, because again I’m telling you the lover of Mandel was in th -- in charge of the architectural office of Auschwitz, now -- and Birkenau.</span> <span id="s2457">And h-he always -- I’m sure that -- and Mandel, with that monthly report, was always very proud, and she could -- she received probably from him several compliments, and she never -- they never objected to anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2458">Q: Did writing these reports depress you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2459">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2460">Q: Did writing these reports depress you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2461">A: To -- I never write -- wrote the reports.</span></p> <p><span

creative.</span> <span id="s2465">Why, what is wrong to make a nice curve of the daily incoming people, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2466">Q: Yes, but you would also have to make a curve of the people who died.</span></p> <p><span id="s2467">A: Those who were gassed, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2468">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2469">A: Of course that didn’t -- made me sad, but that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2470">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2471">A: You are sad if somebody dies here right now.</span> <span id="s2472">If you would make diagrams of the city of New

understand that.</span> <span id="s2484">But to -- in some sense, sh --</span></p> <p><span id="s2485">A: A diagram might -- I did -- I worked after the war, I produced many other things, which were -- have nothing to do -- a diagram is just an ordinary, simple expression of figures.</span></p> <p><span id="s2486">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">Q: But you did two copies, right, so that you hid one?</span></p> <p><span id="s2489">A: Yes, I left that there, and nobody knows what it is, and where it is, and what happened.</span> <span id="s2490">And it’s possible that it stands there in a corner still today, if they haven’t already [indecipherable] in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s2491">Q: But you’ve told them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2492">A: Whom?</span> <span id="s2493">Who -- who are --</span></p> <p><span id="s2494">Q: You didn’t tell Teresa?</span></p> <p><span id="s2495">A: Who are they?</span></p> <p><span id="s2496">Q: You didn’t tell?</span></p> <p><span id="s2497">A: But does -- but does she know whats a diagram is?</span> <span id="s2498">Look, what do you -- what do historians know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2499">Q: Well, a diagram, if you found it in Auschwitz, you would realize you were getting part of the history, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2500">A: It would be like the -- like the Dead Sea Scrolls, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2501">Q: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2502">A: I know that.</span> <span id="s2503">You don’t know -- you don’t know the world outside New York City, or Washington, D.C.</span> <span id="s2504">If I would have a chance to go to Auschwitz, not only that I will find my work, yeah, I would be able to deseefert some document --</span></p> <p><span id="s2505">Q: That others can’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2506">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2507">Q: That other’s can’t, yeah.</span> <span id="s2508">Did the men do the same kind of reports, from the men’s camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s2509">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s2510">Q: Did the men construct the same kind of graphs for Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s2511">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2512">Q: Was this the women’s idea?</span> <span id="s2513">Was this Mandel’s idea, Katya’s idea, yours idea, whose idea?</span> <span id="s2514">All of you?</span> <span id="s2515">All right --</span></p> <p><span id="s2516">A: I created the job for myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2517">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2518">A: And they had no -- nobody in the man’s camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2519">Q: And how come -- well, how -- you -- it’s a stupid question.</span> <span id="s2520">I wa -- this is what I was going to ask you , but it’s not answerable.</span></p> <p><span id="s2521">A: Well, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s2522">Q: Why, if Berlin was -- was glad to get your reports --</span></p> <p><span id="s2523">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2524">Q: -- didn’t they say to the men, we want these reports from the men’s camp?</span> <span id="s2525">No, of course you don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2526">A: How should I know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2527">Q: I don’t know, Sip.</span></p> <p><span id="s2528">A: As you can see, we repro -- we did things men couldn’t do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2529">Q: You did the res -- reports once a month, right?</span> <span id="s2530">And so that they would be different graphs for different -- showing the different circumstances, you at one point told me --</span></p> <p><span id="s2531">A: [indecipherable] movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s2532">Q: -- there were 18 different curves and colors.</span> <span id="s2533">18</span></p> <p><span id="s2534">A: 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s2535">Q: Every single month.</span></p> <p><span id="s2536">A: Yes, sir.</span></p> <p><span id="s2537">Q: So -- so name some of the things that you were graphing, that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2538">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s2539">Q: You were -- you were graphing people coming in, so you were graphing population changes of -- in -- of incoming.</span></p> <p><span id="s2540">A: Incoming, outgoing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2541">Q: Outgoing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2542">A: Dying, gassing, work details.</span></p> <p><span id="s2543">Q: So that would be a number of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2544">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2545">Q: Different -- different ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s2546">A: With th-the work force.</span></p> <p><span id="s2547">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2548">A: [indecipherable] work force.</span></p> <p><span id="s2549">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2550">A: So?</span></p> <p><span id="s2551">Q: It’s a lot of work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2552">A: It was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2553">Q: How did you come up, or why did you come up with the idea of making a model of ow -- of the women’s camp?</span> <span id="s2554">Did you just come up with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2555">A: I tell you.</span> <span id="s2556">I had an desk, working desk like that, big like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2557">Q: Like a -- like a kitchen table -- like a dining room table?</span></p> <p><span id="s2558">A: Yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2559">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2560">A: And every time an SS man was asked to go to a certain barrack, he was -- they were coming to the camp office to ask where the barrack is, yeah?</span> <span id="s2561">Now, then they have sent them to me, I should tell.</span> <span id="s2562">So, after awhile I’ve decided --</span></p> <p><span id="s2563">Q: You were the tourist office.</span></p> <p><span id="s2564">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2565">After awhile I’ve decided I’m going to make an -- with a pencil, an plan on the desk -- top of the table, to put in those blocks, how they are located, with everything in the scale from one two.</span> <span id="s2566">So I measured out the whole camp, and everything, and made myself a line drawing with pencil, on the top of the desk, and put the number of the block in.</span> <span id="s2567">So when an SS man was coming, and asking where is the block, I told him I could show him immediately where it is.</span> <span id="s2568">So when I noticed it worked so nicely, I had the plan flat on my desk, I said I’m going to build the barracks, and in colors exactly, and I’m going to make an little model, without asking anybody.</span> <span id="s2569">The material I had, and when I started, and Mandel once visited, and thought what I’m -- and saw what I am doing, she said [indecipherable] and Hessler was there.</span> <span id="s2570">“Carry on, you can do anything, you can measure out whatever you want.</span> <span id="s2571">But, don’t include the crematorium.</span> <span id="s2572">You can put anything on, but no crematorium.”</span> <span id="s2573">Okay.</span> <span id="s2574">So I engaged in little -- Hans [indecipherable] was an architectural student in Poland, or in France, and we are started to build that nice little model.</span> <span id="s2575">It was so nice we made [indecipherable] barbed wire, everything was on.</span> <span id="s2576">So -- soil, glued -- put the glue on, and sprinkled sand on so it stuck.</span> <span id="s2577">I made an professional model, okay, out of the camp.</span> <span id="s2578">Now, then I had an friend who was one of the Polish underground workers.</span> <span id="s2579">He was an electrician, and him I engaged to put me in front of the entrance an little barb, electric barb like an -- like an -- what we had over there, and underneath I had the battery, and so when you touched the two things, the camp was illuminated, yeah.</span> <span id="s2580">Was an good model, very professional.</span> <span id="s2581">Then, one nice day they were -- put me on an glass top on that, and were taking it out to the commandant, Hesse, into his office.</span> <span id="s2582">That was the end of it.</span> <span id="s2583">Do you know it’s possible that it is still standing somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s2584">Q: Somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s2585">A: And what I did, I put my number, I marked the model with my number.</span></p> <p><span id="s2586">Q: Oh, you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2587">A: It’s signed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2588">Q: Did you paint it --</span></p> <p><span id="s2589">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2590">Q: -- so it was really -- it looked really professional, you painted it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2591">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2592">Q: Did you put people in it, too, or just the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2593">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2594">Q: No.</span> <span id="s2595">So you didn’t have any -- did anyone take pictures of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2596">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2597">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2598">A: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s2599">Q: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2600">A: Who, we?</span> <span id="s2601">Of the inmates?</span></p> <p><span id="s2602">Q: No, no, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2603">A: I have no idea what they did.</span> <span id="s2604">But every time, whenever somebody was visiting, an high official, instead to -- what they did in prior years, to demonstrate how people are getting 25 on their buttocks, they brought the high officials into my office, and showed him the -- the model, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2605">Q: Yes, you said that, that rather than watching somebody being beaten, that this became a substitute.</span></p> <p><span id="s2606">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2607">Q: Isn’t that strange?</span></p> <p><span id="s2608">A: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s2609">Q: Well, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2610">How does one substitute -- this was a way of entertaining them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2611">A: Because -- look, I don’t know, it happened that -- it turned out that it was very beneficial for the camp, that there was never -- there was never again, since I made the model, they had -- you see, they were showing off with something always, but nobody ever performed the 25 since then.</span> <span id="s2612">They were proud of their model, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2613">Q: So they wanted to show that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2614">A: Isn’t that funny?</span></p> <p><span id="s2615">Q: Strange.</span></p> <p><span id="s2616">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2617">I don’t even know what high officials I had in that drawing office, because there were really a lot of very important looking people.</span> <span id="s2618">I know one thing, Hitler wasn’t there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2619">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2620">A: But, with those primitive SS people, I once made a joke, but it was not a joke, it turned out to be a very good -- good weapon.</span> <span id="s2621">They always asked me, “What kind of an profession do you have?”</span> <span id="s2622">I did that, I did that, what kind of a pro -- I said, “The same like your fuhrer.”</span> <span id="s2623">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2624">Q: Did they keep quiet then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2625">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2626">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2627">A: Can you imagine?</span> <span id="s2628">No, we are laughing now, but it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2629">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2630">A: -- for me then, I -- I tried to -- to keep those people out of my way.</span> <span id="s2631">Same profession as your fuhrer.</span> <span id="s2632">Son of a bitches.</span> <span id="s2633">Now, what can I tell you?</span> <span id="s2634">Any other question, or are you too tired?</span></p> <p><span id="s2635">Q: I’m s -- I’m s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2636">A: Would you like to wa -- a cup of coffee or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s2637">Q: I’m starting to get tired.</span></p> <p><span id="s2638">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2639">Q: I think we’ll st -- we’ll stop the tape right now, at about 4:10, on September seventh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2640">End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s2641">[blank] Beginning Tape Five, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s2642">Q: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Helen Tichauer, on September eighth, 2000, in New York City.</span> <span id="s2643">This is tape number five, side A, interview conducted by Joan Ringleheim.</span> <span id="s2644">Sippy, is there -- is there anything after we left each other yesterday --</span></p> <p><span id="s2645">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2646">Q: -- that you thought you wanted to clarify?</span></p> <p><span id="s2647">A: I went to sleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s2648">Q: You went to sleep, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2649">A: I was tired.</span> <span id="s2650">I just realized afterwards, clarify we will, after you’ve make an -- after we’ll make an transcript.</span></p> <p><span id="s2651">Q: Right, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2652">A: That I can correct, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2653">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2654">A: There I will be able to clarify better th-than -- you see, I must see certain things in front of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2655">Q: Right, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2656">A: I’m a visual person.</span></p> <p><span id="s2657">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2658">Well let me -- let me ask you something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2659">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2660">Q: What is it -- what -- what is it about the structure of Auschwitz that you th -- the women -- the women’s camp, that you think most ordinary prisoners who went through --</span></p> <p><span id="s2661">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2662">Q: -- and are being interviewed, don’t understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s2663">A: I can’t tell you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2664">Q: Is it everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s2665">A: -- it’s very -- it’s not Auschwitz only.</span> <span id="s2666">Let’s compare -- and I like to compare Auschwitz with the present civilian environment, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2667">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2668">A: Because we are living in a normal life, in a normal environment.</span> <span id="s2669">Who f -- f -- I mean, New York is an big city, but a little village, a little -- an borough, whatever community, what does the ordinary person know about the structure of the city hall?</span> <span id="s2670">In spite of the fact that we have television performance, exposure, we know that people can come and discuss it, and present their problems, and there’s a group of people, com-committees, and so on, who are listening, who are going ahead, and are engaged in problem solving, and betterment of certain malfunctions, t-trying to help, and to make life more bearable.</span> <span id="s2671">But who -- who knows how -- how the system works?</span> <span id="s2672">Who knows the mechanics?</span> <span id="s2673">Now why should the ordinary person in Auschwitz have known the mechanics of the camp, or the camp leadership?</span> <span id="s2674">Why are we expecting that?</span> <span id="s2675">Only those who were engaged, or are engaged today in city hall business will know, and know, and know how to go ahead, and how to conduct the certain sessions, and how to conduct the leadership.</span> <span id="s2676">I mean, how to engage in the leadership, and what to do.</span> <span id="s2677">The ordinary -- I don’t know what the -- how they are -- how it works.</span> <span id="s2678">And there’s no plan of -- of s -- simplified to explain to the public, not even who is who.</span> <span id="s2679">And who -- who’s -- who is doing what.</span> <span id="s2680">Wh-Why do we expect -- know that ev-every ordinary, poor, ex, dirty, stinky inmate, hungry, half-dead musselman, should know what happened in Birkenau, and in Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s2681">Is that an answer?</span></p> <p><span id="s2682">Q: That’s a good answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2683">A: Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2684">Q: But let me -- let me ask you it in a -- in a different way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2685">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2686">Q: It’s one thing for ordinary people --</span></p> <p><span id="s2687">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2688">Q: -- not to know exactly what the structure is, and -- in any kind of detail.</span></p> <p><span id="s2689">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2690">Q: It’s another thing for them to not know that there’s any structure.</span> <span id="s2691">So -- so, a lot of people, certainly before I met you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2692">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2693">Q: -- many years ago --</span></p> <p><span id="s2694">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2695">Q: -- I never -- it could be my stupidity, of course --</span></p> <p><span id="s2696">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2697">Q: -- as opposed to anything else, but I never thought that there was -- I never thought about a structure.</span> <span id="s2698">Di -- di -- do you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s2699">And I think that that’s true, I think that’s true for a lot of people, el -- over the years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2700">A: Good, we were prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s2701">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2702">A: Yeah?</span> <span id="s2703">There is a prison system in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s2704">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2705">A: Who knows about the prison system?</span> <span id="s2706">Who ask about it?</span> <span id="s2707">Who cares about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2708">Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2709">A: Yeah?</span> <span id="s2710">The prisoners themselves, today, they’re interested in one thing, to have food, to have medical care, to -- not to e -- be exposed to brutality by their guards, but -- and some of them may be interested in the jury leg -- jury -- legal system, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2711">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2712">A: And learn more about the law, and they have a chance to -- even to study, but how many of those people will, after their sentence, be engaged in the cil -- in civil law?</span> <span id="s2713">Just few who are interested.</span> <span id="s2714">And same thing as here.</span> <span id="s2715">Those who survived and were -- became interested later on, what really happened to them, they have learned, and they know a little bit more than the average person.</span> <span id="s2716">But they participated in one thing, all of those -- of those who -- who are able to speak out.</span> <span id="s2717">They mu-must remember how they were -- how they were perform -- not perform, transform from being an civilian into an inmate.</span> <span id="s2718">They remember, even if a little bit, and not everything, how they -- what happened to them when they were stripped naked, when they were shaved, yeah, when they were registered maybe, yeah.</span> <span id="s2719">Then driven into an barrack, and all those basic things, they have remembered them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2720">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2721">A: They remember they had an blockelteste.</span></p> <p><span id="s2722">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2723">No, you’re right, you’re right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2724">A: Yeah?</span> <span id="s2725">Now what -- why must they remember anything else what they never ec -- never -- they were never exposed to anything else, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2726">Q: Yeah, right, yeah, you’re right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2727">A: So it is not just the people don’t know, they were never exposed to anything.</span> <span id="s2728">And they were interested in one thing, to sleep and to eat.</span> <span id="s2729">They were the two enemies, sleeplessness, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s2730">Q: And starvation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2731">A: -- the lack of the chance to sleep enough, and to eat enough.</span> <span id="s2732">And s -- hygiene, and then comes medical facilities, let alone a medication, or well-being during an -- an roll call, yeah.</span> <span id="s2733">The roll call was actually the center of everything.</span> <span id="s2734">Everything was built around the roll call, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2735">Q: So food is built around the roll call?</span></p> <p><span id="s2736">A: Depended on the roll call, the food supply, if there were a thousand people, and you have received 900 rations, yeah, there was an problem.</span> <span id="s2737">So as we mentioned yesterday, and I explained to you that the male prisoners -- the non-Jewish male prisoners, who were there much earlier than the Jewish prisoners, male and female, the male prison -- non-Jewish male prisoners were mainly ex-military people, fren -- from France, from each country.</span> <span id="s2738">They knew what an roll call is, they knew that an -- the formation into five and all that, is of importance to make things easier and quicker, but the women did not understood, and the Jewish male, especially of the religious sect, did not understood, yeah.</span> <span id="s2739">Now they think that they have committed an act of resistance, those idiots, yeah?</span> <span id="s2740">That was no act of resistance, to -- to made it impossible to be counted, that was an k-killing situation.</span> <span id="s2741">They were beaten, they were -- they have extended the duration of the roll call, and a -- the s -- it -- stupidity of they’re not allowed to be counted, and all that, did not help, so again -- and we were not soldiers, the women were not soldiers, ex-soldiers, we didn’t know what it meant in the beginning at least, and then later on, of course it -- we have learned what -- what the roll call is, but it was an torture, because we hadn’t -- the people had no experience, they didn’t understood.</span> <span id="s2742">And everybody wanted to stand during a lo -- roll call with her sister, while moving forward, and backwards, and they were -- they had the ti -- never made any sense.</span> <span id="s2743">They -- they did not understood, nobody’s there to explain, yeah, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2744">Q: Di -- wh-when you -- when you f -- when you folks came up with your system of doing the roll call, the pre -- the pre-appelle.</span></p> <p><span id="s2745">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2746">Q: Did you try to create a system where the blockelteste would explain to the women what you were doing, so that they wouldn’t act in this chaotic way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2747">A: The blockelteste, no.</span> <span id="s2748">Th-There was told -- look, people in charge had certain obli -- had certain -- no -- had an obligation, certain obligation to tell the people, come out, we have to count you.</span> <span id="s2749">Stand in fi -- in -- in five rows, yeah.</span> <span id="s2750">Who had time, in an hungry, wild, hoard, th -- the -- it was an wild hoard of people, yeah, who had time to speak and to explain, and who was listening, yeah?</span> <span id="s2751">There was an ordered, do that, yeah.</span> <span id="s2752">If you didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s2753">Q: And ordered what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2754">A: -- a order, do that, go stand in five --</span></p> <p><span id="s2755">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2756">A: -- in perf -- in five of rows, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2757">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2758">A: That was the order.</span> <span id="s2759">If you did it, fine.</span> <span id="s2760">If not, you were hit.</span> <span id="s2761">There was hitting going on, pushing, kicking, screaming.</span> <span id="s2762">So that was not an normal situation, you had hungry, wild people, who didn’t know what is going on, and nit -- did not understood, and you could not talk, because there was no time to talk.</span> <span id="s2763">You -- if you wanted that people should do something, you s -- the f -- you were giving an order, and if they did not obey to the order, they were be-beaten, and once they were beaten, things -- it was an horrible situation.</span> <span id="s2764">And then the SS came in, and they were coming with dog.</span> <span id="s2765">They had to be -- it -- it was an wild horde of hungry, miserable people, yeah, in the beginning.</span> <span id="s2766">Later on, when they have learned -- it took awhile, that if they are going out, and they do that quick as possible, they can go back quick as possible.</span> <span id="s2767">That meant they could rest longer, they could sleep longer, there was no beating.</span> <span id="s2768">But it took awhile, but there was no tal -- look, you’re Mrs. Lehrman, in one of her speeches that were printed in -- in the newsletter, explained that she was -- something happened during roll call, and the blockelteste took an bucket of cold water and -- and -- over her body, I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s2769">She must have been wild, too, because she must have ec -- behaved just like what I explained to you before, that an blockelteste will use water fe -- every drop of water was so precious, she must have behaved impossible, yeah.</span> <span id="s2770">But that she doesn’t know, and does not even bother to explain.</span> <span id="s2771">Then she mentions the name of the blockelteste, yeah.</span> <span id="s2772">That woman lives here, and I know her very well.</span> <span id="s2773">She was not an bitch, she was a normal human being, who was living later on in a displaced person camp, and believe me, she would have been such an horrible woman, she wouldn’t have survived one day.</span> <span id="s2774">So, she doesn’t even bother to find out who that blockelteste was, yeah.</span> <span id="s2775">You know s -- her name, she mentioned her name.</span> <span id="s2776">So the bucket of water, that was the big -- big event that she used a bucket of water to calm her down.</span> <span id="s2777">But can you imagine how wild she must have been?</span> <span id="s2778">And we had man-many, many of those people, who just turned crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2779">Q: Did the camp office workers have to go on roll call?</span></p> <p><span id="s2780">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2781">Q: With -- with just -- in the ba -- the barrack -- barracks four, five and six -- I mean that’s barracks four -- barrack four.</span></p> <p><span id="s2782">A: Every -- every --</span></p> <p><span id="s2783">Q: Everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s2784">A: -- roll call was in front of the barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s2785">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2786">But you were how many people in that barrack?</span></p> <p><span id="s2787">A: Nearly hundred.</span></p> <p><span id="s2788">Q: And all of -- everybody working for the camp office?</span></p> <p><span id="s2789">A: Or individuals who worked in one capacity of secretaries or so, outside of the camp, who went out every day.</span> <span id="s2790">But they were part of the camp office.</span> <span id="s2791">On the -- the work place or somewhere, not concentrated where we -- yeah, it was the camp, it was the office -- the office workers of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2792">Q: So -- so let’s -- let’s do this just a little bit again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2793">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2794">Q: The roll call really is -- is the information, in order for almost everything to function.</span></p> <p><span id="s2795">A: Logistic -- logistics.</span></p> <p><span id="s2796">Q: So it’s -- it’s food, it’s clothing, it’s work, it’s movement, everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2797">A: Everything.</span> <span id="s2798">It was the -- real heart, the be-beating heart of entizil.</span> <span id="s2799">It was the most important function, the most important function of the whole camp, and it is just too bad that Laura Shelley did not understood what she did with the secretaries of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2800">Q: No, it’s interesting, because the only thing that you get --</span></p> <p><span id="s2801">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2802">Q: -- as far as I can tell, when women talk about the roll call, is how difficult it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2803">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2804">Q: Not the way it functioned -- at -- and you’re right, how would they know, but in spite of the fact of studying it for so long, I myself have not, until now, really understood that without that, you can’t do anything in that camp, for good or ill.</span> <span id="s2805">Either killing people, or saving people, that’s the heart of it.</span> <span id="s2806">That’s very interesting.</span> <span id="s2807">So tell me something.</span> <span id="s2808">In terms of food rations, di -- amounts of food --</span></p> <p><span id="s2809">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2810">Q: Who made the decision what a ration was for one person?</span></p> <p><span id="s2811">A: Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s2812">Those decisions were made for -- merely for the whole system in all Germany, so it was made at an very high level.</span> <span id="s2813">I couldn’t tell you where, and who was responsible for it, but just like the civilian population had their food rations, and which applied to each German citizen, and -- or applied to -- to the German population of an certain working group, like light industry, or heavy industry, or whatever, there were certain standards set, yeah.</span> <span id="s2814">Now, so they were set certain standards for the concentration camp population, and we have information of the caloric intake, and the caloric standards, or supplies for the civilian population, and for the working population in the -- and in the working -- in the camp population.</span> <span id="s2815">Now, those special rations which every two weeks or so were supplied to heavy -- to indus -- to workers who were working in heavy industry -- prisoners or civilians were sometimes identical, yeah.</span> <span id="s2816">And there are studies made, there are tables, there are reports on that.</span> <span id="s2817">I couldn’t tell you that by heart, but it is available, and the East Germans did that already after the war, and published that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2818">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2819">A: In many publications, so if that is of interest to you, you can go into the files and -- and look into that, easily.</span></p> <p><span id="s2820">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2821">But all right, so however, you -- the camp office would say, there are X number of women.</span></p> <p><span id="s2822">A: Oh no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2823">Q: And -- and -- and -- then so who -- how does that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2824">A: X num -- no, the population in the camp, man or women, had the same supply, food supply, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2825">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2826">A: And the order what to supply, on an daily or weekly or monthly basis, was not decided in -- in the camp.</span> <span id="s2827">Not in the camp, not in the headquarters of the SS.</span> <span id="s2828">It was -- it was coming from an higher authority, I couldn’t tell you where from, yeah, but when every day is a kitchen -- it was a kitchen where you have to collect your bread, in the kitchen you -- the bread rations of an gi-given day, yeah.</span> <span id="s2829">All week they were five -- for five people, one bread, or four people, or two people, yeah.</span> <span id="s2830">And accordingly, they had supplied to the barracks, some bread rations.</span></p> <p><span id="s2831">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2832">A: If there was margarine, the kitchen had the order to supply for 10 people one cube, or five people, whatever.</span> <span id="s2833">The kitchen was the one who -- who supplied -- you supplied the kitchen with the amount of people, and you were rec -- you received the amount of rations.</span> <span id="s2834">But they had the orders from somewhere, yeah, I couldn’t tell you where from.</span> <span id="s2835">We had nothing to do with that, the -- we couldn’t care less.</span></p> <p><span id="s2836">Q: Okay, but wo -- suppose you said, I don’t know, 10,000 people --</span></p> <p><span id="s2837">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2838">Q: -- need to be fed today --</span></p> <p><span id="s2839">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2840">Q: -- right?</span> <span id="s2841">But they only gave you -- I mean, would it happen --</span></p> <p><span id="s2842">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2843">Q: -- that they would give you rations for only 900?</span></p> <p><span id="s2844">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2845">Q: It wouldn’t happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2846">A: No.</span> <span id="s2847">But that happened in the beginning, because they were not quite sure, and they never received the proper amount --</span></p> <p><span id="s2848">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2849">A: -- of people, because the roll call was not organized, and was contro -- out of control, because the system was not established.</span> <span id="s2850">But the moment when Katya took over, there was no way that somebody would have gone hungry to bed, yeah.</span> <span id="s2851">For each person, it -- if -- for each person reported, there was an ration, the daily ration.</span> <span id="s2852">No matter what.</span> <span id="s2853">It never happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2854">Q: But --</span></p> <p><span id="s2855">A: It did not happen.</span> <span id="s2856">And if by accident something happened, then the blockelteste was clever enough to su -- to -- to divide the rations so that everybody had something to eat, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2857">Q: Now, the rations, were they mainly soup, and bread, and some margarine sometimes, and sometimes --</span></p> <p><span id="s2858">A: Yes, and twice a week, an little piece of -- of sausage.</span> <span id="s2859">There are people today, listen carefully, who swear they have never seen an piece of margarine.</span> <span id="s2860">They simply don’t remember.</span> <span id="s2861">Who swear they never had -- no -- never even knew that there is something else.</span> <span id="s2862">They had sometimes an bit of marmalade, sometimes cheese.</span> <span id="s2863">That was everybody, but they don’t remember any more, I don’t know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s2864">Q: So how -- how would -- how would these come to the barrack?</span> <span id="s2865">The soup was carried in big kettles.</span></p> <p><span id="s2866">A: The people from the barracks --</span></p> <p><span id="s2867">Q: Would come?</span></p> <p><span id="s2868">A: No, they have f -- the -- the block stubendienst, yeah, those who were engaged in the block personnel, they had to go in the morning and get the -- the tea, or coffee, or whatever they had, they had to go in between and bring the bread, al-always to the kitchen.</span> <span id="s2869">The kitchen supplied everything, yeah.</span> <span id="s2870">In the kitchen, the portions were cut.</span> <span id="s2871">In the kitchen everything was prepared, so it was easy to -- to count if one cube of margarine was for 10 people, so 100 people to be supplied, you had 10 -- 10 cubes, yeah?</span> <span id="s2872">It was not -- no big deal.</span> <span id="s2873">The soup was always carried -- the kitchen supplied an -- an -- pa -- the personnel from each barrack had to go to the kitchen and collect their -- their portions.</span></p> <p><span id="s2874">Q: So the kitchen worked very hard?</span></p> <p><span id="s2875">A: Very.</span> <span id="s2876">There were very strong people working in the kitchen, too, but it was mainly reserved for Poles.</span> <span id="s2877">In the women’s kitchen were Polish women only.</span></p> <p><span id="s2878">Q: And you had said that they were members of the Resistance that had come in?</span></p> <p><span id="s2879">A: Some of them, some of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2880">Q: Some of them.</span> <span id="s2881">But you always said that they were fair.</span></p> <p><span id="s2882">A: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s2883">Q: The Poles in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s2884">Different from when the Hungarians came.</span></p> <p><span id="s2885">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s2886">The Hungarians were stealing.</span> <span id="s2887">Oh God, oh God.</span> <span id="s2888">And not only that, the Hungarians were cruel, stupid -- some of them -- stupid people.</span> <span id="s2889">There were an couple of -- of Norwegian prisoners in the camp, males.</span> <span id="s2890">They were so mean to them, they did not understood Europe, yeah, they were coming just like the people out of the ghetto in -- in Romania or where -- where Elie Wiesel comes from, those little shtetls.</span> <span id="s2891">They never heard of a rest -- the rest of Europe.</span> <span id="s2892">And right in the camp, there were Norwegians, big, clumsy, yeah, good types of pe -- but couldn’t speak anything.</span> <span id="s2893">Definitely not Yiddish.</span> <span id="s2894">And they were calling the Norwegians the Eskimos, can you imagine?</span> <span id="s2895">And were making fun of [inaudible], and were mean.</span> <span id="s2896">After the war, it’s very little known, the Norwegian government took in Jewish refugees, under one condition, no Hungarians.</span> <span id="s2897">No Hungarian Jews.</span> <span id="s2898">They were not allowed to enter no -- Norway, and nobody knew why, yeah.</span> <span id="s2899">It was an silent, secret, unwritten regulation and law, yeah.</span> <span id="s2900">But I can tell you why, yeah.</span> <span id="s2901">Let -- but I -- I would not mention that -- oh, I would like to have that off record, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2902">Q: You at one time said to me that when you would get the morning liquid, the tea or the coffee --</span></p> <p><span id="s2903">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2904">Q: -- that rather than drinking it, you would clean yours --</span></p> <p><span id="s2905">A: We were washing ourselves, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2906">Q: -- yes, and that that would be s -- it would have been smart for everybody to do that, rather than drinking it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2907">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2908">We -- not -- not smart, I mean we were hydra -- dehydrated, too.</span> <span id="s2909">So if you have used an couple of sips, was good enough for your body, but you could clean your genitals, you could clean your face, your hands, whatever.</span> <span id="s2910">You can, with an piece of a rag, if it’s wet, can clean your whole body, yeah.</span> <span id="s2911">You know that.</span> <span id="s2912">Even patients in an hospital are washed with a little bit of water, and that is good enough.</span> <span id="s2913">So, that what we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2914">Q: Did a lot of women do that, or mainly in the camp office?</span> <span id="s2915">I’m just wondering.</span></p> <p><span id="s2916">A: I don’t know --</span></p> <p><span id="s2917">Q: You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2918">A: -- if the people in the camp office.</span> <span id="s2919">I did it in -- in the camp office we had water.</span> <span id="s2920">In the camp office, we had other conditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s2921">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2922">A: But I did it in an time when we had no access to anything, in the beginning, especially.</span> <span id="s2923">I did it, but I don’t know what the others did, really not.</span></p> <p><span id="s2924">Q: Now the margarine, you said you also put on your face --</span></p> <p><span id="s2925">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2926">Q: -- so that it wouldn’t dry out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2927">A: Every day, I have used more margarine on the face then, than I am using cosmetics today, yeah.</span> <span id="s2928">And I massaged my face every day, every day in the morning, after I washed the face with margarine, and not only that, the rest of my hands, I’ve smoothed, went over my hairdo, yeah, and it was shining.</span> <span id="s2929">So I looked pretty well groomed, by using the existing -- the existing -- what shall I tell you?</span> <span id="s2930">It’s existing na -- material, or whatever, yeah.</span> <span id="s2931">That what I did.</span> <span id="s2932">I don’t know what the others did, yeah.</span> <span id="s2933">And definitely never discuss what to do.</span> <span id="s2934">It was an drive, it was an natural drive to look smooth, to look good, because to have cracks around your lips, or s -- on your skin m-meant sometimes death.</span> <span id="s2935">People were selected for that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2936">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2937">A: I have massaged my fingers, my hands.</span> <span id="s2938">I never -- I really had better -- in those days I looked better much more often [indecipherable] today.</span> <span id="s2939">Today I am using ordinary water and soap.</span> <span id="s2940">There I have used at least cream, and I don’t use any lotion.</span> <span id="s2941">I don’t know why, but I massaged my face, around my eyes, just like the book said, with margarine.</span> <span id="s2942">And during outdoor works, the sun made such an nice -- such a good work, the sun and margarine is giving you such an beautiful tan, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2943">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2944">A: You didn’t know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2945">Q: I’m going to have to stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2946">A: Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2947">Q: Okay?</span> <span id="s2948">This is the end of tape number five, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s2949">End of Tape Five, Side A Beginning Tape Five, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s2950">Q: Okay, this is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Helen Tichauer, September eighth, 2000, tape number five, side B, conducted by Joan Ringleheim.</span> <span id="s2951">That’s quite a story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2952">A: What’s a story?</span></p> <p><span id="s2953">Q: The story about how you used the food in order to protect yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2954">A: I have an other woman here, an girl who used to be a girl, she lives in Australia now.</span> <span id="s2955">I received some photos from her, she is over 80, older than I am, looks good, beautiful face, s -- everything looks good.</span> <span id="s2956">So, at an occasion, while being on the phone with her, I have ask her, “Tell me, when did you had your last face lift?”</span> <span id="s2957">Yeah?</span> <span id="s2958">I -- I was very honest, and expected an honest answer.</span> <span id="s2959">She said, “I beg your pardon?</span> <span id="s2960">Didn’t you told me to use margarine in Auschwitz for my face?</span> <span id="s2961">I never had a facelift, and I have the best skin you can imagine, and thanks to you.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2962">Q: So she used margarine?</span> <span id="s2963">It was a very cheap way of getting a facial.</span></p> <p><span id="s2964">A: Yeah, but she -- she learned that from me there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2965">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2966">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2967">Q: And you didn’t remember telling her?</span></p> <p><span id="s2968">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2969">Q: Oh, you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s2970">A: She noticed what I’m doing, so she did it too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2971">Q: So maybe we should tell everybody to do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2972">A: Look, what do you -- what do you think about my face?</span></p> <p><span id="s2973">Q: It’s in very good shape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2974">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s2975">Q: Very good shape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2976">A: In good shape?</span></p> <p><span id="s2977">Q: Yeah, you don’t have a lot of lines.</span></p> <p><span id="s2978">A: If I have lines, they are from the time when I had my -- my skull broken, and my -- and my f-face was split open, and there’s the scars, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2979">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2980">A: But I don’t have any lines over my chin.</span></p> <p><span id="s2981">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2982">A: Not chin, what is that?</span> <span id="s2983">Forehead.</span></p> <p><span id="s2984">Q: Forehead.</span></p> <p><span id="s2985">A: I don’t have any lines like the crocodile of -- you -- have you ever -- ever noticed the face of -- what is the name of the cosmetic company?</span> <span id="s2986">Helena Rubenstein, the old lady.</span> <span id="s2987">If you look at her, that face of her, on her -- one of [indecipherable], she looks like an crocodile, and she had all the -- the best possible way of using her cosmetic for herself, right?</span> <span id="s2988">She had the money, and the massages, and everything.</span> <span id="s2989">So, if she would have used, instead of whatever she used, mar-margarine, she would never develop -- she would have never developed the crocodile skin.</span> <span id="s2990">No -- anyhow, I once said --</span></p> <p><span id="s2991">Q: So did you use margarine after the war, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s2992">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2993">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2994">A: But I have -- you know what I have used?</span> <span id="s2995">They should pay me for that, what I am saying now, some -- I should collect some -- what are -- what are you calling that in English, if -- if you get interest, of -- no, not interest.</span> <span id="s2996">I am not -- in an commercial, yeah, you get so and so much if you make an commercial, and if you repeat that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2997">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2998">Residuals.</span></p> <p><span id="s2999">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s3000">Q: Residuals.</span></p> <p><span id="s3001">A: Okay, I should get now those residuals for -- from them, but I have used them all my life, yeah.</span> <span id="s3002">Nothing else, but nothing whatsoever.</span> <span id="s3003">N-i-v-e-a.</span></p> <p><span id="s3004">Q: Nivea?</span></p> <p><span id="s3005">A: You know what that is?</span></p> <p><span id="s3006">Q: Nivea?</span> <span id="s3007">Nivea.</span></p> <p><span id="s3008">A: Nivea.</span></p> <p><span id="s3009">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3010">That’s it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3011">A: That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3012">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s3013">Sippy, what about clothe -- distribution of clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s3014">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3015">Q: When -- when people were -- were registered --</span></p> <p><span id="s3016">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3017">Q: -- and they lost their normal clothes --</span></p> <p><span id="s3018">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3019">Q: -- and they had to be given stuff.</span> <span id="s3020">The Jewish women are not given uniforms, or they’re given uniforms?</span> <span id="s3021">It’s not a uniform, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s3022">A: In the beginning --</span></p> <p><span id="s3023">Q: Yeah, you had Russian -- the Russian uniforms, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3024">A: Yeah, in the beginning, but then there were no Russian uniforms more, so they have taken -- while sorting the stuff which they have taken away from the newcomers, the good stuff went to Germany, into the Reich, and the less -- th-th -- those which looked more cheap and -- and not so good, were then supplied the beglidinskammer, the clothing barrack, and were stored there, and distributed to other Jewish newcomers, while the non-Jewish newcomers received the striped clotheses.</span> <span id="s3025">But, so if you have s -- then, when people were selected for better jobs, Jewish women, they were dressed into striped clotheses, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s3026">Q: So is that what you wore?</span></p> <p><span id="s3027">A: Yes, but after that, we switched back to civilian clotheses, but good ones, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3028">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s3029">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s3030">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s3031">A: Because they wanted us to look -- it was summer, and it -- summertime the striped stuff was too heavy, so they even supplied the non-Jewish women with civilian clotheses, but they were all -- b -- they were all lightweight uniformed -- uniformed material dresses, specially sewn for the prisoners, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3032">Q: And who sewed them?</span> <span id="s3033">In the prison, or -- or in Auschwitz, or</span></p> <p><span id="s3034">A: I don’t know where --</span></p> <p><span id="s3035">Q: You don’t know where.</span></p> <p><span id="s3036">A: -- they were coming from.</span> <span id="s3037">We don’t know who did the striped clotheses, yeah.</span> <span id="s3038">That we don’t know.</span> <span id="s3039">I don’t know, at least.</span> <span id="s3040">But th-they are not produced in Auschwitz, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s3041">Q: And ki --</span></p> <p><span id="s3042">A: Well, it was for the whole German --</span></p> <p><span id="s3043">Q: Yeah, the system.</span></p> <p><span id="s3044">A: --prison system, yeah, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s3045">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3046">And when they gave out clothes --</span></p> <p><span id="s3047">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3048">Q: -- to the newcomers --</span></p> <p><span id="s3049">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3050">Q: -- to the Jewish women --</span></p> <p><span id="s3051">A: Oh, they exchanged clothes between summer and winter, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3052">Q: Even for the Jewish women?</span></p> <p><span id="s3053">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s3054">Q: The Jewish wi -- the j --</span></p> <p><span id="s3055">A: It -- the clothing barracks -- the whole bi -- business over there, they -- in the beginning, they had, for each newcomer, a dress, yeah, in the women’s camp, and for the men they had their trousers, and whatever.</span> <span id="s3056">And exchanged -- clotheses were either exchange after delousing process, not always.</span> <span id="s3057">Sometimes you received the same stuff back, but sometimes they just took the stuff away and supplied you with different things.</span> <span id="s3058">Now, what is it you would like to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s3059">Q: Well, people would say that women would get, if they were short they would get large clothes, if they were tall --</span></p> <p><span id="s3060">A: S-So what?</span></p> <p><span id="s3061">Q: -- s-so that -- what did -- what did they do when they --</span></p> <p><span id="s3062">A: Now who cared, who cared?</span> <span id="s3063">The -- we had no Bloomindales over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3064">Q: No, I understand.</span> <span id="s3065">But if you were very short, and you had something very long --</span></p> <p><span id="s3066">A: Yeah, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s3067">Q: -- it would be very difficult, so what would -- people would switch clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s3068">A: No, but you could go to your -- to your kapo, or to your -- see, kapos were at the workplace, or to your blockelteste at th -- in the barrack, and demonstrate, and the blockelteste could then go to the -- to the cl-clothing barrack, and a -- and ask for an exchange, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3069">Q: Distinguish for me the difference between the beglidinskammer --</span></p> <p><span id="s3070">A: I beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s3071">Q: Distinguish Canada --</span></p> <p><span id="s3072">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s3073">Q: -- commando from beglidinkskammer -- the clothing.</span> <span id="s3074">What is the difference between these two?</span></p> <p><span id="s3075">A: Oh, well the Canada commando was the commando who sorted all incoming belongings from the people -- from the new arrivals.</span> <span id="s3076">They were not only clothing, there were --</span></p> <p><span id="s3077">Q: Everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s3078">A: -- everything.</span> <span id="s3079">And that was on the sortings facility for everything, yeah.</span> <span id="s3080">And they had nothing whatsoever to do with those people who worked in the clothing barrack, because there were clothes -- clothing and shoes, and linen -- not linen, clothing, shoes, some underwear, some head covers for the prisoners only, yeah.</span> <span id="s3081">There were hundred and thousand, and thousands, and thousands of prisoners.</span> <span id="s3082">So, don’t think that there was nothing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s3083">Q: No, no, no, I -- I’m -- I’m not saying that, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s3084">A: Canada had --</span></p> <p><span id="s3085">Q: -- is it nothing to do --</span></p> <p><span id="s3086">A: -- nothing whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s3087">Q: So, what is coming in to the beglidinskammer is the -- is the --</span></p> <p><span id="s3088">A: The leftovers --</span></p> <p><span id="s3089">Q: -- is the issue --</span></p> <p><span id="s3090">A: -- the leftovers from the Canada, which could not be sent to th -- to the Reich, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3091">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3092">A: Those things which were -- those dresses which were of low quality, were supplied to the beglidinskammer for distribution.</span></p> <p><span id="s3093">Q: But the beglidinskammer also got sort of German issue.</span> <span id="s3094">They got uniforms that were coming in from the outside.</span> <span id="s3095">So they had two kinds of material coming in.</span> <span id="s3096">Lefto --</span></p> <p><span id="s3097">A: Two kinds of supplies.</span></p> <p><span id="s3098">Q: Plies.</span></p> <p><span id="s3099">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3100">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3101">A: But -- yeah.</span> <span id="s3102">And it was quite an big enterprise, yeah.</span> <span id="s3103">There were 600 people working in that business.</span></p> <p><span id="s3104">Q: In the beglidinskammer?</span> <span id="s3105">So it was a big storehouse?</span></p> <p><span id="s3106">A: It was the incoming stuff, and outgoing stuff had to be counted, had to be prepared, had to be bundled, yeah.</span> <span id="s3107">Was constant movement.</span> <span id="s3108">And don’t forget the beglidinskammer had to supply the branch camps, wherever a woman was, just the same, yeah.</span> <span id="s3109">They sometimes changed very often their clothes, more often than -- than the outdoor workers.</span> <span id="s3110">So they have supplied them with new clothing, or clean clothing, and received the dirty one, yeah.</span> <span id="s3111">It was an clearinghouse for constant change, especially the odds -- the branch camps were very well looked after, yeah, they are always well dressed, clean.</span> <span id="s3112">That was an very important function, the function of the -- of the clothing from barrack, yeah.</span> <span id="s3113">Very important.</span> <span id="s3114">In the beginning they were full of lies, but later on, it was whenever you have -- whenever you could see somebody from those branch camps, they looked just like out of the box, beautifully dressed.</span> <span id="s3115">Everything was beautiful, clean.</span></p> <p><span id="s3116">Q: But that wasn’t true of people who were in Auschwitz itself, o --</span></p> <p><span id="s3117">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s3118">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3119">So they would clean the clothes for the -- the branch [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3120">A: Every -- a-all the clothes, it’s not --</span></p> <p><span id="s3121">Q: But not --</span></p> <p><span id="s3122">A: -- not only for -- they would clean for the indoors too, but not -- not under -- under such care, and -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s3123">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3124">A: It depend --</span></p> <p><span id="s3125">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3126">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s3127">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3128">A: It -- the -- in -- inside workers of the camp -- of the main camp, were well dressed, too, yeah, clean.</span> <span id="s3129">They could -- the blockelteste had som-sometimes an problem to take the whole barrack, and to exchange the -- to stand there in front of the beglidinskammer, in front of the clothing barrack, and exchange dresses, yeah.</span> <span id="s3130">So they received clean ones, and they left the dirty ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s3131">Q: In the -- in the wintertime, when it got very cold --</span></p> <p><span id="s3132">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s3133">Q: -- who wa -- who was able to get coats or jackets, or sweaters?</span> <span id="s3134">It certainly --</span></p> <p><span id="s3135">A: You could -- you could -- the blockelteste could ask for sweaters, and receive for each member of the barrack an sweater under the clothes, to wear, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3136">Q: So it would depend upon the -- I don’t know, the --</span></p> <p><span id="s3137">A: Yes, it was an regulation.</span></p> <p><span id="s3138">Q: That said it was okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s3139">A: That the people are [indecipherable] to receive that, or that, or that, yeah?</span> <span id="s3140">Or they were forbidden to have that, that, and that, yeah?</span> <span id="s3141">For example, a woman was not allowed to wear the brassiere.</span> <span id="s3142">While we in the camp office, we had brassieres.</span> <span id="s3143">Nobody -- nobody bothered, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3144">Q: And what about underwear?</span> <span id="s3145">Panties?</span></p> <p><span id="s3146">A: Those who had striped clotheses, there was -- there were under -- underpants, not very -- very sexy ones, but there were underpants, and some kind of an undershirt, and the others, the Jewish prisoners, who wore dresses, or whatever, they -- they were allowed to -- to wear an -- sweaters, under the dress.</span></p> <p><span id="s3147">Q: Under the dress?</span> <span id="s3148">Not over the dress?</span></p> <p><span id="s3149">A: No, because sun -- they had to be recognized as prisoners, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3150">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3151">A: You could wear under -- under the dress, anything you wanted.</span> <span id="s3152">Underwear, you organized.</span> <span id="s3153">They were stealing.</span> <span id="s3154">They were -- I sometimes ask some girls from the clothing barrack to get me some panties, a dozen or so.</span> <span id="s3155">So I took the whole dozen on my body, went to an barrack, undressed myself, supplied that among the people, and returned without.</span></p> <p><span id="s3156">Q: What about gloves?</span> <span id="s3157">Did anybody -- was anybody able to get gloves?</span></p> <p><span id="s3158">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3159">But sometimes they were s -- shri -- they were shrinking those gloves, sometimes an real glove looked like was that -- like my fist, small, because they went through -- through the steam cleaning machine, and was shrinking.</span> <span id="s3160">But in some of the outdoor work -- workplaces, they were allowed to wear gloves, and received gloves.</span></p> <p><span id="s3161">Q: Socks?</span></p> <p><span id="s3162">A: Gloves.</span></p> <p><span id="s3163">Q: Yeah, how about socks?</span></p> <p><span id="s3164">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3165">Pardon, socks?</span></p> <p><span id="s3166">Q: Socks.</span></p> <p><span id="s3167">A: Nobody cared, yeah, if you wore socks, or if you had rags.</span> <span id="s3168">Soldiers wear rags too, so it was not officially supplied, yeah, but somehow they couldn’t care less.</span> <span id="s3169">Everybody looked after them -- after herself and people somehow had what -- what they -- some of them had no chance to protect themselves in wintertime, they fr-frozen toes.</span> <span id="s3170">Some of the girls had frozen nipples.</span> <span id="s3171">It’s a pity that you don’t speak German.</span> <span id="s3172">I have here some good literature of -- of -- of interviews.</span> <span id="s3173">I have here some interviews of people who are describing their pro-problems at wintertime, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3174">Q: Well, maybe you can tell me the reference, and I can have it translated.</span> <span id="s3175">So -- before I leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s3176">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3177">I may give you an copy of an -- of one paper where -- no, [indecipherable] it’s a -- references, no, it’s enough if I tell you that the girls had frozen nipples.</span></p> <p><span id="s3178">Q: So what did they do about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3179">A: They were coming to me, and -- and as I have learned from one of the doctors, that cod liver oil is very good for frozen -- frozen parts of the body, and -- and frozen nipples.</span> <span id="s3180">I collected cod liver oil every day from the garbage heap of the -- of the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3181">There was no garbage heap, but the package room, where the non-Jewish prisoners re -- would receive packages from home, were opened before they were supplied to the -- to the owner, and they have taken out all the vitamins.</span> <span id="s3182">Every package at least contained an bottle of cod liver oil from home, because it was so good, and important.</span> <span id="s3183">But the SS removed from each package, the cod liver oil, and the vitamins, and throwing that out in front of the barrack, and in the morning -- early morning, the cleaners, they are coming, collecting that, and into the garbage.</span> <span id="s3184">Now when I have learned that, as the package room was next to our barrack, the package barrack was number five, I was living on number four, I went out every morning, and collected all the cod liver oil, not the vitamins, but I took all the cod liver oils into my camp office.</span> <span id="s3185">I re -- consumed every day, one bottle of cod liver oil.</span> <span id="s3186">I was stinking.</span> <span id="s3187">From miles away you could feel that somebody who was -- who was smelling after cod liver oil, but I think it saved my life.</span> <span id="s3188">It saved a lot, because if -- to have in your body, every day, an bottle of cod liver oil, meant something, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3189">Q: What does it do?</span></p> <p><span id="s3190">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s3191">Q: What does --</span></p> <p><span id="s3192">A: Drinking, drinking.</span></p> <p><span id="s3193">Q: No, no, no, what does it do to -- for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3194">A: Cod liver oil?</span></p> <p><span id="s3195">Q: I know I took it as a kid, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s3196">A: Good, then go into the library and read.</span></p> <p><span id="s3197">Q: And find out.</span></p> <p><span id="s3198">A: Read what it does.</span> <span id="s3199">But, besides that, I drank -- I was drinking daily one bottle of cod liver oil for months, maybe a whole year.</span> <span id="s3200">Then, I supplied the hospital, my doctor friends, with cod liver oil, so that when patients were coming they could treat them, and friends of mine who had frozen nipples and toes, I supplied them with cod liver oil so that they can treat themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s3201">Q: And rubbing --</span></p> <p><span id="s3202">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3203">Q: -- cod liver oil helps.</span> <span id="s3204">Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3205">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3206">If so -- if it was not overdue, because sometimes the toes were falling off, yeah.</span> <span id="s3207">But everybody noticed an frozen nipple, so most of the girls were coming, and I supplied them with cod liver oil, okay?</span> <span id="s3208">That’s an story, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s3209">Q: Yeah, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s3210">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s3211">Q: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s3212">Tell me about shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3213">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3214">Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s3215">Q: Who got wooden shoes, and who got normal shoes?</span> <span id="s3216">O-Other kinds of shoes, I shouldn’t say normal shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3217">A: All the workers got wooden shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3218">Q: Outside workers?</span></p> <p><span id="s3219">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3220">Q: Got wooden shoes?</span></p> <p><span id="s3221">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3222">And inside workers got good shoes, not -- you see, the cont -- the whole system was not designed for the well being of the inmates, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s3223">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3224">A: And sometimes you had big shoes, and sometimes you had small shoes, so it was a mite -- nightmare, the shoe business.</span> <span id="s3225">I, for example, could not get boots.</span> <span id="s3226">And people were allowed to wear boots at wintertime, and I couldn’t get boots, do you know why?</span> <span id="s3227">Because most women were taller than I, and the size of the boot was too high.</span> <span id="s3228">It was hitting my knees.</span> <span id="s3229">So I never -- I never, never, during all those years, I’ve been able to get a pair of boots to fit my legs.</span></p> <p><span id="s3230">Q: And what happened to those sh-shoes, those hiking shoes that you came in with?</span></p> <p><span id="s3231">A: No, th-then when the summer was coming, yeah, it was too hot, and then I had a better job already, I couldn’t walk around with those shoes, you know, in the camp office.</span></p> <p><span id="s3232">Q: Not even in the winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s3233">A: The first.</span></p> <p><span id="s3234">Q: The first one?</span></p> <p><span id="s3235">A: The first winter, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3236">Q: And after that, what did you wear?</span></p> <p><span id="s3237">A: Shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3238">Q: Just regular shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3239">A: I could any -- any pair of shoes in the -- shoe in the clothing barrack.</span> <span id="s3240">I just se --</span></p> <p><span id="s3241">Q: But if you went outside during the winter, when there was a lot of snow, it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s3242">A: Well then, I had my -- my boot.</span></p> <p><span id="s3243">Q: Then you had your other ones?</span></p> <p><span id="s3244">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3245">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s3246">So you kept them the whole time?</span></p> <p><span id="s3247">A: As long as I could.</span></p> <p><span id="s3248">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3249">So that was lucky, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s3250">A: Very.</span></p> <p><span id="s3251">Q: -- you couldn’t get other --</span></p> <p><span id="s3252">A: Very, very.</span></p> <p><span id="s3253">Q: -- boots, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3254">A: And for my size, yeah.</span> <span id="s3255">I never had an -- what are you calling in English?</span> <span id="s3256">You get s-some hardening -- the hardening --</span></p> <p><span id="s3257">Q: Corns?</span></p> <p><span id="s3258">A: Corns, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3259">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3260">A: I never had a corn in my whole life.</span></p> <p><span id="s3261">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s3262">How interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s3263">A: Never had a corn.</span> <span id="s3264">Because I have always taken care of my shoes, which I wore, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3265">Q: But shoes were really crucial in Auschwitz, weren’t they?</span> <span id="s3266">So it could kill you, or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s3267">A: They are as crucial in New York as in Auschwitz, believe me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3268">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3269">A: What do you think, why have they developed after so many years, that kind of walking shoes people wear, even with fur coats, yeah?</span> <span id="s3270">By the way, I had -- I developed one bunion, several years ago.</span> <span id="s3271">Now, that has nothing to do with Auschwitz, what I’m telling you.</span> <span id="s3272">And a bunion is no fun, and most people must undergo surgery because it hurts.</span> <span id="s3273">I have decided not to undergo surgery, and I have decided no matter how expensive, and how pretty the shoe is, I have cut out an hole on each pair of shoes, where the bunion grew.</span> <span id="s3274">And if you are looking today my -- at my li -- leg, I have no bunion any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s3275">Q: It just went away?</span></p> <p><span id="s3276">A: It just went away, because normally, if you have the pressure --</span></p> <p><span id="s3277">Q: It keeps it going.</span></p> <p><span id="s3278">A: And I -- people were laughing at me.</span> <span id="s3279">Here, in New York.</span> <span id="s3280">I was well dressed, beautiful shoes, and the cut up -- and the hole, and I couldn’t care less,

yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3289">A: It’s worthwhile to ruin your shoes, than to ruin your leg.</span></p> <p><span id="s3290">Q: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s3291">I agree with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3292">A: And just an ordinary little hole, and if it’s too little, then you can make it bigger.</span></p> <p><span id="s3293">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3294">A: Even if the whole bunion comes out.</span> <span id="s3295">If you have black shoes and wear black stockings, nobody notice that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3296">Q: Okay Sip, let’s talk about washing in the latrine, for most of the prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s3297">A: Washing and what?</span></p> <p><span id="s3298">Q: Going to the bathroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s3299">A: Yeah, the latrine --

they -- are they allowed to go to the latrine before roll call --</span></p> <p><span id="s3303">A: No, you can’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s3304">Q: You go right there?</span></p> <p><span id="s3305">A: [indecipherable] you don’t go right there.</span> <span id="s3306">And nobody was allowed to leave the roll call, for heaven’s sake.</span></p> <p><span id="s3307">Q: No, no, no, I don’t mean that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3308">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s3309">Q: When were people allowed to go to the latrine?</span> <span id="s3310">After roll call, before roll call?</span></p> <p><span id="s3311">A: N-Not during.</span></p> <p><span id="s3312">Q: Not -- no, I understand not during.</span> <span id="s3313">Before?</span></p> <p><span id="s3314">A: It depends.</span> <span id="s3315">Before, or after, but not during, yeah.</span> <span id="s3316">During roll calls you had to be there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3317">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3318">A: And nobody bothered if y -- it’s after or before.</span> <span id="s3319">If the roll call was announced, people had to gather.</span> <span id="s3320">And if the roll call was terminated by a missile, people could disperse.</span></p> <p><span id="s3321">Q: And they could go to the latrine if they wanted to.</span></p> <p><span id="s3322">A: They -- they -- yeah.</span> <span id="s3323">If it wasn’t too late in the morning, that they had the formation of work details and so on, yeah.</span> <span id="s3324">But if it was an urgent matter, you had to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s3325">Q: Sippy, ordinarily, what time is roll call in the morning?</span></p> <p><span id="s3326">A: The -- very early.</span></p> <p><span id="s3327">Q: I know that it cha -- I know that it changed over time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3328">A: Very early, very early.</span> <span id="s3329">It was still dark, yeah.</span> <span id="s3330">So, it winter time, when is it dark?</span> <span id="s3331">Still --</span></p> <p><span id="s3332">Q: Six, seven?</span></p> <p><span id="s3333">A: Roll call started, actually, the waking up -- I couldn’t tell you exactly the time, but it was around five o’clock.</span> <span id="s3334">And until you -- six o’clock, I think, you had to s -- wait until the SS man was coming and counting you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3335">Q: So did you wait outside until they came and counted you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3336">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s3337">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3338">A: We had -- Katya, during our time, when we tried to make life easier for the people, under all circumstances, on an rainy day, on an windy day, or on bad day, we allowed the people to had -- I mean, we arranged to allow some of the people, where applicable, to stay indoors, yeah, and to be counted indoors, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3339">Q: Indoors.</span></p> <p><span id="s3340">A: If I say applicable, if there was no room for such an usual amount of [indecipherable] thousand, because there was no space.</span></p> <p><span id="s3341">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3342">A: So, it was always close to the barrack, where they were protected from the weather, and from the sun, or so.</span> <span id="s3343">But, usually it took place outdoors, because th -- if it was too heavy, an heavy rain, the SS didn’t wanted to get wet, either.</span> <span id="s3344">So it was never done for the inmates -- I mean, they would never allow that for the benefit of the inmates, but for their own benefit.</span> <span id="s3345">And we have used that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3346">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3347">A: We have used that, by talking them into indoor -- indoor counting.</span></p> <p><span id="s3348">Q: The tape is now stopping again.</span> <span id="s3349">This is the end of tape number five, side B End of Tape Five, Side B Beginning of Tape Six, Side

id="s3355">Because many people talked about --</span></p> <p><span id="s3356">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s3357">Q: -- there being a bucket in the -- in the barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s3358">A: No, there was curfew, curfew, curfew.</span></p> <p><span id="s3359">Q: And curfew started when?</span></p> <p><span id="s3360">A: Late.</span> <span id="s3361">Around 10, I think.</span> <span id="s3362">But I couldn’t tell you that exactly, we had no watches.</span> <span id="s3363">Whenever they decided curfew, there were whistle -- whistles -- the whistles went on, and there was curfew, and then you were not allowed to leave, otherwise you could have been shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s3364">Q: And before curfew, could you go to the latrine?</span></p> <p><span id="s3365">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3366">Q: If -- you could.</span></p> <p><span id="s3367">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s3368">Q: You could?</span></p> <p><span id="s3369">A: You could.</span></p> <p><span id="s3370">Q: Did most of the latrines also have washing facilities, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s3371">A: Some of them had a little bit -- a little bit, but not really.</span> <span id="s3372">It depend where.</span> <span id="s3373">In Birkenau the la -- la -- the wooden barracks -- yeah, the wooden barracks had buckets.</span> <span id="s3374">The brick barracks had buckets, too.</span> <span id="s3375">The latrines were actually real buildings, wooden buildings, or brick buildings, behind the whole row in the -- in the women’s camp.</span> <span id="s3376">Beho -- behind the row of brick barracks, there were barracks who -- in -- were in use for -- for the latrine.</span> <span id="s3377">We have -- they are still in good shape today, they still exist.</span> <span id="s3378">You can see for those if you go to Birkenau, you can see how the latrines looked.</span> <span id="s3379">There were holes --</span></p> <p><span id="s3380">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3381">A: -- where you were sitting, and doing your business.</span> <span id="s3382">It was an ugly business.</span></p> <p><span id="s3383">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s3384">A: Very ugly.</span></p> <p><span id="s3385">Q: Want to explain that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3386">A: Uh?</span></p> <p><span id="s3387">Q: You want to explain?</span> <span id="s3388">Why was it ugly?</span></p> <p><span id="s3389">A: Oh, to sit there, and to be pushed around sometimes, be -- there were more people than holes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3390">Q: Is that where you went, or did you have a -- was there a latrine that --</span></p> <p><span id="s3391">A: I went on the barrack -- on the bucket, but in the beginning I was living there, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s3392">Q: Did you have diarrhea?</span></p> <p><span id="s3393">A: And I had diarrhea.</span> <span id="s3394">And I don’t even want to think about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3395">Q: It’s awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s3396">A: Horrible.</span> <span id="s3397">Bloody diarrhea, no medication, dirty, couldn’t clean yourself.</span> <span id="s3398">Wait -- wait until the next morning, you had an bit of tea, and then you had to use that to clean yourself, and to wash your tookas.</span> <span id="s3399">It’s horrible, horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s3400">Q: So to -- h-how does -- I know when, in ordinary circumstances, normal circumstances --</span></p> <p><span id="s3401">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3402">Q: -- when you get diarrhea, it’s very difficult.</span> <span id="s3403">You have to make sure that you don’t get dehydrated, it’s exhausting.</span></p> <p><span id="s3404">A: Who -- who could think about dehydration?</span> <span id="s3405">We had nothing to drink.</span></p> <p><span id="s3406">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3407">A: Because the water we’ve -- they’ve supplied us, that caused the diarrhea, was infected water.</span> <span id="s3408">So th-that, you cannot imagine, it was -- was like an vicious circle.</span> <span id="s3409">If -- I really don’t know how everything work -- how I -- how I overcame all those things.</span> <span id="s3410">Hard to believe.</span> <span id="s3411">You see, diarrhea is something unpleasant, even here, when you have all the facilities, let alone where you had no facilities whatsoever to clean yourself, or to -- to -- to use an toilet whenever you had the urge, yeah.</span> <span id="s3412">And there was not diarrhea only, as you had some -- always two or three different conditions.</span> <span id="s3413">I don’t know how we did it, I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s3414">I tell you what I did, during the heavy time, and hard time, somehow I got myself a tin -- a tin, and whenever I had the urge to do something during the night, I used the tin.</span> <span id="s3415">Then -- put that in front of my legs, in that bed where we were laying, but some of the women used their -- their eating --</span></p> <p><span id="s3416">Q: Bowls?</span></p> <p><span id="s3417">A: Bowls for both, and that was an big tragedy, because they never -- they couldn’t survive.</span> <span id="s3418">You see, you -- you infected yourself, and re-infected yourself.</span> <span id="s3419">You couldn’t -- and no matter what we did to explain not to do that, it didn’t help.</span> <span id="s3420">So, I can tell you what I did, but I can not ec -- explain why the others used only th-the same bowl for their business they used for eating.</span> <span id="s3421">I never did it.</span> <span id="s3422">I got -- got myself a can of -- it was approximately as -- ama -- an two pound can, tall like that.</span> <span id="s3423">Was just good to use as a -- for urinating.</span> <span id="s3424">Also, I never had to go down when -- I like to live always on the top, where most people didn’t wanted to climb, cause they had no -- no energy.</span> <span id="s3425">I could always climb, I was always on the top, and there used my -- my -- and then all I had to go was going down in the morning, and s -- and empty that into the bucket.</span> <span id="s3426">And then I left the can again on my bed, and -- and the block personnel, who checked those beds, and sometimes even arranged the beds, they never -- never throw those cans out.</span> <span id="s3427">They knew what it is used for.</span> <span id="s3428">So that is the way how I really survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s3429">Q: So -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s3430">A: How I managed, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3431">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3432">And other women did similar things, as far as you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s3433">A: Some of them, probably, yes.</span> <span id="s3434">Nobody -- there was no consitent --</span></p> <p><span id="s3435">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3436">A: -- to tell you what to do, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s3437">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3438">A: You acted on your own instinct, and own judgement.</span> <span id="s3439">There you were really alone.</span> <span id="s3440">What are you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s3441">Q: I was just checking.</span></p> <p><span id="s3442">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3443">Q: Tell me about the bedding, the mattr --</span></p> <p><span id="s3444">A: About what?</span></p> <p><span id="s3445">Q: The mattress, the -- what people s -- what people slept on.</span></p> <p><span id="s3446">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3447">Q: Did most people have some hay, or whatever it was, what was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3448">A: No, no, no, we had mattresses with straw.</span></p> <p><span id="s3449">Q: Mattresses with straw.</span></p> <p><span id="s3450">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3451">Q: So they were covered?</span> <span id="s3452">The -- the straw was covered by some material?</span></p> <p><span id="s3453">A: Yeah, yeah, in -- yeah.</span> <span id="s3454">It -- mattresses -- I mean, it was not a mattress like --</span></p> <p><span id="s3455">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3456">A: -- you go out and buy a mattress, but it was an -- kind of an pillow k -- a large pillow cover, yeah, with an hole in the center, where you stuffed in straw.</span> <span id="s3457">So it was covered, and protected, yeah, and then we were sleeping on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3458">Q: And how was -- how was that -- did all the bunks have that already, or did people have to bring it when they --</span></p> <p><span id="s3459">A: No, no, no, the bunks had the wooden -- wooden bottom, and the blockelteste, and the block personnel, had to get those from an special unit, who supplied mattresses, and the straw, yeah.</span> <span id="s3460">They -- that had to be carried from an special unit, into the block.</span></p> <p><span id="s3461">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s3462">And how long did they -- one mattress -- A: Forever.</span></p> <p><span id="s3463">Q: You just -- that was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3464">A: All the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3465">Q: It was all the time, they didn’t change those?</span></p> <p><span id="s3466">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3467">Q: So after awhile, because of --</span></p> <p><span id="s3468">A: They were thrown out, and I -- they were ye -- probably full of urine, or who knows what.</span></p> <p><span id="s3469">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3470">A: After awhile, but it took awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s3471">Q: Pretty un --</span></p> <p><span id="s3472">A: But -- huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s3473">Q: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s3474">A: Again, you had to s -- you had to ask for it, and then you had -- you were supplied with -- you have -- or they arranged the supply of any request from time to time, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3475">Q: And in the beginning, did you sleep alone on the -- on the bunk, or did you have two, or three, or four people?</span></p> <p><span id="s3476">A: 15.</span></p> <p><span id="s3477">Q: 15 on one?</span></p> <p><span id="s3478">A: On -- on one bunk, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3479">Q: 15?</span></p> <p><span id="s3480">A: 15.</span></p> <p><span id="s3481">Q: Short people?</span></p> <p><span id="s3482">A: You mean -- which bunks?</span></p> <p><span id="s3483">Q: Well, when you first came into Auschwitz one --</span></p> <p><span id="s3484">A: Ah, Auschwitz one, we were on the floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s3485">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3486">A: Then we were in wooden beds, there were no bunks.</span></p> <p><span id="s3487">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s3488">Wooden beds?</span></p> <p><span id="s3489">A: In vi -- wooden beds, those t-t-tri -- t-three bunk --</span></p> <p><span id="s3490">Q: Yeah, bunk beds.</span></p> <p><span id="s3491">A: Bunk bed, ah.</span> <span id="s3492">There were always two people in one.</span></p> <p><span id="s3493">Q: So did you s --</span></p> <p><span id="s3494">A: We were never alone, never alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s3495">Q: So did you sleep head to foot?</span></p> <p><span id="s3496">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3497">Q: One person’s head on one side, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s3498">A: Foot -- foot -- foot and head.</span></p> <p><span id="s3499">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3500">And when you went --</span></p> <p><span id="s3501">A: And if you were more on the loving side, and you had your lover, then were sleeping the way you wanted, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s3502">Q: Uh-uh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3503">A: But normally people slept so that we could accommodate ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s3504">Q: And were there a lot of relationships that were closer than --</span></p> <p><span id="s3505">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3506">Q: There were?</span></p> <p><span id="s3507">A: As -- it was actually introduced by -- in the beginning, not amongst the Jewish girls, but in the beginning, where we had so many German from Ravensbrück, the first thousand, you had many who were there for years, in Ravensbrück, and they have developed some relationship among themselves, and those who had no partners, were looking -- seeking for partners amongst the Jewish women.</span> <span id="s3508">And Jewish women were introduced to lesbianism, as German women from Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s3509">They didn’t know one thing, they didn’t know the difference, they didn’t know anything, yeah.</span> <span id="s3510">So, it was very hard to distinguish who is really a partner or not.</span> <span id="s3511">But people were looking for love, and warmth, and companionship.</span> <span id="s3512">They’re lonely.</span></p> <p><span id="s3513">Q: Was that helpful to people, you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s3514">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3515">I have never experienced anything, because I had friends from home, from the youth movement and so on, so we were used to live together in the summer camps, and so on.</span> <span id="s3516">So there was no lack of -- lack of -- we were not lonely, yeah.</span> <span id="s3517">Girls from school, neighbors, we always were seeking for some old relationship from home.</span> <span id="s3518">We were young then, and sports -- from the sports club, or so on.</span> <span id="s3519">So it -- it -- if is me, I had no -- I personally had no problems, I always had company, and that was good enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s3520">Q: Wh-When you think about the majority of women that you knew, not just -- not just your close friends, but people that you saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s3521">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s3522">Q: Did they tend to have a relationship with one person, or two people -- no -- including people who became lovers, but was that more typical?</span></p> <p><span id="s3523">A: [indecipherable] it -- look, the -- the problem among the people was -- was a language, yeah?</span> <span id="s3524">It’s not enough just to be attracted by a body, right?</span> <span id="s3525">In those days, we needed communication.</span> <span id="s3526">You had to learn how to survive, you had to learn many things, and that couldn’t be done without an verbal communication.</span> <span id="s3527">So, people who knew the language, the German women, spoke German.</span> <span id="s3528">Our women, from Slovakia in the beginning, spoke enough German to communicate.</span> <span id="s3529">They were -- but we were mainly looking for the companionship of political prisoners, because those who were professional prostitutes, were not very attractive to us, they were different, was an different -- different category of people.</span> <span id="s3530">And the political prisoners had their own companionship with -- since Ravensbrück, who -- there were couples who were already established couples.</span> <span id="s3531">And those who had no partner were not even seeking for any partner, because they had their husbands at home, or in -- during the war, somewhere on the front, or they were old, and were never married, and had no -- didn’t know what it means to have a partner at all, yeah, spinsters, who were -- but they were decent people who were idealists, because that was the reason why they were put into the camp as Socialists or Communists.</span> <span id="s3532">So, I myself always looked for good people.</span> <span id="s3533">I had an good friend who was the wife of an -- she was German, but had an Jewish husband, and two sons at home.</span> <span id="s3534">And she practiced, more or less, medicine.</span> <span id="s3535">We had such different ailments, like in civilian life, all of a sudden, everybody -- most of the women -- at least I, among others, we were lot an -- pus in my whole mouth, yeah.</span> <span id="s3536">Between the teeth, the tongue, everything.</span> <span id="s3537">I couldn’t talk, I couldn’t swallow, I couldn’t do nothing.</span> <span id="s3538">It was an awful situation.</span> <span id="s3539">I don’t know where from, how she got it, she was coming every day with something.</span> <span id="s3540">And I had to keep that in my mouth for awhile, and then spit it out, and she cured me, yeah.</span> <span id="s3541">Because she knew from experience, what to do under the camp conditions.</span> <span id="s3542">Having her husband to probably practice medicine there an different way, but I had an woman what -- during my malaria attacks, who was an Jehovah Witness, who brought -- and worked in the SS pharmacy.</span> <span id="s3543">They were stealing every day, one tablet of shineen, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3544">Q: What is shineen?</span></p> <p><span id="s3545">A: Shineena.</span> <span id="s3546">That is the medication if you have malaria.</span> <span id="s3547">Shining, hining, shining, how do you pronounce it?</span> <span id="s3548">C-h-i-n-i-n-e.</span> <span id="s3549">Good?</span></p> <p><span id="s3550">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3551">A: So, I had a pool of helpers help us, yeah?</span> <span id="s3552">Of good people, and I would not s -- would not deal with -- with the rough or low -- low grade -- low grade morally, low grade people.</span> <span id="s3553">I -- I was selective, and that was my luck, yeah.</span> <span id="s3554">Could speak the language, and it was my luck that I was selective.</span> <span id="s3555">And so -- but nobody approached me, ever.</span></p> <p><span id="s3556">Q: But --</span></p> <p><span id="s3557">A: I was an ugly -- must have been very ugly with my short hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s3558">Q: Sippy, I remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s3559">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s3560">Q: -- when -- when Irwin was alive --</span></p> <p><span id="s3561">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s3562">Q: -- and talked to me about this when we -- when we all would talk about it.</span> <span id="s3563">And he said that -- and it wa -- I’m not now talking about lesbian relationships, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s3564">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3565">Q: -- he said that men did not pair bond, and women tended to pair bond.</span> <span id="s3566">Insofar as you know, is that the case, that women tended, whether they were lovers or not --</span></p> <p><span id="s3567">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3568">Q: -- to be with one other person, very close?</span></p> <p><span id="s3569">A: You always had an camp sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s3570">Q: Yeah?</span> <span id="s3571">You always had a camp sist --</span></p> <p><span id="s3572">A: If nothing, always.</span> <span id="s3573">Why?</span> <span id="s3574">It was practical, more practical to have two rations together to share, than to have only one ration, yeah.</span> <span id="s3575">You could manipulate, if you had two pieces of bread, two rations, and two pieces or margarine, yeah, you could go and use together only one ration of margarine together.</span> <span id="s3576">Limit yourself.</span> <span id="s3577">And one ration of bread, but exchange the other half for something which was more important than the ration, yeah?</span> <span id="s3578">And I was never in the exchange business, but n -- I had a partner, a very religious girl, whom I found there in the camp office.</span> <span id="s3579">I have known her brother at home, and because of that she was more attracted -- I was more attracted to her, and she trusted me.</span> <span id="s3580">With her I was even sleeping together in one bed.</span> <span id="s3581">She became my partner, but very religious.</span> <span id="s3582">And she’s still alive, she lives in Jerusa -- in the -- Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s3583">She was a business women.</span> <span id="s3584">She went out and exchanged sometimes, she returned with some garlic, or with an onion, yeah, what the girls were smuggling in from the field where -- where they had to perform.</span> <span id="s3585">Now, I knew that that is important, more important than a piece of bread, so if we were eating garlic, and onions with margarine on bread.</span> <span id="s3586">Even if only half of it wat -- the vitamins were more important than the starch, yeah?</span> <span id="s3587">So that was an relationship where she was a businesswoman, she supplied me with all the goodies, and -- but she became my -- my ca -- then later on, I became to shabbas goy, it was Pesach, and she wouldn’t eat bread, so we had to exchange the bread against potatoes.</span> <span id="s3588">And we had to cook the potatoes illegally.</span> <span id="s3589">I had already my drawing office, I had an stove, yeah.</span> <span id="s3590">So I cooked inside of the stove, because outside we were not allowed to sh -- to cook.</span> <span id="s3591">And that was an relationship of eating together, and do-doing business together, and most girls v -- eat -- nobody was eating alone, that -- I can tell you that.</span> <span id="s3592">Th-That was an -- an habit, to have an partner with to eat, yeah, together.</span> <span id="s3593">So, I don’t know if the men did it.</span> <span id="s3594">Irwin must have known better.</span> <span id="s3595">I never spoke with him about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3596">Q: He said no.</span></p> <p><span id="s3597">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s3598">Q: He said no.</span></p> <p><span id="s3599">A: He said no.</span> <span id="s3600">But maybe in his experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s3601">Q: You’re right.</span> <span id="s3602">It-It’s hard -- it’s hard to -- to generalize with so many thousands of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s3603">A: Yeah, but that was -- had nothing to do with love, or with lesbianism, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s3604">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3605">A: It was just a necessity of going to an restaurant, you’d rather sit with somebody and eat together, than to be alone in an corner.</span> <span id="s3606">Right, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s3607">Q: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s3608">A: Same, I mean we were human, the same feelings, the same instinct.</span></p> <p><span id="s3609">Q: But it -- it -- it --</span></p> <p><span id="s3610">A: Among women, it was more important, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s3611">Q: Perhaps, than for the men.</span></p> <p><span id="s3612">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3613">I can -- have never experien -- sometimes you had only one -- one -- what’s his name?</span> <span id="s3614">Bowl.</span> <span id="s3615">So you were forced to eat two people out of one bowl, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3616">Q: One bowl.</span></p> <p><span id="s3617">A: If they like it or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s3618">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3619">A: And we’re entitled to two bowls of soup, so once they’ve finished the first, they could collect the second, but they were forced to eat together, or they had only one spoon, or -- look, they were [indecipherable] funny circumstances, which drove you into -- into together in, yeah.</span> <span id="s3620">It was not the -- the men probably had their own bowl, and could eat their own soup by themselves, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3621">Q: And why would that be the case?</span> <span id="s3622">Was the s -- was the circumstances in the men’s camp different --</span></p> <p><span id="s3623">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3624">Q: -- and better than the women’s?</span> <span id="s3625">Physical circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s3626">A: It depend -- Irwin was never in Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s3627">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3628">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3629">So, c-call mine was different, and in Auschwitz, he was better off than anybody in Birkenau, and still he described in his book his -- the camaraderie between an couple of men, among themselves, how they manage.</span> <span id="s3630">That is an good book he wrote, yeah.</span> <span id="s3631">But noth -- n-no mystery, and no I -- I -- I, yeah?</span> <span id="s3632">It’s very well done.</span> <span id="s3633">I will give you one book to carry with you, because whenever you will have a chance to have somebody who speaks German, it will be helpful to translate you an little bit --</span></p> <p><span id="s3634">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3635">A: -- step by step, bit by bit, yeah.</span> <span id="s3636">Do you think I’m right?</span></p> <p><span id="s3637">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3638">A: Good.</span> <span id="s3639">Now, what else please?</span></p> <p><span id="s3640">Q: I’m just trying to think if there’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s3641">A: It -- does that answer what you -- your question about the camaraderie?</span> <span id="s3642">The shortage of bowls -- bowls, or bowels?</span></p> <p><span id="s3643">Q: Bowls.</span></p> <p><span id="s3644">A: Bowls?</span></p> <p><span id="s3645">Q: Yes, bowels are different.</span></p> <p><span id="s3646">A: Okay, b-o -- b-o-w-l, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s3647">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3648">A: And bowel is?</span></p> <p><span id="s3649">Q: B-o-w-e-l.</span></p> <p><span id="s3650">A: E-l?</span> <span id="s3651">Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3652">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3653">A: Bowel movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s3654">Q: Right, so it’s different, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3655">A: Good, now I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3656">Q: But Sippy, let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s3657">If you have among the women, ha -- mainly pairs --</span></p> <p><span id="s3658">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3659">Q: -- sometimes it may be three or four --</span></p> <p><span id="s3660">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3661">Q: -- but mainly it was two people.</span></p> <p><span id="s3662">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3663">Q: What did that mean between those two people, and another two people?</span> <span id="s3664">Was there -- di -- were there circumstances where there were a lot of difficulties in a barrack between groups of people, either groups of different nationalities, or -- no.</span> <span id="s3665">But everybody wasn’t nice to each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s3666">A: Everybody wasn’t what?</span></p> <p><span id="s3667">Q: Nice.</span> <span id="s3668">It was a difficult circumstance, so people have complicated ways of --</span></p> <p><span id="s3669">A: Look, the people amongst themselves in the barrack, if th-they were living in an barrack, and worked in the same work detail, yeah, are so tired at the evening, and were so busy to look after their own business.</span> <span id="s3670">That means eating, and sleeping, yeah.</span> <span id="s3671">There was no time for being nice or not nice.</span> <span id="s3672">You will have today among people in good conditions living, neighbors are fighting neighbors, yeah.</span> <span id="s3673">It’s human.</span> <span id="s3674">Some people, they’re fighting with their mouths, yeah.</span> <span id="s3675">Fist fights, nobody wanted to lose any energy.</span> <span id="s3676">So it’s harmless if you scream at each other.</span> <span id="s3677">I don’t even consider that as not nice, just human to let it out.</span> <span id="s3678">And I really don’t know -- or don’t think that to make an big issue out of it.</span> <span id="s3679">People were very tense, or weak, or tired, or sleepy, or hungry.</span> <span id="s3680">So sometimes they screamed at each other, and screaming is harmless.</span> <span id="s3681">I don’t think that screaming is a crime.</span> <span id="s3682">Not even if the blockelteste were scre -- the blockeltestes were screaming.</span> <span id="s3683">To -- to judge blockelteste and other screaming personnel, f -- only for one reason that they were screaming, is not justified.</span></p> <p><span id="s3684">Q: Sippy, you not only didn’t have watches, you didn’t have calendars, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s3685">A: Uh-huh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3686">Q: So how -- if people were religious, whether they were Christian, or they were Jewish, how did they find out, and how did they respond to the various holidays, as far as you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s3687">A: First of all, newcomers brought in the news of the day --</span></p> <p><span id="s3688">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3689">A: -- and events.</span></p> <p><span id="s3690">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3691">A: Some had contact through the camp office.</span> <span id="s3692">One person only, she wer -- was able to discover the date, or the -- yeah, that spreads very quickly.</span> <span id="s3693">There was the latrines, where people have communicated, even if they have known each other.</span> <span id="s3694">That was no problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s3695">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3696">A: That was no problem.</span> <span id="s3697">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3698">Q: So the people tried to celebrate holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s3699">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3700">Q: Did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3701">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3702">Q: No.</span> <span id="s3703">No holidays, didn’t matter?</span></p> <p><span id="s3704">A: My religious girl, she -- she knew everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s3705">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3706">A: She had the calendar, we had in the camp office a day, and everything.</span> <span id="s3707">There were newcomers who brought exactly the -- all news in, and cross -- cross we -- we could cross check, or they could cross check the Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s3708">But it had no -- no significance for me personally, because to be in a place like that, it -- it could have become schizophrenic, to be in the hell, and to -- and to sing like in heaven, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3709">Q: And -- and you -- this religious -- this woman who was your -- your partner --</span></p> <p><span id="s3710">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3711">Q: -- who was religious, what did she do about being kosher?</span></p> <p><span id="s3712">A: Kosher?</span> <span id="s3713">She was not eating anyth -- any sausage --</span></p> <p><span id="s3714">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3715">A: -- when we had -- when we had the rations.</span> <span id="s3716">I gaved her my cheese, and she gave me her sausage.</span> <span id="s3717">So I ate her sausage too, and she was eating my cheese.</span></p> <p><span id="s3718">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3719">A: And that how we managed.</span> <span id="s3720">Pesach she was not eating any bread, but she was living on potatoes, and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3721">Q: I’m stopping the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s3722">End of Tape Six, Side A Beginning Tape Six, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s3723">Q: Tape number six, side B, United States Holocaust Memorial interview with Helen Tichauer, September eighth.</span> <span id="s3724">Sippy, what did runners do?</span></p> <p><span id="s3725">A: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s3726">Q: Runners.</span> <span id="s3727">Like Mala.</span></p> <p><span id="s3728">A: Oh, runner.</span></p> <p><span id="s3729">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3730">A: There were different types of runners.</span> <span id="s3731">There were even runners, I can show you very nice pictures of Indian tribes in the old times, and Indian tribes today, South American Indian tribes, where people live in the high plateau of the Andean mountains, where they have no other communication, like verbal communication between one tribe and another, by using individuals, the so-called runners, yeah?</span> <span id="s3732">They walk from one village to another and communicate, or convey messages, and so on.</span> <span id="s3733">So the runner business is not an invented one of the concentration camp, but as we had no vehicles, the ter -- the distances between camp -- in the camp, between barracks, were pretty large.</span> <span id="s3734">Bicycles were not used for -- for -- inmates couldn’t u -- did not have any bicycles, only the SS, some of them were able to use bicycles.</span> <span id="s3735">The SS runners actually had bicycles.</span> <span id="s3736">An runner is somebody who conveys messages, or who has an job to do, to do it fr -- [indecipherable] from one point to another, and ha -- with a certain order to do something, to bring some people from one barrack to -- to another, to -- to the front entrance for any reason, or to -- is a messenger service, more or less.</span> <span id="s3737">Now, there were no -- no other way of communication, no-not even telephones, yeah.</span> <span id="s3738">They have used people who were messengers, yeah.</span> <span id="s3739">So, sometimes they had dual -- an dual duty.</span> <span id="s3740">Sometimes they were runners who were sent from one -- from the main e -- from the camp office, for example, to an barrack, and convey an message or ask the blockelteste to come to the camp office, or some similar orders were given from headquarters, from the t-top management to us, and we had to execute that through the runners, yeah.</span> <span id="s3741">Through those people who are sending them through different barracks, or different facilities to -- to convey an certain order, or message, or whatever.</span> <span id="s3742">And they work mainly in couples.</span> <span id="s3743">When the one couldn’t do it, then the other took over, yeah, or when one was on lunch break, or in the toilet, and something has to be done in a hurry, the other took over.</span> <span id="s3744">They were couples molis.</span> <span id="s3745">But then you had an other function of certain runners, who made an -- had an du-dual function.</span> <span id="s3746">They were multi-lingual, and could be used as translators.</span> <span id="s3747">So, such, for example, was Mala, was an runner, and an translator between German and French, and German and I think Polish, she could speak Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s3748">Q: That’s Mala Zeemadbel.</span></p> <p><span id="s3749">A: Zeema, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3750">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3751">A: Then you had another runner, which was -- and an translator, which was not one to be identified, but I know where -- her name, and I know where she lives.</span> <span id="s3752">Her maiden name then was Ava Pomeranz.</span> <span id="s3753">She was an -- an -- one of those runners who took, like Mala, and many others, who were taking sometimes people from the camp office, who were asked to report to our camp office, and were then taken for -- with those runners, and an SS man, over to the Gestapo for interrogation, yeah.</span> <span id="s3754">That was one of the activities, too, to accompany certain people who have to appear at the SS headquarters in the shtopskaboida for interrogation.</span> <span id="s3755">That was ma -- one of the main activities of the shtopskaboida of personnel, SS with their secretaries.</span> <span id="s3756">Now, there was Mala, there was Ava Pomeranz, and so on.</span> <span id="s3757">So, there are some still alive, and I know where they are, and I even made myself a list of all the runners.</span> <span id="s3758">So, it was an important activity, because without telephone, and without vehicles, and with such an big enterprise was -- there was so many movements going -- so many things going on, that they had that -- that it was a messenger service among others, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3759">Q: So -- so at any one time, about how many runners would there be?</span></p> <p><span id="s3760">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3761">Q: You think?</span></p> <p><span id="s3762">A: Wait a minute, [indecipherable] and two, four, six -- I would say a dozen.</span></p> <p><span id="s3763">Q: Mm-hm, and where were they living?</span> <span id="s3764">Were there -- was there a particular --</span></p> <p><span id="s3765">A: As a -- in the individual barracks, or th-they were not living in private rooms, just located close to -- in -- they were living in -- in barracks, just like anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s3766">Q: Did they have -- did they have a particular insignia on their arm or something --</span></p> <p><span id="s3767">A: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s3768">Q: -- to -- so that --</span></p> <p><span id="s3769">A: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s3770">Q: -- she was -- they were clear that th --</span></p> <p><span id="s3771">A: You must realize that the la -- if it comes to insignias on the arms, there were the ar -- the arm bins, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s3772">Q: Arm bands?</span></p> <p><span id="s3773">A: Bands, yeah.</span> <span id="s3774">The la -- you had n-n-nearly every function was marked, yeah, in the camp.</span> <span id="s3775">The blockelteste, the block administrator, the lagerelteste, the rapport schreiber, the -- every runner.</span> <span id="s3776">Many, many people were marked so that you could recognize who they are.</span> <span id="s3777">And at the workplace, the same thing.</span> <span id="s3778">You had the kapos, the sub-kapos, the foremen, and many other functions in the wor -- at the workplace, were still -- were marked just the same.</span> <span id="s3779">So that wasn’t my job to do just the same, I did all those -- those arm --</span></p> <p><span id="s3780">Q: Arm -- arm bands?</span></p> <p><span id="s3781">A: Correct, so I -- as you can see, I had an important job, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s3782">Q: So what sort of an insignia did the runner have?</span> <span id="s3783">What did it say?</span></p> <p><span id="s3784">A: Runner, it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s3785">Q: It said runner.</span> <span id="s3786">And what is that in German?</span></p> <p><span id="s3787">A: [indecipherable] loifa.</span></p> <p><span id="s3788">Q: Loifa.</span></p> <p><span id="s3789">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3790">Q: And did they -- were they considered privileged in some way?</span> <span id="s3791">Were they not in --</span></p> <p><span id="s3792">A: They were privileged, yeah of course, they had an job where they could enter any building, where they could run, or be outdoors any time of the day, even if there was curfew during an selection.</span> <span id="s3793">That -- that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3794">Q: So do you think that some of these people actually ended up being in touch with the resistance because they could then bring messages, or was that --</span></p> <p><span id="s3795">A: They ended up like what?</span></p> <p><span id="s3796">Q: Were some of these women --</span></p> <p><span id="s3797">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s3798">Q: -- I don’t know about the men, I’m assuming the men had runners, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s3799">A: Yeah, good, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s3800">Q: Do you think they were -- some of them were in contact with the resistance, because then they could --</span></p> <p><span id="s3801">A: With whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s3802">Q: Resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s3803">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s3804">I cannot answer that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3805">Q: But it would be an opportunity, right, because you could bring messages?</span> <span id="s3806">They could bring more than just the --</span></p> <p><span id="s3807">A: Because you have an idea, do you think the SS wouldn’t have had the same idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s3808">Q: Of course they’d have the same idea.</span> <span id="s3809">That doesn’t mean it wouldn’t happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s3810">A: So, you had -- you had -- you were very careful, because you see, if you -- everybody was careful with those people, you never know for whom they are running, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s3811">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh, right.</span> <span id="s3812">No matter which side, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3813">A: People in the resistance were not visible.</span></p> <p><span id="s3814">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3815">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3816">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3817">Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s3818">A: If todays -- ev -- anybody who’s telling you the story, resistance [indecipherable], they were invisible people.</span></p> <p><span id="s3819">Q: But somebody was in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3820">A: But they were not visible.</span></p> <p><span id="s3821">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s3822">And do you not trust the people who’ve talked afterwards about being in the resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s3823">A: Everybody’s telling you now he was in the resistance, now what kind of business is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3824">Q: Tell me about Mala Zeemadbel, what kind of a person she was.</span></p> <p><span id="s3825">A: Selfish, stupid girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s3826">Q: Selfish, stupid girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s3827">A: Show-off, big mouth.</span> <span id="s3828">She had her own contact reels, yeah, the Belgian Jewesses, and she could help, because she could come into our office, and ask for favors any time, and she was [indecipherable] yeah.</span> <span id="s3829">Any time, she -- she had to go through us.</span> <span id="s3830">And if she needed something, she could come and ask for a favor.</span> <span id="s3831">But what we are talk -- making out of her, it’s nonsense.</span> <span id="s3832">If she wouldn’t have been stupid, she wouldn’t have planned -- or she actually didn’t planned her escape.</span> <span id="s3833">If she wouldn’t have been stupid, she wouldn’t have done what she did.</span> <span id="s3834">She had all the chances to survive.</span> <span id="s3835">What was the hurry?</span></p> <p><span id="s3836">Q: So why did she do it?</span> <span id="s3837">Because she’s stupid?</span></p> <p><span id="s3838">A: Look, when she arrived, I was then still working -- you know I worked in the -- among others as the printer of those numbers --</span></p> <p><span id="s3839">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3840">A: -- fo -- f-for newcomers, yeah?</span> <span id="s3841">New arrivals.</span></p> <p><span id="s3842">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3843">A: I was there when she arrived with an Belgian transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s3844">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3845">A: It was late afternoon, must have been winter off -- late afternoon, but it was dark.</span> <span id="s3846">So there were -- I -- I don’t know how many hundreds newcomers and to register them, and to process so many, and until they are passing through everything, and finally got their numbered labels, and -- sewn on, they were standing in one corner, and waiting until the whole group was processed, and after that, the blockelteste, for whom they were designated to be transferred, was coming, and took them to their barracks -- to the barracks.</span> <span id="s3847">And that what happened with that particular transport when she arrived, where she was in the Belgian transport.</span> <span id="s3848">I was sitting there, and watching, and all of a sudden, somebody went up on a table like that, and giving orders to the crabat -- to the whole group.</span> <span id="s3849">She didn’t know, is she crazy?</span> <span id="s3850">I went over to her, and I said, “What are you doing here?</span> <span id="s3851">Get down from the table.”</span> <span id="s3852">She didn’t understood.</span> <span id="s3853">I said, “Get down.</span> <span id="s3854">Look, you are now in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s3855">You are not in Belgium, I don’t want you to show off.</span> <span id="s3856">The moment you show off, you’ve -- the SS will remember you.</span> <span id="s3857">Get down off here -- from here.</span> <span id="s3858">Get off the table.”</span> <span id="s3859">So, a-after awhile she went down.</span> <span id="s3860">And then the next days -- she took over leadership, yeah?</span> <span id="s3861">Next days, she was presented by the blockelteste as somebody who speaks languages.</span> <span id="s3862">In the arbatz einsatz, yeah.</span> <span id="s3863">Was in our building, in our office, in our [indecipherable] my drawing office, so she was sent -- given the job as an runner.</span> <span id="s3864">And from the runner, she became translator, both.</span> <span id="s3865">And from there on, she had every day to come in the morning to the camp office, and take orders, and what to do, and what [indecipherable] she got her work order every day, in the morning.</span> <span id="s3866">And that’s the way how I have been with her on an daily basis, and I met her every day, and it was a normal relationship between me and the others.</span> <span id="s3867">But that’s the way -- that’s the time when we met for the first time, and when I jumped at her to get off, yeah.</span> <span id="s3868">Because wa -- the moment the SS noticed somebody with such qualities, they picked you and made -- gave to you an big job as an -- as an camp vi -- I don’t know what, and it was not very nice to witness somebody to be recruited f-for an cruel job, yeah?</span> <span id="s3869">So in any case, that went on, on and on.</span> <span id="s3870">She did her job, and she was coming every day, and when she needed some favors to help the girls from Belgium, she had an easy -- easy approach to us, because we helped her.</span> <span id="s3871">Now -- then, all of a sudden, the day when she escaped, you know that she had malaria, and she used to have attacks from time to time, and we knew that.</span> <span id="s3872">The day when she escaped, same day I we -- she was living on number six barrack, in the barrack where the people from the -- the klidonskcamera, they are living.</span> <span id="s3873">And I went at lunchtime, over to six.</span> <span id="s3874">There was Ava, my friend who lives now in Israel, whose husband I made for -- the sign, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3875">Q: What’s her last name?</span> <span id="s3876">Ava?</span></p> <p><span id="s3877">A: Valansuela is her name now.</span></p> <p><span id="s3878">Q: Uh-huh, alright.</span></p> <p><span id="s3879">A: And I went over with her because I think some of the Poles -- Polish men were coming, and wanted to meet with the girls in my office, I always vacated my office, I d -- I went walking.</span> <span id="s3880">I went over to Ava, to number six.</span> <span id="s3881">Four, five, six, and Ava had a boyfriend, he was visiting her, an Dutch boy, so I didn’t wanted to interfere.</span> <span id="s3882">Then I finally noticed the barrack was totally empty, but -- because they were working in the beglidinskammer the whole barrack, but there was Mala in her bed, and next to her, her boyfriend Edek, standing next to her.</span> <span id="s3883">So I thought she had again her malaria attack, yeah.</span> <span id="s3884">I went over, and went to ask her how she is, here was Edek standing, she seemed to me quite normal, so she had no -- no malaria attack, so I didn’t wanted to interfere.</span> <span id="s3885">He visited her, okay.</span> <span id="s3886">Why she was in bed, I wi -- don’t know.</span> <span id="s3887">In any case, I left.</span> <span id="s3888">An hour later, the siren went on.</span> <span id="s3889">That was the last moment before she escaped, I may have been the last person who ever spoke to her, yeah.</span> <span id="s3890">Now, s -- they were caught, there are several stories, but it is true that she had a malaria attack during her ordeal, and while escaping, and he panicked, and went to the village doctor.</span> <span id="s3891">And that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3892">Q: And the doctor told on them?</span></p> <p><span id="s3893">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s3894">Q: The doctor contacted the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s3895">A: So the rest is history.</span></p> <p><span id="s3896">Q: But what’s the --</span></p> <p><span id="s3897">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s3898">Q: -- from -- from your perspective, the different stories about what happened afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s3899">A: What stories do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s3900">Q: There -- there stories that she -- when she was going to be hung, she had a razor blade, and she had cut herself.</span></p> <p><span id="s3901">A: That is true.</span> <span id="s3902">She had the razor blade from Herta -- Herta Rote, who was another lifer, who’s dead by now, and she cut herself.</span></p> <p><span id="s3903">Q: And this was before they took her to be hung?</span></p> <p><span id="s3904">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3905">Q: When she was --</span></p> <p><span id="s3906">A: She wasn’t hung.</span></p> <p><span id="s3907">Q: She wasn’t hung?</span></p> <p><span id="s3908">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s3909">They wanted to hang her, she cut herself.</span> <span id="s3910">According -- you see, I always avoided anything like being present.</span> <span id="s3911">Everybody had to come and to witness that, the whole camp.</span> <span id="s3912">And I locked myself up in my drawing office, nobody could see me, that I am there, and I never went to the execution, yeah.</span> <span id="s3913">And so I cannot tell you what really happened, but according to the others, she cut herself, she was supplied by Herta Rote with an razor blade, and Mandel -- see, according to the people, she was hitting Mandel with her bloody hand in her face.</span> <span id="s3914">Then she was ordered -- then -- then the Hauptchafuehrer Maul, ordered her to carry her into the crematorium, where she was shot by him, and that was it.</span> <span id="s3915">Then the father of the -- Edek was brought in from an village, was hanged in front of his son, and then he was hanged.</span> <span id="s3916">So that was an badly planned escape.</span> <span id="s3917">That was selfishness.</span> <span id="s3918">She put so many people into -- into trouble, and lost her life.</span> <span id="s3919">And she could have survived easily, like all us, and could have led a normal life.</span> <span id="s3920">She had an boyfriend at home that she abandoned for Edek.</span> <span id="s3921">I don’t think she was very clever.</span></p> <p><span id="s3922">Q: What year was that?</span> <span id="s3923">When did she --</span></p> <p><span id="s3924">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s3925">Q: What year was that when she escaped?</span></p> <p><span id="s3926">A: ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s3927">Q: ’44, and she arrived there in ’43?</span></p> <p><span id="s3928">A: Ah, wait a minute, what are you talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s3929">Q: When did Mala arrive in Auschwitz, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s3930">A: Arrive?</span></p> <p><span id="s3931">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3932">A: Ah, ’40 -- ’43.</span> <span id="s3933">End -- no, end of ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s3934">Q: End of ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s3935">A: End of ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s3936">Q: And this was the summer of ’44 when she escaped?</span></p> <p><span id="s3937">A: Escaped, yeah.</span> <span id="s3938">But I would not like to bring Mala in at all, because everybody writes about Mala, Mala, so let’s everybody -- I -- I have -- I knew her on the first day she arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s3939">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3940">A: I spoke to her the last hour before she left, yeah?</span> <span id="s3941">That is all I rem -- will -- want to remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s3942">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3943">Tell me about Rosa Robbat.</span> <span id="s3944">What was she like?</span></p> <p><span id="s3945">A: A normal girl.</span> <span id="s3946">Very clever, very shrewd, and s -- again, as they had no Polish Jewish girls in the camp office whatsoever, they had a hard time to help each other to get -- Polish Jewish girls had no good positions because of that.</span> <span id="s3947">So, there were some work details which were better.</span> <span id="s3948">For example, the work details, indoor work details, yeah.</span> <span id="s3949">Pretty good, and [indecipherable] the Polish girls could be accommodated.</span> <span id="s3950">Rosa helped -- tried to help them through me, yeah.</span> <span id="s3951">She made contact with me, and whenever she needed something, she approached me, and I helped her.</span> <span id="s3952">But sh -- I was never recruited by her for anything else, yeah.</span> <span id="s3953">We had an entire different relationship.</span> <span id="s3954">She knows -- she had what she wanted from me, I had what I wanted from her.</span> <span id="s3955">I -- She organized for me all my underpanties, and all the ma -- bowls of -- rolls of material to make, quickly, handkerchiefs for your head, to cover when newcomers arrived, especially from my city, in the lase -- late autumn, ’44.</span> <span id="s3956">She brought me a lot of material when I could go to the barrack, and supply the people, they never received -- it was cold, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3957">They never received any covers, so there where she helped me, and she helped me to steal from the clothing barrack, whatever -- whatever I needed, and I helped her by placing people, whenever she asked me.</span> <span id="s3958">Then, that’s about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3959">Q: But what about the aprons, didn’t she --</span></p> <p><span id="s3960">A: Well, shall I tell you the story?</span></p> <p><span id="s3961">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3962">A: Did I told you the story already?</span></p> <p><span id="s3963">Q: I think you did.</span> <span id="s3964">I think on the phone once, you told me some of it, but I --</span></p> <p><span id="s3965">A: Yeah, she brought me s -- always a custom tailored aprons, of -- so I accepted that, because we were -- that was very fashionable in the camp office, to have over your dress a nice apron, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3966">Q: A regular -- like a kitchen apron?</span></p> <p><span id="s3967">A: No, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s3968">Q: No [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3969">A: -- nicely -- nicely tailored.</span></p> <p><span id="s3970">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s3971">A: Yeah, they were pretty.</span> <span id="s3972">I maybe have to make one to sketch how they look like.</span> <span id="s3973">And from time to time she was coming pretty frequent to exchange, bought me a new one, took the old one.</span> <span id="s3974">And I always begged her, I don’t need more aprons, and leave me the one.</span> <span id="s3975">“No, I want you to have it.”</span> <span id="s3976">So, by now I am -- I was -- and later on, when all that happened, I was suspicious if they didn’t -- if she did not use me as an carrier of her -- of her -- of her smuggled stuff, because I remember later on that the aprons had one -- were nicely sewn, but at the end, they had something like that, yeah, two or three seams at -- at the end of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s3977">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3978">A: And it could have been here inside --</span></p> <p><span id="s3979">Q: Side.</span></p> <p><span id="s3980">A: -- that she’s -- was hiding stuff, because she supplied those I -- aprons to several people who were in high positions, yeah, probably knowing that nobody’s going to -- to check their -- their belongings what they wear.</span> <span id="s3981">And that’s the way -- I have never spoke to anybody about it, but that must have been the reason, yeah?</span> <span id="s3982">And among others, she used me, too.</span> <span id="s3983">So, what can I tell you?</span> <span id="s3984">Then she collected the apron, and brought me a new one.</span> <span id="s3985">So she -- I don’t know what -- she collected probably the one which was full of stuff, and brought me one empty.</span> <span id="s3986">And that’s how she worked, because for what reason she brought me aprons?</span></p> <p><span id="s3987">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3988">Many --</span></p> <p><span id="s3989">A: Can you imagine?</span> <span id="s3990">Huh?</span> <span id="s3991">Then I have found an -- a woman, I still have to look for it, in Australia, who brought an story that she had -- she was sewing aprons for -- for -- for Rosa.</span> <span id="s3992">Special ones, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3993">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s3994">Were you surprised when they were captured, the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3995">A: When she was captured?</span></p> <p><span id="s3996">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3997">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3998">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3999">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s4000">Q: Did you have -- you -- you be -- you were already suspicious that she was doing something?</span></p> <p><span id="s4001">A: No, I was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s4002">Q: You weren’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s4003">A: I was not, no.</span> <span id="s4004">I was not.</span> <span id="s4005">We had -- she was among those people I like, and we had nice chats together, but she never recruited me, also.</span> <span id="s4006">She asked me for favors, I asked her for favors, but that was normal business, like to help the people, yeah.</span> <span id="s4007">And it -- because she has -- I knew that there are no Polish Jewish girls in the camp office, so I gladly helped her out.</span></p> <p><span id="s4008">Q: Now why was that the case?</span> <span id="s4009">Why were there no Polish Jewish girls in the camp office?</span></p> <p><span id="s4010">A: Because the camp office had a lot of Pole -- Poles, non-Jews.</span> <span id="s4011">Camp office, and the arbatz einsatz, yeah, and the rest were Slovakian girls.</span> <span id="s4012">We were there before the Poles, before the Polish Jews, and the Poles were more or less simultaneously coming with us around the same time.</span> <span id="s4013">So, we have occupied the good places, while the Poles -- Polish girls had no German knowledge, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4014">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s4015">A: That was among others there mi [indecipherable] their disadvantage.</span></p> <p><span id="s4016">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4017">A: And that’s about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s4018">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s4019">A: There’s no more to add.</span> <span id="s4020">Everything else is speculation and is blow -- blow -- blown up into something so that people can write.</span> <span id="s4021">But Rosa Robbata was an ordinary girl, who just did what she felt is important, and she did it skillfully, and I don’t know how she gots -- how she -- how she was caught.</span> <span id="s4022">That I’ll never found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s4023">Q: Okay, we’re at the end of tape number six, side B End of Tape Six, Side B Beginning Tape Seven, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s4024">Q: -- Memorial Museum interview with Helen Tichauer on September eighth, year 2000, conducted by Joan Ringleheim, this is side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s4025">A: May I ask you something?</span></p> <p><span id="s4026">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s4027">A: Do you really s -- remember that everybody ignored me at the first meeting that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s4028">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s4029">A: Because I never had the feeling that I was ignored, I just have taken the people how they are, but I didn’t know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s4030">Q: No, that -- that meeting, 20 -- I don’t know when it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s4031">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4032">Q: -- 20 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s4033">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4034">Q: It’s my recollection, but it’s not that clear, but there’s some recollection that you said a few things, but people didn’t want to pay any attention.</span> <span id="s4035">That’s my ere -- that’s my recollection.</span></p> <p><span id="s4036">A: Who were the people with the --</span></p> <p><span id="s4037">Q: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s4038">A: Did -- wait a minute, do you mean the other people, or you mean Einstan the lecturer?</span></p> <p><span id="s4039">Q: The lecturer, and the other people I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s4040">It didn’t seem to me that people were able --</span></p> <p><span id="s4041">A: Understood.</span></p> <p><span id="s4042">Q: Understood what you were saying, and were able to concentrate on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s4043">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s4044">So that was their bad luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s4045">Q: That’s right, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s4046">A: What about you?</span></p> <p><span id="s4047">Q: I don’t remember me.</span> <span id="s4048">I probably didn’t know what to make of anything.</span> <span id="s4049">I don’t -- I don’t remember it, Sippy, I really don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s4050">A: I --</span></p> <p><span id="s4051">Q: So let me ask you this.</span> <span id="s4052">I’m going to continue what you just said to me when we were off the tape.</span> <span id="s4053">When -- when Anna Polarchik was being interviewed, she made some statement that she thought you were in the underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s4054">A: It’s on her interview, in Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s4055">Q: Right, right, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4056">A: Not she thinks, she is sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s4057">Q: She’s sure.</span> <span id="s4058">Okay.</span> <span id="s4059">So what -- what is it about what you were doing that would make somebody think that -- that you might have been in --</span></p> <p><span id="s4060">A: I had an daily visitor, and that was a man, an Pole, who was known -- who was the only man who was living in the women’s camp.</span> <span id="s4061">And his name was En -- Hen -- Henyek Borepsky.</span> <span id="s4062">Henyek Borepsky was the official electrician, who was in charge of checking the wirings, electric wiring, all over the whole area.</span> <span id="s4063">Henyek Borepsky was the one who buried s -- many of the Jewish and non-Jewish reports the people wrote in all their languages, in -- who buried that during our stay there, and then after the war, made it possible to un-bury the stuff.</span> <span id="s4064">We have more stuff, the information we had after the war, thanks to him, and due to him.</span> <span id="s4065">Now, he isn’t -- he isn’t quoted in most of the literature by important historians, like Lunkbine mentioned him too, but he is described very well in the book by -- called “Fighting Auschwitz,” yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s4066">Q: By Garlinsky.</span></p> <p><span id="s4067">A: As he visited me every day, she didn’t know what business he has to do with me, yeah?</span> <span id="s4068">Who am -- what -- otherwise he -- there was no love affair, he was not my boyfriend.</span> <span id="s4069">He was just visiting me, and she doesn’t know what we -- what business we had to do, except he was the representative of the top man, who was leading the Polish underground, yeah?</span> <span id="s4070">So that why she suspected me, I must have had something to do with them.</span> <span id="s4071">That’s all.</span> <span id="s4072">And he asked me for hundred thousand things to do for him, and I never have asked any questions, I did it.</span> <span id="s4073">So, I probably worked for the Polish underground without know -- I knew I worked for somebody, or I did things for somebody, but I have not ask any questions.</span> <span id="s4074">That was an very basic rule, if you do something, either you do it or not, and if you are doing it, don’t ask questions, because what you know -- you should never know, in case you were caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s4075">Q: So why -- why -- were there people that you refused to do things for?</span> <span id="s4076">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s4077">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s4078">Q: So you trusted -- is it because the right kind of people came to you, and you trusted them?</span></p> <p><span id="s4079">A: Because it was very hard to approach me.</span></p> <p><span id="s4080">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s4081">A: For men.</span> <span id="s4082">So -- you could not enter the camp office just like that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4083">Q: So who --</span></p> <p><span id="s4084">A: And -- and you had no -- and people I have not known of through -- even if not talking to each other, but there were, in certain jobs established -- for example, I’ll give you another example.</span> <span id="s4085">You know Gerovitch?</span></p> <p><span id="s4086">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s4087">A: He was an outsider of everything.</span> <span id="s4088">He was an Bundist, but there was one leader of the -- of the Bundists, whom he mentioned in his interview, and that was Nonyek.</span> <span id="s4089">Nonyek was an French and Polish Jew who was coming from France.</span> <span id="s4090">Later on, he became an medical student, after the war, and practiced medicine.</span> <span id="s4091">But it was Nonyek whom was one day arrived to the camp office, straightforward to me, and said, “Sippy, I need the figures of French women, how many arrived up til now, and how many are still alive.”</span> <span id="s4092">Now, I could have told him, “Why do you ask me, ask somebody else,” yeah?</span> <span id="s4093">But I had access.</span> <span id="s4094">He researched me before he came.</span> <span id="s4095">I had access to everything, because I designed the card totake, yeah.</span> <span id="s4096">So I --</span></p> <p><span id="s4097">Q: Designed the what?</span></p> <p><span id="s4098">A: The card totake.</span> <span id="s4099">The types of cardex.</span></p> <p><span id="s4100">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s4101">A: I designed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s4102">Q: Yeah, I know, but you just use -- you used a word, what’s that word?</span> <span id="s4103">Cardatteck?</span></p> <p><span id="s4104">A: Cardex is an --</span></p> <p><span id="s4105">Q: Cardex.</span></p> <p><span id="s4106">A: Cardex.</span></p> <p><span id="s4107">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s4108">So he knew that?</span></p> <p><span id="s4109">A: I knew that -- I knew -- they knew that I -- I can have the access to it, because nobody would have questioned me, what are you doing there, right?</span> <span id="s4110">So, I -- and two minutes later, I was coming with the answer.</span> <span id="s4111">After all, I had constant reports of certain things, I told you that I did the diagrams and so on, so I didn’t -- I knew exactly w-w-what to look for, and where to look for, and quickly, so that -- because there could have been any time, somebody coming from the SS, and so on.</span> <span id="s4112">But we always had some people out at the door entrance to watch out.</span> <span id="s4113">In any case, Nonyek arrived, and asked me for information.</span> <span id="s4114">He got the information, which he reported afterwards, but I couldn’t care less how, and to whom.</span> <span id="s4115">But I know through Gerovitch now, in his interview, that Nonyek was the leader of the Bund, okay?</span> <span id="s4116">So that what I’m trying to tell you.</span> <span id="s4117">I haven’t ask him what do you need that for?</span> <span id="s4118">When I noticed he was coming with something important, of question, he got his answer.</span> <span id="s4119">And that’s how I worked.</span> <span id="s4120">Whoever was coming with important questions, he got his [indecipherable] he got the right answer.</span> <span id="s4121">I don’t know what I did, and to whom I was giving, and how much I did, yeah?</span> <span id="s4122">Or that Henyek, what he have asked me, is hard to believe, but that’s an whole story, you have to -- to -- Henyek was always asking me impossible things.</span></p> <p><span id="s4123">Q: Like what?</span></p> <p><span id="s4124">A: To -- to a shell of an watch, yeah.</span> <span id="s4125">And t-to write down doxsa, that was an trademark.</span> <span id="s4126">I said, “Henyek, you can get at Canada, as many doxsas you want.</span> <span id="s4127">Why do you want me to write on that particular watch, which is empty inside, doxsa?”</span> <span id="s4128">“Just do it.”</span> <span id="s4129">That what he said.</span> <span id="s4130">Now, what he did afterwards with that, if they have smuggled something in the container, if that was just to recognize that it is an different doxsa, because my writing and my -- must have been different than the original print.</span> <span id="s4131">But then, from then on, he was coming with similar mishugas, yeah, to do for him, and I did it.</span> <span id="s4132">I never asked any questions.</span> <span id="s4133">But I know that not only that I did something valuable, I have been protected by the Polish underground, just like they protected them -- themself, and their agents.</span> <span id="s4134">That what I know.</span> <span id="s4135">I really made my office available for their get together, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4136">Q: So you would leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s4137">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s4138">Q: You would leave, they would come in and you would leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s4139">A: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s4140">Q: When they got together, you left the office?</span></p> <p><span id="s4141">A: I left the office.</span> <span id="s4142">At -- I was running all the time around the camp, and [indecipherable] thought I’m a runner.</span></p> <p><span id="s4143">Q: So did they -- did they just come in and say --</span></p> <p><span id="s4144">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s4145">The first time when they were coming, and all the women from everywhere were coming, the first time in, they said, “Sippy, leave us alone.”</span> <span id="s4146">I did that, and when they co -- were coming afterwards, and I left by myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s4147">Q: They didn’t have to ask you.</span></p> <p><span id="s4148">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s4149">Q: They didn’t have to ask you.</span></p> <p><span id="s4150">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s4151">Q: So in what ways did they protect you?</span></p> <p><span id="s4152">A: What can I tell you, in what way.</span> <span id="s4153">They -- they were watching out I should -- nobody should do any harm to me, yeah.</span> <span id="s4154">They watched -- look, th-th-that -- they were an very close-knit group of Polish officers, and their wives, but I belong -- I was one of them, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s4155">Q: Tell me how your reputation got into the men’s camp.</span> <span id="s4156">Irwin said he knew who --</span></p> <p><span id="s4157">A: Into what?</span></p> <p><span id="s4158">Q: Into the men’s camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s4159">A: My reputation?</span></p> <p><span id="s4160">Q: Yes, because Irwin said one day when I was here, “I knew who Sippy was.”</span></p> <p><span id="s4161">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s4162">Q: I knew who Sippy was.</span></p> <p><span id="s4163">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s4164">Q: Before she -- before he met you.</span></p> <p><span id="s4165">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s4166">Oh, that was different.</span> <span id="s4167">I tell you.</span> <span id="s4168">One nice day, Hessler was coming, and said, “Sippy, we are going to transfer you, I have now taken over some -- some duties at the onione factory.”</span> <span id="s4169">I, Hessler.</span></p> <p><span id="s4170">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s4171">A: “And we are going to transfer a -- you to the onione as technical draftswoman.”</span> <span id="s4172">I said, “But I was not trained as an technical draftswoman.</span> <span id="s4173">I’m a graphic artist.”</span> <span id="s4174">He said to me, “The way how I know you, you know everything.”</span> <span id="s4175">That what Hessler said to me.</span> <span id="s4176">So, I didn’t know, but Irwin told me afterwards, while we were married, what happened.</span> <span id="s4177">S -- Hessler was coming, and explained to the civilian engineers there, “We are -- we are -- we are going to get now a woman, a draftswoman.</span> <span id="s4178">She’s very peculiar, very exact, very moody.</span> <span id="s4179">Empty fund room for her, bring in instruments, bring in everything.</span> <span id="s4180">She will be as -- from now on, your draftswoman.</span> <span id="s4181">And Irwin is going to supervise her.”</span></p> <p><span id="s4182">Q: So, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s4183">A: I was fighting, hiding behind Katya, and Drexel, that I don’t want to go.</span> <span id="s4184">And they were winning.</span> <span id="s4185">I didn’t had to go.</span> <span id="s4186">And I never arrived to the onione.</span> <span id="s4187">Good.</span> <span id="s4188">So he knew that I exist, but he didn’t know that -- who I am, yeah.</span> <span id="s4189">Just a woman, a draftswoman.</span></p> <p><span id="s4190">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s4191">But he knew your name?</span></p> <p><span id="s4192">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4193">Q: Sippy.</span></p> <p><span id="s4194">A: Good.</span> <span id="s4195">Now -- then Mengele was coming.</span> <span id="s4196">He wanted me as an draftswoman when he heard about me, as a microscopic draftswoman.</span> <span id="s4197">There I was fighting again.</span> <span id="s4198">I am not -- I wasn’t trained as an microscopic draftswoman.</span> <span id="s4199">But we will find for you somebody, and we have found for him -- what is her name?</span> <span id="s4200">That woman who is now fli -- claiming her work?</span></p> <p><span id="s4201">Q: Whoop, the phone.</span> <span id="s4202">We’re back.</span> <span id="s4203">That was the fax, not the phone.</span></p> <p><span id="s4204">A: So, that why Irwin knew about me.</span> <span id="s4205">I stayed at the camp office, and that was it.</span> <span id="s4206">But we wanted to talk about something else.</span> <span id="s4207">You were just s -- putting in -- in that Irwin business.</span> <span id="s4208">What was the next question?</span></p> <p><span id="s4209">Q: No, I was asking you about the requests that people made.</span></p> <p><span id="s4210">A: About what people’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s4211">Q: What people were asking you to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s4212">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s4213">Several -- several things.</span> <span id="s4214">No people.</span> <span id="s4215">I have been working for the French Bund, through Nonyek, and fr -- for the Poles.</span></p> <p><span id="s4216">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s4217">No, I guess it was because you were talking about the Poles, and I was ask -- then asking you how did Irwin hear about you.</span> <span id="s4218">And that’s -- and that’s how --</span></p> <p><span id="s4219">A: Oh, right, but that how, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s4220">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4221">A: Because that was just an one ti -- time when he was fighting for my transfer --</span></p> <p><span id="s4222">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4223">A: -- but lost, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s4224">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s4225">That’s such a co -- funny coincidence, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s4226">A: Yeah, it’s an funny coincidence.</span> <span id="s4227">You know, the prostitutes in the onione, who were the foreman, some German women, Irwin told me even made fun out of me.</span> <span id="s4228">They said, “Look, that woman, she makes -- she goes on the -- you -- you know, in German, mangeet umstreesh.</span> <span id="s4229">If you are an prostitute, you are going where the stripe is marked, and that is called -- I don’t know in English, if -- if they use the word, the stripe --</span></p> <p><span id="s4230">Q: You mean on the road?</span></p> <p><span id="s4231">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s4232">For prostitutes, they -- they are not allowed to cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s4233">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s4234">A: But in Germany, it’s a stree -- mangeet umstreesh, yeah?</span> <span id="s4235">Mangeet umstreesh.</span> <span id="s4236">Now, I painted the stripes.</span></p> <p><span id="s4237">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4238">A: And then [indecipherable] then she made her numbers, yeah?</span> <span id="s4239">And th-that was an joke, but it was true.</span> <span id="s4240">Look, there was humor in Auschwitz, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s4241">Q: Yes, I understand.</span> <span id="s4242">Tell me something about revenge.</span></p> <p><span id="s4243">A: Revenge?</span></p> <p><span id="s4244">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s4245">Or let -- I can put it more simply.</span> <span id="s4246">If there were kapos, or blockeltestes, or other prisoners, who were treating other people badly.</span></p> <p><span id="s4247">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4248">Q: You told me a long time ago that you could get people punished.</span> <span id="s4249">Katya could put people on a punishment detail.</span></p> <p><span id="s4250">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s4251">Now, I tell you what we did, and I can tell you that honestly.</span> <span id="s4252">The book of the punishment detail, was kept in the camp office under -- strictly under Katya’s supervision.</span> <span id="s4253">But, as I mentioned before to you, that most book were supplied with plain sheets, only lines, and we had -- I had to put, or designs, or columns necessary for an particular situation, like block books, where we knew how many columns, and for what.</span> <span id="s4254">So where the columns established in that br -- punishment book, where you had the names, numbers, the punishment, the duration from, too, yeah?</span> <span id="s4255">Transferred then and to -- to be released then and then.</span> <span id="s4256">And if there were some of the kapos, or some of the blockelteste, who accidentally, for any reason, had -- have been transferred to the punishment block, if they were lousy, bad people, Katya took the liberty to ask me to extend the duration, okay?</span> <span id="s4257">And that was the only way how we could take revenge on those people.</span> <span id="s4258">Now, that is unofficial, but I’m telling you, that’s what we did.</span> <span id="s4259">And it was good that we could do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s4260">Q: So did -- did people understand that that’s what you were doing to them --</span></p> <p><span id="s4261">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s4262">Q: -- so that -- did people know that this --</span></p> <p><span id="s4263">A: I never menti --</span></p> <p><span id="s4264">Q: I don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s4265">A: -- to whom should I have spoken about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s4266">Q: No, no, no, did they figure it out?</span></p> <p><span id="s4267">A: They?</span></p> <p><span id="s4268">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4269">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s4270">Q: No.</span> <span id="s4271">They didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s4272">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s4273">Q: But you did tell me the story of one woman, who was a kapo, and that you -- somebody planted cigarettes on her, so that she would get caught -- this is what you told me, so see if it recalls --</span></p> <p><span id="s4274">A: I told you this?</span></p> <p><span id="s4275">Q: You told me this.</span> <span id="s4276">She was sent to a punishment detail.</span></p> <p><span id="s4277">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4278">Q: And then she came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s4279">A: And?</span></p> <p><span id="s4280">Q: And she said she wanted her old job back.</span> <span id="s4281">And Katya, or somebody said to her, “We’ll give you the old job back, but if you start doing what you did before,” I don’t know what sort of a threat there was, but there was a threat.</span> <span id="s4282">Do you have any recollection?</span></p> <p><span id="s4283">A: It’s too -- I would have, if you would explain that the way I said it.</span></p> <p><span id="s4284">Q: Well, I’ll go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s4285">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4286">Q: I will find -- I will find --</span></p> <p><span id="s4287">A: Find -- find --</span></p> <p><span id="s4288">Q: -- how I put it down.</span></p> <p><span id="s4289">A: That’s better.</span></p> <p><span id="s4290">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s4291">A: But I have to check my -- my fax.</span></p> <p><span id="s4292">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s4293">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s4294">A: Wait a minute, you have to take that off?</span></p> <p><span id="s4295">Q: We’re going to stop -- we’re going to stop for a moment.</span> <span id="s4296">All right, we’re now back from our little break, there was no fax.</span> <span id="s4297">And at a later time, we’ll go back to this example, and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s4298">A: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s4299">Q: -- maybe you can explain -- you can explain more.</span> <span id="s4300">Was -- were there any instances where you could denounce an SS?</span> <span id="s4301">So n --</span></p> <p><span id="s4302">A: N-No.</span></p> <p><span id="s4303">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s4304">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s4305">Q: If an -- if an SS was having an a -- a German was having an affair with a Jewish woman, could that be -- it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s4306">A: Could be.</span> <span id="s4307">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4308">Q: Rarely, but it would happen.</span> <span id="s4309">He was in great danger, wasn’t he?</span></p> <p><span id="s4310">A: Yeah, very great.</span></p> <p><span id="s4311">Q: Why did they do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s4312">A: Why do people --</span></p> <p><span id="s4313">Q: Do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s4314">A: -- kill each other?</span> <span id="s4315">They’re in danger too, to be locked up, and they are doing it.</span> <span id="s4316">That I cannot answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s4317">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s4318">And there were no instances that you knew of an S --</span></p> <p><span id="s4319">A: Why that Jewish woman was falling in love with an SS man, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s4320">Q: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4321">A: Why did she do it?</span> <span id="s4322">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s4323">Q: Were there any instances of the -- of an SS man who fell in love with a Jewish woman, or who had an affair with a Jewish woman where the -- he was denounced?</span> <span id="s4324">Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s4325">A: Balitch.</span></p> <p><span id="s4326">Q: Balitch?</span></p> <p><span id="s4327">A: And Katya.</span> <span id="s4328">Stupid woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s4329">Q: Edick?</span></p> <p><span id="s4330">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s4331">Q: Th-The man that she was with?</span></p> <p><span id="s4332">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4333">Q: Was an SS?</span> <span id="s4334">He wasn’t a prisoner?</span> <span id="s4335">Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s4336">I guess I should have known that.</span> <span id="s4337">At so -- at some point you said to me that the SS were afraid of Katya, is that true?</span></p> <p><span id="s4338">A: Everybody was afraid of her because she had such influence on the top management, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4339">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s4340">And why was she so respected?</span></p> <p><span id="s4341">A: Because she was clever.</span> <span id="s4342">She did a good job, and nobody could fool her, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4343">Q: How --</span></p> <p><span id="s4344">A: And her --</span></p> <p><span id="s4345">Q: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s4346">A: Fool her.</span></p> <p><span id="s4347">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4348">A: And she -- her job, not only that she helped herself and some fellow inmate, but she pretended to help the SS, but she did not, yeah.</span> <span id="s4349">She was very, very, very skillful, and -- by manipulating the whole business, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4350">Q: Was she your age?</span></p> <p><span id="s4351">A: Younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s4352">Q: Younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s4353">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4354">Q: So how younger was --</span></p> <p><span id="s4355">A: One year younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s4356">Q: So that made her what, when you entered Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s4357">A: Wh-When she entered the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s4358">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4359">A: For -- I was born in ’18, and entered ’42.</span> <span id="s4360">I was 23 when I entered.</span></p>

Uh ha ha.</span> <span id="s4366">You said to me that --</span></p> <p><span id="s4367">A: What I said now comes -- now I am getting -- going through the mill --</span></p> <p><span id="s4368">Q: You’re right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4369">A: -- like -- like an interrogation, like an judge, or like an prosecutor.</span></p> <p><span id="s4370">Q: No, I just want more information.</span></p> <p><span id="s4371">A: You said -- no.</span></p> <p><span id="s4372">Q: I just want you to know that that’s where I’m getting it from --</span></p> <p><span id="s4373">A: I know.</span> <span id="s4374">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s4375">Q: -- first.</span> <span id="s4376">Okay.</span> <span id="s4377">You said that by the -- actually, Irwin said the same thing to me, that the beatings -- the regularity of beatings of prisoners stopped in ’40 -- stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s4378">A: What stopped?</span></p> <p><span id="s4379">Q: Beatings.</span> <span id="s4380">The regular beatings.</span></p> <p><span id="s4381">A: Ah, beating, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4382">Q: Beating, the prisoners stopped by the end of 1943.</span> <span id="s4383">Now this is what Irwin said.</span></p> <p><span id="s4384">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s4385">Q: Irwin said the SS found it more convenient to steal things, than to beat prisoners.</span> <span id="s4386">That’s what he said.</span> <span id="s4387">But you said that while it was a standard for the dignitaries, the Germans when they came in, to watch beatings at first.</span></p> <p><span id="s4388">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s4389">Q: Once you had the model, they came into the office, and your office was a -- a their entertainment.</span></p> <p><span id="s4390">A: A showcase, a showcase,</span></p> <p><span id="s4391">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s4392">All of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s4393">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s4394">Q: All of it.</span> <span id="s4395">Your tools, your model, everything was a showcase for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s4396">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4397">Q: And they didn’t mind that that was a substitute?</span> <span id="s4398">They didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s4399">A: They didn’t know.</span> <span id="s4400">They didn’t know, because they were not there before, yeah.</span> <span id="s4401">And they haven’t asked for anything.</span> <span id="s4402">So they -- they haven’t asked to per -- to perform the beating.</span></p> <p><span id="s4403">Q: Beatings, right.</span> <span id="s4404">So who deci -- I mean, wha -- I know this is -- sounds like stupid question.</span></p> <p><span id="s4405">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s4406">Q: But, why would they bring in these people, and then what they show them is the beating?</span></p> <p><span id="s4407">A: Because that is --</span></p> <p><span id="s4408">Q: Power?</span></p> <p><span id="s4409">A: -- SS mentality, yeah.</span> <span id="s4410">That how we deal with our prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s4411">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s4412">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s4413">A: Cruelty was -- cruelty was introduced as an -- as an skill, and an so-called science.</span> <span id="s4414">It was part of their daily -- daily routine.</span></p> <p><span id="s4415">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4416">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4417">Q: So let -- I don’t know if you know the answer to this question.</span></p> <p><span id="s4418">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s4419">Q: But when they would do those beatings --</span></p> <p><span id="s4420">A: Yeah, uh-huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s4421">Q: -- those public beatings, were they simply picking anybody, or th --</span></p> <p><span id="s4422">A: No, no, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s4423">Q: -- or these were really punishment --</span></p> <p><span id="s4424">A: [indecipherable] it was part of --</span></p> <p><span id="s4425">Q: -- for partic -- something particular.</span></p> <p><span id="s4426">A: They were punishment -- look, there were prisoners who were sent over from prison, or from other camps, with an order to receive 25 beats, or 12, or 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s4427">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4428">A: It was part of their -- of their punishment to receive, and they were keeping that for the visitors, to -- to demonstrate how they are doing it, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s4429">Q: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4430">A: And that’s gone crazy, and crazy, and there was an doctor present, and when the people collapsed, they were brought to the hospital compound, yeah.</span> <span id="s4431">And they were mainly non-Jewish prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s4432">Q: Who were beaten?</span></p> <p><span id="s4433">A: Because they knew where -- ba -- mainly non-Jewish prisoners, because they were coming through an police station, or through another jail, or through -- or sentenced by an judge to -- to receive the beating, yeah.</span> <span id="s4434">They were mostly non-Jewish prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s4435">Q: Did you observe these beatings?</span></p> <p><span id="s4436">A: No, you could -- it was never an open -- open -- open show.</span> <span id="s4437">There were always dignitaries there of the camp dignitaries, or -- I was not a camp dignitary, or some SS people.</span></p> <p><span id="s4438">Q: So they --</span></p> <p><span id="s4439">A: And sometimes the camp dignitaries had to do the beating.</span> <span id="s4440">And if the beating were not done properly hard, then the same dignitary was put on the -- on the -- that type of tool -- not tool, an desk, or whatever it -- I must show you one day how it looked.</span> <span id="s4441">And he was beaten, or she was beaten by somebody else.</span> <span id="s4442">So, it was quite an s -- science, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4443">Q: So they didn’t use it in order to show the rest of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s4444">A: Oh no.</span></p> <p><span id="s4445">Q: To frighten anyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s4446">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s4447">Q: No, this was really a internal show.</span></p> <p><span id="s4448">A: It was mainly done inside of an building.</span></p> <p><span id="s4449">Q: I see, I see.</span> <span id="s4450">Okay, Sip.</span></p> <p><span id="s4451">A: What else?</span></p> <p><span id="s4452">Q: I th -- I think for today, I’m finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s4453">A: You are finished, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s4454">Q: And so are you.</span> <span id="s4455">So this is the end of tape number seven, on -- tape nu -- tape number seven, side A, on September eighth, 2000, with Sippy Tichauer.</span></p> <p><span id="s4456">End
