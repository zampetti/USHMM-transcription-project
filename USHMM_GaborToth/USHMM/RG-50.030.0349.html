JACQUES GODEL</span></p> <p><span id="s10">August 28, 1995 QUESTION: Where you were born.</span> <span id="s11">Date of birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">ANSWER: My name is Jaques Godel.</span> <span id="s13">I was born October the 9th, 1924, in Paris, France.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: Tell me a little bit about your familyyour family and your life before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: My father was born in Romania in 1894 and he left Romania in 1910.</span> <span id="s16">And on his way to America he stopped in Paris and stayed there.</span> <span id="s17">And after World War Ihe was in the French Foreign Legion during World War Ihe went back to Romania, married my mother, took her to Paris.</span> <span id="s18">And so I was born in Paris, my sister was born in Paris.</span> <span id="s19">And before the war, life wasthe life of Jewish immigrants in Francetolerated.</span> <span id="s20">I wouldn't say affluent, but well‑to‑do.</span> <span id="s21">Until the recession.</span> <span id="s22">And we didn't have major problems in terms of intolerance and suspicion of being a foreigner until really the midlate 30's.</span> <span id="s23">Very, very shortly before the war.</span> <span id="s24">Very shortly.</span> <span id="s25">And that came about, of course, with in Germany.</span> <span id="s26">And athe beginning of, or maybe the renewal of French Nationalism, which was very strong during the Dreyfus (ph.) business.</span> <span id="s27">Of course, I was not there.</span> <span id="s28">My father was not there either, but we knew a lot of people who lived through those times, and I believe that was the seed of what we felt after that.</span> <span id="s29">That Dreyfus business wasis still very important in France, but in the 30's, Dreyfus was still alive, of course.</span> <span id="s30">The controversy around his name was really the trigger for the French Nationalism.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Did you live in a Jewish community, or were you necessarily integrated into the general</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: No, we neverwe never lived in awell, the Jewish community in Paris was essentially the , that'sthat is on the right bank of Paris near the Hotel there, that's where you find all the kosher butchers, and where you buy your matzo for Pesach and where they have the traditional synagogues and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">But other than that area, the Jews were kind of scattered until the 30's or so, when they started to get together in and the Follies Bergere, yes.</span> <span id="s34">But, no, we were scattered.</span> <span id="s35">We were scattered.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Was your family religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: No.</span> <span id="s38">No.</span> <span id="s39">No.</span> <span id="s40">Just like so many Jewish families before the war, religion was notall our friendsreligion was not an importantwell, weyoung people would beyesrespect it, but we would get gifts at Christmas.</span> <span id="s41">And we had bread for Pesach.</span> <span id="s42">We had matzo and bread at the same time on the table.</span> <span id="s43">We ate pork.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">So we were very .</span> <span id="s45">And all our friends were the same.</span> <span id="s46">But weculturally, we were very, very Jewish.</span> <span id="s47">Very Jewish.</span> <span id="s48">There were still many Jewish activities going on in Paris and very strong Yiddish theater.</span> <span id="s49">And we grew up with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">There were five or six stages where you could go and have a nice afternoon or evening with Yiddish theater.</span> <span id="s51">There were friends of mine who were Scouts and the Scout movementthe Jewish Scout movement.</span> <span id="s52">There were Zionist groups.</span> <span id="s53">There were Socialist groups, part of more or less the Bund.</span> <span id="s54">And so religion was not very important and that always was a point of friction when my grandfather visited from Romania.</span> <span id="s55">He was very religious.</span> <span id="s56">It was always a point of friction with my family, because he wanted a kosher plate and couldn't find it, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Did you go to school with the French Catholics?</span> <span id="s58">Did you mix socially?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Oh, II went to schoolmy first schoolmymywas kindergarten.</span> <span id="s60">That was with the nuns.</span> <span id="s61">And what, about three, three and a half, or four.</span> <span id="s62">And my sister was born and was really a nuisance so I went to school.</span> <span id="s63">And was very good because I needed the .</span> <span id="s64">And then after that I went to public school.</span> <span id="s65">We had no discriminationwas not beaten by the other kids because I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s66">They nevernever said anything.</span> <span id="s67">No, we were normal kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Did you play with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s70">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s71">Yes.</span> <span id="s72">And they played with me andsure.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: What wasumwhat was your father's business?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: He had a business of interior decoration.</span> <span id="s75">Painting, wallpaper andbut on a large scale in the 30's.</span> <span id="s76">He would re‑do movie theaters, and small factories and stuff like that with deadlines so he had to work at night with a large group of people.</span> <span id="s77">And they were RussianRussian immigrants, those people, who were all first cousin of the Czar, of course, you know.</span> <span id="s78">So it was colorful, it was colorful.</span> <span id="s79">That was, you know, untiluntil the of '35'36.</span> <span id="s80">That was the turning point.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Can we just ask you another question?</span> <span id="s82">You had mentioned Jewish cultural and political activities.</span> <span id="s83">Where you or your family involved in them?</span> <span id="s84">Were you Zionists?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: No.</span> <span id="s86">No.</span> <span id="s87">No.</span> <span id="s88">No.</span> <span id="s89">Wewejust like all the Jewish family we had the blue piggy bank of the where we would put money in it and somebody from the would come once a month and collect that and that would supportthat would support IsraelPalestine at the time.</span> <span id="s90">And we were getting a Jewish paper, .</span> <span id="s91">But thatthat was the extent of itwas the extent.</span> <span id="s92">Justjust having family members and friends with the same background that was ourthat was the extent of our Jewishness.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: You had mentioned, also, Russian immigrants.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Was there a difference in the way Frenchtraditionally French Jewsversus immigrants from otherfrom Eastern Europe were treated in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Oh, those Russians immigrants werewerenone of them are Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s97">Okay.</span> <span id="s98">I misunderstood.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Oh, they were notoh, no, no.</span> <span id="s100">I believe maybe one was Jewish.</span> <span id="s101">I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s102">But all the rest of them werewereI don't know if they werethey werethe White Russians.</span> <span id="s103">Yes.</span> <span id="s104">They were counts, and were really a funny bunch of people.</span> <span id="s105">But they were good workers so my father hired them.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: So in the 30's when Hitler came to power, how aware were you of what was going on in Germany?</span> <span id="s107">Were there refugees coming into Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: The refugees started to come in '38.</span> <span id="s109">Most of the refugees that we saw were from Austria.</span> <span id="s110">And I remember one of themwhose name was Godel alsoand he came to see us and my father helped him.</span> <span id="s111">And we got in touch with him after the war.</span> <span id="s112">He was able to come here to the United States.</span> <span id="s113">And we lost track of himbutand so they told us what was going on.</span> <span id="s114">They told us.</span> <span id="s115">I don't remember being in contact with German Jews, but Austrian Jews, yes.</span> <span id="s116">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: What waswhat was your reaction to this?</span> <span id="s118">This information you were getting?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Uh, well, weI know my parents were very, very upset.</span> <span id="s120">Very, very upset.</span> <span id="s121">And we were looking at Hitler asas a danger.</span> <span id="s122">But at the same time, being in France, you know, the traditional enemy of Germany, the strong French Army.</span> <span id="s123">We felt very secure.</span> <span id="s124">Well, if they move, we're going to leave them and Hitler is going to go back to Bohemia, or wherever he came from.</span> <span id="s125">That was the feeling in France.</span> <span id="s126">Very few people were aware of what happened.</span> <span id="s127">Very few.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: So you weren't particularly threatened?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Wewewe were notnonot by the French, no.</span> <span id="s130">No.</span> <span id="s131">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: But by the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: Germany waswas a danger forfor the world.</span> <span id="s134">People were talking about re‑armament of Germany and so forth, but at the same time, weweas I say, you know, we were feeling that we had the Maginot line protecting us, that the French Army was so strong, that we had the best weapons, and so forth.</span> <span id="s135">And all that propaganda of the French government, trying tonot tryingbutI believe they believed that, themselves, you know.</span> <span id="s136">They believed that, yes, the Maginot line was very strong, that the French engineers were building the best tanks, and building the best airplane, and the French Army was invincible.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">The navy was the second in the world, and so forth.</span> <span id="s138">Soandyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: When did you learn differently?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: At the defeat of France, 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Well, when the French Army collapsed and all of a sudden German soldiers were invading France, that'sthat's when we felt the impact of defeat.</span> <span id="s143">And the danger of an enemy of France and the Jews at the same time.</span> <span id="s144">Soso we were threatened on two aspects.</span> <span id="s145">So it was really a feeling of total despair and fear all of a sudden.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">All of a sudden.</span> <span id="s147">A different reality.</span> <span id="s148">And we had to adjust to that different reality.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Do you remember when the Germans occupied Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Well, we left Paris the 10th of June in 1940.</span> <span id="s151">We were among the last to leave Paris.</span> <span id="s152">Everybody was leaving.</span> <span id="s153">Andwell, we were just outside of Paris in that place where we spent the first two years of the war.</span> <span id="s154">And the</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Can you describe to me the German occupation of Paris?</span> <span id="s156">The initialthe first days.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: I was not there.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: I was not there.</span> <span id="s160">No, I can describe the German occupation of Brittanythe first days.</span> <span id="s161">Whereit was about the 15th or 16th of June and we had reached that small place in Brittany.</span> <span id="s162">Peaceful, beautiful medieval town with old, walled medieval town and it was beautiful, beautiful summeroh, spring.</span> <span id="s163">And it was the first time that we really were out sothat far from Paris in a couple of years or so.</span> <span id="s164">And it was very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Very, very nice.</span> <span id="s166">Beautiful landscape and the smell of country.</span> <span id="s167">And so we used to walk in the evening around thatthat small city.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: What's the name of the city?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: .</span> <span id="s170">And in the distance we could seeon the road in the distancemoving side carsmotorcycles.</span> <span id="s171">We could see that in the distance.</span> <span id="s172">And we had seen very few French soldiers in the preceding days.</span> <span id="s173">There were very few French soldiers in that area, practically none.</span> <span id="s174">Were just a few stragglers who were trying to go wherever they could.</span> <span id="s175">And so we sawlate at nightit was almost duskand the color of their uniform was strange.</span> <span id="s176">It was very strange.</span> <span id="s177">So at first we thought they were British soldiers who were trying toto go back to Brest towe were told that the British were re‑embarking that area.</span> <span id="s178">No, they were Germans, and it was absolutely frightening, because they wereI'm sure they were exhausted.</span> <span id="s179">And they were two to a motorcycle.</span> <span id="s180">One was driving and the other one was in the sidecar with a machine gun.</span> <span id="s181">And their face wasthey were blonde andthey werethey had the typical Germans.</span> <span id="s182">And their face covered with the dust of the roadthey were looking absolutelythey were awful.</span> <span id="s183">They were raw, military power.</span> <span id="s184">And of course, I understood that years later, when I was myself in the Army, the people who are sent like that are the best.</span> <span id="s185">They are the people who can analyze a situation and take action and so forth.</span> <span id="s186">So they passed by us, and I remember we were walking by the barracks of the French Gendarmes and it was a hot evening and they had like a balcony at the barracks there with the sign and the flag.</span> <span id="s187">And the wife of one of the Gendarmes there almost collapsed.</span> <span id="s188">She had ashe had a cry.</span> <span id="s189">And they removed the French flag immediately.</span> <span id="s190">They knew whatsoand they disappeared.</span> <span id="s191">And then the next morning, the other came, and they were the Herman Goerring (ph.) division.</span> <span id="s192">And they came with big guns and weapons and so forth.</span> <span id="s193">And they stopped to engage in conversation with us.</span> <span id="s194">AndI'm sure they were under orders to be very friendlyand they were friendly.</span> <span id="s195">They were friendly.</span> <span id="s196">One of them asked me why I was not in the army.</span> <span id="s197">And I told him, "Well, I'm 15."</span> <span id="s198">He said, "Well, in Germany, 15, .</span> <span id="s199">And they were very proud to be member of the Herman Goerring division.</span> <span id="s200">And they were telling us, Well, a week we'll be in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">And after that they left.</span> <span id="s202">I don't know where they went.</span> <span id="s203">And they were replaced by the regular German Army.</span> <span id="s204">That place was like an administrative city, so they established a commandanture there.</span> <span id="s205">But that was essentially for themyou know, theythey ordered a curfew for the population and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s206">But at the same time they were trying to show to the French people that, Well, we are not that bad.</span> <span id="s207">And I remember, we stayed there one month before we were able to go back home.</span> <span id="s208">And one of the son of that city was a Navy officer who died at Dunkirk.</span> <span id="s209">And his body was recovered and was sent to that place to be buried in the family vault.</span> <span id="s210">And the whole city came to the funeral in the church.</span> <span id="s211">And the Germans sent an honor guard there.</span> <span id="s212">Yes.</span> <span id="s213">And they allowed his coffin to be draped in the French flag.</span> <span id="s214">Soand whenwhenso they had a Mass inside the church and when they came out, you know, people were carrying the coffin on their shoulders, and the Germans had the salute with their rifles.</span> <span id="s215">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Now, I may have interrupted you earlier.</span> <span id="s217">When you werewhen you left Paris to go to Brittany</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q:was that because you all felt it was safer because the Germans had already arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Well, it waswaswas also because the battlefront was getting close to us.</span> <span id="s221">And the day that we leftwe were living outside Paris and it was like a development, weI mean, little cottages, and a garden.</span> <span id="s222">It was our second home, actually.</span> <span id="s223">And we could hear the gun all night longgunsbig guns.</span> <span id="s224">Big guns, artillery.</span> <span id="s225">Which were close to us.</span> <span id="s226">And German planes flying all over and so forth.</span> <span id="s227">And then in the morning when we got up, at the end of the streetsof the street there, a company, or a platoon of French infantry.</span> <span id="s228">And they were colonial troops.</span> <span id="s229">They were Senegalese.</span> <span id="s230">They were in foxholes withlooked like a battle was going to take place right there.</span> <span id="s231">So we fled.</span> <span id="s232">We fled.</span> <span id="s233">And our neighbornext‑door neighborwas from that place and she say, Okay, we'll takeher son was fightingand she's saying, Okay, let's go to my sister's in Brittany.</span> <span id="s234">So we took the train.</span> <span id="s235">The trains were still working.</span> <span id="s236">You know, it's crazystuff is absolutely crazy.</span> <span id="s237">So the trains were working, we got to Paris.</span> <span id="s238">We had to change railroad stationwe went from to .</span> <span id="s239">And there, of course, it was confusion.</span> <span id="s240">They didn't know which train would leave at when, but they were trying to get the train.</span> <span id="s241">And finally we got the train which was going the direction that we wanted to go.</span> <span id="s242">It took us likequitealmost a day.</span> <span id="s243">The train was packed but we got there.</span> <span id="s244">And when we got out of the railroad station, the taxis were there.</span> <span id="s245">Ilife was normal there.</span> <span id="s246">The taxis, people were in the sidewalk cafe andthey didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: You went up there, you said, in early June?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: We left Paris June the 10th.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Hadn'thadn't the Germans already come into France in May?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s251">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s252">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: But just not into Paris yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Notno, no.</span> <span id="s255">They entered Paris, I believe, June the 15th.</span> <span id="s256">We wereactually, we didn't have to leave that area but we didn't know that at the time, see.</span> <span id="s257">Those soldiers whoParis was an open city.</span> <span id="s258">Was declared an open city.</span> <span id="s259">So the defense around Paris was canceled by the French military people orI don't know, maybe they just fled, you know.</span> <span id="s260">But one of the last major battles of Paris took place maybe ten kilometers from where we were.</span> <span id="s261">In the forestit's a denseat the time, it was a dense forest.</span> <span id="s262">Part of that big forest going from __________ all the way to _________ and so forth.</span> <span id="s263">And the French fought very, very hard in _________, which is 25, 26 kilometers from Paris.</span> <span id="s264">And we went there when we came back in July and nothing had changed from the battlefield except that the dead were buried.</span> <span id="s265">But it was provisional graves, with wooden crosses and helmets which were on the ground, and weapons andit was the remnants of a battle.</span> <span id="s266">And you could see that the battle was fierce.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: When you were living that month up in Brittany and the Germans were there, did they distinguish between Jews and non‑Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s269">No.</span> <span id="s270">The Germans couldn't care less.</span> <span id="s271">At the timethey were in the German Army.</span> <span id="s272">And theythey interfered very little with the French administration.</span> <span id="s273">The armistice had been signed.</span> <span id="s274">The Vichy government was in charge.</span> <span id="s275">The Germans were controlling, essentiallyrailroad system was controlled by them, maybe the post office, in terms of supervision.</span> <span id="s276">But they had absolutely no interference with the French, absolutely none whatsoever.</span> <span id="s277">Actually, they were trying to be friendly.</span> <span id="s278">They didn't ask anybody "Are you Jewish or not?"</span> <span id="s279">No.</span> <span id="s280">Absolutely not.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: So you decided to return to Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Well, we had to.</span> <span id="s283">We had to.</span> <span id="s284">We had to.</span> <span id="s285">We couldn't stay there.</span> <span id="s286">Thethat village was very, verythat city was very, very small.</span> <span id="s287">We had no place to stay.</span> <span id="s288">Weour money was running out.</span> <span id="s289">My father couldn't work there.</span> <span id="s290">So since we were in the occupied zone anyway, we had to go back home.</span> <span id="s291">Soand the German also wanted the people who were refugees to go back to where they came from.</span> <span id="s292">And so I believe that they had like a census, or whatever.</span> <span id="s293">I know we needed a special form to get on the train.</span> <span id="s294">And that was the German who gave that.</span> <span id="s295">And maybe they asked ifI don't recall exactly, but they might have a box on that form, or one way to ask if you were Jewish or not.</span> <span id="s296">But I'm not quite sure.</span> <span id="s297">But anyway, to get on that train, you needed a pass from the Germans.</span> <span id="s298">And we got there, we got into Paris.</span> <span id="s299">And that's when the impact alsowe left Paris and and Paris a month earlier was Parisyou know, the buses, and the cars, and the taxis and no German.</span> <span id="s300">And all of a sudden, there were very few buses, no taxisnow taxis were just for the Germans.</span> <span id="s301">There were very few taxis which were reserved simply for the Germans.</span> <span id="s302">And Germans everywhere, in all kinds of uniforms.</span> <span id="s303">All kinds.</span> <span id="s304">And they had taken the cafe and that was aand this and that, and restaurant .</span> <span id="s305">And they had posters with propaganda and warnings.</span> <span id="s306">It was a sad picture.</span> <span id="s307">A very sad picture.</span> <span id="s308">And so manyso many business werewere still closed down.</span> <span id="s309">People had not returned.</span> <span id="s310">So we arrived there and the Metro was workingMetro was working.</span> <span id="s311">So we took the Metro.</span> <span id="s312">Went to the other station, took the train and went back home.</span> <span id="s313">That was July, 1940.</span> <span id="s314">And life waslife was as usual, at least temporarily.</span> <span id="s315">UntilI'm trying to remember if it was September of that year thatthat was the German who askedthe census of the Jews.</span> <span id="s316">But the census was done by the French.</span> <span id="s317">And my father had to go to .</span> <span id="s318">was the administrative centerit was the of that department where we were, which was at the time called and now it'sI don't know what.</span> <span id="s319">It was changed since then.</span> <span id="s320">So he went there and he had to register.</span> <span id="s321">And he registered the whole family.</span> <span id="s322">And that was the beginning of that of that spiral of discrimination and persecution and so forth.</span> <span id="s323">Soso shortly after that, he had to fill out forms about our belongings, our furniture, our jewelry, our books of art, et cetera, et cetera.</span> <span id="s324">And then we couldn't have a telephone, we couldn't have a radio set.</span> <span id="s325">And so that was in 1940.</span> <span id="s326">And then he had restrictions about what he could do, in terms of work.</span> <span id="s327">He couldn't do this, he couldn't do that.</span> <span id="s328">But he was still working.</span> <span id="s329">He couldn't care less.</span> <span id="s330">And I was going to school, my sister was going to school.</span> <span id="s331">And for ordinary lifelife was absolutely normal for us.</span> <span id="s332">We hadwe had veryexcept for those restrictions.</span> <span id="s333">And we couldn't travel too far.</span> <span id="s334">Butbut other than that, we could go to the movies, we could go toour foodyou know, the coupons for food were the same as the general population.</span> <span id="s335">We had absolutely no discrimination at that time, either from the Germans or the French.</span> <span id="s336">Absolutely none.</span> <span id="s337">None.</span> <span id="s338">Then in 1942, that's when things started to change drastically.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: All of this time between fall of 1940 and '42, your life was relatively normal?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: In Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Outside of Paris.</span> <span id="s343">The .</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s345">Youokay, I'm sorry, because I didn't underI don't think you told me that you had gone to .</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Oh, that was at the beginning of the war, in 1939.</span> <span id="s347">We were afraid of Paris being bombarded, soand the French government asked people who had family in the provinces or a secondary home outside of Paris to leavemost of the big cities.</span> <span id="s348">They asked most of the big cities, but essentially Paris.</span> <span id="s349">They did the same in England, by the way, at the beginning of the war.</span> <span id="s350">And they sent the children all over the place and some of them were sent to England alsoto the United StatesEnglish childrenand Canada.</span> <span id="s351">Soso we had that second home, and we moved there.</span> <span id="s352">We moved there.</span> <span id="s353">At first my father was still keeping his business in Paris.</span> <span id="s354">And the business was not good anymore.</span> <span id="s355">Soand he was known locally, so he found ahe found enough to do locally.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Did you have to identify yourselves as Jews?</span> <span id="s357">Did you have to wear a star?</span> <span id="s358">Did you</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: No.</span> <span id="s360">Not from 1940, until 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: And you still had good relations with your neighbors or Christian friends at school?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s363">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s364">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s365">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s366">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s367">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s368">It waslife waswas very normal.</span> <span id="s369">Very normal.</span> <span id="s370">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s372">So you were saying that this went on until sometime in 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: I'm trying to remember ifI believe in 1941 they arrestedthey started to arrest Jews in Paris.</span> <span id="s374">I believe that was when they put them in the there.</span> <span id="s375">I believe that was July, '41.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: I think it was '42.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A. '42?</span> <span id="s378">Okay.</span> <span id="s379">Okay.</span> <span id="s380">So that was the turning point.</span> <span id="s381">WhenwhenJuly, '42, whenyes, yes, that's July, '42.</span> <span id="s382">Because my sister was spending the night in Paris with some friends of ours during that night when they came to arrest people.</span> <span id="s383">And theythe friends were living almost at the top of the building and they could hear the police in the middle of the night, climbing the stairs, knocking on the doors, and so forth.</span> <span id="s384">So their next‑door neighbor, who was Christian, got them in their apartment.</span> <span id="s385">And that's whythat's how my sister was able to escape that night.</span> <span id="s386">Soso shortly after thatno, before thatshortly before that</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Let me interrupt you.</span> <span id="s388">Because I think for the record, when you say the Velodrome, I don't think that somebody watching this tape might know what you're talking about.</span> <span id="s389">I mean, I know what you're talking about</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q:but somebody else may not.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s393">was a indoor stadium in Paris, built around the turn of the century, essentially for bicycle races.</span> <span id="s394">That's where they have the six days of Paris.</span> <span id="s395">Like the six days ofI don't remember where, but it was very popular at the turn of the century.</span> <span id="s396">And it went on for maybe 50 or 60 years.</span> <span id="s397">And people would go there for six days.</span> <span id="s398">They would bring food and so forth and they would watch thosethose people would race around like squirrels for six days.</span> <span id="s399">And so that stadium was big enough to accommodatenot accommodatenot accommodatebut to sit maybe two, three thousand people.</span> <span id="s400">And when the French police arrested the Jews in Paris for the first time on a large scale after the agreements between the French government and the Vichy government and the Germans, they had not made provisions to house such a large population.</span> <span id="s401">So they decided to park them in that stadium, which was called .</span> <span id="s402">Andbecause it was the winter oneit was covered.</span> <span id="s403">So the conditions there were absolutely appalling.</span> <span id="s404">And the French people who were allowed tothe French Red Cross, and so forthwere allowed to go there and try to give some milk for young children or medication for elderly people were so appalled by what they saw, I believe it helped later on, to a certain extent, to open the eyes of French people and try to help the Jews in the future.</span> <span id="s405">Or at least to avoid being involved.</span> <span id="s406">And they really saw that, and the Catholic charities also were involved.</span> <span id="s407">And so it became a big controversy among the French people.</span> <span id="s408">They didn't realize that discrimination could be that bad.</span> <span id="s409">And some were pleased, of course.</span> <span id="s410">Saying "Well, the Jews deserved that."</span> <span id="s411">But I don't believe they were a majority.</span> <span id="s412">I don't believe that.</span> <span id="s413">So that's the .</span> <span id="s414">Which means the winterhow do you sayvelodromebicycle track.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: As opposed to summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: And once people were taken thereonce the Jews were roundedof Paris were rounded up and taken there</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Soso then the French government decided that they would use a place called .</span></p> <p><span id="s419">And was a huge public housing project which was not complete in 1941 or '42.</span> <span id="s420">So they transferred the Jewish population from to .</span> <span id="s421">And became, really, the firstthe first stop to Auschwitz in the history of the persecution of the Jews in occupied France.</span> <span id="s422">And we knew people who were there.</span> <span id="s423">Somesome people were released from .</span> <span id="s424">But the agreements betweenfrom what I understandthe agreements between the German and French was that the French had to arrest so many people, like a quota of Jews.</span> <span id="s425">And they would be arrested until they had enough cars and railroad cars and so forth to take them wherever they had to go in Germany or Poland.</span> <span id="s426">But after that they opened other camps in occupied France.</span> <span id="s427">near was one.</span> <span id="s428">AndI'm trying to remember the other onebut those were the two places,I don't believe was only for Jews.</span> <span id="s429">was essentially for Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Were the Jews who were sent there initially French Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: No.</span> <span id="s432">No.</span> <span id="s433">No.</span> <span id="s434">No.</span> <span id="s435">They were essentially Jews withthe first one were German Jewswell, essentially, Polish Jews or Jews who had no nationality.</span> <span id="s436">or whatever.</span> <span id="s437">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: You said that this was a real turning point in people's perceptionin non‑Jewish people's perception.</span> <span id="s439">Up until then, were they fairly respectful of the occupation and of the Vichy government?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: No.</span> <span id="s441">No.</span> <span id="s442">Notnot in the occupied zone.</span> <span id="s443">In the occupied zone, the feelings were either, well, we are defeated, we have to survive, we have towe have to just, you know, go with the crowd.</span> <span id="s444">Or there were others who were saying, well, we are going to build a new Europe, a new world.</span> <span id="s445">And we have towe have to get rid of the Jews and the Free Mason and CommunismCommunism, that was the Bolsheviks.</span> <span id="s446">And then there were the people who were either openly against the Germans and Vichy or secretly against the Germans and Vichy.</span> <span id="s447">And the Frenchthe French, basically, arethey hate the Germans just as much as the Germans hate the French.</span> <span id="s448">It's a tragedy of history that two nations which are so different have aare neighbors.</span> <span id="s449">And even to this day, France and Germany, yes, they are big friends, but, no.</span> <span id="s450">No.</span> <span id="s451">They are very, very different.</span> <span id="s452">And the feelingsthe feelings of the French are still anti‑German.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: So you began to say in '42 with this massive round‑up in Paris, things started changing for you.</span> <span id="s454">You were living in .</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s456">Yes.</span> <span id="s457">Soso we knew thatand people were telling my father also, you know, you're crazy to stayto stayto stay here.</span> <span id="s458">You have to leave.</span> <span id="s459">You're going to be arrested.Theyso what they were doing, they werethey started with Paris, and they werethey were usingit was likelikeyou know, like when you drop a stone in water, you have those waves.</span> <span id="s460">Andand so they were arresting very systematically by zone, so such date was the arrest in that area.</span> <span id="s461">And that was all planned with the French police, the number of room available there and there, and so forth, and the over‑time for the police.</span> <span id="s462">It waswasjustI found out after it was veryit waslife was normal for those cops.</span> <span id="s463">Yes.</span> <span id="s464">Okay, so what are we doing today?</span> <span id="s465">Oh, arrest those peoplethat'sso we knew that it was coming in our area.</span> <span id="s466">Our neighbor told my father they arrested Jews in .</span> <span id="s467">was about six miles from us.</span> <span id="s468">And sobut wewewe didn't know exactly what was going on.</span> <span id="s469">III had the feelingand I knewI didn't know exactly, but the Royal Air Force would drop leaflets over France, which was called the .</span> <span id="s470">And it was like a little newsletter, printed on very, very thin paper, but strong paper.</span> <span id="s471">And they would drop that by the thousands.</span> <span id="s472">And they had that warning for the Jews, talking about the group, and the Jews who were gassed in trucks.</span> <span id="s473">And that was, I believe that was in early April of that year that I got thatone night we heard the planes above our head, and the next morning we had those flyers in our garden.</span> <span id="s474">And we were not supposed to pick them up.</span> <span id="s475">We were supposed to call the German immediately.</span> <span id="s476">Butso we read that, and I became very, very, very tense.</span> <span id="s477">But the propaganda from Jewish people was that, don't listen.</span> <span id="s478">That's not true.</span> <span id="s479">How can the Germans, such a civilized nation, do things like that?</span> <span id="s480">No.</span> <span id="s481">They just want to send the Jews in camps to work.</span> <span id="s482">Why elderly people and children work in camp, though.</span> <span id="s483">Sososomymy parents were trying toto believe that, see, because, it waswhere could we go?</span> <span id="s484">We had no placewe didn't know.</span> <span id="s485">So the pressure on my father was suchand on friends also was suchthat he got in touch with people who were working in the diamond business.</span> <span id="s486">And the diamond business, they were very chummy with the Germans.</span> <span id="s487">The Germans were dealing in diamonds, and gold, and so forth.</span> <span id="s488">And the only people they could deal with were the Jewish people who were in that business.</span> <span id="s489">And soI don't know all the details because I was not curious at the timebut my father got in touch with an organization through thatone of the diamond dealerwhere we would cross from occupied France into non‑occupied France on a regular train.</span> <span id="s490">And one person, I believe he was German, had those pass, thosethose made in our name.</span> <span id="s491">And so the day that we left, which was November the 7th, on a Friday</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: 1942.</span> <span id="s494">That same daywe were not sleeping in our home for a few days, we were sleeping at neighborsandwhat's that?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Do you hear the noise outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s497">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: You said you were staying at a neighbor's house.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: Yes, we were staying at neighbor house.</span> <span id="s500">The same neighbor who took us to her sister in Brittany.</span> <span id="s501">Andand I was going to school in Paris at the time.</span> <span id="s502">I decided that Paris was the safest.</span> <span id="s503">Because nobody knew me in Paris.</span> <span id="s504">I would take the train early in the morning, it was dark, and that was like anot exactly boarding school, but I took one meal there and I would come at night and when I was in that school I was safe.</span> <span id="s505">It was called .</span> <span id="s506">It was a very old college which Loyola attended in the 1500's.</span> <span id="s507">It was a private school, they didn't care, they didn't ask any questions and I was not wearing mythe star.</span> <span id="s508">And I never wanted to wear the star, I took a chance, but I neverdidn't wear it.</span> <span id="s509">So I was going to that school and was trying to blend with the rest of the people.</span> <span id="s510">And no question asked, absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s511">It wasthe other people and, you know.</span> <span id="s512">And sobut when I was going back home, the pressure was there.</span> <span id="s513">So anyway, my father got thatinto that organization and the day that we were leaving, that's the day they came to arrest us.</span> <span id="s514">But they didn't have enough people to arrest us, so what they were doing, they sent a cop and asking us to go to the precinct with all our papers and so forth for businessfor personal businessand we knew what it was.</span> <span id="s515">And soand so the railroad station was about a mile from our place and we werewe knew the train was taking us to Toulouse.</span> <span id="s516">Our neighbor next door had a niece who was living very close to the Spanish border in that small village and that was a village called .</span> <span id="s517">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Well, I was asking you, before you fled for the , how normal your life really was.</span> <span id="s519">I mean, you went to school in Paris, and you returned to at night.</span> <span id="s520">But there must have beenEnd of Tape 1</span></p> <p><span id="s521">TAPE NUMBER 2</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Oh, okay.</span> <span id="s523">So the firstthe first year of the Occupation, at first, we werewe didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s524">So we didn't want to make any moves, we just didn't know.</span> <span id="s525">So II attended a local school in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">And the second yearthat was 1941, '42since life waswas more normal, I went back to a schoolnot in Paris, but in , which is about 32, 35 kilometers outside of Paris, where I went during the first year of the warfrom 1939.</span> <span id="s527">1939‑1940.</span> <span id="s528">And in that school, things were absolutely normal.</span> <span id="s529">I would leave in the morning, take the train toor if the weather was nice, ride my bikewas no more thanI don't knowmaybe 12 miles or less than that.</span> <span id="s530">And go to school.</span> <span id="s531">At lunch time, we couldn't eat in school because of the shortage of food, so the school had an agreement with a restaurant in town where the Germans also had an agreement.</span> <span id="s532">So we would go to that restaurant and eat like regular customers there.</span> <span id="s533">And we had a special discount because it was the school, and the food was good.</span> <span id="s534">Because we were in a rural area, so we had plenty of food.</span> <span id="s535">And the Germans were next to us and they would greet us.</span> <span id="s536">And I remember one of them one day was like, crying, and we didn't know what happened, and the waitress say "Oh, poor guy.</span> <span id="s537">He got his orders to go on the Russian Front."</span> <span id="s538">And saying "Good."</span> <span id="s539">Soso lifeand we had sports in school, and we would travel to play with different schools, so we would travel in a radius of 60, 65 miles of Paris.</span> <span id="s540">And most of the time we had one of our teachers, but I remember oneone day we didn't have our teacher, so we reallyreally hadyou know, like teen‑age boys who are left on their own andand we had a lot of fun.</span> <span id="s541">And</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q:</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s544">Yes.</span> <span id="s545">Yes.</span> <span id="s546">Yes.</span> <span id="s547">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Was there any sense of what else was going on?</span> <span id="s549">Of detention?</span> <span id="s550">Of round‑up?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Well, wewewe were living with that constant threat of the round‑up.</span> <span id="s552">The constant threat of what is going to be the next step, what are they going to do to us?</span> <span id="s553">Andandand nobody wanted, really, to face that.</span> <span id="s554">There were very few people who wanted to face that.</span> <span id="s555">We were living just the day to day, and okay, tomorrowand tomorrowwe'll see tomorrow.</span> <span id="s556">But then whenwhen the round‑up started really to affect us, when friends or members of families were arrested, when the restrictions on what we could do started really to show that it's not that benign.</span> <span id="s557">Things are going to be very drastic.</span> <span id="s558">That's whenthat's when wewe decided to take action.</span> <span id="s559">So some people went into the Resistance, some people tried to go into hiding, some people went to their nation of origin, trying to likelike some of the Romanian went to the Romanian embassy and were trying to go back to Romania becausewewe were receiving letters from Romania.</span> <span id="s560">They were censored, but still they werethey were normal letters.</span> <span id="s561">And they werewe could guess from what they were telling us that life was very normal, and they were saying "Why don't you come here?</span> <span id="s562">Why do you stay there, you know, far away from us?"</span> <span id="s563">Sobut the Romanian and other nation didn't want the Jews there, see.</span> <span id="s564">So you could feel that the trap waswas reallywas really closing down on you and the game was to find a hole in that trap.</span> <span id="s565">And everybody had a different story or a different people trying to help.</span> <span id="s566">And so the goal was to go into Vichy Franceunoccupied France.</span> <span id="s567">But at least we are not with the Germans.</span> <span id="s568">Soso there were all kind of ways to get thereillegally, I mean.</span> <span id="s569">Andbut they were dangerous.</span> <span id="s570">All of them were dangerous.</span> <span id="s571">Andand some unscrupulous people were making good money byby telling people "I will take you over the border," and robbing them or selling them to the Germans and so forth.</span> <span id="s572">Soor killing them.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: You knew this at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s575">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s576">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s577">Yes.</span> <span id="s578">We knew that because we heard of families who werewho tried to get over and we never heard of them again ororwe knew they had been arrested.</span> <span id="s579">And soso you were supposed to go to that farm, and at the end of the field it was Vichy France and they had a waiting for you with a bicycle or stuff like that.</span> <span id="s580">Somesome were legitimate, I know people who crossed like that.</span> <span id="s581">Butand it was a biga long border betweenbetween Occupied and not‑Occupied France.</span> <span id="s582">But my father found that way where it was reallyat least from thefrom what we were toldwas strictly safe.</span> <span id="s583">We took the train.</span> <span id="s584">Webefore we got to that checkpoint, whoever was the guide would give us our pass, the German would come, and they were legitimate pass in our name, and they couldn't see that they werethey were forged.</span> <span id="s585">And they would stamp them and then two hours later we would be out of Occupied France.</span> <span id="s586">It was costly.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: Didwere there other people who were travelling with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: It was a large group.</span> <span id="s589">And I was never curious about that, but my Mother told me that after the war, she heard on the radio aFrench radioa program about that group.</span> <span id="s590">And essentially, why it was so costly, it's because what they were doing, they were a Jewish organization who was taking the children of people who had been rounded up and their children had beennot arrestedhidden.</span> <span id="s591">And they were taking them to farms and so forth in unoccupied France.</span> <span id="s592">And they were always with adults and theythe adults were like their parents, and so forth.</span> <span id="s593">And they would do that, I believe, once a week, or once every two weeks, I don't remember exactly.</span> <span id="s594">But my mother told mebut I never had the curiosity to go to the and find out.</span> <span id="s595">No.</span> <span id="s596">Afterafter thatafter the war, I justI just saying well, we escaped, and the past is the past.</span> <span id="s597">It's only now that saying well, I don't have that many more years, and maybe somebody should know what happened.</span> <span id="s598">But at the time, everybody had the same story.</span> <span id="s599">Everybody who survived the war, Jews or non‑Jews, survived the war.</span> <span id="s600">And we all had this story.</span> <span id="s601">All of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: So you were on a train going south?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s604">The regular train to from Paris to Toulouse.</span> <span id="s605">And whenwe left with another family who were close friends of the family forforever.</span> <span id="s606">And we had forged papers.</span> <span id="s607">And everybody knew us in thatin that community.</span> <span id="s608">Soso we went to the railroad station, take the train and we hadlike we go on a vacation.</span> <span id="s609">You know, we had suitcases, bicycles.</span> <span id="s610">And we put that on the train to Toulouse.</span> <span id="s611">Andand the man at the railroad station, he had been there for years and years and years, and he knew us, especially the other coupleeverybody knew they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s612">And he looked at us and he say "Toulouse?</span> <span id="s613">You have a ticket for Toulouse?"</span> <span id="s614">Yes.</span> <span id="s615">Okay.</span> <span id="s616">So we went, you know, and we had just small suitcases that we kept with us, including one with the food that my mother saved.</span> <span id="s617">And so we hadshe had sugar, and she had oil, and she had coffee, and she had all kind of stuff like that.</span> <span id="s618">And we carried that on the train.</span> <span id="s619">And we spentwe went to dinnerto friends of ours.</span> <span id="s620">The wife of a friend of ours who was a prisoner of war, so sheshe was safe because of that.</span> <span id="s621">And then we went to and took the train for Toulouse.</span> <span id="s622">And we werewewethe compartments were booked in advance, not by us, but by that organization, so wewhen we got there we got our seat assignment in the train.</span> <span id="s623">Andno, we got in the stationrailroad stationthere are Germans at patrol, they had French police patrolling.</span> <span id="s624">But they were not checking anybody.</span> <span id="s625">Absolutely not.</span> <span id="s626">Duringat least that time.</span> <span id="s627">Maybe some other time they would round up people or what but nobody asked us anything.</span> <span id="s628">We went on the train, nobody said "Do you have a pass?"</span> <span id="s629">or what.</span> <span id="s630">Absolutely not.</span> <span id="s631">The trainokay.</span> <span id="s632">What they wanted is "Did you pay your fare to go to Toulouse?"</span> <span id="s633">That's what they wanted to know.</span> <span id="s634">So we went there.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: Did your card identify you as being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: Forged card?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s639">Yes.</span> <span id="s640">No, not the forged one.</span> <span id="s641">My parents had the forged one.</span> <span id="s642">I had my regular one.</span> <span id="s643">And a year earlier it was stamped "Jew" with a big red stamp.</span> <span id="s644">.</span> <span id="s645">And a friend of mine told me that if you dip a wooden match with a cotton tiplike a Q‑tipif you dip that in bleach and you go very carefully over the red, it disappear.</span> <span id="s646">So I took a chance and I went very carefully overdid thattook one of those long, wooden matches that we still had in France at the time, with the cotton, bleach, and it disappeared.</span> <span id="s647">So the onlythe only way they could have found that I was Jewish was if I would be arrested in circumstances where they would check on my identify.</span> <span id="s648">But mine was a legitimate one.</span> <span id="s649">You could see that it was not forged.</span> <span id="s650">And I was taking a chance because had they checked on me, asked that precinct there in "What about him?"</span> <span id="s651">and they would have looked in their and said "Oh, .</span> <span id="s652">But I took a chance.</span> <span id="s653">I wanted to survive at the time.</span> <span id="s654">And soso wewe crossed thatthat line of demarcation.</span> <span id="s655">It was very impressive.</span> <span id="s656">Very, very impressive.</span> <span id="s657">It waswas very scary, because the train would stop in the middle of the night and you had to have the curtains down and sit in your seat and you were not allowed to look outside.</span> <span id="s658">And we could hear, you know, the Germans walking up and down like a wooden with their heavy boots in the middle of the night there.</span> <span id="s659">.</span> <span id="s660">And from both ends of the train they had German soldiers withofficer and so forthchecking those there.</span> <span id="s661">And they were talking loudly among themselves.</span> <span id="s662">And was very organized.</span> <span id="s663">And the German Army is very militaristic and traditional.</span> <span id="s664">And I found out that in their rules and regulation when you have a check‑point, you have to ask, I believe, a major and another officer and an NCO and then you have to have a private holding aone of those lampsoil lamp.</span> <span id="s665">So they wereI can seestill see that tall German officer who was, I believe, a major or something, who must have been a hero of World War I.</span> <span id="s666">He must have been in his 50's and talking to the other one, and the NCO and they were looking at the and they were looking at the identity card, and they wanted to find out what was in my mother's suitcase.</span> <span id="s667">So she opened that and the oil was all over the sugar and everything, so they laughed and they said "Well."</span> <span id="s668">And then they have that little guy with the lantern following and he was just as frightened as we were.</span> <span id="s669">And so just before the train left, I was too curious.</span> <span id="s670">I had to peep out.</span> <span id="s671">And I saw that and it was really frightening.</span> <span id="s672">We werewe were on alike aa platform with barbed wire, big floodlights and those Germans going up and down with their rifle on their shoulder.</span> <span id="s673">Oh, it wasso the train left, and by then wewe were on the other side, and the man who was with us came back to collect thoseour .</span> <span id="s674">And he told myhe told us Okay, be very careful when you get into Toulouse because there are very important events which are taking place in the world.</span> <span id="s675">And the same night that we got there, Eisenhower landed inin Casablanca.</span> <span id="s676">Was during the night Saturday to Sunday.</span> <span id="s677">And the Germans occupied France the 11th of November, and they were planning to do that, from what I understand, a long time before they did, but three days later the Germans were back.</span> <span id="s678">We saw the German back.</span> <span id="s679">Sobut at least this time, nobody knew where we were, nobody knew who we were.</span> <span id="s680">So we got to that niece of our neighbor who didn't know who we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: This is in Toulouse?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s683">This isthis isno.</span> <span id="s684">So we left Toulouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: How long were you in Toulouse?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: The time to change trains, to get to .</span> <span id="s687">And wewewe had absolutely no idea of where it was.</span> <span id="s688">So we had to collect our luggage and everything came through, including my bicycle.</span> <span id="s689">And everything, you know, was there.</span> <span id="s690">Soso we ask "How do we go to ," and the guy said "Okay, you have to take that train and change train at that"we had to take two trains, so okay.</span> <span id="s691">So we went to buy the tickets, get all our luggage again to go to that place.</span> <span id="s692">And we had maybeand our friends left.</span> <span id="s693">Left, and they were very scared.</span> <span id="s694">They had one in Toulouse, so we didn't see them 'til after the war.</span> <span id="s695">And so we took that train.</span> <span id="s696">And the train was working maybe twice a week.</span> <span id="s697">And that was a Saturday.</span> <span id="s698">And the train was working on the Saturday, so by the timeand it was very early in the morning.</span> <span id="s699">We got there like 5:30, 6 in Toulouse.</span> <span id="s700">And my mother was very pleased because she saw a French soldier on the platform there in Toulouse.</span> <span id="s701">A French soldier of the Vichy French.</span> <span id="s702">But still, it wasyou know, French flag andit was French.</span> <span id="s703">Not German.</span> <span id="s704">Soso we getwe get in by about 1 p.m. And by then my parents were absolutely exhausted.</span> <span id="s705">They werecouldn't take it anymore.</span> <span id="s706">So they say "Okay.</span> <span id="s707">You have a bike.</span> <span id="s708">We don't know where that village is.</span> <span id="s709">We don't know anything.</span> <span id="s710">You go and you find out."</span> <span id="s711">So I got on my bike and I asked my direction and I got into that village.</span> <span id="s712">And I asked about that lady and they told me where it was.</span> <span id="s713">And I knocked on their door and I say "Well, we are the neighbors of your aunt."</span> <span id="s714">And "Ah.</span> <span id="s715">Okay."</span> <span id="s716">And they say "Well, we have a problem."</span> <span id="s717">She was living in a big home with a young son and she wasshe had been widowed maybe less than a month before that.</span> <span id="s718">Her husband was much older than she was, and he was a disabled veteran of World War I who had been gassed and he died.</span> <span id="s719">He was fairly young when he died, he washe was not 60.</span> <span id="s720">But she wasshe wasat the time she was like 31, 32.</span> <span id="s721">She was a young widow, a very young widow.</span> <span id="s722">And soso I told her, you know, we are Jewish people and sheshe didn't know what Jewish meant.</span> <span id="s723">It was a small village.</span> <span id="s724">She came from Brittany.</span> <span id="s725">She just didn't know anything.</span> <span id="s726">She say "Oh, you can stay here.</span> <span id="s727">Sure, I have room."</span> <span id="s728">But I have my father, my mother and my sister.</span> <span id="s729">"Oh, where are they?"</span> <span id="s730">I say, you know, the railroad station.</span> <span id="s731">She say "Okay, I'll go with you."</span> <span id="s732">And she told her son "Okay, finish your lunch"it was lunchtime"and go back to school."</span> <span id="s733">And so we went to pick up my parents and we took the luggage and she said "Let me prepare lunch for you."</span> <span id="s734">And then she say "Well, we have to have a scenario because there is a lot of family, so you are going to be the cousin from Brittany."</span> <span id="s735">So we became the cousin from Brittany.</span> <span id="s736">And we knew the family so well andbut they say"But how come we didn't see you at the wedding?"</span> <span id="s737">and this and that or"Well, we were not there."</span> <span id="s738">Or, you know, things during the family.</span> <span id="s739">Soso then when the Germans came, a few days later, my parents had to be in hiding because she felt that it was suspicious to have the whole family.</span> <span id="s740">So we stayedmy sister and I were supposed to stay with her.</span> <span id="s741">And my sister was still an age to go to school.</span> <span id="s742">But nobody was saying anything about she has to go to school.</span> <span id="s743">So wewe were there and my parents were hiding and when people were coming in the house, they were moving the house and you could hear that.</span> <span id="s744">And finally, little by little, people started to find out, because we told them and my parents were telling them.</span> <span id="s745">So we told a close friend of hersher husband was the guide who took us over the mountain and was also the guide for Arnold, I found out.</span> <span id="s746">And then another friend of her was the mayor of a small city and he was getting memos from the police about the different operation.</span> <span id="s747">And he would tell us "Oh, they are preparing an operation against the Jews in Toulouse," and this and that.</span> <span id="s748">Andand finally she went to Paris, and she had a sister whose husband was a prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s749">Her sister was absolutely beautiful.</span> <span id="s750">She was one of the most beautiful women that you can see.</span> <span id="s751">And she had a young boy.</span> <span id="s752">And she was the mistress of a German officer who was in Paris there.</span> <span id="s753">And so the lady who was taking care of usthey went there to see her and we asked her to see some people that we knew also so she went there.</span> <span id="s754">She stay about a week.</span> <span id="s755">And when she came back, she saythat was April, '43she told us "Well, I cannot keep you anymore."</span> <span id="s756">And she say "No.</span> <span id="s757">I talk to my sister and I talk to Willy (ph.)"Willy was the German officer and friend"and Willy say 'You are crazy.</span> <span id="s758">You are hiding Jews in your home.</span> <span id="s759">And you havejust across the street you have the German Commandanture.</span> <span id="s760">And you areyou are already flirting with danger.</span> <span id="s761">If anything happens, those people are going to be sent to the camps, and you going to be shot.'</span> <span id="s762">So she came back absolutely frightened.</span> <span id="s763">She say "You cannot stay anymore."</span> <span id="s764">So my mother was absolutelyabsolutelytotallytotally depressed.</span> <span id="s765">And so we had like a big family reunion.</span> <span id="s766">And we were so close to Spain that we say "Well, let's go to Spain."</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: Before you made this decision, you were in this town four or five months, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: From November the 7 or 8th.</span> <span id="s769">And that was Aprilthe first week of April.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: So what was the daily life like?</span> <span id="s771">How threatened were you?</span> <span id="s772">Were you just living normally?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: Wellokayso the Germans came and they were not in the area.</span> <span id="s774">But then around January or FebruaryI don't remember exactlythey had like a red zone going all along the French‑Spanish borderall along.</span> <span id="s775">And that was extremely, extremely reinforced in terms of patrol, and so forth.</span> <span id="s776">And thatthat small place where we were was a village with maybe two or three hundred people, that's all, see.</span> <span id="s777">Soso it had two or three streets at the most.</span> <span id="s778">So one street was the main road, so to speak.</span> <span id="s779">No.</span> <span id="s780">It's a narrow road going from one small village to the other.</span> <span id="s781">It was the way to Spain anyway.</span> <span id="s782">And the other one was like a very narrow streetI don't even know if it was paved or notleading tonot eventhey didn't even have any shops there.</span> <span id="s783">Just farms and so forth.</span> <span id="s784">And they had like a general store which was just across the house where we were in hiding.</span> <span id="s785">And the house was close by the road.</span> <span id="s786">I should have taken a picture of that with me, but it doesn't matter.</span> <span id="s787">Soand right across the street, they had that general store.</span> <span id="s788">And they were selling, you know, the tobacco, and it was like athe baker would come and leave bread there and so forth.</span> <span id="s789">And they would sell liquor, and wine, and it was like a big place, sowhen the Germans draw that line and they had patrol post every mile or so, that was the headquarter there.</span> <span id="s790">Right across the street from us.</span> <span id="s791">And the people who were the owner of thatof that general store, their son was in the Waffen SSFrench.</span> <span id="s792">And they were suspicious that something was not right with us.</span> <span id="s793">But they knew the husband of that lady extremely well.</span> <span id="s794">He was a respected World War I veteran, he was the chief of the veteran organization, and so forth.</span> <span id="s795">Andsoso they didn't want toto reallyat the time, annoy that lady, but I'm sure with time they would havehad we stayed there, something would have happened.</span> <span id="s796">It was too dangerous.</span> <span id="s797">Much too dangerous.</span> <span id="s798">So one ofone of her friend's husbandthe husband of one of her friendswas that guide and he was a member of the Communist Resistance.</span> <span id="s799">And he and his nephews and other peoplethey were all local peoplethey were smugglers, so they knew the mountain extremely well.</span> <span id="s800">Hehe was involved in passing people.</span> <span id="s801">And so he had a group of four French who werewell, two French and two Gypsiesthe Gypsies also were starting to be rounded upwho werethey were cominggoing from one place to the next in hiding.</span> <span id="s802">At night they would walk in the fields.</span> <span id="s803">And they would stop in a farm or they would stop in a church.</span> <span id="s804">A lot of local priests, country priests, were also involved in helping out people like that.</span> <span id="s805">It didn't matter if they wereif people were Jews ora lot of also were involved with pilots, who were shot down.</span> <span id="s806">And so they hadthey had like a chain, you see.</span> <span id="s807">And those organizations were very strong.</span> <span id="s808">Very, very strong.</span> <span id="s809">They had to be veryveryhow can I say thatthey had to choose who they were passing because they could be betrayed very easily, and many of them were betrayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Were there other refugees living in this ?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: No.</span> <span id="s812">But amazingly enough, afterafter we talked to other people, one of the local people say "Oh, there is another Jewish family in hiding"I forgot where it was.</span> <span id="s813">So one day they werethey came to visit us.</span> <span id="s814">And they were from Poland.</span> <span id="s815">They were much younger than my parents.</span> <span id="s816">And theythe wife was pregnant at the time.</span> <span id="s817">So I really don't know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s818">Butbut the people knew that they wereand I'm sure that there were other people in hiding there also, see.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: But you were pretty free to move around as you wanted?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: We were pretty free to move until thethat zone became the red zone.</span> <span id="s821">And then you needed a special pass.</span> <span id="s822">And only the local people could get that.</span> <span id="s823">Soso actually, we didn't move, we were all in hiding.</span> <span id="s824">We couldn't move.</span> <span id="s825">From January or February of '43 until the day we left in April the 9th of '43, we didn't move.</span> <span id="s826">We stayed in the house constantly.</span> <span id="s827">Except going in the yard, you know.</span> <span id="s828">But my parents didn't.</span> <span id="s829">My parents weremy parents were not supposed to be there.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: How aware were you of these different resistance operations in the area?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: Not very much.</span> <span id="s832">Because we had no contact with anybody.</span> <span id="s833">And we found out when thatthat friend of oursof ourour friend, the one who was hiding uswhen he said well, I'm taking you, and then he told us exactly what he was doing.</span> <span id="s834">And the whole chain of people who were doing that.</span> <span id="s835">So we had toto get through thatthose checkpoint.</span> <span id="s836">So the secretary of the mayor of a little village made those passes for us.</span> <span id="s837">And we wereso we walkedbefore we walked in the mountains and that was the last road beforebefore getting in the mountain.</span> <span id="s838">And that road was patrolled heavily by the Germans, so wehe was in the wine business, so we were hiding in the cellar there and his young boy was playing in the street and he was watching for the patrols.</span> <span id="s839">So we heard the patrol walking and the kid was playing and then he say "Okay."</span> <span id="s840">So we all cross the road one by one.</span> <span id="s841">And then we walkedwe started to walk up that mountain.</span> <span id="s842">And we walked for 24 hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: How much preparation did you have for this journey?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: None.</span> <span id="s845">None.</span> <span id="s846">None.</span> <span id="s847">None.</span> <span id="s848">And in retrospect, it was absolutely crazy.</span> <span id="s849">How we made it, I don't know.</span> <span id="s850">Well, I know, because those four guides who came with us were very, very strong.</span> <span id="s851">And they were able to carry my mother on their back for part of the crossing.</span> <span id="s852">And my father almost died there in the mountain, of exhaustion.</span> <span id="s853">Because we walked 12 hours in the snow.</span> <span id="s854">Yes.</span> <span id="s855">Well, that saved us because the Germans had ahad alike a smallnot chalet, but kind of portable, littlelittle hut in the mountain.</span> <span id="s856">And the weather was so bad thatbefore thatthat they had abandoned it.</span> <span id="s857">So we had to walk there in front of that hut and nobody was there, but the Germans could see us from the valley because we saw, before we left, we saw people walking that same mountain andand was covered with snow on one side.</span> <span id="s858">And you could see, you know, the people walking up there.</span> <span id="s859">And the Germans were everywhere, everywhere there.</span> <span id="s860">So when they saw us there they sent the and we were a few hours ahead of them and by the time we reached the Spanish territorythat part of Spain was controlled also by Spanish guards and they arrested us.</span> <span id="s861">And they told us that because they arrested us the Germans couldn't do anything to us, that the Germans were after the people who were crossing the boarder in day to cross into Spanish territory to arrest people when there were Spanions (ph.) around.</span> <span id="s862">So we were arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: What was your plan at this time?</span> <span id="s864">You wanted to get to Spain.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: We had no plans.</span> <span id="s866">The plan was to go to Spain and then be there.</span> <span id="s867">Andandand get away, again, to be one step ahead of the Germans.</span> <span id="s868">We just didn't know.</span> <span id="s869">We had absolutely no idea.</span> <span id="s870">All we wanted to do was be in Spain.</span> <span id="s871">Be away from the Germans.</span> <span id="s872">That's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: So you were arrested by the Spanish guards</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s875">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q.what happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: Well, they took us toto theto the first village which was way up in the mountains.</span> <span id="s878">Way up.</span> <span id="s879">Way up.</span> <span id="s880">It was a tiny little place and they took us to the Mayor.</span> <span id="s881">They were not even in uniform.</span> <span id="s882">No, they hadthey had likewellwell, they had kind ofofof military habits.</span> <span id="s883">The rest of Spain at the time was so poor, so they had no uniform and their shoes were in terrible shape.</span> <span id="s884">We were better dressed then they were.</span> <span id="s885">Coming from occupied France.</span> <span id="s886">And so they took us there.</span> <span id="s887">The Mayor greeted us and since my mother and my sister were there they were allowed to go sleep with people and he knocked on doors and he asked some ladies or some people, so my mother and my sister spent the night in a bed and then all the men, we werewe were sent to a barn.</span> <span id="s888">And they still had a local pub open, a bistro.</span> <span id="s889">So we went there and we got drunk.</span> <span id="s890">I believe that was the first time in my life that I got drunk and while I sick, you know, we were celebrating.</span> <span id="s891">Those four French guys were so happy to be in Spain and we had French money and they were taking French money in that cafe and what a tab of white wine.</span> <span id="s892">Andand the next day they took us to, that was already a city, Less (ph.).</span> <span id="s893">And from Less we took a bus to another place called Yella (ph.) and we spent a night in a hotel there and they told us that the next day we would walk like 30 or 40 jamata (ph.) and we walked, we went through a tunnel which was not finished

Franceof in between and Spain.</span> <span id="s906">isisis Spanish.</span> <span id="s907">And it'sit's separated form the rest of Spain, so during most of the winter it's so high in the mountains the path is covered with snow.</span> <span id="s908">So the only way they could get theirtheir food and so forth was from France and that same road which was duringin Francepassing in front of that house where we were in hiding would go all the way to Spain.</span> <span id="s909">That was the onlythe only road.</span> <span id="s910">That's why we have such a concentration of German there.</span> <span id="s911">That was the only road going to ____________.</span> <span id="s912">That was the name of thatthat boulder.</span> <span id="s913">And I went back there and theand thethe Spaniards developed that into aa ski resort.</span> <span id="s914">And I didn't recognize any of the place except that that village where we spent that first night and the village is ____________ abandoned.</span> <span id="s915">It's dead.</span> <span id="s916">Dead.</span> <span id="s917">All of the villages there are dead.</span> <span id="s918">They were just two or three people

did that drastically.</span> <span id="s922">Andand Spain, they didn't do that.</span> <span id="s923">They didn't do that.</span> <span id="s924">So when we arrived in Lada an English pilot was there and they took care of the consul ofit wasI don't remember what it was.</span> <span id="s925">____________ at the time it was really a very impressive car.</span> <span id="s926">Was there to pick him up in view of everybody.</span> <span id="s927">Thethe Spaniards didn't care about that and so he washe was there and they took him to Barcelona and sure, and from there he was flown back to England and so we were escorted out andand the people who were in between 18 and 40 were sent to jail and the governor told us "Well, II know that when you crossed the boarder and you gave your name and age and so forth, you all lied.</span> <span id="s928">You're a bunch of liars and now you have to tell the truth.</span> <span id="s929">And remember anybody who is in between 18 and 40 will go to jail."</span> <span id="s930">And the jail on top of that hill of Lada.</span> <span id="s931">And if people didn't get the message that they were not to be between 18 and 40 they were very stupid.</span> <span id="s932">And somesomesome were very stupid and say "I'm 22."</span> <span id="s933">Soso I got to be younger then I was.</span> <span id="s934">And my father was over 40 so he didn't have to lie.</span> <span id="s935">And we stayed a couple of days in a hotel in Lada.</span> <span id="s936">And that was all paid.</span> <span id="s937">We didn't haveby that time we were

French, people who were from Belgium, like ____________ and all those people didn't have to pay a penny.</span> <span id="s953">And then we were sent by train, we didn't have to pay a penny either, to Barcelona and I remember the governor came to the station to greet us, gave us the tickets and food tototo eat on the train to go toto Barcelona.</span> <span id="s954">He was such a kind man.</span>

id="s986">No, they were from all over.</span> <span id="s987">All over.</span> <span id="s988">Because I remember oneoneoneone of us was from Czechoslovakia (ph.) and he was able to enlist in the Czech legion.</span> <span id="s989">Some where from Belgium.</span> <span id="s990">Well, it waspeople who were allowed to land on allied territory.</span> <span id="s991">From, I suppose they

3</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: what was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: Well, it was like being born again.</span> <span id="s1010">Casablanca was very, very busy and French flags everywhere.</span> <span id="s1011">The French Navy was there; French uniforms.</span> <span id="s1012">We saw the Americans for the first time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: When you say "first," what sense are we talking about?</span> <span id="s1014">We're not talking about .</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: Visie (ph.), visie was irrelevant then.</span> <span id="s1016">Thatthat part of France had been liberated November '42 byby the British and the U.S. and the French were there.</span> <span id="s1017">Were there before the .</span> <span id="s1018">They didn't fight because they were to far away fromfromfrom the and their assignment was not to fight.</span> <span id="s1019">Their main assignment was to defend the French colonies and they were essentially the Frenchregular French Army.</span> <span id="s1020">For two years or three their allegiance was to the government of Visie, but like any Army in the world their allegiance was to their French government, but in terms ofof the uniform, the discipline, the weaponry and so forth, they were thethey were the French Army, the French Navy, the French Airforce.</span> <span id="s1021">Theytheythey never, never knew any other chain of command orororknew orders and what came from the French government.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: With .</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: Until November '42, but</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: .</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: Yes, butbutI'm talking of July '43.</span> <span id="s1026">That's when we landed in Casablanca and Visie was history in North Africa.</span> <span id="s1027">Visie was history.</span> <span id="s1028">We had .</span> <span id="s1029">They had a parliament, the beginning of a parliament and the goal was working very hard to become thethewhat was its titlechief of the provisional government.</span> <span id="s1030">And the goal was in North Africa at the time, I saw the for the first time in my life inin Casablanca in July '43.</span> <span id="s1031">So Visie was history.</span> <span id="s1032">Visie was history.</span> <span id="s1033">I don't know if thethe seal, the French republic was totally reestablished, but all the laws of Visie by then had been totally, totally abolished.</span> <span id="s1034">Totally, totally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: So what were you'rewhat were your plans?</span> <span id="s1036">What were you planning on doing once you got to Casablanca?</span> <span id="s1037">?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s1039">No.</span> <span id="s1040">No.</span> <span id="s1041">Sososo the plans werewas to enlist in the army and my father was too old to beto be in the active, active duty, but he got drafted as a civilian and they needed people with his specialty, so they are finding to the maintenance of the air base in Casablanca there which was essentially French and American.</span> <span id="s1042">And my sister went to school.</span> <span id="s1043">She was 14.</span> <span id="s1044">And they were assigned a small apartment which was nice and my mother became involved with that association of a group of people who came like within, from France and Spain andwhich became a very profiting group because many high ranking officials took the same oath that we did and, so theythey had a likelike a big headquarters and they took over a big hotel in Casablanca.</span> <span id="s1045">A very nice hotel and they had likeit was like a home for the soldiers who were coming on leave or people who were going through Casablanca.</span> <span id="s1046">They had a big cafeteria.</span> <span id="s1047">They had social services and so forth and my mother got very heavy involved with that.</span> <span id="s1048">And of course they were , so and then I was in the Army.</span> <span id="s1049">French, second French.</span> <span id="s1050">Second division and so we stayed there until April of '44 and then we were shipped over to England and then August the 1st of '44 we landed in Normandy and, so actually Normandy and liberation of Paris and the , it's awful.</span> <span id="s1051">Q: I'm just side tracking a minute.</span> <span id="s1052">In Morocco we talked aboutwerewere your parents part of a Jewish community or was it just a French</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: No.</span> <span id="s1054">No.</span> <span id="s1055">No.</span> <span id="s1056">No.</span> <span id="s1057">No.</span> <span id="s1058">Theythe American Jews didn't help us at all.</span> <span id="s1059">We were asked in .</span> <span id="s1060">They were actually .</span> <span id="s1061">And they didn't help us.</span> <span id="s1062">The help came from the French.</span> <span id="s1063">The French in Morocco use their .</span> <span id="s1064">Truly anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s1065">Extremely, extremely violently rabid or where nice French people who couldn't care less.</span> <span id="s1066">Who just couldn't care less.</span> <span id="s1067">And I know my parents were very happy in Morocco.</span> <span id="s1068">Very happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: Did they resumewell, you weren't very religious before, but was there any observance of recognition of being Jewish again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1071">Yankapor (ph.), Basa (ph.) and stuff like that, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: And within the French Army was there any distinction about being Jewish or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: Thatthatthat French Army, that's a different chapter.</span> <span id="s1074">Well, well, veryhow can I say thatwe were a very large number of Jewish boys there.</span> <span id="s1075">Very large.</span> <span id="s1076">And that's where we found raw, virulent anti‑Semitism.</span> <span id="s1077">All the way from the top downfrom the top down.</span> <span id="s1078">From the very high‑ranking officer down.</span> <span id="s1079">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: How did that manifest itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: Oh, by discrimination, bad assignments, Jew‑baiting, fist‑fights.</span> <span id="s1082">Yes.</span> <span id="s1083">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: Did that surprise you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1086">Yes.</span> <span id="s1087">I was not prepared for that, at first.</span> <span id="s1088">But after that, okay, I took it for granted.</span> <span id="s1089">And we were enough Jewish boys to stick together.</span> <span id="s1090">But it was not fun, it was not fun.</span> <span id="s1091">We felt very, very different.</span> <span id="s1092">Very different.</span> <span id="s1093">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: It would seem that after all your travails to finally arrive in Morocco and think that you were free and then have to contend with this</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1096">Yes.</span> <span id="s1097">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: What was the general spirit of the Armed Forces going back into Europe to help end the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: Well, basically, for most of the people it was the feeling that they were doing what they were meant to do.</span> <span id="s1100">But not everybody was like that, because many of the soldiers of the 2nd French Armored Division were drafted in North Africa.</span> <span id="s1101">We had a large contingent of Arabs from Algeria.</span> <span id="s1102">Many of them couldn't speak a word of French.</span> <span id="s1103">And didn't feel that they had to fight the Germans.</span> <span id="s1104">I don't blame them, you know.</span> <span id="s1105">And after a while, when some of the young men who were drafted in North Africa so that the young French men who were liberated didn't try to join the Army or they had done nothing to liberate themselves, they say "Why are we dying for them?"</span> <span id="s1106">We were perfectly happy in our cities of Algeria and for what, you know.</span> <span id="s1107">So, I remember one of my friends.</span> <span id="s1108">He's dead now, the poor guy.</span> <span id="s1109">But after Paris, after the liberation of Paris, we were on the road going east, and it was the beginning of fall, and the liberation of Paris had beenhow can I say thatyou know, the first two days were great.</span> <span id="s1110">Then after that we dealt with a population which had survived four years of occupation.</span> <span id="s1111">And most of those people who had survived those four years of occupation had survived by surviving.</span> <span id="s1112">Which meansI wouldn't say illegal means but the French, they have a word for that.</span> <span id="s1113">They call that ________ or ________.</span> <span id="s1114">You survive.</span> <span id="s1115">So they had a mentality that was very, very difficult to accept.</span> <span id="s1116">So on that road he told me "Well, we are not volunteers anymore."</span> <span id="s1117">And that's the way we felt.</span> <span id="s1118">At least, that's the way I felt.</span> <span id="s1119">I was not a volunteer anymore.</span> <span id="s1120">And the enthusiasm, the sense of victory that we felt in Normandy and getting into Paris had vanished totally.</span> <span id="s1121">Two weeks in Paris, that was the end of it.</span> <span id="s1122">That was the end of it.</span> <span id="s1123">Just being in contact with those people in Paris</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: So at that point what were you going to do?</span> <span id="s1125">What did you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: Oh, well, I kept going on.</span> <span id="s1127">I was enlistedI volunteered for the duration.</span> <span id="s1128">Soand we still had a job to do.</span> <span id="s1129">But we didn't feel like the superhero, or Superman or what.</span> <span id="s1130">So just, okay, let's finish that and go back home.</span> <span id="s1131">That was the feeling.</span> <span id="s1132">Then after, when it was all over, you know, first thing first, I got among the first to be discharged when it was over.</span> <span id="s1133">And I want my uniform in a closet nevermore.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q:</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q: Where else did you fight?</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">A: That's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: After Paris</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q:you were just in the Army but not fighting it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1142">We wentwe went all the way to Alsace.</span> <span id="s1143">Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: And then after France was liberated, then you decided to stay in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: When I was discharged?</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: When were you discharged?</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: August the 13th, 1945.</span> <span id="s1148">That's 50 years ago, two days ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: So from liberation of France, which was in 1944 through 1945, were you fighting elsewhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: After the end of the campaign in Alsace, we went back into Franceinto the center of France.</span> <span id="s1151">That was in March of '45.</span> <span id="s1152">March, '45.</span> <span id="s1153">And I got amy firstmy parents were back in France by then.</span> <span id="s1154">They came back in February.</span> <span id="s1155">And so I got a leave to see them.</span> <span id="s1156">And I went back to England.</span> <span id="s1157">They had some outfit there taking care of the liquidation of what had been the Free French to get back into the regular Army.</span> <span id="s1158">And what essentially was loafing.</span> <span id="s1159">But gave me the opportunity to come back by plane, which was fun.</span> <span id="s1160">Not too many people were flying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: So when did you resume your life after all of this interruption?</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: Three days after I got discharged, went back to school to finish my baccalaureate.</span> <span id="s1163">And after that, I went to medical school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: And all this was in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: All that was, yes.</span> <span id="s1166">The Paris area.</span> <span id="s1167">But medical school was in Paris, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: You had basically decided to stay in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: Yes, oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1170">Yes.</span> <span id="s1171">Yes.</span> <span id="s1172">The only thing was that we were involved with Israel at the time, you see.</span> <span id="s1173">And theywhat was it calledI forgot what it was called.</span> <span id="s1174">But they were looking for Jewish war veterans to help the Hagana (ph.).</span> <span id="s1175">So we were likelikesome of my friends were working with the Exodus.</span> <span id="s1176">Mostly those who had been in those macquis, Jewish macquis.</span> <span id="s1177">Some were forging papers and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s1178">And others were carrying weapons.</span> <span id="s1179">So we were all more or less involved like that.</span> <span id="s1180">Arnold went back to Israel because he was in the Jewish brigade, so heand they didn't want him, they sent him back.</span> <span id="s1181">They had too many people.</span> <span id="s1182">They had too many people coming from all over the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: What were you doing to make a stand?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: I wasfor a few months I was working with a group which was called ___________.</span> <span id="s1185">Which was, essentially, working for aviation.</span> <span id="s1186">And thethey were heavily recruiting pilots from World War II.</span> <span id="s1187">British, Americansfrom all over.</span> <span id="s1188">People that had been in the Air Force of their countries.</span> <span id="s1189">And the French had allowed the Jewish Agencythat's the name of itto use several airports there, so that's what we were doing.</span> <span id="s1190">Helping with that.</span> <span id="s1191">Taking flying lessons, also.</span> <span id="s1192">I met a lot of characters there.</span> <span id="s1193">That's when I met my firstthe first Indian Jew from India.</span> <span id="s1194">I didn't know that they had Jews in India at the timeand was a pilot and I met also a pilot of the Royal Air Force and a German crew who camethey wanted to erase what Germany had done during the war.</span> <span id="s1195">They came and they had their log book from World War II showing their missions and how good they were.</span> <span id="s1196">And of course they were turned down.</span> <span id="s1197">They were crushed.</span> <span id="s1198">"But we have done nothing against the Jews, and we want to help.</span> <span id="s1199">And we are good pilots."</span> <span id="s1200">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: What did you discover about the French attitudes after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: Oh, well, everybody was trying to getwell, France had been heavily destroyed during World War II.</span> <span id="s1203">Many, many cities had been really destroyed.</span> <span id="s1204">A lot of French people had been maimed or killed.</span> <span id="s1205">More than a million prisoners of war came back and had to re‑adjust to life.</span> <span id="s1206">So we were all in the same boat, re‑adjusting to life.</span> <span id="s1207">And I had beenI wouldn't say immunized, but being exposed to a different kind of anti‑Semitism that I had experienced before as a teenager, this time I wasmy skin was thicker.</span> <span id="s1208">So going to medical school I found the same attitude.</span> <span id="s1209">Same attitude.</span> <span id="s1210">At that"Too many Jews are in medical school.</span> <span id="s1211">Too many Jews are doctors" and et cetera, et cetera.</span> <span id="s1212">So I went through medical school and didn't have too many problems.</span> <span id="s1213">And I started my practice.</span> <span id="s1214">I had my own practice for ten years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: What kind of practice?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: Oh, general practitioner.</span> <span id="s1217">I was a general practitioner.</span> <span id="s1218">And in the '60s, anti‑Semitism started to be more targeted.</span> <span id="s1219">It was not just a general uneasiness.</span> <span id="s1220">People were being targeted as Jews.</span> <span id="s1221">And not ____________________.</span> <span id="s1222">They werehow can I say that?</span> <span id="s1223">You were shown that you were different.</span> <span id="s1224">French society was starting to really become nationalistic.</span> <span id="s1225">And my understanding of that situation was that the most virulent collaborators and traitors of World War II, who had been sentenced to death or long jail period or even life sentence, through amnesty and so forth, all of a sudden were back in the streets.</span> <span id="s1226">And I recognized a few of them in Paris, because Paris is a village and you know everybody.</span> <span id="s1227">And with them coming out in the streetsbackand having as much power as before.</span> <span id="s1228">Somebody like Bousceau (ph.), who signed the agreements which allowed the French police to be after us and without those agreements the Germans would have been unable to arrest five Jews in France.</span> <span id="s1229">Bousceau had a brilliant career, and he was a friend of _________.</span> <span id="s1230">He was a friend of ___________.</span> <span id="s1231">And many of them, many of them whoso their attitude about the Jewsthey didn't want to kill the Jews, no.</span> <span id="s1232">No.</span> <span id="s1233">But their attitude about the Jews was the traditional attitude of France, which means that the Jewwhatever you doyou cannot be French.</span> <span id="s1234">You cannot be French.</span> <span id="s1235">To be French your ancestry has to beyou have to have a French name.</span> <span id="s1236">You have to be a ______, you have to be a _______, you have to beno, if your name is Bloom or Bloch or Levy, it doesn't matter if you have lived in France as long as and it doesn't matter, you are not French.</span> <span id="s1237">You are not French.</span> <span id="s1238">It doesn't matter if you lost a leg, if your father died in Verdun, it doesn't matter.</span> <span id="s1239">How can you be French?</span> <span id="s1240">You can be French a little bit if you convert to Catholicism.</span> <span id="s1241">Then okay, you arethings are better.</span> <span id="s1242">But if your father or your grandfather was a Russian Jew or a Polish Jew, even if you change your name, even if you get to be a priest, you are still a Jew.</span> <span id="s1243">Likewhat's his namethe bishop of Paris.</span> <span id="s1244">He's still Jewish.</span> <span id="s1245">So</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: Did you sense that the French were angry at the Jews for the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: No.</span> <span id="s1248">No.</span> <span id="s1249">No.</span> <span id="s1250">Not the people who think clearly.</span> <span id="s1251">No.</span> <span id="s1252">The French anti‑Semitism is really looking at the Jew as a foreign element.</span> <span id="s1253">And when you look at French history for a period ofgoing back to the 1300's until the 1800'sfor more than five hundred years the Jews had absolutely no impact in French history.</span> <span id="s1254">They didn't exist physically in France.</span> <span id="s1255">And they had absolutely no impact.</span> <span id="s1256">And when they started to have an impact on French history, it was essentially in the realm of banking and big money.</span> <span id="s1257">And that's why the Jews are associated with money, because that's when they became prominent.</span> <span id="s1258">And it's now that they are in science and medicine and so forth.</span></p> <p></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q: .</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">A:and medicine and so forth.</span> <span id="s1261">Sososoand the Catholic religion had always that teaching of the Jew killed quite.</span> <span id="s1262">The Jew isand the Jewish religion which is inferior to Christianity and it'sit'sand all the symbols of the cathedral andand in France.</span> <span id="s1263">All of the cathedrals have oneone of those with culture depicting the Jews as evil oror punished from their sins, so it's really ingrained and it doesn't seem that necessary that theythat they will condom the king of the Jews.</span> <span id="s1264">Not at all.</span> <span id="s1265">But Jew has to know which is his place or her place in French society.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: Do you feel differently about being a French Jew after the war than you had before?</span> <span id="s1267">Did it change your perception?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: Oh, yes, of course.</span> <span id="s1269">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1270">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1271">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1272">Yes, because sincesince the end of the warsee the French population before the war was about 300,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s1273">Most of those Jews were of falling origin and first generation.</span> <span id="s1274">And, so they were essentiallythey were notnot merchants.</span> <span id="s1275">Allallif they were merchants they were people who were people who were working in the market place.</span> <span id="s1276">You know, theytheythey werethey were reallytheirtheir socialthetheeconomically andandand socially the Jews that we knew were, I wouldn't say "poor," but they were really at the bottom.</span> <span id="s1277">They were at the bottom.</span> <span id="s1278">And after the war we had a big influx of Jews fromfrom eastern Europe from North Africa andand the second generation or third generation ofof the Jews born to Russian immigrants or Polish immigrants because the school system is so open went to higher education and all of a sudden they are engineers or .</span> <span id="s1279">They are higher ranking members of that corporation, of the other corporation and it creates a lot of resentment.</span> <span id="s1280">A lot of resentment.</span> <span id="s1281">A lot.</span> <span id="s1282">A lot.</span> <span id="s1283">It creates a lot of resentment also in the Jewish community because of the inter‑marriages, because of the conversions.</span> <span id="s1284">Ititit seemedsee, it's a very, very difficult situation.</span> <span id="s1285">Very, very difficult situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: So is this what motivated you to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A: Well, whatwhat motivated me to leave was the feeling that I didn't want to be onon the continent where that continent is essentially a enormous burden place forforforfor the Jews and the Jewish culture.</span> <span id="s1288">Overover the centuries they have totally destroyed ourourour culture.</span> <span id="s1289">And II felt that coming to the United State it's totally different because the United Statesall the culture excepted all the cultures, blend.</span> <span id="s1290">It's the only place in the world that I know where you go to a church which ononononon Saturday it's a synagogue and you have several around here.</span> <span id="s1291">It's the only place in the world where you go to a buffet for a Sunday brunch and they serve bagels and Matzo.</span> <span id="s1292">I saw that in Pittsburgh.</span> <span id="s1293">On Sunday I went down, Sunday brunch, bagels and lox and so forth and Matzo.</span> <span id="s1294">And everybody knows what Matzo is.</span> <span id="s1295">In France or England or a placeany place like that it was unheard and heard.</span> <span id="s1296">it's the only place that I know where on Christmas the Jews are working for the Christians, so they can stay home and celebrate.</span> <span id="s1297">It'sit'sand it's the only place that I know where anti‑Semitism was maybe of fervent as in France 50 years ago.</span> <span id="s1298">And I remember World War II and I remember talking to JewishJewish GIs and what they werewhatwhat they were putting up with was absolutely similar to what we were putting up with.</span> <span id="s1299">I saw them when I was in England before the end of the war the JewishJewishthey had, you know, Jewishlike a restaurant and so forth.</span> <span id="s1300">Jewish and we were comparing notes andbut now it's totally different.</span> <span id="s1301">Totally different.</span> <span id="s1302">I'm not saying that it's a perfect world.</span> <span id="s1303">There's no perfect world, but at least there is an effort made here toanti‑Semitism is considered as an illness.</span> <span id="s1304">It's not part of society.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">Q: What year did you come over here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A. '64.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: Was the adjustment difficult at all when you came over here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: No.</span> <span id="s1309">No.</span> <span id="s1310">No.</span> <span id="s1311">No.</span> <span id="s1312">Thethe only thing was the language, but I had the delusion that I spoke English andand I rapidly understood that I had to make major efforts to</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: Did all of this strengthen your sense of religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: Well, ififif youif you mean the religion by going to synagogue, the ritually and so forth, no.</span> <span id="s1315">No.</span> <span id="s1316">No.</span> <span id="s1317">No, butbut the sense of Judaism I always had andandandand I make a separation, in my mind at least, because I was raised in a nontraditionalI wouldn't say "not religious," no.</span> <span id="s1318">My parents were religious, but they didn't follow the ritual.</span> <span id="s1319">Theytheythey didn't eat kosher.</span> <span id="s1320">They didn't do this.</span> <span id="s1321">They didn't do that.</span> <span id="s1322">Butbut the sense thatthatthe deep sense ofof Judaism, we have.</span> <span id="s1323">I feel that'sthat's much more important thanthanthan, you know, repeating a prayer just because it's a prayer.</span> <span id="s1324">So that'sthat's what I'm trying totototo follow everyday.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Q: What sort of long term impact do you think that all of these experiences during the war still have on you today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: Thatthere is such thing as fate.</span> <span id="s1327">That things don't happen just like coincidence.</span> <span id="s1328">That there is fate.</span> <span id="s1329">There isthere islike gears working together and I know ifif that didn'tthat was not the case for us I don't know how we would have been able to survive.</span> <span id="s1330">It's a very strange feeling and that, in spite of fate, fate is not blind.</span> <span id="s1331">You have to help yourself also.</span> <span id="s1332">That's the most important step.</span> <span id="s1333">Thatthatyou are responsible for what happened to you if you don't know how to read the signs around you and that you have to do.</span> <span id="s1334">You cannot expect somebody else to do for you and I believe that's very Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: Do you believe in destiny?</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: No.</span> <span id="s1337">No.</span> <span id="s1338">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: .</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: .</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">Conclusion of interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0399 PAGE 77 USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0349 PAGE 2</span></p></body></html>
