BERKOWITZ</span></p> <p><span id="s11">September 18, 1989</span></p> <p><span id="s12">WH: …the first book you wrote was written in 1965…</span></p> <p><span id="s13">SB: It was published in 1965…originally I started it in the camps.</span> <span id="s14">It’s a story behind it.</span> <span id="s15">Whenever I had a chance, I wrote a few lines.</span> <span id="s16">I really wanted the world to know what’s going on with the Jews in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">WH: You were writing while you were in the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">SB: Yes, that was in ?</span> <span id="s19">Unterlose?</span> <span id="s20">it was a concentration camp and whenever I had a little time or chance, I wrote a few lines.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">WH: So you were keeping a diary.</span> <span id="s22">What would have happened if they would have caught you?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">SB: Well, this is exactly what I’m going to tell you.</span> <span id="s24">I was fearful.</span> <span id="s25">I knew the consequences, but I always wrote a few lines, and I kept it under my mattress, we slept on straw mattresses.</span> <span id="s26">One day we came back from our work, and I was informed that there was a search and whoever had something that we were not allowed to have, it was discovered, was punished severely.</span> <span id="s27">I ran immediately to look under my mattress and I found that little note.</span> <span id="s28">But I said to myself, evidently it was meant for me to destroy it.</span> <span id="s29">And I tore it up.</span> <span id="s30">However I said to myself, I will have it in mind with the first opportunity I have, I will continue, and I want to write a book, so that the world will really know what was going on.</span> <span id="s31">What atrocities the Germans were capable of.</span> <span id="s32">And when I came to the States I started slowly in Sweden when I was recovering from typhoid and different ailments, however, when I came to the States, I had my grandfather here, my mother’s father, they encouraged me very much to write that book.</span> <span id="s33">But my English was so limited, despite the fact that before the war I did learn some basics.</span> <span id="s34">I would say nothing more, that I wrote it in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s35">And I put it away.</span> <span id="s36">I didn’t know where to go about it, how to start, what to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">WH: Were you married then?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">SB: Yes.</span> <span id="s39">I had two children.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">WH: Were you working?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">SB: No, I stayed home…my husband had two jobs.</span> <span id="s42">And I knew that there was nothing I can do about it.</span> <span id="s43">I didn’t have the means, I didn’t have the people, the connections.</span> <span id="s44">So I put it away, for a long time until one day, quite a few years later, we came here in 1947.</span> <span id="s45">And…in 1962 or 1963 and our accountant came and struck up a conversation…and I told him that I had the ambition to publish a book.</span> <span id="s46">He said, ‘Did you write it?’</span> <span id="s47">I said, ‘Yes, in Yiddish.’</span> <span id="s48">He said, ‘Well translate it for me.’</span> <span id="s49">I said, ‘Mr. Englehardt, my English is limited.’</span> <span id="s50">He said, ‘Just the way you are talking to me, I want you to.’</span> <span id="s51">And that’s exactly what I did.</span> <span id="s52">And the publisher…immediately sent me a letter…that they would really be interested in publishing it and they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">WH: …so when your book came out, it was one of the earliest books that dealt with the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">SB: Yes…</span></p> <p><span id="s55">WH: How do you feel about having done these two books?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">SB: Well, you know, when the war ended and I found out that I’m the sole survivor, my mother perished, my father perished, I had one sister and one brother.</span> <span id="s57">I said, ‘What’s the purpose of my life?</span> <span id="s58">Where am I?’</span></p> <p><span id="s59">WH: …they had all perished?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">SB: My father died in the ghetto, Lodz, and my mother, my sister, went to their death in Auschwitz, and my brother later on too…so I started thinking, where am I heading?</span> <span id="s61">What’s my purpose in life?</span> <span id="s62">And I don’t know.</span> <span id="s63">At the beginning, was it worth surviving to find out that there’s nobody left?</span> <span id="s64">But evidently the fact that the Germans were defeated, and I’m here, had such an impulse in me, that I found something to say, ‘it was worthwhile, and I want to live.’</span> <span id="s65">And I said, ‘But one thing, I committed myself to tell the world about the German atrocities.’</span> <span id="s66">And whenever I had the chance-I speak on the Holocaust, yes, and this is why I wrote the two books.</span> <span id="s67">I was not looking for money, I was not looking for glory, my main purpose was, I committed myself to tell the world about the German atrocities, so I feel I accomplished what I really wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">WH: Do you feel that there were some things that you said, or maybe in the way in which you said them, that were different or that are different from that which is already been written on the subject?</span> <span id="s69">I ask you because there are many books on the camps.</span> <span id="s70">Do you feel that you said it in a special way, or do you feel that you just felt that you should add your own voice to what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">SB: No, I feel that those two books are really my own voice.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">WH: But what is unusual about them, compared to other books written on the same subject.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">SB: We.</span> <span id="s74">.</span> <span id="s75">it’s my autobiography, it’s exactly what I,-my experiences, and in both books I said, and whenever I speak on the Holocaust I say it too, that my experiences are very similar to the experiences of the Jew who was caught in Nazism in the Nazi (inaudible), however, we were all in different places.</span> <span id="s76">But it boiled down to one thing.</span> <span id="s77">Wherever we were, we were marked for murder.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">WH: So if there were 100 books on the subject, and yours was 101, since the goal of telling the world had already been accomplished by the first hundred, why do you feel you should add your own?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">SB: Alright.</span> <span id="s80">Because each one of us, as I said, we were all marked for murder, Hitler wanted to destroy us.</span> <span id="s81">Annihilation was his main aim.</span> <span id="s82">However, each one had a different experience, tell something, add something about the German atrocity.</span> <span id="s83">I’m sure that I had moments where I faced atrocities, what somebody else didn’t.</span> <span id="s84">And each group tells about them.</span> <span id="s85">And it’s important that we should all tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">WH: You feel that there is an accumulated weight of evidence?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">SB: Absolutely, Absolutely.</span> <span id="s88">Yes.</span> <span id="s89">I think that they now, with all the books, and with all the proof, I think the evidence is so overwhelming that those who try to deny it, they have one reason, in the back of their mind.</span> <span id="s90">Anti-Semitic reasons to deny the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s91">Otherwise, the world knows that this happened and that 6 million Jews who were wiped out because they were Jews, and those who survived, survived in a way, that you see it, and the rest see them, but nobody can see their hearts.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">WH: So, the first book is called, ‘Where Are My Brothers, From the Ghetto to the Gas Chambers.’</span> <span id="s93">Sarah Bick Berkowitz.</span> <span id="s94">And the second one is called, ‘In Search of Ashes.’</span> <span id="s95">…and this is published in 1984, and the first one us in 1965…were you able to get the books reviewed…?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">SB: I saw it in the ‘Jewish Press,’ I also saw it in the ‘Emunah,’…</span></p> <p><span id="s97">WH: Did you get reactions from people who read the books?</span> <span id="s98">…whoever read it.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">SB: …not only friends, like I went to the dentist, and the secretary and the receptionist, she said, ‘You know, Sarah, I was actually with you.</span> <span id="s100">That’s how much I enjoyed that book, wherever you went, and unfortunately it was a very tragic (inaudible).’</span> <span id="s101">So I got some good opinions about-yes.</span> <span id="s102">It’s a strange story.</span> <span id="s103">I was not trying to be dramatic.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">WH: Are you happy you did it?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">SB: Very.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">WH: Do you have any regrets?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">SB: No…(although) if Mr. Weitzman was alive, I would definitely go with my second book to Mr. Weit-because I felt, that he was more friend than businessman.</span> <span id="s108">He wanted me, he knew that this is my ambition, to tell the world.</span> <span id="s109">And he made it very possible for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">WH: How did your children feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">SB: My children were very, very proud about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">WH: And very supportive?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">SB: Very supportive.</span> <span id="s114">As a matter of fact, you read the book, you know each one really had a deal in encouraging me…</span></p> <p><span id="s115">WH: …of the books that you read on the Holocaust…which ones do you think the most of?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">SB: Well…the book that I read by Leon Uris, who was never really in Warsaw, (inaudible) left such an impact on me, that I had to be convinced that he was not a survivor.</span> <span id="s117">Excellent writer…and then I started reading…by Herman Wouk, ‘The Winds of War,’ and I just couldn’t go through with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">WH: What about Elie Wiesel’s books?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">SB: Not one did I read, I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s120">I respect him as an intellectual, but I think that he monopolizes too much the Holocaust .</span></p> <p><span id="s121">WH: What do you mean, ‘monopolize?’</span></p> <p><span id="s122">SB: You know, constantly, one person is pushed to talk about it, and he is the one who wants to do it, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s123">There are so many survivors that have stories to tell, that are capable, but there’s only a small bunch of people who are always in the forefront.</span> <span id="s124">And I resent it to a degree.</span> <span id="s125">I really resent it to a degree.</span> <span id="s126">I respect Elie Wiesel, very much as an intellectual, but why only a few?</span> <span id="s127">Among the survivors there are so many that educated themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">WH: Why do you think that happened, that so many of the survivors that educated themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">SB: Well…there’s one…a Congressman, Tom Lantos…I spoke to him in Washington…when we had a gathering there which was in 1983.</span> <span id="s130">First we had the American gathering, the World gathering is in 1981, which I attended.</span> <span id="s131">I try to attend all these gatherings, it’s part of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">WH: Why do you attend?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">SB: I identify with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">WH: …do you feel differently when you are with survivors than when you are with other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">SB: I feel very comfortable with American people.</span> <span id="s136">Let’s put it this way.</span> <span id="s137">I acclimate myself from the very beginning.</span> <span id="s138">I tried to speak the language.</span> <span id="s139">As a matter of fact, today, I am more comfortable with English than I am in Polish.</span> <span id="s140">If I have to write a Polish letter, I say to myself, I can’t believe that you went to school, you went to High school-so I’m very comfortable, however, when we are among survivors, you know, we bring up the-no matter what we talk about.</span> <span id="s141">We can start off with a wedding, we can start off with a beautiful dress for parties, somehow, we always reach the point when we talking about our survival, about those that didn’t survive, so naturally we most comfortable among this group.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">WH: Is it like that there is a feeling that if you think of it as unfinished business, something being unfinished…is there a feeling that if you review it, and review it that maybe there’ll be something new, that maybe you’ll get an answer to something like the answer to the question of why you survived and others didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">SB: Well, we have one question, and the question is nagging, since I was in camp.</span> <span id="s144">‘God, why did you have-You forsaken us.’</span> <span id="s145">This is,-as much as we believe, I come from a religious home, but we couldn’t help asking the question, ‘God, why have you forsaken us?’</span> <span id="s146">Until this day, we are Sabbath observant, I believe in God, but that does not deny the fact that I question, why did He allow it?</span> <span id="s147">I mean, you want to punish your children, but don’t go to the point of killing 6 million.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">WH: Have you ever come up with the answer to that question, even partial?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">SB: No.</span> <span id="s150">It’s always bothering me.</span> <span id="s151">I always feel that what happened, we were punished much too severely.</span> <span id="s152">I know the Satmar don’t feel this way, but I’m not a Satmar-they feel we deserved it because the Jews were not religious enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">WH: Isn’t it true that the irreligious Jews came to America in the early part of the 20th century, most of the religious ones stayed behind.</span> <span id="s154">And they got it worse than the irreligious ones who came here…so if God wanted to punish people for their sins, the ones who came here were bigger sinners.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">WH: Yeh, it’s the right philosophy.</span> <span id="s156">I agree with you however, the Satmars believe differently.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">WH: If you are always asking the question, can you really believe in God?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">SB: Yes, I can believe.</span> <span id="s159">I’ll tell you why.</span> <span id="s160">Even if you like the father or mother, yeh?</span> <span id="s161">You love them.</span> <span id="s162">But sometimes you don’t exactly agree, and you question why did they do this or why did they-I do believe.</span> <span id="s163">I mean, I feel that having some belief-.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">WH: You just have (inaudible) timer (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s165">SB: Yes, I have a (illegible) (inaudible).</span> <span id="s166">Yes, absolutely, I said, ‘Why did you punish us so severely?’</span> <span id="s167">Yes, I do, I will never deny it, and my children know it, but I believe our house was and is-.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">WH: Were you able to be religious right after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">SB: No, I wasn’t.</span> <span id="s170">It took, after the war, as I said, I questioned why is my existence, where am I heading, what am I going to do all alone in this world, so before I decided that maybe my purpose is to tell the world about the Nazi atrocities, I was very bitter.</span> <span id="s171">That was the-.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">WH: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">SB: The period of bitterness.</span> <span id="s174">And I said, I questioned God and I didn’t.</span> <span id="s175">But now, I question, but I am more into religion.</span> <span id="s176">That time, I questioned, and I didn’t want to believe in anything.</span> <span id="s177">I said, ‘If that’s what happened, maybe I shouldn’t say it, where were You?’</span></p> <p><span id="s178">WH: When did you come back to it?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">SB: Well that’s what I’m trying to tell you.</span> <span id="s180">But in my heart, I was raised in a Jewish family, in a-not a fanatic-but-.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">WH: Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">SB: Yes.</span> <span id="s183">And in my heart I knew that I could never, never be completely fearless, completely Godless.</span> <span id="s184">And then when I came to America, my uncle has a shul, and I saw Yiddishkeit and it sort of came back to me.</span> <span id="s185">And when the children were born, I decided I’m raising them in a religious way.</span> <span id="s186">And I send them to Hebrew Schools, they went to Central, and thank God, Cecil (?)</span> <span id="s187">is modern, but religious, and Florence the same thing, and Shellie, is not religious.</span> <span id="s188">And it hurts me.</span> <span id="s189">(inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s190">WH: Is she married?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">SB: She’s married and…she lives in Berkeley, California.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">WH: What kind of guy did she marry?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">SB: A guy who is born Jewish, that’s all.</span> <span id="s194">That’s the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">WH: He’s an American.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">SB: Yes.</span> <span id="s197">And I send them my candlesticks, to light candles, and I hope she’ll oblige us and-.</span> <span id="s198">Shellie’s pregnant now…her first.</span> <span id="s199">Shellie is 35, she is the youngest…her husband is…a social worker, a psychologist, he has a very good position…</span></p> <p><span id="s200">WH: …did Shellie go to Hebrew school?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">SB: She graduated Central…and went to Barnard…and within the four years, there was a change, a transition.</span> <span id="s202">I think it was something in herself.</span> <span id="s203">Yeh.</span> <span id="s204">And I tried, my husband tried, we all tried.</span> <span id="s205">She is a wonderful girl, don’t misunderstand me, but as far as religion,-no.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">WH: Not interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">SB: Not at all.</span> <span id="s208">Not only not interested, but sometimes she’s even against, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s209">But I hope maybe now, that she’ll have a child that she’ll-.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">WH: …is your husband a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">SB: Yes…and he comes from a family of ten…</span></p> <p><span id="s212">WH: I would like to speak to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">SB: Yah, well if you have a second chance, if you ever-but I think he’ll be most comfortable in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s214">As a matter of fact last year they came from the Center from the Holocaust Studies, from Avenue J, and they asked for an interview for tape.</span> <span id="s215">At the beginning, you know, it’s very painful.</span> <span id="s216">It’s very, very painful.</span> <span id="s217">And some people can do it.</span> <span id="s218">I mastered it, but-.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">WH: Well, for me, it’s more after the war that I’m interested in…what does he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">SB: He was in business as a furrier, but about ten years ago he almost lost his vision, he has cataracts, and he has two eyes, but three surgeries, cause one surgery was not successful.</span> <span id="s221">And he had to give up the business.</span> <span id="s222">He felt, like completely useless, you know?</span> <span id="s223">Until three years ago somebody suggested that he come into Astoria for a few hours, there’s a fur shop, in which he’s managing and it keeps him so happy.</span> <span id="s224">He feels that he’s still accomplishing something.</span> <span id="s225">Useful, yeh.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">WH: How old is he?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">SB: He’s in his late 70’s…</span></p> <p><span id="s228">WH: What year were you born in?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">SB: 1924…</span></p> <p><span id="s230">WH: You’re in good health?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">SB: Yes.</span> <span id="s232">Thank God.</span> <span id="s233">Not my husband, not I, I mean, if you want to complain about things, there’s always a little this, a little that, but the two of us don’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">WH: Florence is your middle child…she’s 41…and she has three girls…</span></p> <p><span id="s235">SB: The oldest is named after my sister, Muira, because Florence knew what my sister meant to me…and the little one is named after my husband’s sister.</span> <span id="s236">And Cecil has…(two girls and one boy).</span></p> <p><span id="s237">WH: What does Florence’s husband do?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">SB: He’s a teacher, and he’s also an assistant professor…in college…</span></p> <p><span id="s239">WH: And Cecil’s husband is?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">SB: In business…he’s a brilliant, brilliant businessman…he, and his father and his brother, they bought the (Brown’s) hotel…</span></p> <p><span id="s241">WH: What is your impression of the people who are involved in the gathering of the survivors…do they monopolize it?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">SB: That’s what I said.</span> <span id="s243">It’s the same.</span> <span id="s244">It’s Benjamin Meed, which I respect, it’s Elie Wiesel, and-.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">WH: Elie Zborowski.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">SB: Yes, that’s right.</span> <span id="s247">I respect these people very much.</span> <span id="s248">But I’m sure that among the survivors, that there are others that cannot come up with the amount that Benjamin Meed comes up, and the others, but they are really, people that could speak for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">WH: How do you feel when they make a…gala dinner…at the Waldorf Astoria for example.</span> <span id="s250">Does it seem Okay to you?</span> <span id="s251">Does it seem like a good thing to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">SB: To raise money for the Museum they are going to do-absolutely!</span></p> <p><span id="s253">WH: Some people feel that the Holocaust should not be a cause for any kind of celebration…a commemoration in the shul is one thing, but to make a 7 course dinner, that is a contradiction.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">SB: No.</span> <span id="s255">If they make it to raise money for the museum, and this is one way they can do it, I really have not any-.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">WH: More power to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">SB: Yes.</span> <span id="s258">I don’t feel that this is not right, no.</span> <span id="s259">Because, after all, the survivor, as I said, we accomplished a lot, we established ourselves, we are in business, we have families,-and we go places, we live.</span> <span id="s260">Right?</span> <span id="s261">What’s in our heart we know.</span> <span id="s262">But still, people go to bar mitzvahs, they go to weddings, they go to elaborate place, and especially if it’s a place, even if it’s a dinner, they raise money, that will help the cause of the Holocaust like the museum (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s263">WH: You asked the question after the war…’How could you go on?’</span> <span id="s264">And you said that one motivation was to tell the story.</span> <span id="s265">Is that a key thing that helps you rebuild your life, that helps give you a purpose for living?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">SB: Well, as I said, right after the war, when I realized I’m alone, at the beginning, we were looking for names were posted.</span> <span id="s267">I was hoping against hope, because I knew that my brother had perished in Auschwitz, I knew that my sister and mother died in Auschwitz, and I knew that my father died in the ghetto, so I was hoping against hope, when I was reading these posters, and when I realized that I’m left alone, that I’m facing a lonely world, all alone.</span> <span id="s268">I was very down.</span> <span id="s269">That was the time I despaired, and I really didn’t know whether I want to live.</span> <span id="s270">But then I said to myself, ‘Look, the fact that you are here, and Hitler is dead, it means something to you, right?’</span> <span id="s271">So I found a reason to go on with life, and one of the first reasons, was maybe come here to tell the world about the German atrocities.</span> <span id="s272">But, later on, I realized this is one of the reasons, but I can’t go my whole life with this reason.</span> <span id="s273">So I got married, and I had children, and I went on like any other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">WH: Where did you meet your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">SB: In Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">WH: Did you come on the ‘Gripshole’?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">SB: Yes…in 1947.</span> <span id="s278">At the time my husband did not have his visa.</span> <span id="s279">I came with Cecil, she was 7 months old…and what can I tell you?</span> <span id="s280">The fact that we were separated again, I can’t describe, because we dread separation.</span> <span id="s281">Separation to us is something that we really dread and always will.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">WH: …you dreaded separation from him?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">SB: Yes.</span> <span id="s284">So that was a moment of terrible fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">WH: …do you feel that as a survivor, that you…worry more, about your children than the average parent?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">SB: Perhaps I, myself was not as much aware of it, until Cecil brought it out.</span> <span id="s287">The Emunah Organization was making a film about the survivors, and some survivors spoke up, and some children of survivors, the second generation…and then Cecil came out and she said, ‘Now I realize that growing up in a house of survivors is different than in a home of the American people.</span> <span id="s288">My mother was always worried when we went some place, if we gonna come back, if we’re not taken, my mother always tried to have food in the house, in case of shortage.’</span> <span id="s289">…when the children went out someplace, I worried terribly, ‘Are they gonna come back?</span> <span id="s290">Is anybody gonna get them?’</span> <span id="s291">You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s292">That feeling.</span> <span id="s293">(inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s294">WH: …do you think that what happened in Europe could happen in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">SB: I gave it thought, many times, and I’m not the only one who does.</span> <span id="s296">And, I always-you see I love Israel.</span> <span id="s297">And I always put out a lot of trust, and I know that as strong as Israel is, the stronger we are, and the less fear we should have that something like this will happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">WH: Do you think Israel will prevent it from happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">SB: Well, we have a home, and the world looks different at us…it’s a small country, but, when we compare it to the time when we really went into the Holocaust, we were homeless.</span> <span id="s300">We had nothing, so I feel much stronger now.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">WH: Were your parents Zionists?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">SB: Yes.</span> <span id="s303">My (great) grandfather was the founder of the Mizrachi…what happened was, when he first came up with Mizrachi, and he combined religion with education, the rabbis condemned him.</span> <span id="s304">They said, ‘How do you combine religion with education?</span> <span id="s305">A woman should never go to college.’</span> <span id="s306">And my grandfather said, ‘Yes, a girl should be educated.’</span> <span id="s307">My mother’s sister was a doctor, M.D., so many years ago.</span> <span id="s308">They all college graduates.</span> <span id="s309">My mother, who was born in 1898…she was a stenographer for (?</span> <span id="s310">name?)</span> <span id="s311">.</span> <span id="s312">an educated woman…my mother’s grandfather, and he was the first one who came out to combine religion with education…in Lithuania, Vilna…and the windows were broken, the doors were broken, my great-grandfather was beaten until the world finally accepted that the Mizrachi is a most wonderful institution to combine education with Zionism…</span></p> <p><span id="s313">WH: After the war did you think of going to Israel to live?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">SB: Very much so…however, I knew I had nobody there.</span> <span id="s315">I didn’t know that I had relatives there.</span> <span id="s316">I knew that I had a grandfather here.</span> <span id="s317">And I wanted family.</span> <span id="s318">I wanted family so badly that I came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">WH: …did he (your grandfather)send you the affidavit?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">WB: Yes…</span></p> <p><span id="s321">WH: …you were in Israel in 1981, I guess you were there other times too, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">SB: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">WH: Do you ever feel sorry that you didn’t go to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">SB: No, I don’t feel sorry that I didn’t go, but what I’m trying to do, is to convince my husband for years, already, that we should settle in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">WH: To retire there.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">SB: Yeh.</span> <span id="s327">But he doesn’t agree with me.</span> <span id="s328">He says, ‘I know.’</span> <span id="s329">Because there is an age difference, you know.</span> <span id="s330">‘I know you gonna join the Emunah, you gonna run around,’ he’ll be in, ‘What will I do?’</span> <span id="s331">He’s afraid that he’ll be lonely there.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">WH: …does he have friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">SB: He’s not really the social type.</span> <span id="s334">He’s a wonderful man, don’t misunderstand, but when he’s home he loves gardening, he has a beautiful garden, he likes to play chess…he always finds something to do.</span> <span id="s335">He’s not a man who will sit.</span> <span id="s336">He either works, or he gardens, or he likes to play chess, or he finds some-.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">END OF SIDE ONE TAPE ONE SIDE TWO TAPE ONE</span></p> <p><span id="s338">SB: Three years ago I received a call, in January, from the Holocaust studies, they submitted my name because they want to have a few survivors to speak on the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s339">Now, there was not only survivors, there was Elizabeth Holzman was there too, as a representative… they kept me on the phone for over an hour, and I know why, to test me, how my English is, if I can converse, if I can talk about the subject, if I don’t break down, and then she said she’d like to interview me more, but the taping was on April 22, 1986, and that’s when we had Elizabeth and Professor Yaffa Eliach, and we have two other survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">WH: What channel was that on?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">SB: Channel Nine…and everybody spoke about the Holocaust, about their own experiences.</span> <span id="s342">I have a video.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">WH: Were you impressed by Yaffa Eliach?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">SB: Yes.</span> <span id="s345">I am always impressed by her.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">WH: …do you ever feel like it was all a dream, like it never happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">SB: I can’t feel like that it’s a dream, no, because I have too many dreams about it.</span> <span id="s348">And it always reminds me that it was very realistic.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">WH: You were in labor camps and concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">SB: Yah.</span> <span id="s351">I was in the Loge ghetto, 4 and a half years…(talking Yiddish about ?</span> <span id="s352">Rumkovsky?</span> <span id="s353">…and the times in the Loge ghetto…).</span></p> <p><span id="s354">WH: …which camp were you in?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">SB: In Auschwitz I was in Birkenau…my mother and my sister were sent to the left immediately to die…my mother was a walking skeleton…my sister was 15, but she was underdeveloped…my brother was spared momentarily…he was overlooked.</span> <span id="s356">But when it came to me, Mengele stopped me.</span> <span id="s357">And he said to me, (needs translation).</span> <span id="s358">Here I see a good looking German, and I was completely oblivious to the fact that Auschwitz is a death machinery, and at the time, we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s359">And I answered him nicely, (needs translation).</span> <span id="s360">And he pointed to the right.</span> <span id="s361">To live.</span> <span id="s362">To exist.</span> <span id="s363">Live.</span> <span id="s364">Whatever you want to call it-then I saw that each one, before me, went on the cattle train, was given a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s365">This was just to humiliate us.</span> <span id="s366">They knew good and well, that we’ll never live to eat that bread, because the conditions on these cattle trains were indescribable.</span> <span id="s367">There were hundreds in one car.</span> <span id="s368">People were sitting in their own excrement.</span> <span id="s369">People were crying for drink of water, especially children.</span> <span id="s370">Nobody thought about eating.</span> <span id="s371">They knew it.</span> <span id="s372">So I thought that my brother’s loaf of bread was nibbled, and mine wasn’t touched.</span> <span id="s373">So I felt sorry, and I left my line, and I ran to him, and I exchanged, and I gave him the whole one, and I took the one that was nibbled.</span> <span id="s374">If I wasn’t meant to live, they would shoot me immediately, because this was called, ‘fluk’ in German that I was fleeing.</span> <span id="s375">Nobody said anything, I went back to my line.</span> <span id="s376">So, here within half an hour, Mengele stopped me, put me to the right, and I went back to my line, and nobody killed me.</span> <span id="s377">So, I was probably meant to live.</span> <span id="s378">What can I tell you.</span> <span id="s379">To live, and to have a torch for people that did not survive.</span> <span id="s380">And, that’s that.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">WH: Was there a time when you had to use your head to survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">SB: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s383">Oh yes!</span> <span id="s384">Oh yah!</span> <span id="s385">Many times I’m thinking, is it sheer luck, or did I help it?</span> <span id="s386">And I think that it was a combination.</span> <span id="s387">I was meant to live, because I see there was another instance, in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s388">We were standing for (needs translation-head counting) and I felt terrible shivers, and I came back to my bunk bed and a nurse came, and I said to her, I had very high temperature.</span> <span id="s389">And I didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s390">And she said to me that it was a kidney infection.</span> <span id="s391">A cold.</span> <span id="s392">She said, ‘Look, you have two choices, keep quiet and go to the (needs translation), head counting, or you can go to the ambulance, meaning the hospital.’</span> <span id="s393">But intuition, I had a foreboding about the hospital.</span> <span id="s394">I chose to keep quiet, stand at (needs translation) with high temperature, shaking and shivering.</span> <span id="s395">To find out later, that that ambulance was Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s396">It was the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s397">So here again, three instances in two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">WH: That was a matter of luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">SB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">WH: Was there any place where you-.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">SB: Yes, now we get to that.</span> <span id="s402">Then I was sent to…various places…from Auschwitz…to work, but when the Germans saw us, that we had no hair, they were frightened.</span> <span id="s403">They didn’t want us.</span> <span id="s404">They rejected us.</span> <span id="s405">That was the moment when our fate was-wait.</span> <span id="s406">Are we to be condemned?</span> <span id="s407">Are we to die in Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s408">Are we to be shot?</span> <span id="s409">They had various methods of killing people.</span> <span id="s410">What should they do with us?</span> <span id="s411">So, the train was going back and forth, back and forth.</span> <span id="s412">Finally, they decided they sending us to Bergen-Belsen That was a make-shift camp.</span> <span id="s413">From Bergen-Belsen we were sent to /Unterlout?</span> <span id="s414">…that was probably the only time where we were resting a little bit.</span> <span id="s415">However, we complained we used to work, so the Germans had no choice but to send us to (?</span> <span id="s416">Unterlout?)</span> <span id="s417">.</span> <span id="s418">In (?</span> <span id="s419">Unterlout?)</span> <span id="s420">there were 800 Hungarian girls, and 100 Polish.</span> <span id="s421">And the animosity among the Hungarian and the Polish is a shame to admit.</span> <span id="s422">Among Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">WH: Why did it exist?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">SB: The Hungarians and the Polish never got along.</span> <span id="s425">They considered themselves superior to the Polish people Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">WH: Were these religious girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">SB: Well, who knew in the camp what we are really.</span> <span id="s428">We were not human.</span> <span id="s429">We didn’t look like human.</span> <span id="s430">We didn’t feel like human.</span> <span id="s431">We felt like we are just somebody who-.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">WH: Also a language barrier?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">SB: Of course, we didn’t know, but nobody had a chance to speak anyway.</span> <span id="s434">That was not the reason.</span> <span id="s435">There was animosity long before the camps, and in the camps it definitely came out.</span> <span id="s436">So we were sent to (?</span> <span id="s437">Unterlose?)</span> <span id="s438">and there were a 100 Polish girls and we were sent to (inaudible) digging canals.</span> <span id="s439">They needed these canals for nothing.</span> <span id="s440">But just so, make us work.</span> <span id="s441">All of a sudden, the (inaudible) German, he was probably a Kaiser Wielhelm soldier.</span> <span id="s442">Most beautiful person.</span> <span id="s443">If he would be alive, I would not hesitate to help that man with anything I could.</span> <span id="s444">Each one was equal to him when the Germans were not around, because,-one German could be good, but two together, one was afraid of the other.</span> <span id="s445">They had to be bad…(needs translation-about Hitler).</span> <span id="s446">All of a sudden he called out, ‘(needs translation).’</span> <span id="s447">Who can chop wood.</span> <span id="s448">Nobody said, everybody thought it was a trick.</span> <span id="s449">I picked up my hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">WH: Why did you pick up your hand?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">SB: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s452">That was impulse.</span> <span id="s453">I really don’t know why I did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">WH: Did that save your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">SB: Well, what happened was, digging the canals, people got very sick, it was very cold, they collapsed whatever, I-was allowed to stay in a little wood.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">WH: But this is also luck because you didn’t know-.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">SB: No, I didn’t know…but, the only thing, I used my head but subconsciously.</span> <span id="s458">And, of course I had it much better than everybody, because one, they were outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">WH: …the animosity between the Poles and the Hungarians…do you think it continued in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">SB: Not to that degree, God forbid!</span> <span id="s461">To some extent, absolutely… I don’t know where I belong, because my father was really from Bratoslovia.</span> <span id="s462">.</span> <span id="s463">He never accepted Polish citizenship…so in a way, I’m not really Polish.</span> <span id="s464">I was born there-but I still identify with Hungarian too, because I have great sentiment from my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">WH: …you could be Galiciana…</span></p> <p><span id="s466">SB: I don’t know why they made up that story with the Galiciana.</span> <span id="s467">The only thing about the Galiciana, they spoke a beautiful Polish, were the Jews, from different city, did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">WH: They made up what?</span> <span id="s469">That the Galicians are thieves, you can’t trust them…</span></p> <p><span id="s470">SB: That they sly, like in a way, yah.</span> <span id="s471">Naa, I met a lot of Galiciana here, and I don’t see any difference.</span> <span id="s472">It’s just like they said, there was this Onelm…and they have quite a few (smart people there) and they labeled it.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">WH: Where is your husband from?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">SB: (?)</span> <span id="s475">Czechoslovakia…</span></p> <p><span id="s476">WH: …when you first came here, you came in on the S.S.?</span> <span id="s477">Gripsholm?</span> <span id="s478">right, and in what month?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">SB: I came October 27, 1947.</span> <span id="s480">I came with Cecil (pronounced: ‘seal’) in my arms, she was 7 months old…and I was pregnant with Florence…that was a lonely trip without my husband…</span></p> <p><span id="s481">WH: …were the Swedes nice?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">SB: Very nice.</span> <span id="s483">However they were glad when we left…</span></p> <p><span id="s484">WB: …your grandfather sent for the affidavit, and when you came in, what was it like when the boat sailed into the harbor…did you see the Statue of Liberty?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">SB: I didn’t know about it.</span> <span id="s486">I saw it, but I didn’t realize what it was.</span> <span id="s487">All I wanted is to have a home, have a place.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">WH: When you got off the boat, who greeted you?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">SB: Yes…I came down with Cecil in my arms, and I remembered my grandfather from his visit in Loge, and somehow I recognized him immediately, and I came out and there was my mother’s two sisters waiting.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">WH: Was he a religious man?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">SB: Yes…he had his own synagogue in Flatbush…but he lost it…he didn’t worry about mortgages…</span></p> <p><span id="s492">WH: Who helped you the most when you came?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">SB: Well, it was a very tough situation.</span> <span id="s494">I didn’t expect, really too much, but I expected a little more than I got.</span> <span id="s495">My aunt who lives on 23rd Street, who has the shul, that was 41 years ago, they were limited in funds, very.</span> <span id="s496">She really couldn’t help me.</span> <span id="s497">The one that helped me was the aunt in the Bronx.</span> <span id="s498">I came to her.</span> <span id="s499">She would not let me go to the HIAS.</span> <span id="s500">This was the biggest mistake.</span> <span id="s501">She was childless.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">WH: Why didn’t she let you go to the HIAS?’</span></p> <p><span id="s503">SB: She wanted me to be with her.</span> <span id="s504">But I didn’t realize that that aunt had a lot of psychological problems.</span> <span id="s505">Like, her shades had to be drawn because nobody should see her, and she was a wonderful person, charitable, but had problems.</span> <span id="s506">And I was not-it was not for me to take these problems.</span> <span id="s507">I was still sore.</span> <span id="s508">You know, I went through so much.</span> <span id="s509">So that was a mistake.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">WH: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">SB: She was a very nervous woman and I needed a little more calm (inaudible)-I was just out of the war.</span> <span id="s512">And, I should have gone to the HIAS, because my husband wasn’t here…my grandfather arranged with the HIAS because he had an influence there, they knew him very well.</span> <span id="s513">So a representative from the HIAS came, and they said, ‘Come, we have a room for you and your child, everything, until you can-.’</span> <span id="s514">-and my aunt came over and (inaudible) she started crying, she said I’m coming to her.</span> <span id="s515">And this was the mistake.</span> <span id="s516">So the beginning was a little-.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">WH: How long did you stay with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">SB: I stayed with her two weeks…she was not only hovering over me, she was hovering over the baby, like its her-she was childless.</span> <span id="s519">You know, like I didn’t exist and I resented it…so I went to Mr. Herman Hollander…a friend of my grandfather, and I went to him, he lived in Boro Park…and I said, ‘Mr. Hollander, I can’t be anymore with my aunt’…and I said, ‘I don’t know what to do, my husband is not here, and I’m here with a little kid.</span> <span id="s520">And my family cannot help out because my aunt has three little rooms and four children and financially they’re not comfortable.’</span> <span id="s521">He said, ‘Don’t worry, I want you to come to me until your husband comes.’</span> <span id="s522">And they were very gracious about it.</span> <span id="s523">I moved in.</span> <span id="s524">So he asked me if I want to be upstairs (inaudible).</span> <span id="s525">I said, ‘All I want is a little privacy, because I really went through the (inaudible) weeks a lot.’</span> <span id="s526">So I chose to have the basement.</span> <span id="s527">And I wouldn’t say that I wasn’t living fear alone with a child-so the beginning wasn’t easy.</span> <span id="s528">Really, really not easy.</span> <span id="s529">Even though I had relatives here.</span> <span id="s530">I knew they wanted to do everything for me, but they couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">WH: How long until your husband joined you?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">SB: Seven weeks later.</span> <span id="s533">And he came, two days later Mr. Hollander sent somebody from the company and helped him look for work.</span> <span id="s534">Two days the man rested.</span> <span id="s535">He was always a man who wanted to provide for his family, and work for his family.</span> <span id="s536">And he wound up with a job as a furrier.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">WH: Was he trained in that before?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">SB: Close to it…in Europe they had farms…</span></p> <p><span id="s539">WH: …how did the Americans treat you?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">SB: That worried me.</span> <span id="s541">It left a terrible scare on me.</span> <span id="s542">I could not stand it, when somebody said to me, ‘This is a greenhorn?</span> <span id="s543">A greener?’</span> <span id="s544">It’s like giving me a knife in the back.</span> <span id="s545">Why remind me something that I don’t want to be reminded.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">WH: …and you went to school at night, how often?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">SB: Not enough.</span> <span id="s548">We went to school, I think it was twice or three times a week.</span> <span id="s549">So, I started with the first grade, but they kept on sending me from higher and higher grades, and I graduated with what they called, parochial school, within a few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">WH: Did you ever entertain the idea…of college?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">SB: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s552">I wasn’t ambitious enough, and my grandfather told me, (?</span> <span id="s553">dum midt thine kup, ga, ga?)</span> <span id="s554">he was encouraging me.</span> <span id="s555">I don’t know whether it was an excuse, but I really could not have anybody sit with my children.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">WH: …but not too many survivors wrote two books.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">SB: Well, but I think I said it in the beginning, this book deals with my personal experiences, so it does not need a background, real education, it just that I like to write, and there was some talent, so I was able to put it into a book.</span> <span id="s558">But I could have done much more, as far as education.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">WH: You clearly value education…and rather than spend money on yourself, you’d rather spend it on your children.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">SB: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">WH: Tell me how you sacrificed.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">SB: Well,-because we lived over a store which was not the most comfortable for us, there was a fish store underneath, and you know, the smell was sometimes not the most pleasant.</span> <span id="s563">And I had a choice.</span> <span id="s564">Move, but I will not be able to pay for the education.</span> <span id="s565">So I decided that the children’s education is most important, and my husband went along with me.</span> <span id="s566">And, I mean, playing piano is not education, but it’s musical education, that was something I had a dream about.</span> <span id="s567">That all the children should play piano too.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">WH: And did they?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">SB: Oh, they all do!</span> <span id="s570">All-terrific.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">WH: Why piano?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">SB: I had a cousin.</span> <span id="s573">My mother’s sister’s son.</span> <span id="s574">He is a professor, a conductor in Belgium, a very great, known man.</span> <span id="s575">He started out as a pianist, and I always envied him.</span> <span id="s576">So I said, the first thing I want to do is to give my children piano lessons.</span> <span id="s577">And I remember, I had nothing in my living room-two broken chairs that somebody gave me and a broken couch.</span> <span id="s578">And I said to my husband, ‘I would love a piano.’</span> <span id="s579">And to this day, I am grateful to him, for understanding me, and saying yes and I remember, we took a drawer from that broken chest, not from here, from the old apartment, to match up the wood.</span> <span id="s580">I wasn’t looking for quality, but to match up the colors-but, my happiness, the joy when they brought in the piano, and when Cecil got her first lesson, is indescribable.</span> <span id="s581">And I was very fortunate, because usually you don’t buy a piano, you rented-you test whether your children would really take to it.</span> <span id="s582">Because I remember we literally, whatever I had to spend, I really spent much less, having in mind that we have to make payments for the piano.</span> <span id="s583">It was really a sacrifice on our part.</span> <span id="s584">And my husband went along with it very nicely, he made the payments and I remember buying a suit was out of the question, or buying some clothes (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s585">WH: No vacations?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">SB: No-o-o,-Well, vacations, in a way, yes.</span> <span id="s587">The first vacation we took was to Lake Peekskill.</span> <span id="s588">But that wasn’t on our own feet.</span> <span id="s589">That was thanks to my uncle, my mother’s brother who really helped us a lot.</span> <span id="s590">And he-made sure that we go on a summer vacation,</span></p> <p><span id="s591">WH: He paid for the vacation?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">SB: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">WH: That was very nice of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">SB: He was a big help.</span> <span id="s595">A BIG, big help-.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">WH: What did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">SB: He was a rabbi…very educated.</span> <span id="s598">He was a rabbi without a shul.</span> <span id="s599">What he did, he could have done MUCH more with his life.</span> <span id="s600">He was for people.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">WH: …is Florence more modern Orthodox, or more to the Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">SB: I would think they lean to the Right, but yet they manage to be modern too.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">WH: …Amit’-magazine-used to be Mizrachi-.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">SB: What happened to the Mizrachi, (inaudible) Mizrachi Women’s Organization, changed their name to Emunan.</span> <span id="s605">So, I am automatically in the Eminah, but not with my heart.</span> <span id="s606">It bothers me-ALWAYS!</span></p> <p><span id="s607">WH: That they took away the name ’Mizrachi?’</span></p> <p><span id="s608">SB: Yes.</span> <span id="s609">Not only did they take it away, but my great-grandfather’s name is nowhere on the stationery!</span> <span id="s610">Like he didn’t exist.</span> <span id="s611">And he was the founder…why I say I don’t have the heart to quit that organization, even though I am personally hurt, I take it as a personal insult, that my great-grandfather’s name is nowhere in sight.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">WH: …what shul do you go to?’</span></p> <p><span id="s613">SB: My uncle’s.</span> <span id="s614">I have no choice.</span> <span id="s615">I always wanted a Young Israel.</span> <span id="s616">It was better for the children, but I couldn’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">WH: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">SB: Because my aunt would be terribly hurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">WH: Of course-there’s Rabbi Fink down the block here…</span></p> <p><span id="s620">SB: Yah, but we couldn’t do it to my aunt.</span> <span id="s621">She would have taken it very personal, but in a way, maybe I should have done-because children should be before-.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">WH: Do you go on vacations now?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">SB: Yes, we go every year.</span> <span id="s624">We have a summer home…in Harris…</span></p> <p><span id="s625">WH: Through blood, sweat and tears, you saved up to buy the summer home, I imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">SB: Well, I would say that thank God, the last (inaudible) when my husband was in business, the last few years, he worked very hard.</span> <span id="s627">Sometimes 17 hours a day, 18 hours a day, sometimes he came home 11 o’clock at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">WH: American Jews don’t work that hard, do they?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">SB: No, I wouldn’t say that.</span> <span id="s630">No.</span> <span id="s631">No.</span> <span id="s632">I wouldn’t classify them as lazy.</span> <span id="s633">No, American Jews work very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">WH: Did you encounter prejudice?</span> <span id="s635">I know you couldn’t stand the term, ‘greener.’</span></p> <p><span id="s636">SB: No, that I couldn’t stand.</span> <span id="s637">But other than that, I was very comfortable, the American (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s638">WH: Did you encounter prejudice in the beginning as a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">SB: As a survivor?</span> <span id="s640">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s641">Quite a few times.</span> <span id="s642">The time when I walked with my grandfather, and a man stopped him, (inaudible…) and he says, ‘(inaudible) a greener?’</span> <span id="s643">I was terribly hurt.</span> <span id="s644">I said to my grandfather, ‘Why does he call me a greener?</span> <span id="s645">I don’t want to be reminded of that.’</span> <span id="s646">That was one time.</span> <span id="s647">And then I went into the butcher store, why that woman said it, I don’t know, she said to me.</span> <span id="s648">‘You came from Europe?’</span> <span id="s649">‘Yes.’</span> <span id="s650">‘How come you came to America?’</span> <span id="s651">I said ‘Where should I have gone?’</span> <span id="s652">‘You should have gone to different countries.</span> <span id="s653">Why to America?’</span> <span id="s654">And a Jewish woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">WH: Where was this?</span> <span id="s656">How long ago?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">SB: Here in Brooklyn…at the very beginning, I was here maybe a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">WH: You lived in Brooklyn?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">SB: First I was in Brooklyn with my aunt…then I moved to Boro Park, and then I moved close to my aunt who has the shul here.</span> <span id="s660">And ever since we live in this neighborhood.</span> <span id="s661">But then, my husband started working very hard, he worked himself up, and like you say, we’re not tremendous spenders, my husband saved and now, thank God.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">WH: Of your four best friends, are they survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">SB: Well, mostly, yes.</span> <span id="s664">We play cards…poker.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">WH: …why do so many survivors play cards?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">SB: It’s fun…I wouldn’t say they only play cards, a lot of survivors read a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">WH: Do you feel that today’s Germans, do you hate them?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">SB: Oh, I will always hate them.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">WH: Even today’s Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">SB: I will always hate-.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">WH: Even though they didn’t do anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">SB: And I’ll tell you-see, I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s673">You read German?</span> <span id="s674">(inaudible…) we were in Israel a year ago, we had no intention of going again, because as comfortable as we are, we can’t afford that.</span> <span id="s675">I call it comfortable, thank God, because we not looking for luxuries, so what happened, Cecil, my oldest daughter, called up my husband at the place where he worked, and says, ‘Daddy,’ she called me first and asked for his number, I said, ‘Cecil, I have an arrangement with Daddy, that we only call, God forbid, in emergencies.’</span> <span id="s676">It’s not his place.</span> <span id="s677">She said, ‘Well, it’s an emergency, I have to ask him about (inaudible).’</span> <span id="s678">And I gave her the number.</span> <span id="s679">And as soon as I hang up, I said, ‘Something is very fishy.’</span> <span id="s680">To make the story short, they wanted to make him a big birthday party, but my husband is superstitious.</span> <span id="s681">You know, thank God, he’s an older man, he’s in good health, and he’s afraid of the Phora?</span> <span id="s682">.</span> <span id="s683">He didn’t want it.</span> <span id="s684">So she said, ‘Do you know what we have for your present?</span> <span id="s685">A trip to Israel, which includes stone.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">WH: Stone?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">SB: Yeh.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">WH: Why?</span> <span id="s689">He likes the mineral things in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">SB: Yes, he loves it.</span> <span id="s691">Yah, he loves it.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">WH: But what has this to do with the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">SB: Well, let me tell you.</span> <span id="s694">So, in Stone, they have a lot of Germans, who come there, a tremendous amount of Germans.</span> <span id="s695">And whenever I was sitting in the lobby there, you could see immediately it was a German woman.</span> <span id="s696">Tall, blond, typical German.</span> <span id="s697">And she struck up a conversation with me, and I said-.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">WH: In what language?</span> <span id="s699">German?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">SB: German, I speak German.</span> <span id="s701">That was my first language…I didn’t know a word Polish…I am ashamed to say that I’m most comfortable in German.</span> <span id="s702">I’m ashamed to say it, because that was my childhood language.</span> <span id="s703">And a childhood language you don’t forget.</span> <span id="s704">Anything you learn in your childhood (inaudible).</span> <span id="s705">So, I said to her, her name was Rosemarie Klein, I said, ‘I’ll be very honest with you.</span> <span id="s706">To this day I cannot be friendly with Germans, what they did.</span> <span id="s707">Every German will tell you, (needs translation-niche est…)’ but I said, ‘How do I know which is the one?</span> <span id="s708">They all have to be condemned.</span> <span id="s709">The one that didn’t do anything, has to be condemned for not doing anything, knowing what was going on.</span> <span id="s710">And the one that did, I definitely hate.’</span> <span id="s711">Well, to this day, I cannot trust a German, and I cannot like a German, and I cannot go really close.</span> <span id="s712">So what happened?</span> <span id="s713">We took pictures, and I send her a picture, and she sends me back a beautiful letter, which I have, but I can’t answer her.</span> <span id="s714">I don’t want to continue that friendship.</span> <span id="s715">I can’t!</span> <span id="s716">knowing that she-.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">WH: Do you feel that she, in some way, was trying to make up for all this?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">SB: I ask her the question.</span> <span id="s719">I said, ‘Tell me, do you have a guilt feeling?</span> <span id="s720">Do you feel guilty?</span> <span id="s721">She said, (needs translation-?</span> <span id="s722">nine eshat est g’emaucht…).</span></p> <p><span id="s723">WH: Did you believe her?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">SB: Yes, I believed her.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">WH: So why not continue it?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">SB: No, I still don’t feel that I want to get close to a German.</span> <span id="s727">I believe her, because there were Germans when I came To Bergen-Belsen, that was the make-shift Bergen-Belsen-they came with the trucks there, for our luggage.</span> <span id="s728">So, they said, (needs translation) –we were afraid to say something.</span> <span id="s729">Finally one of the Hungarian girls spoke up.</span> <span id="s730">She said, (needs translation…).</span> <span id="s731">Some Germans did not know, but the majority knew what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">WH: Do you feel differently about the Pollacks?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">SB: Isn’t that something?</span> <span id="s734">I have a great sentiment for Poland.</span> <span id="s735">KNOWING that there was anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s736">KNOWING that in 1950 there was a pogrom…</span></p> <p><span id="s737">WH: How come you see them differently than the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">SB: The Polish people didn’t create Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s739">It was the Germans.</span> <span id="s740">The Germans Acknowledge it…people ask me why I went to Poland.</span> <span id="s741">I went in search of my father’s grave.</span> <span id="s742">However I still have a lot of sentiment.</span> <span id="s743">Maybe it’s a selfish point.</span> <span id="s744">I had a very good childhood in Poland, which I cannot forget.</span> <span id="s745">A wonderful childhood.</span> <span id="s746">And I would say that those were the best years of my life.</span> <span id="s747">The 15 years before the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">WH: Do you think that in your personality, there is something that would have made it likely for you to be a survivor?</span> <span id="s749">Are you like a fighter?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">SB: Yes.</span> <span id="s751">I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">WH: You don’t give up easily?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">SB: I don’t give up-.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">WH: If your children would come home, right, if your children would tell you about a problem that they are having, do you say, ‘I don’t want to hear about it’ Or do you jump in and try to help them.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">SB: No, I hear about it.</span> <span id="s756">And I want to know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">WH: Are you an optimistic person?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">SB: To a degree.</span> <span id="s759">Now, it came to the point now, in all honesty, maybe the survivor will not admit it, they (inaudible) a survivor who’s very successfully, who maybe thinks more about money, but the truth is that now, more than ever, the tragedy comes back to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">WH: Is it because you have more time to think about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">SB: No, maybe you know, you’re aging, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s762">Maybe when you think about death, you remind yourself of their death.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">WH: You realize that if it hadn’t been for this, you might have had a very ordinary life.</span> <span id="s764">Maybe.</span> <span id="s765">Maybe not…</span></p> <p><span id="s766">SB: I realize it all the time.</span> <span id="s767">As I said, we live with it.</span> <span id="s768">And we’ll die with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">WH: In a sense, you went through an extraordinary experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">SB: Oh-h-h-h.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">END OF SIDE TWO.</span> <span id="s772">TAPE ONE.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">SIDE ONE.</span> <span id="s774">TAPE TWO.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">WH: What do you think you’ve learned from the whole thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">SB: From my experiences, I learned that the world could be very cruel.</span> <span id="s777">That people, could be so cruel, beyond your imagination.</span> <span id="s778">I have seen it, I experienced it.</span> <span id="s779">And of course, I learned that they could be very, very cruel.</span> <span id="s780">I also learned that a human being could be as strong as an elephant, and could be as weak as a fly, in the case of the war.</span> <span id="s781">There were people who were always weak, and yet they gained such strength, in human strength, and I think that I was one of them too, because I remember myself as a sickly child, and yet, when I had to endure, so much sufferings, I was a fighter, so I learned that you cannot give up.</span> <span id="s782">You must fight, of course, it’s a matter of luck, but besides the luck, you must really fight, you can’t give up.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">WH: You live with all the memories of everything that happened, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">SB: Yes.</span> <span id="s785">Not only I, but every survivor.</span> <span id="s786">Even as I mentioned, we can talk about parties, we can talk about dresses, but any little thing we’ll talk about, will spark memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">WH: Even with someone who didn’t go through your experience, let’s say, someone who was in hiding, or someone who was in a different camp, will you compare it to each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">SB: Well, no.</span> <span id="s789">Anyone that was under German rule, was in hell.</span> <span id="s790">But of course, there were different steps.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">WH: So what would you talk about?</span> <span id="s792">What specific content?</span> <span id="s793">The food?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">SB: No, the food is the least we talk about.</span> <span id="s795">We always-the most is whom we lost.</span> <span id="s796">About the casualties, about those that perished.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">WH: Even if they don’t know your casualties?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">SB: No, the average person, nobody would go out and say, Look, I lost this one, and this one, and that one.</span> <span id="s799">Among ourselves, if we get together, of course we gonna talk about it.</span> <span id="s800">And if we go to Yiskor, we talk about it.</span> <span id="s801">We pray and then we talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">WH: Who’s the we’-like friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">SB: Yes.</span> <span id="s804">The survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">WH: If you met a survivor at a party that you didn’t know, would you talk to them about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">SB: No, not right away, but it will come up.</span> <span id="s807">It will come up!</span></p> <p><span id="s808">WH: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">SB: In conversation.</span> <span id="s810">She’ll say, Oh my God, I remember this and this in Europe.</span> <span id="s811">But now, they no more here.</span> <span id="s812">And this is how it comes up.</span> <span id="s813">It always does.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">WH: Do you compare experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">SB: Yes.</span> <span id="s816">Sure.</span> <span id="s817">Yah.</span> <span id="s818">Where were you during the war?</span> <span id="s819">Where did your mother perish?</span> <span id="s820">Where did your father perish?</span> <span id="s821">Mine in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s822">Mine in Treblinka.</span> <span id="s823">Sure, it comes up.</span> <span id="s824">Even by the cards, when we drink coffees.-Sometimes things come up, but we try to squash it right away.</span> <span id="s825">Come on!</span> <span id="s826">Let’s not talk about it now.</span> <span id="s827">But it comes up.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">WH: It’s hard-</span></p> <p><span id="s829">SB: Yes, it’s hard.</span> <span id="s830">I remember, my father loved playing cards.</span> <span id="s831">He loved playing.</span> <span id="s832">Not poker-I don’t know what he played…so once even we played cards I said, ‘My God, I remember how my father used to love playing cards.’</span> <span id="s833">And the other one said, ‘My father didn’t play cards, but this and this’, but what good is it ?</span> <span id="s834">Nobody is here anymore.</span> <span id="s835">So?</span> <span id="s836">You see, any little things will bring out the memories about those that perished, about what we went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">WH: …how did you get your group together?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">SB: Two people are from the shul.</span> <span id="s839">And those two people brought in two more.</span> <span id="s840">And one is (inaudible) American-born…we have sometimes nine…</span></p> <p><span id="s841">WH: Do you win?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">SB: No, I’m not a winner.</span> <span id="s843">In cards I’m a loser.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">WH: Play low stakes?</span></p> <p><span id="s845">SB: Well ten and twenty.</span> <span id="s846">Really, not to gamble-it is Saturday nights, we are together…wintertime we start early, like 7:30 and by 10 o’clock we serve, so sometimes-we really try not to, but any little thing, even when we talk about when we played cards before the war, and that one word brings in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s847">That’s something you can’t help.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">WH: …you ever go away on vacation with this group of people?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">SB: No.</span> <span id="s850">We all go to separate places.</span> <span id="s851">We just play together.</span> <span id="s852">We-friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">WH: …at the bungalow colonies…where were you a tenant?</span></p> <p><span id="s854">SB: That was in South Fallsburg, Brook Cottages.</span> <span id="s855">It’s on the way where the Pines Hotel is…that was unfortunate the place where Florence was in such a terrible accident…Florence is a-you see, after God spared me Florence, I started believing even more.</span> <span id="s856">Because I put Him to the test.</span> <span id="s857">I said, ‘God forbid that she-.’</span></p> <p><span id="s858">WH: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">SB: Friday night, Florence is very good natured.</span> <span id="s860">And a Russian boy came and asked her, if she could arrange an audition for him at the Pines, so he can work there, he was a musician…we were not right-far from the Pines, so he figured maybe she can take him there, he can talk to somebody.</span> <span id="s861">However, that was Friday, and Florence says, we really can’t stay this Shabbas, we’ll come again, because Uri has some engagement in New York, and to him the few dollars were very, very important.</span> <span id="s862">I said, ‘Florence, you’re here already, stay for Shabbas.’</span> <span id="s863">So she said, ‘Let me make a few phone calls, if somebody can fill in for Uri, we’re going to stay.’</span> <span id="s864">And this is why I felt so guilty about it.</span> <span id="s865">And Florence came and said, ‘Ma, somebody is filling in for Uri, so tonight we’re going to the Pines for the audition.’</span> <span id="s866">So, we ate supper, it was like a real Shabbas atmosphere, and they went to the Pines, and by three o’clock at night, there was a knock at the door…and I went to the door…and I saw a police.</span> <span id="s867">I got very scared.</span> <span id="s868">But what happened, I didn’t associate it with the fact that Florence was hurt.</span> <span id="s869">I thought that there’s something wrong with his papers-Uri’s.</span> <span id="s870">Because I didn’t see Florence.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">WH: How many years ago was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">SB: Exactly nine years ago.</span> <span id="s873">1980.</span> <span id="s874">And the policeman said, ‘Get dressed, your daughter was hit, she’s badly hurt, we want you to come to the hospital.’</span> <span id="s875">…when I saw Florence, I didn’t believe that this was my daughter.</span> <span id="s876">She looked like an old woman, her eyes were black, there were holes in her head, her feet were broken, she was a mess, and they didn’t give 5 cents for her life.</span> <span id="s877">And God was good.</span> <span id="s878">He spared her.</span> <span id="s879">And here too, I said, it’s important to fight.</span> <span id="s880">Florence is a born fighter…she went through so much, that the doctor could not believe that she emerged with a clear mind.</span> <span id="s881">So, God was on the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">WH: And she’s alright now?</span></p> <p><span id="s883">SB: Thank God.</span> <span id="s884">She’s brighter than ever.</span> <span id="s885">She doesn’t give in.</span> <span id="s886">She has problems with arthritis…she was so lucky…</span></p> <p><span id="s887">WH: Hit and run driver?’</span></p> <p><span id="s888">SB: Hit and run…but we found the driver…but, Florence was a gift from God.</span> <span id="s889">Florence is a gift from God.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">WH: I remember her as a very pretty girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">SB: She’s very pretty.</span> <span id="s892">Very pretty, Florence.</span> <span id="s893">Very attractive.</span> <span id="s894">And a voice?</span> <span id="s895">Florence was singing the Hatikvah for 1,500 people at Brown’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">WH: When?</span> <span id="s897">Now?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">SB: Yeh…</span></p>
