-- What is the date today?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">SL: Today is the 30th.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: The 30th.</span> <span id="s211">November 30th.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">SL:

id="s216">SL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: New Jersey.</span> <span id="s218">And it’s a little bit past 10:30 in the morning and I’m thrilled to be here, very honored to meet you both and thank you for having me.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">SL: It’s our pleasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">RL: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: And as I told you, the -- the -- this interview will be a little bit different than the one which I watched the video of.</span> <span id="s222">And it’s -- and it -- you can help me direct it.</span> <span id="s223">So if it’s going in a direction that you think is less important and you have something else you’d like to talk about, or just something you don’t want to talk about, then just let me know, we’ll just go to [indecipherable] thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">SL: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Some of the questions I have for you are just some questions that I had that weren’t fully explained in the video, and then I have other questions that we’ll start after -- after you left Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s226">O-One of the questions that I had was -- was, could you describe for me again, your perception of the -- the relationship between Jews and Gentiles in Kovno when you were very young?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">SL: Before the war, you’re talking?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Yes, before the war, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">SL: Well, before the war, the relation between the Jews and the Gentiles was very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">SL: I mean, they didn’t show no anti-Semitism, right.</span> <span id="s232">And never make -- like we had ra -- Gentiles working for us, right?</span> <span id="s233">They were the finest pe-people you ever met.</span> <span id="s234">Even I used to play with the Gentiles, they was never say, hey you dirty Jew or things like that.</span> <span id="s235">Everything was friendly, except one -- we used to have a boy that used to take care on our property where we lived.</span> <span id="s236">He used to be a janitor.</span> <span id="s237">And when Hitler start to come in power, you know, and he used to listen to the radio, and he be -- this guy became very anti-Semitic and he used to say, “If Hitler ever comes to this country,” he says, “I’m going to kill Jews.”</span> <span id="s238">Openly, he used to say it.</span> <span id="s239">And my grandfather said to him, he says, “You’ll never live to see that day.”</span> <span id="s240">All right?</span> <span id="s241">That things just stuck in my mind.</span> <span id="s242">I was a baby and I still remember it, right?</span> <span id="s243">And sure enough, my -- my grandfather died in 1938 and -- and Hitler -- Hitler came in and took over Poland and this guy was -- and the Russians came in, and he don’t like the Russians, this ja -- this -- this janitor, right?</span> <span id="s244">It was a janit -- yeah, it was a janitor.</span> <span id="s245">And then when -- when no -- when the Germans attacked -- no, the Russians, in 1941, the day before, that was a Saturday, the man dropped dead, okay?</span> <span id="s246">The Russians came in -- the Germans came in to Lithuania on -- on -- on Monday, right?</span> <span id="s247">Saturday that man dropped dead, okay?</span> <span id="s248">He never lived to see the -- see the day.</span> <span id="s249">Because if he would have lived, he would have killed plenty Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">SL: Bec -- They became so anti-Semitic after that, it was just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s252">I guess ma-maybe because they didn’t like the Russians, because the Russian depressed them.</span> <span id="s253">So maybe because of that, but they were such a -- so anti-Semitic, they were worse than the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: I -- I know this is something you can’t really answer, but how do you explain that?</span> <span id="s255">How do you explain that sort of general getting along and then this in-incredible betrayal?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">SL: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s257">Maybe it could have been jealously, because the Jewish people in Lithuania were we -- we -- pretty well off.</span> <span id="s258">And we -- we had the -- in -- in Lithuania -- in Lithuania was about 250,000 Jews, out of a population of a million and a half people.</span> <span id="s259">So we’re a big percentage.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">SL: And -- And the Jew didn’t -- I mean, they used -- they even used to speak Yiddish in -- advertisement in the street used to be in -- in -- in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s262">We used to have Yeshivas there and we -- we had the very sh -- very famous Yeshiva in Slobotka was ve-very famous.</span> <span id="s263">And I guess maybe it was jealousy.</span> <span id="s264">And I guess when the Germans came in and they were -- they were the -- they were depressed into the Russians and the Jews owned -- owned a lot of things, the chance to take everything away from the Jews.</span> <span id="s265">Maybe that’s where they turned.</span> <span id="s266">Because -- Because the Lithuanians, the Latvians, the Estonians and the Ukrainians, they were worse than Nazis.</span> <span id="s267">They were -- All the killing, actually, was done by them.</span> <span id="s268">Very few Germans that -- that did the killing.</span> <span id="s269">All the dirty work was done by them.</span> <span id="s270">Even be -- When the -- When the Germans came in and all the pogroms was done by the Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s271">The Germans din -- We were come -- We were ra -- We ran away, you know, when the bobocart, and we start to run towards the German -- to the Russian border.</span> <span id="s272">And what happen, there were a lot of bombardments on the road and we were going by horse and wagon, you know, and the Germans were mechanized and next day they passed us already.</span> <span id="s273">So we stopped in a small town, I don’t remember the name of it, and you know, they told us that we have to back where we came from.</span> <span id="s274">And while we were going back, on the roads, the Germans stopped us and ask us where are we going.</span> <span id="s275">So we told them we’re going back to Kovno.</span> <span id="s276">So they told us, “Don’t go this way.”</span> <span id="s277">He says, “You go with everybody, the German troops coming down the road, nobody will bother you.”</span> <span id="s278">Because they said, “If -- If you’re going to go this way, the Lithuanians are killing everybody -- all the Jews and taking everything away from them.”</span> <span id="s279">I guess they had a chance to take things a -- t-take things away from the Jews and that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: An-And how do you explain this message from the Germans?</span> <span id="s281">Why did they -- Why did they do that for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">SL: They won’t -- I tell you, they di -- all those killings, that they weren’t that bad in the beginning of the war.</span> <span id="s283">The mass killing started in 19 four -- in -- in -- late in ‘41.</span> <span id="s284">That’s when the mass killings started, and actually, the-they started -- the --the -- all the killings were in -- in the -- in the Kovno ghetto in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s285">They we --the -- that’s where all the experimentals -- the killings started.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: What -- What were these experiments?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">SL: Well, to see how the -- how they used to gather all the Jews and they used to get them in certain places and just shoot them.</span> <span id="s288">Because, I have a book about it, you know, and -- and that’s where -- that’s where they -- they claim that most experimental killing started in Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: But I -- I don’t understand what the experiment was.</span>

--</span></p> <p><span id="s429">SL: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: And you found out that they had left Germany on [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s431">SL: When they went to Lithuania, yeah, in 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Tell me what happened when you found that out.</span> <span id="s433">How -- Tell me again how you found out and what you reaction was and why you decided to go back to France?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">SL: Well, I meant -- I met somebody, right?</span> <span id="s435">And we start to talk, you know.</span> <span id="s436">So he says, “Where you from?”</span> <span id="s437">So I told him, I says, “I’m from Kovno.”</span> <span id="s438">He says, “Did you have pe --,” my name, he says, “You know, I met somebody, Simon Lurie, right?”</span> <span id="s439">“Yeah,” I said, “that’s my father.”</span> <span id="s440">He said because there was -- af-after liberation -- they were liberated in Dachau together.</span> <span id="s441">So -- So he said -- So he said th-they -- that’s why I know that my brother and sister, the one to go back to Kovno.</span> <span id="s442">And he says, “Your brother Haim only wants to go back to Kovno.</span> <span id="s443">He was looking with you -- want to look for the -- for his mother.”</span> <span id="s444">See, but before I -- before I te -- before -- before I -- I got in -- in -- in the children’s home, right?</span> <span id="s445">I found out that my father was alive.</span> <span id="s446">And that’s -- that’s when I wanted to go back and be with the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">SL: And while I was on the train, I met this guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: On the train to?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">SL: I was going to -- to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">SL: Going to Dachau, and he -- he told me that the -- you -- you -- masta -- met this

father.</span> <span id="s455">We’re going to meet.”</span> <span id="s456">Because it’s -- and it’s -- he told me, he asked me what’s the name.</span> <span id="s457">He said, “No, they went back to Kovno.”</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: So why did you decide to go back to France instead of trying to go to Kovno?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">SL: Well, listen, I didn’t know where they were in Kovno, right?</span> <span id="s460">And I know the Communists were no good already, right?</span> <span id="s461">So this way I know where I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">SL: This way, I had friends over here already and this way I got a little better chance to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: To come --</span></p> <p><span id="s465">SL: Beca-Because after -- after I -- when -- what I -- the way I knew how to take care of myself already.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">SL: Because it’s not like they -- the children here these days and they -- in America, you know, a -- a 10 and 11 year old is a baby, a 20 year old is a baby.</span> <span id="s468">You have to ge -- You have to take of them like a babies.</span> <span id="s469">The children that survived during the war, were not babies.</span> <span id="s470">At eight years old they were not babies no more.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Well, was that a difficult decision for you to make?</span> <span id="s472">Did you have to stop and think about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">SL: No, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s474">I knew it -- not difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: When you were on the train and you found out that your father was back in Kovno -- [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s476">SL: Yeah.</span> <span id="s477">It wasn’t a difficult decision at all.</span> <span id="s478">Just -- Listen, this is spur of the moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: But you were going -- you had to back to France first.</span> <span id="s480">Was your plan already to come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">SL: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s482">That was a little later.</span> <span id="s483">What happened, we were on the children’s home and somebody came from the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s484">And we were talking about it and I remember my grandfather should rest in peace, he went to see his children in America, 1934.</span> <span id="s485">Now he was rach -- I very attached to my grandfather and I wanted to go with him to America.</span> <span id="s486">So, he didn’t take me, I was very upset.</span> <span id="s487">But I remember that making my -- and also my father and my ma -- we used to get letters from America and I remember New York, right?</span> <span id="s488">So one day the man came from the -- from the Red Cross and asked anybody if they got any family in America.</span> <span id="s489">And I remember my na -- my father’s brothers.</span> <span id="s490">I remember, cause it’s -- the name is the same as my father and my -- and his brothers, my uncles, right?</span> <span id="s491">So I gave one that my father has fam -- brothers in New York.</span> <span id="s492">And what happened -- when that -- when th-they put it into the Jewish paper, and my cousin was looking to the Jewish paper and she saw our name, Shya Lurie is looking for -- for uncles Ike, Ithzac and -- and, gee I forgot the names already, [indecipherable] loo -- an-and looking for the uncles and aunts.</span> <span id="s493">So, sh-she wrote me a letter and she asked me what my father’s name was, what my mother’s name was, what my grandfather’s name was.</span> <span id="s494">And I got back a letter.</span> <span id="s495">That’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: You were still in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">SL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: And who -- And who wrote --</span></p> <p><span id="s499">SL: Said they decided -- They as -- They ask me if I want to come to America.</span> <span id="s500">Listen, I was alone anyways, right?</span> <span id="s501">I said, “Definitely.”</span> <span id="s502">So they made out papers for me, it took almost -- almost about two years, a year and a half or so, a little more than a year and a half or so, til they brought me over here.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Well, just explain to me so I understand it, cause I -- an-and I -- I’m -- I don’t mean to be -- to be challenging you, I’m just curious why you weren’t trying to get back with your fo -- with your father, and when -- and at what point did you find out that your mother was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s504">SL: Well, that we found out much later.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">SL: Because my -- my aunt -- my cousins were telling me.</span> <span id="s507">That was many years ago.</span> <span id="s508">I didn’t know when -- when she died, see?</span> <span id="s509">But my aunt and my cousin, they were in the same camp.</span> <span id="s510">Then they were in Stutthof, and what happened, we’re -- had a cousin that was sick, some -- and they were liquidating the camp.</span> <span id="s511">So my -- my -- my -- my mother says, “I’m going with -- with -- with -- with my niece.”</span> <span id="s512">So my Aunt Hannah was [indecipherable], and my cousin Edka.</span> <span id="s513">Says, “Bazil, come with us.</span> <span id="s514">Leave her, she’s sick.”</span> <span id="s515">She says, “I can’t leave her alone.”</span> <span id="s516">And she wouldn’t leave her alone.</span> <span id="s517">Now, my aunt and my cousin survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: And your mother probably knew the consequence.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">SL: I don’t know if they knew or not, but they -- listen, e-e-eventually, I guess everybody knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">SL: And they -- I -- I -- I understand they drown them in the -- and they drowned them.</span> <span id="s522">They sunk the boat.</span> <span id="s523">They put them all on the boat and they drowned them.</span> <span id="s524">Listen, my mother was a wonderful woman.</span> <span id="s525">She gave her life to be with her niece.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: But so -- so help me understand what was going on when you were in France and why -- why -- how it was that you decide to come to America and not to try to go back [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s527">SL: Well, I knew where the Russians were going there, okay?</span> <span id="s528">And then there were -- I didn’t want to go back to Russia, ma -- I knew before the war how they were and after the war, they were worse yet.</span> <span id="s529">So I didn’t want to go back to Russia.</span> <span id="s530">And first of all, I didn’t know if -- if I come to -- to Kovno, I know da -- what would it be, because in Russia you never knew.</span> <span id="s531">You could be in one place here and next day the-they -- they shipped you to Siberia.</span> <span id="s532">Here, I know where I was.</span> <span id="s533">And listen, I was very independent already, I could take care of myself.</span> <span id="s534">I guess it’s -- it’s fate, it’s destiny, it’s meant to be, it’s meant to be that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: But I guess what -- what you -- is it accurate to say that this is two different reactions to the murders that you saw and that you knew how murderous the Russians could be, that your father and brother wanted to go back for some reason and you didn’t want to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">SL: Well, they wanted to go for a certain purpose.</span> <span id="s537">My brother and sister, they wanted to go look for my mother</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">SL: [indecipherable] They didn’t know what the c-consequences they went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">SL: Now, but -- but that time, I knew where the consequences.</span> <span id="s542">Once you go in there, you can’t come out.</span> <span id="s543">You could come in, but you can’t go out.</span> <span id="s544">Even when I would start to write to my father, even the letters, they didn’t go through.</span> <span id="s545">Finally I got through a letter and when I got a letter back from them, used to be opened and censored.</span> <span id="s546">Cause see, they used to open up the letters and censor it, to see whether I -- and used to take maybe five or six months before I used to get a letter from them.</span> <span id="s547">If I wouldn’t a known what was going on in Russia, I might have gone back.</span> <span id="s548">But I knew what was going on there.</span> <span id="s549">And I tell you, when you went -- you go through a war like that, you become very selfish, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: This is an interview with Mr. Sol Lurie for the United

become very cold.</span> <span id="s558">Don’t know wh -- you look out it -- for yourself.</span> <span id="s559">It’s like an animal, survival.</span> <span id="s560">So if -- You’re not attached no more.</span> <span id="s561">The feeling is not there no more.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: Le-Let me ask you this.</span> <span id="s563">You said in the -- in the other interview, that at a certain point, you made a very firm decision, that you would try to outlive Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">SL: I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: Or that you would outlive Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">SL: Yeah.</span> <span id="s567">Well, that’s how I survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: Tell me what made you -- what was it that pushed you to that decision, or how you came to that decision.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">SL: Well, I had a lo -- I always had a lot of willpower, all right?</span> <span id="s570">And the only way to survive, you have to do -- it’s something to look forward to, which is why -- once you give up, that’s it, right?</span> <span id="s571">So, if you make a goal in your -- in your own mind, I’m going to accomplish this, right?</span> <span id="s572">And -- And -- And -- And that’s when it -- that was my goal.</span> <span id="s573">I want to survive so badly and I made my goal that I’m going to outlive Hitler.</span> <span id="s574">And that’s what kept me going.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: So it -- How -- How important was that for -- like the difference between those who survived and those who didn’t survive?</span> <span id="s576">To have a goal like that, where that --</span></p> <p><span id="s577">SL: The goal was very important, because if you haven’t got a goal, and you don’t set your mind on something, you’re not going to do it.</span> <span id="s578">So, there was so many times that ee -- I pee -- I want -- you want to give up.</span> <span id="s579">But just the thought that I might outlive Hitler and ca -- when I went back to Germany -- I’ll tell you later about -- when I ba -- came -- went back to Germany in 1953, right?</span> <span id="s580">And I came back -- I came back as an American soldier in occupied Germany, I was the proudest human being you ever saw.</span> <span id="s581">Because I show you, you want to kill me, and I came back alive and I’m an American.</span> <span id="s582">That -- That was my pride.</span> <span id="s583">People said, “How could you love the Germans?”</span> <span id="s584">Right?</span> <span id="s585">But [indecipherable] this -- this -- when I came back, I used to walk down the street, I was proud.</span> <span id="s586">I even became an American citizen in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: You became an American citizen --</span></p> <p><span id="s588">SL: American citizen in Germany, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Well, tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">SL: Okay, when I was in the army, I went -- I went in the army, I wasn’t a citizen yet.</span> <span id="s591">So -- And they send me back -- send me into -- to Germany, instead of -- in the Korean war.</span> <span id="s592">And then they -- they -- they made a new -- a law that the -- the -- that if you’re in the army, you become a -- you going to become a citizen.</span> <span id="s593">I was one of the first ones to became an American citizen in Germany.</span> <span id="s594">So I we -- I went to Frankfort, in Ame-American headquarters, and that’s where I was sworn in as the American citizen.</span> <span id="s595">And it’s written on my discharge, too.</span> <span id="s596">So when I came -- when I first came back fa -- after the army, I came back to vote in the -- in the elections and I came into the -- when th-they asked you where did you get your American citizenship papers.</span> <span id="s597">I says, “I got it in Germany.”</span> <span id="s598">So the woman that there was registering me says, “Don’t be no wise guy.</span> <span id="s599">What do you mean you got it in Germany?”</span> <span id="s600">I says, “Lady, I got it in Germany.”</span> <span id="s601">She says to me, “If you don’t play around -- stop playing around, I’m going to call the cop, he’s going to throw you out.”</span> <span id="s602">I says, “Lady, you could call the United States army.</span> <span id="s603">That’s where I became an American citizenship.”</span> <span id="s604">And I took out my paper, you know, my si -- my American citizen paper and showed it to her.</span> <span id="s605">She thought I was kidding around.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: How important was it to you to become an American citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">SL: Very important, I didn’t have to go to the army, but I went, because when I came to this country and I saw what the -- I know what the country did for me, the way I was treated.</span> <span id="s608">I had freedom, I could say anything I want, right?</span> <span id="s609">And I want to fight for this country, to preserve the -- [indecipherable] the freedom.</span> <span id="s610">I didn’t say the -- it’s a legitimate war, it’s not a legitimate war.</span> <span id="s611">When the country calls me, I went.</span> <span id="s612">I didn’t have to, but I went.</span> <span id="s613">I’m very proud of it, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: And do you remember that day, that moment when you became a citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">SL: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s616">I was very proud.</span> <span id="s617">Yes I was st -- I was standing -- I was the fi -- the only one, and when the headquarters of the -- the seventh army, I was the only one that -- that was sworn in as the American citizen that day.</span> <span id="s618">And I had -- I had the two or three witnesses from my company there, to be witnesses, sigh?</span> <span id="s619">I was very proud.</span> <span id="s620">I was also written up the Stars and Stripe.</span> <span id="s621">That’s where the -- That ne -- beca --</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: What is that, a -- a military newspaper?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">SL: Yeah, it’s an American newspaper.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">SL: That -- That -- That -- That’s a new law that came out.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: Which it -- What was the law?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">SL: The law that once you serve in the army, right, you -- you’re the ma -- you become an American citizen.</span> <span id="s628">Because, see, they couldn’t send me in combat because I wasn’t a citizen.</span> <span id="s629">So they can send you in occupied terr -- if you volunteered, you could send you in occupied territory.</span> <span id="s630">I could have gone to the -- the Middle -- the Middle East, but I could have gone to -- to Japan, I think, like that, but I -- in combat they couldn’t send you.</span> <span id="s631">That’s why I’m [indecipherable] from now -- from the whole company, when I -- when I was in the -- in the -- in the Korean war -- that was the height of the Korean war, right?</span> <span id="s632">And 90 -- 90 -- 97 percent of the companies used to go right to Korea.</span> <span id="s633">Me and two other guys went to Germany, that was it, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: Because you weren’t citizens?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">SL: Yeah.</span> <span id="s636">Actually, I didn’t have to go, but I wanted to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: Now, of all the places to go, was Germany a difficult place for you to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">SL: No, I -- I came back, I -- I was very proud, that I was telling you.</span> <span id="s639">I was very proud because I came back, I showed you, you wanted to kill me, you couldn’t do that and I came back as a -- an occupi -- occupied your country.</span> <span id="s640">That was my pride.</span> <span id="s641">I used -- And when used to walk in Germany as American soldier, I was like a hundred feet tall, like a giant.</span> <span id="s642">Felt great.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: What -- Was there any -- What was the climate in the army for Jews?</span> <span id="s644">Was it -- Was it difficult?</span> <span id="s645">Was there any anti-Semitism [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s646">SL: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s647">First of all there was very little Jews in my company, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">SL: In the whole -- the whole regiment -- I was in the 26th inf -- the regiment, there was only about four Jews, that was it.</span> <span id="s650">So when it came to a Jewish holiday, we didn’t even know.</span> <span id="s651">I didn’t know when Yom Kippur was or Rosh Hashanah.</span> <span id="s652">But there was no anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s653">Most of them were -- Well, first of all from the -- from the south, they were real hillbillies.</span> <span id="s654">And they mu -- know much anyway.</span> <span id="s655">They ask me, “Where you from?”</span> <span id="s656">I says, “From New York,” and I have a air -- had a very big accent, I still have, right?</span> <span id="s657">And they say, “Oh, that’s the way they talk in New York?”</span> <span id="s658">Right?</span> <span id="s659">They didn’t even know I was a foreigner.</span> <span id="s660">They thought a Jew had horns.</span> <span id="s661">They didn’t know.</span> <span id="s662">I used to be [indecipherable] some guys in our -- in the barracks there and the only pictures they used to have in the -- in their war locker, used to have in the pigs and the cows.</span> <span id="s663">They never had a family picture, you know, like a mother or father, or -- animals, that was it.</span> <span id="s664">They couldn’t wear no shoes.</span> <span id="s665">Shoes used to come off from the -- from the training, you know.</span> <span id="s666">Used to take off the shoes, they couldn’t walk -- they couldn’t wear shoes.</span> <span id="s667">But very nice, very nice people.</span> <span id="s668">They thought a Jew had horns and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: So were -- were they surprised to find out not -- that all [indecipherable] New Yorker --</span></p> <p><span id="s670">SL: Yeah, then -- I was very friendly with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">SL: I was ver -- I was very close with them.</span> <span id="s673">Had a lot of friends there.</span> <span id="s674">Listen, what people don’t know -- anti-Semitism is only ignorance.</span> <span id="s675">When you talk to -- When you -- When you tell people that don’t use their own mind.</span> <span id="s676">Don’t know how to make up their own mind.</span> <span id="s677">They don’t think for themself, that’s when anti-Semitism comes in.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">SL: And the person that doesn’t know nothing, is not anti-Semitic.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: I’m putting up a second microphone for my -- myself.</span> <span id="s681">When I record the interviews for my radio programs, I don’t record myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">SL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: But for this one they asked me to and I forgot.</span> <span id="s684">I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s685">With the -- Let m -- I want to go ba -- I know we’re jumping around in time a little bit --</span></p> <p><span id="s686">SL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: -- but I wanted to -- because we -- some of the important things to me, when I -- when I hear th -- your story and the other stories of survivors, is to understand what was special, what were -- what were the ingredients of their survival and I know part of it is -- is luck.</span> <span id="s688">It’s just having --</span></p> <p><span id="s689">SL: 99 percent was luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Yeah, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s691">SL: And somebody has to watch over you.</span> <span id="s692">I put -- See, I’m a very strong believer in fate.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">SL: In destiny.</span> <span id="s695">And I believe somebody’s watching over you and you -- not-nothing’s going to happen to you before your time is up.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">SL: See, I p -- I personally believe in my grandfather, hey?</span> <span id="s698">He’s the one that watched all through the war over me.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Now ca -- You -- You mentioned that several times and this was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s700">SL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: -- the-these were the two things that I picked up from the interview that were very important, was one, your determination to live beyond Hitler, and then your being watched over by your grandfather.</span> <span id="s702">But could you explain how that manifests itself, or what it -- what it actually was, in terms of him watching you?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">SL: Well, see, when I was a child, I was very -- my grandfather used to live by us.</span> <span id="s704">I was very close to my grand -- whatever -- I was like a little dog, right?</span> <span id="s705">Whatever my grandfather went, I used to go with him.</span> <span id="s706">I used to go to shul with him, whatever.</span> <span id="s707">To my aunts, my s -- children, right, whatever.</span> <span id="s708">And I fe -- I was very close to him, see?</span> <span id="s709">And he was reu -- he was very close to me.</span> <span id="s710">He wa -- He loved me, [indecipherable] and -- I fi -- and that’s the only one, [indecipherable] I was a child and the way I felt, he was always there whenever I needed him, when I was a child, right?</span> <span id="s711">And the same thing during the war.</span> <span id="s712">I mean, there were certain -- certain things, like he told the guy, “You’ll never see to -- li-live to see that day,” right?</span> <span id="s713">The day before Hitler started the war, he died, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: How old was that guy that died, I forgot to ask you that.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">SL: That man?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">SL: He must have been in his late 40’s.</span> <span id="s718">Young, young man.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">SL: Well he said, “You’ll never live to see the day.”</span> <span id="s721">And that was a prediction, a couple of years before it.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">SL: And the man never lived to see the day.</span> <span id="s724">So, there was something there.</span> <span id="s725">There’s so many -- There’s so many fi -- instance, you know, so many instances that I’ve -- I went through like a miracle.</span> <span id="s726">Nad in the war, and even after the war, the -- certain things.</span> <span id="s727">19 f -- 1987, right, I was walking around like a time bomb, I didn’t even know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: With your heart?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">SL: Right.</span> <span id="s730">Now, sigh -- like a miracle, my -- my -- my -- my right ar -- my right ventricle -- right ventricle?</span> <span id="s731">What do you call that?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">RL: Your right side of the heart.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">SL: Right side of the heart took off ma -- took over the work from my left heart, because my left one was completely closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">RL: The coronary artery.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">SL: Now, when you -- if you ever read the report, you would never believe it, right?</span> <span id="s736">The doctor wrote the report.</span> <span id="s737">My wife is a RN, right, and she couldn’t believe the report.</span> <span id="s738">Now, you don’t -- you mean to say that somebody’s not watching over me?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">SL: Mm.</span> <span id="s741">Somebody’s watching over me.</span> <span id="s742">The same thing now.</span> <span id="s743">One of my -- my grafts closed up, right?</span> <span id="s744">But what happened, my -- my ha -- my body developed new ca -- carotical circulation around the heart, right, right.</span> <span id="s745">Somebody li -- if wouldn’t be for that, I would have had a massive heart attack.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">SL: And I thank God I don’t need nothing.</span> <span id="s748">I just take medication, that’s it.</span> <span id="s749">But shows that somebody’s watching over me.</span> <span id="s750">First of all, my wife needs me, okay?</span> <span id="s751">I need my wife and my wife needs me.</span> <span id="s752">And it’s still -- my time is not up yet.</span> <span id="s753">So is -- it shows, there’s something there in destiny, right?</span> <span id="s754">In fate, hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: Is there any connection between this strong belief that you have and this -- or this knowledge that you have of somebody watching you and -- and your religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">SL: Yeah, the religion has something.</span> <span id="s757">I’m not -- personally, I’m not religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">SL: I believe if you are a good human being, you have a good heart, you don’t harm nobody, you help people when they’re in need, that’s the most important religion.</span> <span id="s760">It’s nit -- It’s not what you -- It’s not what you -- you -- you -- you say abba, it’s what you do.</span> <span id="s761">If you do good things to people and you help people, that’s a religion for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">SL: It’s not if you go to synagogue or you go to church and you -- and you pray and you say that and then you come out and you steal people -- from people.</span> <span id="s764">That’s not religion.</span> <span id="s765">Somebody is in need, I’m there.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: But was it -- What -- I guess what I’m curious about was tha -- I mean, that’s -- that’s an important distinction and -- and I would -- and -- and I think that it’s -- well, it’s -- it’s not an uncommon view.</span> <span id="s767">I mean, my family is the same -- of Jewish people who are not particularly religious, but have very strong sense of values and ethics.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">SL: The most important thing is values.</span> <span id="s769">See, because the Jewish religion, the most important thing -- that’s where the Jewish religion -- that’s what I was taught, okay?</span> <span id="s770">That if somebody’s in need, be there for them, right?</span> <span id="s771">Never close your door.</span> <span id="s772">The same thing, it’s like Passover, right?</span> <span id="s773">I mean, they -- you open up the door for Elino -- Elionowa to come in the house, your door’s supposed to be open.</span> <span id="s774">In Europe to the synagogues, right?</span> <span id="s775">I mean, if you couldn’t afford it, to pay for the -- for the ti -- to give a donation to shul, the shul was open for you.</span> <span id="s776">In America it’s different.</span> <span id="s777">If you don’t -- can’t pay for the -- for the -- for the shul, you can’t come in.</span> <span id="s778">And that’s not religion for me.</span> <span id="s779">That’s a business.</span> <span id="s780">And that’s what happened, that’s what a busin -- religion became, it’s a business.</span> <span id="s781">I mean, not everybody could afford it, there are certain places in -- that you have to show them how much income you have and you have to pay a certain percentage.</span> <span id="s782">I want to send my kids to Yeshiva and I went to one of the Yeshivas, right?</span> <span id="s783">And the rabbi told me, this is my price.</span> <span id="s784">I told him I couldn’t afford it those days, right?</span> <span id="s785">He says, “Well, if you can’t afford it, you can’t send your kids to Yeshiva.”</span> <span id="s786">And he told me wife, she rest in peace, he says, “If you want to send your kids to Yeshiva, you go and clean floors.</span> <span id="s787">Become a housemaid and you make money to pay me,” okay?</span> <span id="s788">Now -- This is not by me a rabbi.</span> <span id="s789">I told him, I says, “If you paid me, I wouldn’t send my kids to Yeshiva, because you can’t teach them nothing.</span> <span id="s790">You can’t teach them the ethics.</span> <span id="s791">And by yours, the -- the ma -- th -- ya -- the money’s more important than -- than to teach somebody.”</span> <span id="s792">I went to another Yeshiva, says, “Whatever you can afford to, you pay us,” okay?</span> <span id="s793">And that’s the right way.</span> <span id="s794">And I gave my kids a Jewish education.</span> <span id="s795">If I couldn’t hav -- I couldn’t do it, I wouldn’t have given it to them.</span> <span id="s796">And believe me it was hard, whatever I paid those days, too.</span> <span id="s797">But my wife, she rest in peace, she wanted to give the kids a Jewish education.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p>

Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">SL: So, I got -- I got something from her, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: So what did you -- did you learn to cook from her directly, or you just --</span></p> <p><span id="s830">SL: I didn’t learn, I just -- I guess it comes with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">SL: I love to cook.</span> <span id="s833">Looks -- Looks good.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">RL: He loves to cook.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: Yeah?</span> <span id="s836">What’s his specialty?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">RL:

id="s841">I like to cook, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">SL: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: I always liked it, when -- since I was little.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">SL: I’ll let you taste my lasagna.</span> <span id="s845">It’s -- But, see something falls off.</span> <span id="s846">But the thing is, you see, we were brought up to respect people and -- and to help people.</span> <span id="s847">And that’s the way I was brought up and it stays -- it -- it stayed with me, see, because they -- they got in this country, right?</span> <span id="s848">I mean, they come from a bad environment, that’s why the children are bad.</span> <span id="s849">There’s no such a thing.</span> <span id="s850">It’s the house.</span> <span id="s851">It’s what the parents teach children.</span> <span id="s852">See, the -- All the Holocaust survivors, right, that survived the concentration camp, and the -- and the how as they saw, that a human li -- a human life didn’t have no value.</span> <span id="s853">Just like an ant, you step on it and kill it, right?</span> <span id="s854">I mean, everybody came out, they should have been killers and murderers, right?</span> <span id="s855">And everybody -- I would say 99 percent of the people that came out are very successful, respectful citizens, wherever they went.</span> <span id="s856">And they don’t -- I don’t know [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: And what’s you explanation for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s858">SL: Because they had a good upbr -- upbringing in the home, the value.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: Before?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">SL: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: Now, see if you can explain something to me.</span> <span id="s862">I have two children who are six and 10 years old.</span> <span id="s863">My perception is that these issues of the values that we teach them, that my wife and I teach them, are very important and very big, because they don’t know that much.</span> <span id="s864">So I’m envisioning you at 11 - 12 years old, these values and these relationships that you have with your parents and your grandfather, it’s very big.</span> <span id="s865">And your understanding about what you just described about helping people and about being good to people, leaving the door open.</span> <span id="s866">H-How -- How does seeing what you saw affect -- affect it?</span> <span id="s867">It’s a -- It’s almost hard to understand that -- the balance.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">SL: Yeah, the thing is, you see, it was instilled in me --</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">SL: And I was taught as a child, that no matter what you saw, after -- because you could teach somebody a certain age.</span> <span id="s871">After a certain age, that’s it, right?</span> <span id="s872">So, when you were taught at a cert -- my -- at my age, a yo -- young age, how to da -- how to be to people, how to respect people, right?</span> <span id="s873">That if you see a woman, you open the door for her, right?</span> <span id="s874">Or you see an older person, you get up and give the seat.</span> <span id="s875">And if you see a woman -- especially a woman, even if it’s younger than you, right?</span> <span id="s876">You get up and give the seat.</span> <span id="s877">And that’s what instilled in me, to show respect.</span> <span id="s878">And I s -- I still do it now.</span> <span id="s879">Even when I -- I sit somewhere and I see a woman next to me, I get up and give her the seat.</span> <span id="s880">Or I go out and walk and I open that door, right?</span> <span id="s881">I’ll hold the door til si -- the person comes over.</span> <span id="s882">Now you see in young generations, right, the young people, they don’t even say thank you.</span> <span id="s883">Like it’s coming to them, because it’s taught in the home.</span> <span id="s884">There’s no res -- There’s no respect.</span> <span id="s885">Listen, [indecipherable] they see -- I must have this.</span> <span id="s886">Whatever they see, they must have, right?</span> <span id="s887">He grew up, he had two toys, was enough.</span> <span id="s888">You’re growing now, they’ve got hundreds and hundreds of toys, right?</span> <span id="s889">And it’s still not enough.</span> <span id="s890">And whatever the child wants, they pay.</span> <span id="s891">Listen, there’s no such thing, you must have it.</span> <span id="s892">Make use what you got.</span> <span id="s893">And -- And when I -- When I -- I -- I mean they -- the children, five, three, four years old, they have no respect no more.</span> <span id="s894">By us, I remember as a child, it was child -- you could be seen, but not heard.</span> <span id="s895">You couldn’t say nothing.</span> <span id="s896">And you did -- If an older person spoke, you -- you f -- y-you -- you kept quiet.</span> <span id="s897">Here, an older person speaks, forget about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: What I’m curious about is -- is how a child like yourself, or other children, who have such a -- such a good upbringing and such a respect for other people and for elder people, how do you then make sense of the -- the horrible things that -- that were fostered upon you and the horrible things that you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s899">SL: You mean I ca -- well, I figured this, we [indecipherable] it had to be that -- I -- I s -- I have a certain belief, you know, the questions here, where if there was a God, right?</span> <span id="s900">How could it let it -- things like this happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">SL: Now my explanation is -- the way I think, that you don’t question what God does, first of all, re?</span> <span id="s903">And also, the worst punishment for a parent is when the li -- they punish a child, right?</span> <span id="s904">There ca -- can’t be nabarena -- the worse punishment than punishing a child.</span> <span id="s905">And God was punishing -- punishing the parents when they to -- when they -- when they punish the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">SL: So, that’s -- that’s one of the things.</span> <span id="s908">But you can -- you can’t take it, there’s no explanation.</span> <span id="s909">There’s no explanation whatsoever.</span> <span id="s910">You don’t question.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s912">You were 13 when you were -- you were in a concentration camp when you turned 13, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">SL: Yeah, I was -- when I went into the ghetto, when the germ -- when the Germans came into, I was 11.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s915">So we -- What did you -- Were you -- Were -- Were you Bar Mitzvahed?</span></p> <p><span id="s916">SL: Nah, Bar Mitzvahed?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: There was no way, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">SL: No Bar Mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: Was that --</span></p> <p><span id="s920">SL: I was always in hiding, because the children, used to take away.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">SL: I was taken away a couple of times.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: Was that a problem, to -- to -- to miss a Bar Mitzvah?</span></p> <p><span id="s924">SL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: It wasn’t important?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">SL: Who -- Who was thinking of Bar Mitzvahs?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: I don’t know, I’m just curious.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">SL: We -- We di -- We didn’t even have no shawls those days.</span> <span id="s929">We used to -- We used to pray in the -- in -- that nobody saw, hey?</span> <span id="s930">You didn’t have no prayer books, you didn’t have no shawls.</span> <span id="s931">Listen, people with beards, they used to shave -- the Germans used to cut their beards off.</span> <span id="s932">You just -- You just -- Bar Mitzvah never bothered me.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">SL: Listen, the religion the -- hala -- it’s -- it’s not just the -- the only thing a Bar Mitzvah is, if you go before the Torah and they present you and you -- an-and you become a man.</span> <span id="s935">Over here they make a big thing, Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s936">But in -- in Eu-Europe they didn’t make no big things.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">SL: Most of the thing was done in shul and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">SL: What -- Th-Th-Th-Th-There -- Those -- Those things never bothered me.</span> <span id="s941">If it be meant to be, I would have had a Bar Mitzvah, but to show that my -- my -- my -- what they call the -- the -- my destiny.</span> <span id="s942">I wasn’t meant for a Bar Mitzvah and didn’t have no Bar Mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">SL: My biggest belief is destiny.</span> <span id="s945">That’s why I don’t worry about everything.</span> <span id="s946">Whatever is going to be is going to be.</span> <span id="s947">I live at present, see?</span> <span id="s948">I don’t care -- I know what the past was, I don’t care what the pre -- what the future is going to be.</span> <span id="s949">Live right now.</span> <span id="s950">Because why should I worry bou -- say something’s going to happen?</span> <span id="s951">Why do I have to worry what’s going to happen?</span> <span id="s952">I even taught my children the same way.</span> <span id="s953">Don’t worry how to cross the bridge to wa -- before you get there.</span> <span id="s954">A lot of people, they worry, before -- before they get -- b-before something happens.</span> <span id="s955">Why should I worry about it?</span> <span id="s956">I guess the cant -- the time I spent in the concentration camp taught me that, too.</span> <span id="s957">Survive at present.</span> <span id="s958">Do I know what’s going to be next minute?</span> <span id="s959">No, nobody knows.</span> <span id="s960">So you live right now.</span> <span id="s961">And a lot of people are saying the same thing, they finally seeing it.</span> <span id="s962">Same thing my son, too, as I say, he’s going -- he’s going to be get -- going for his Ph.D. in psychology.</span> <span id="s963">Also, he used to worry about everything.</span> <span id="s964">I says, “Charles, what are you worried?</span> <span id="s965">When you get there, you’ll worry about it.</span> <span id="s966">Why should you worry now?”</span> <span id="s967">She used to tell him the same way, yeah.</span> <span id="s968">Now it’s -- after it’s getting -- where he’s going to get his p -- finally, he’s getting a little common sense.</span> <span id="s969">Listen, education doesn’t mean nothing.</span> <span id="s970">It’s the common sense that counts.</span> <span id="s971">I don’t care how educated you are.</span> <span id="s972">You could put -- Your most educated human being was stupid.</span> <span id="s973">And a little common sense, by me is more important than -- than education.</span> <span id="s974">What good is it if you’re smart, but if you don’t use your head the right way?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s976">So t-tell me -- I -- I wanted to go -- start with -- just ask you a few things about the -- the liberation at Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">SL: Oh, I’ll tell you a story about it --</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: Wa -- Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">SL: -- my

houses away from me -- I’m in 119, he’s in 129, right?</span> <span id="s983">And when he came in -- and we are friendly, I walked over to him, I introduced myself and we started to talk.</span> <span id="s984">And he saw my accent, you know.</span> <span id="s985">He says, “Where you from?”</span> <span id="s986">So I told him, “I’m from Lithuania.”</span> <span id="s987">He says, “No, where were you during the war?”</span> <span id="s988">I says, “I was in the concentration camps,” right?</span> <span id="s989">He says, “What concentration camp?”</span> <span id="s990">We start talking what concentration camps I were in.</span> <span id="s991">And I says, “I was liberated in Buchenwald.”</span> <span id="s992">He says, “You know, I was the first tank into Buchenwald.”</span> <span id="s993">I meet my liberator after 50 year -- 51 years.</span> <span id="s994">I meet my liberator who liberated me, you know?</span> <span id="s995">Is that a coincidence?</span> <span id="s996">And I -- Is-Isn’t that re -- destiny, something?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: What’s his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s998">SL: What’s his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s999">RL: I don’t

id="s1003">Q: It’s amazing, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">RL: He doesn’t want to talk about it at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">SL: And the thing is, when I was ta -- I was looking -- I was looking out from the -- from the -- from the concentration camp and there was a ba -- there was woods there, uh?</span> <span id="s1006">And I saw the tank coming down the perimeter of the -- of the -- of the -- of the forests, right?</span> <span id="s1007">And I saw the ee -- that tank coming into the gate, coming right through the gate.</span> <span id="s1008">And I meet him after 51 years.</span> <span id="s1009">Now we had the -- We had the -- I had the interview with Spielberg here and I want him to be in, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">RL: Sol, what

interview.</span> <span id="s1045">He says, “I couldn’t go through it again.”</span> <span id="s1046">I says, “Listen, if I could go through it -- when you talk about things like that,” he says, “I can’t talk about what I saw.”</span> <span id="s1047">But the thing is, you know, when you talk about something, you feel better.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">SL: I used -- I also used to be -- I used to talk a little about it, but I didn’t talk about it much, til I open -- had my open heart surgery.</span> <span id="s1050">It’s like somebody said, “Here, you got another chance in life.</span> <span id="s1051">Open up and talk about things.”</span> <span id="s1052">I opened up, I talk about it.</span> <span id="s1053">My whole personality

<p><span id="s1066">SL: Before I was very serious and s -- but you got another chance in life, and use it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: Did -- Did you make a conscious decision after the war to

id="s1075">Something -- I guess your mind -- your body itself has certain shut off valves and it -- it cuts it off itself.</span> <span id="s1076">It’s the same thing like a pressure valve.</span> <span id="s1077">If you -- If you [indecipherable] a valve to release, you would explode.</span> <span id="s1078">See I -- I use my body as a plumbing system, right?</span> <span id="s1079">That’s the way I use my body.</span> <span id="s1080">And if you built a lot of pressure up and you don’t release it, you haven’t got a valve to release it, you going to explode, the same thing as a hot water

a lot of garbage, right -- if you watch what you put in, your sink is not going to clog up.</span> <span id="s1084">If you put a lot of fat in it and a lot of grease, your arteries are going to clog up, right?</span> <span id="s1085">Same thing, right?</span> <span id="s1086">So that’s the way I use my body, I -- I -- that’s the example I ha -- I give myself and that’s the example I give people.</span> <span id="s1087">It’s to understand how it works.</span> <span id="s1088">And it should work that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">SL: Because when I was young I used to eat a lot of junk, so my arteries closed up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s1092">So tell me a little bit about -- so after -- after the -- the tanks came in in Buchenwald, what was the treatment like?</span> <span id="s1093">I know you tal -- you talked it -- about the -- that was very interesting about the -- the food that the Americans prepared was too rich.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">SL: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: People got sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">SL: Well, after we were liberated, they came in and the Americans, you know, the -- a lot of people were sick, you know, they were starved.</span> <span id="s1097">And they came in and th -- and they started to cook.</span> <span id="s1098">They started to cook pigs with all kind meats.</span> <span id="s1099">Very greasy food.</span> <span id="s1100">People the -- their intestines were all dried up, right?</span> <span id="s1101">And they started to eat like -- I mean, the people are hungry.</span> <span id="s1102">Now me, like somebody was watching me too, right?</span> <span id="s1103">And the -- the only thing I was eating is potatoes and bread.</span> <span id="s1104">I wouldn’t take -- maybe because my religious upbringing, a -- the hahsa, right?</span> <span id="s1105">And you couldn’t eat no hahsa, and that’s -- that’s -- not -- non-kosher meat, right?</span> <span id="s1106">May-Maybe cause of my u-upbringing, I was saved about it.</span> <span id="s1107">But the only thing I ate was bread and potatoes, right?</span> <span id="s1108">Now, people were getting sick, they were getting dysentery.</span> <span id="s1109">Te-Tens of thousands of people died after the liberation because -- from the dysentery.</span> <span id="s1110">Their intestines were all dried up and this -- they got diarrhea and they were just dying like flies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: But other than that, what was the -- was the treatment good from the Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">SL: Oh yeah, very good.</span> <span id="s1113">Listen, when they came into the camp -- and Buchenwald was one of the best ca -- was one of the best camps I was in, the same thing with Dachau, Dachau was also a good camp.</span> <span id="s1114">But co-considering, you know, it’s -- the treatment was very good.</span> <span id="s1115">They treated too good, and weren’t used to it.</span> <span id="s1116">After abou -- After about a week or so, they took us out from the -- they got all the children together, they took us out from the ca -- from the camps, where the German soldiers used to -- used to bring the barracks there, they had like big buildings, at least, I think four or five story buildings.</span> <span id="s1117">And they took all the children and they put us into those barracks there and that’s where we stayed.</span> <span id="s1118">And then they did as -- the f -- the fren -- the French -- French government, the S-Switzerland, Holland, England.</span> <span id="s1119">This -- They started to take some children, you know, because most of them, they were without parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: So, of that group of 500 children --</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">SL: 522.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: 522.</span> <span id="s1123">How many went to France with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">SL: A couple of hundred went -- went to France.</span> <span id="s1125">Some went to -- I don’t know how many went to Sweden and some went to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: And where you went in France, were there other children from other camps there also?</span> <span id="s1127">Or was it just those --</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">SL: No, in the -- in this -- in this -- this one, the -- the -- there was only from Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">SL: Okay?</span> <span id="s1131">But this -- this -- the organization that took us over is the Ozair, if you ever heard of it.</span> <span id="s1132">It’s a -- It’s a -- It’s a -- It’s a Jewish organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">SL: And they -- they -- the one that we were in, that was strictly from Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1135">That was with Elie Wiesel, well, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q: And tell me a li -- What was your life like there, in that place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">SL: Oh, it was very nice.</span> <span id="s1138">Listen, we were running around, I mean we had our freedom.</span> <span id="s1139">They were trying to teach us a trade.</span> <span id="s1140">They taught us -- Some people went to sc -- first of all, we went to school to learn a little French.</span> <span id="s1141">So these the teachers and then some -- said all the ones want to learn, to l -- to -- to learn trades.</span> <span id="s1142">The life itself was very good.</span> <span id="s1143">We stayed in the -- one of the places we stayed was in Rothschild’s pi -- one of his palaces there, all right?</span> <span id="s1144">But the thing is, he didn’t give us the palace, he gave us, for this, the stables, the servant quarters, where the horses used to stay in.</span> <span id="s1145">But still, listen, it was very nice of them, it was very comfortable.</span> <span id="s1146">We had -- We had plenty to eat.</span> <span id="s1147">They gave -- They even drink wine, even when you’re children, they give you wine, right?</span> <span id="s1148">I mean, over there, everybody’s a alcoholic there.</span> <span id="s1149">And we played games.</span> <span id="s1150">We have soccer, we used to have sports and -- listen, we had a little chil -- a ga -- a child upbringing a little bit, you know.</span> <span id="s1151">We weren’t used to things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: Was there -- Were -- Did some of the children stay in France?</span> <span id="s1153">Was there some expectation that those children who went to France would stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">SL: Oh some of them, yeah.</span> <span id="s1155">Yeah, some of them stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">SL: There’s quite a few that are still -- still live there.</span> <span id="s1158">Matter of fact, a couple of years ago, I met -- I met one of the -- two guys actually, that live in France, they settled there.</span> <span id="s1159">See, but right after the war, I mean, the French government took us, but there was a lot of anti-Semitism there.</span> <span id="s1160">A lot of them.</span> <span id="s1161">I mean, right -- you know what the Jews went through, and re -- and when they were -- we -- we came there, they showed it.</span> <span id="s1162">They didn’t -- still didn’t like the Jews.</span> <span id="s1163">To this day, they don’t like the Jews.</span> <span id="s1164">There’s only one place in -- in all France that -- that were friendly to the Jews.</span> <span id="s1165">If you ever heard of Shablon, I think it was.</span> <span id="s1166">This -- They -- They -- They saved the whole Jewish population there.</span> <span id="s1167">They wouldn’t give up one Jew.</span> <span id="s1168">But the rest are anti-Semitic, they don’t like the Jews, they don’t like the Americans.</span> <span id="s1169">That’s why we never go back to France.</span> <span id="s1170">I’ll go back faster to Germany, than go to France.</span> <span id="s1171">People say it’s so beautiful there.</span> <span id="s1172">I says the -- the country is a beautiful country, but the people are rotten.</span> <span id="s1173">And any place that don’t like me -- don’t like me as a person, as a Jew, they don’t like me as an American, I would never go back and -- and spend a -- a penny there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">RL: Sol?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">SL: Hm?</span> <span id="s1176">Which one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">RL: All these are people from -- from France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">SL: Yeah,

a reunion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">SL: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1184">This guys here.</span> <span id="s1185">This guy --</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: Wait, wait.</span> <span id="s1187">Put this in the front here, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">SL: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: -- that you can -- so you can --</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">SL: This man over here, see, is a Frenchman.</span> <span id="s1191">He came for a visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">SL: See, this guy -- his name is -- what’s his -- which is tha -- I forgot his name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">RL: Arya.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">SL: Oh, Arya, okay.</span> <span id="s1196">Or this -- Also this guy here is also from France, see?</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">SL: But this guy Arya, we were going to the same synagogue in Brooklyn together, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">SL: And I was -- I saw him in syn -- the synagogue maybe for about 10 - 15 years, right?</span> <span id="s1201">Now, this guy never talks about it, doesn’t talk about the war at all.</span> <span id="s1202">I mean, if you ask him a question about the war, he gets very upset, doesn’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s1203">And there was -- When I came to shul once, and we’re sitting and talking and he says -- and one of my -- my -- my -- somebody I know says to this guy, “How are you?”</span> <span id="s1204">He says, “What do you think, you’re in France?</span> <span id="s1205">You’re chasing all the girls?”</span> <span id="s1206">So I says to this guy, “Arya, when were you in France?”</span> <span id="s1207">He says, “Right away you want to know my life hist -- biography?”</span> <span id="s1208">I says, “No,” I says, “I was in France, too.”</span> <span id="s1209">He say -- I says, “I was there in 1945.”</span> <span id="s1210">He says, “So was I, in 1945.”</span> <span id="s1211">I says, “I was in the -- in the Ozair, this and this home.”</span> <span id="s1212">He said, “For -- So was I.” I says, “Don’t tell me you were in Buchenwald.”</span> <span id="s1213">He says, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s1214">He says, “Oh, you the leedfacshiker, right?”</span> <span id="s1215">Now, all those years we sit in the same synagogue and the man never want to talk about it, right, because he doesn’t want to talk about the war.</span> <span id="s1216">An -- Ba -- And then it came out that we were in the same concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">RL: They knew each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">SL: Okay, we knew each other.</span> <span id="s1219">Now, that’s the guy I show you on the

<p><span id="s1224">SL: That’s the guy Arya, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">SL: So it shows, if somebody talks, you ca --</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">RL: But these two were also with you in Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">SL: Yeah, yeah, those two guys were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">RL: Those two guys.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: Where was this photograph taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">SL: That was in Brooklyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">RL: In Arya’s house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">SL: They -- They -- They -- That -- They came -- They came for a visit.</span> <span id="s1234">See, this guy Arya keeps in touch with everybody.</span> <span id="s1235">This guy has like a -- he’s like a fa -- a computer walking around.</span> <span id="s1236">He remembers all the name, he’s ga -- even got the ki -- kids from Buchenwald all over the coun -- all over the world, right.</span> <span id="s1237">He knows they’re in Australia, in Canada.</span> <span id="s1238">He remembers the name, he keep in touch with everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: Well then, I don’t understand.</span> <span id="s1240">He -- He -- He’s the one who wouldn’t talk?</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">RL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">SL: Yeah, he doesn’t talk, see, but he keeps --</span></p> <p><span

interviewers [indecipherable] na -- ca -- talk about the camp.</span> <span id="s1246">He has -- Socially, he keeps in touch with them, okay?</span> <span id="s1247">But if you want to interview him or something, he will never talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: Doesn’t that seem a little strange?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">SL: Even -- Even the same thing, if I mention something ba -- about a camp or something, he says, “Sol, shyer, don’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s1250">I don’t want to hear about it, okay?”</span> <span id="s1251">Wouldn’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s1252">And I told him, I says, “Listen, open up, you’ll feel better.”</span> <span id="s1253">And my next door neighbor, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1255">Here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">SL: Yeah, my next door neighbor, he -- we -- from Auschwitz -- was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1257">And he also -- he didn’t want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1258">So I finally talked him in, when Spielberg was coming here, right?</span> <span id="s1259">I talked him in about it.</span> <span id="s1260">“Take an interview.”</span> <span id="s1261">“No, I can’t go through it.”</span> <span id="s1262">I says, “Try.</span> <span id="s1263">I mean, you have to open up.”</span> <span id="s1264">He agreed for interview, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">RL: The son forced him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">SL: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">RL: The son forced him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">SL: No.</span> <span id="s1269">He ag -- He agreed for interview, and he was a nervous wreck, the -- for the -- for weeks before they came, you have to see him, the guy was a nervous wreck.</span> <span id="s1270">And they started, they opened up, right?</span> <span id="s1271">Now, he couldn’t -- he couldn’t believe how much he feels better now.</span> <span id="s1272">Now, you could talk about -- more about the camps than you could before.</span> <span id="s1273">And his children are very happy, because now they got that biography what that man went through.</span> <span id="s1274">Before, they didn’t know about it.</span> <span id="s1275">They knew he was in camp, but didn’t talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: It’s very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">SL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: It’s very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">SL: You see, the thing is, you have to open up.</span> <span id="s1280">Once you open up, it’s going to go out by itself.</span> <span id="s1281">Q: Yeah, well it’s like that pressure valve you talked about earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">SL: Yeah, it’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q: I believe in it, I think that’s true for anybody who went through anything.</span> <span id="s1284">But also, for his in particular, it’s important --</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">SL: Wha-What -- What do you think a si -- si -- si-psychologist, right?</span> <span id="s1286">When you go -- sa -- mentally, something wrong, now.</span> <span id="s1287">Something is bad in back of your brain, your mind, right?</span> <span id="s1288">And you ha -- keep it hidden.</span> <span id="s1289">Now if they want you to keep on talking.</span> <span id="s1290">[indecipherable] sessions you have, it’s all talking, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">SL: They want to see what’s bothering you.</span> <span id="s1293">So when they hit a certain spot and you open up your valve, you let it out, you’ll feel better.</span> <span id="s1294">They’ll be able how to -- be able to help you how to -- into -- handle it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1296">True.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">SL: Now, if you keep in the mind, I don’t know how to -- what’s bothering you.</span> <span id="s1298">Medication helps, but still, talking about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1300">Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">SL: And that’s without education I learned it.</span> <span id="s1302">I have a very good mind.</span> <span id="s1303">I have a very -- I -- see, I’m -- I’m very challenging.</span> <span id="s1304">If I made up to do something, I’ll do it.</span> <span id="s1305">If I -- It’s like I’m very good in repairing things, right?</span> <span id="s1306">Even if I don’t know anything about it, I will not give up til I conquer it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">SL: Okay.</span> <span id="s1309">Th -- It-It’ll b-be on my mind, could go weeks and months and I’ll conquer it.</span> <span id="s1310">So there’s certain things -- I do all kind repair work, I do -- I can do anything, there isn’t a thing I cannot do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: But I -- I’m -- I’m assuming that this is one of the keys to your survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">RL: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">SL: The challenge -- The challenge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">M: Strong</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: Very strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">SL: See, I like something -- I like something challenging.</span> <span id="s1318">Once that challenge is not there no more --</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">SL: -- I ha -- I lose my interest in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">SL: But as long as the challenge is there, I -- I’ll keep on going.</span> <span id="s1323">Like I had the -- I used to live -- where I u -- where I bought my first house.</span> <span id="s1324">That was one of my challenges.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Q: Where was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">SL: In Brooklyn, all right?</span> <span id="s1327">Had a leak, couldn’t find it.</span> <span id="s1328">Now, the houses, there were seven houses attached, right?</span> <span id="s1329">I went to the builder, he sent to point the bricks, he waterproofed the house, the leak was still there.</span> <span id="s1330">And it bothered me, it was on my mind.</span> <span id="s1331">One day it woke me at night -- most of my ideas come fra -- when I’m sleeping.</span> <span id="s1332">Wakes me up in the middle of the night, it was on Saturday, so on Sunday morning, I got up Sunday morning, I went outside, I fixed my porch -- the li -- I fixed my next door neighbor’s porch, okay?</span> <span id="s1333">My leak stopped.</span> <span id="s1334">How did you come to the conclusion, right?</span> <span id="s1335">I figured, when the building, it got steel girders, right?</span> <span id="s1336">And it’s called a I beam.</span> <span id="s1337">And what happened, the I beam ended up in my hou -- in the -- the two joints, th-th-the beams, right, ended on my house.</span> <span id="s1338">So what happened, she had the leak on her porch and the water was coming in from her porch and running down the I beam, and the end of it was in my house, okay?</span> <span id="s1339">So that’s where the water was coming down.</span> <span id="s1340">So once I fixed that porch, I’m fixed up.</span> <span id="s1341">And that was the challenge.</span> <span id="s1342">No matter what I did to my pa -- my house, I di -- I couldn’t stop that leak, til I figured it out.</span> <span id="s1343">If I would have been the ba -- if I would have been when they were building the houses there, I would have known it.</span> <span id="s1344">But I wasn’t there, so I figured out that that thing like -- thing like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">RL: Over here, too, you figured out what the leak -- he had a leak he figured out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">SL: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">RL: Here, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">SL: Oh yeah, here, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: You had a leak here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">SL: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1351">And the builder -- builders ca-came, he was going to do something -- so-something else.</span> <span id="s1352">I says, “Mark, no way,” I says, “water doesn’t go up, it goes down.”</span> <span id="s1353">He says, “No, you don’t know what you’re talking about.”</span> <span id="s1354">I says, “You don’t know what you’re talking about.”</span> <span id="s1355">A-And then one days it was raining, I climbed up in the attic, I went and I went a -- and I went a -- and I look -- I was looking for that leak and sure enough, it start -- it was leaking onto -- it was coming from the top roof, going down, right?</span> <span id="s1356">I got a hold of the builder.</span> <span id="s1357">I brought him up, I said, “Here where the leak is coming in.”</span> <span id="s1358">He had to replace half of the roof.</span> <span id="s1359">Now, he was going -- he -- he was going to fix the soffits.</span> <span id="s1360">There’s openings underneath for the air circulation.</span> <span id="s1361">He was going to seal this up.</span> <span id="s1362">I -- I mean, water doesn’t go up, it goes down.</span> <span id="s1363">And he come in -- That was a builder, mind you.</span> <span id="s1364">And that’s a simple thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1366">So when -- So you di -- You were telling -- You told me that you -- How did you decide to put the ad in the paper in New York, to find your relative?</span> <span

there.</span> <span id="s1370">The Red Cross put in the ad in the paper, see?</span> <span id="s1371">I didn’t put it in, they put it in, because I gave them the names, you know?</span> <span id="s1372">And they put it into the paper and my cousin was looking through the paper, because of -- right after the war, in 1945, bif -- people that looking for family and she noticed my name there.</span> <span id="s1373">She didn’t know it was -- it wa-was a relation or not, but she wrote me the letter, you know.</span> <span id="s1374">And then, in -- And then I gave her the right

about your -- your -- you -- you -- we were talking about your life here in America.</span> <span id="s1592">How long was it before you joined the army?</span> <span id="s1593">How long did you live in -- in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">SL: I didn’t -- didn’t join.</span> <span id="s1595">They called me -- They called me -- 1950 they called me, because the Korean War broke out and in nine -- and they called me to register for the draft, I registered for the draft.</span> <span id="s1596">And then they -- they called me for -- to examination.</span> <span id="s1597">No, first they

they induct me in the army.</span> <span id="s1600">I went for the physical and I was healthy and they took me into the army.</span> <span id="s1601">So, I went in the army in October, 1952.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: And what were you doing in the meantime, what were you doing in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">SL: Well, I -- My first job when I came to America, I was working in a -- in a -- at my uncle -- my aunt got me a job working in the tie -- making ties, men’s ties, right?</span> <span id="s1604">And I was getting that time, I was getting 35 cents an hour.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">Q: Now, what do you mean making the ties, were you like a -- sort of a tailor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">SL: On -- On a sewing machine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">SL: The guy taught me how to make ties -- how to sew and I learned how to -- how to sew and I was getting 35 cents an hour to make the ties.</span> <span id="s1609">Now, the regular operators were get -- were getting 36 cents a dozen.</span> <span id="s1610">So after awhile, you know, I got -- I was doing a very good job and I told the guy, “Listen, I want to work piece work.”</span> <span id="s1611">I says, “because I ca -- I ca -- I can make four or five dozen ties an -- an hour, you know?</span> <span id="s1612">So I can make a -- over a dollar an hour.”</span> <span id="s1613">So he says to me, “Oh,” he says, “a seksha noisgia green.”</span> <span id="s1614">They told me in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1615">You-You’re not no more a greenhorn, you know, not a foreigner no more.</span> <span id="s1616">Now, you’re an American, you want the same thing as American.</span> <span id="s1617">So I says to him, I said, “Listen, is my work as good as theirs?”</span> <span id="s1618">He says, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s1619">I says, “I want the same type of pay.</span> <span id="s1620">Why should I work for nu -- for th-the money that you pay me, nothing, 35 cents an hou -- an hour.”</span> <span id="s1621">And I told him, “Listen, if you don’t want to give it to me, I’m quitting.”</span> <span id="s1622">So the end of the week, I quit my job.</span> <span id="s1623">And I got myself another job in Jamaica, Queens, working on raincoats, also operator.</span> <span id="s1624">And I was -- I was -- I used to do the -- part of the garment, you know.</span> <span id="s1625">What I was making [indecipherable] I think was 40 dollars a week.</span> <span id="s1626">Was good money I got after -- after 15 dollars a week.</span> <span id="s1627">No, but this guy with the ties, had to come in Sunday, too.</span> <span id="s1628">Was Sunday, I had to work a half a day.</span> <span id="s1629">So the half a day used to be from nine to three.</span> <span id="s1630">So when I wor -- went to work in the raincoats, I was making a little bit of money, that was in 1947, end of ‘47, and was better.</span> <span id="s1631">And then I got another offer, this guy was -- all the f -- he was a subcontractor for -- he used to work for manufacturers, making dresses.</span> <span id="s1632">And o -- so -- so I got an offer from this guy also, and that was in Brooklyn, on Essex Street.</span> <span id="s1633">Essex and Atlantic Avenue.</span> <span id="s1634">And I got an offer [indecipherable] says you’re going to teach me how to be a cutter -- fabric -- by dresses.</span> <span id="s1635">So, I says, “Oh, fine,” right?</span> <span id="s1636">Meanwhile, I was wavin -- I came in, I was working on -- on the -- on the -- on the ra -- mean operator.</span> <span id="s1637">And then he took me into the cutting room and I was, you know, laying out the material bring on the table, and -- and -- to make the -- put the patterns on top of it and he showed me how to cut.</span> <span id="s1638">And I was doing a little cutting, small things, not big things, because if that -- you don’t know what you’re doing, you destroy your whole -- your whole -- the whole -- they put up like 40 or 50 dresses at a time, you know.</span> <span id="s1639">So -- And it’s -- actually, it’s layers of the fabric, then you put a patterns on top and you -- and you mark out the patterns on a piece of paper -- on a paper.</span> <span id="s1640">And then you -- you roll -- you pull the paper over -- over the fabric, and it’s a big table, a table maybe 40 - 50 feet long, you know.</span> <span id="s1641">And then you -- you -- you -- you -- you -- it take ya -- ya -- ca -- the ma -- ma -- the cutting machine, just follow the pattern, just cut out, you know, for the -- the -- the patterns.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">Q: Yeah, but you’re cutting 40 layers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">SL: Yeah, 40 layers, 50 layers, depends how thick it is, right?</span> <span id="s1644">It’s very interesting.</span> <span id="s1645">And one day I had an argument with my boss, because I’m very independent, right?</span> <span id="s1646">I didn’t want nobody to take advantage of me, and I quit that job.</span> <span id="s1647">So then I went to work in New York.</span> <span id="s1648">See, what happ -- the thing is, I didn’t like to work inside.</span> <span id="s1649">I didn’t want to be cooped up.</span> <span id="s1650">Maybe because from the -- all the time I was in concentration camp, I didn’t like to be cooped up.</span> <span id="s1651">I wanted to be always outside.</span> <span id="s1652">So like -- like I felt -- like if -- if I have to run away, it’s open, I could run, see?</span> <span id="s1653">Once you work inside, I mean, you feel like you’re locked in.</span> <span id="s1654">There’s no place where to run.</span> <span id="s1655">So I left that job and I we -- I went to work in New York.</span> <span id="s1656">I we-went to work in -- for Regency Dress on Broadway.</span> <span id="s1657">Think this was 1220 Broadway.</span> <span id="s1658">And also dresses and I start to work in the -- in the carding room.</span> <span id="s1659">I used to be like an assistant buyer.</span> <span id="s1660">I used to -- n-not the big stuff, I used to buy like the buttons and the cotton and the threads and -- and also used to fix the -- the sewing machines.</span> <span id="s1661">Because the boss saw I was very handy and -- and before he used to have a mechanic come in if a machine broke or thing like that, he -- he used to call a mechanic.</span> <span id="s1662">I told him, I says, “I could fix it for you.”</span> <span id="s1663">He said, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s1664">And I was fixing it.</span> <span id="s1665">He sa -- I saved him money.</span> <span id="s1666">I also worked in the carding room, I used to be in the receiving department.</span> <span id="s1667">Like the piecegoods used to come in for the cutters.</span> <span id="s1668">I used to take it in, you know, I had to ch -- I had to check if there’s no damages and see, I have a special machine onto it, that see there’s no damages.</span> <span id="s1669">There is damages the material, I used to put like a -- a marker there.</span> <span id="s1670">So this -- Wh-When the -- When you -- When you goes into the cutting room, and when the cu -- and when the cutter lays it out, he used to see the mark.</span> <span id="s1671">So he knows it was a damage, so when he -- when they laid the pattern, he made sure that the -- the damage doesn’t fall into the pattern.</span> <span id="s1672">If no -- If not, the whole -- the whole piece of material is no good.</span> <span id="s1673">And I worked there for quite awhile.</span> <span id="s1674">I worked very hard, I used to work Saturday.</span> <span id="s1675">And I told him, I says, “Listen, I’m working hard, I’m entitled to a increase, you know?”</span> <span id="s1676">I was getting that time, 75 dollars a week.</span> <span id="s1677">I says, “Listen, I want a increase.”</span> <span id="s1678">So there was two partners.</span> <span id="s1679">So one the partners says to me, “Oh,” he says, “you’re not a -- you’re not a refugee no more, you want -- you want to make money.”</span> <span id="s1680">I told him, “Yes, I want to make money.”</span> <span id="s1681">So one the partners says, “I’m going -- We’re going to give you a raise.”</span> <span id="s1682">And the other partner says, “No, you’re not getting a raise.”</span> <span id="s1683">I says, “Okay, I’m -- I quit.”</span> <span id="s1684">That’s it.</span> <span id="s1685">And I quit that job, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">Q: And they were all -- Were all of these businesses owned by Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">SL: Yeah, all Jews, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">Q: So was it -- Was that just sort of taken for granted that you would m-mainly be working within a Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">SL: Because -- Listen, they used to take advantage on foreigners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">SL: I mean, if I do the work, right --</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">SL: -- like everybody else, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">SL: I’m entitled to get the same pay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">SL: I didn’t let nobody take advantage of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">SL: If I want to give my -- my time to somebody, fine.</span> <span id="s1700">But the -- people not going to take advantage of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">Q: So would you say that they were -- that in -- in some ways, that the American Jews were looking out for the refugees by giving them jobs, but in other ways, they were taking advantage?</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">SL: Taking ad -- yeah, work a little cheaper.</span> <span id="s1703">It’s -- It was always this way, and still this way.</span> <span id="s1704">As long as they could take -- as long as you let yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">SL: But I know what I could do and what I can’t do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">SL: So -- So -- So one of the partners wanted to give me the raise and the other one didn’t, okay?</span> <span id="s1709">So I quit.</span> <span id="s1710">Next week they called me back, they’re going to give me the raise.</span> <span id="s1711">I told them, I says, “Once I walk out, I don’t come back no more.”</span> <span id="s1712">I felt very independent, right?</span> <span id="s1713">And I went to work -- I found myself a job, that was something I wanted, I wanted to be outside.</span> <span id="s1714">So I found myself a job driving a -- a truck, right?</span> <span id="s1715">And I go into this paint store and it’s in Lavonia Avenue, East New York, name is Shamus -- M. Shamus and Son Paints.</span> <span id="s1716">And I walked in there and they asked me, do you know how to drive a truck?</span> <span id="s1717">I says, “Sure.”</span> <span id="s1718">I didn’t have no -- no s -- no chauffeur license.</span> <span id="s1719">So he puts me on the truck, you know, and I drive it.</span> <span id="s1720">“Oh,” he says, “you’re very good.”</span> <span id="s1721">I -- He didn’t ask me to show hi -- to show him my license.</span> <span id="s1722">So, “When you want to start?”</span> <span id="s1723">I says, “Not tomorrow, the next day.”</span> <span id="s1724">Meanwhile, the next day, to a -- the next day, tomorrow, I went down to the motor vehicle and I got myself chauffeur license, right?</span> <span id="s1725">And I were -- I s -- I s -- I liked the job, because I had my freedom.</span> <span id="s1726">[indecipherable] and I -- and I liked it.</span> <span id="s1727">The work was very hard, but very nice bosses.</span> <span id="s1728">I worked for them for 21 years.</span> <span id="s1729">But the thing is, I was promised part of the bi -- of the business.</span> <span id="s1730">One of the bosses said, “When I retire, I’m going to give you part of the business.”</span> <span id="s1731">He never -- Matter of fact, they’re still in business, still got one of the stores in Essex Street.</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">SL: And East Broadway, Manhattan.</span> <span id="s1734">The one in Brooklyn got -- the area is gone a long time ago.</span> <span id="s1735">And he says, “I’m going to give you part of the business when I retire.”</span> <span id="s1736">So I kis -- So I took for granted he’s going to keep his promise.</span> <span id="s1737">I worked like a horse.</span> <span id="s1738">I mean, has this paint delivered new construction and had to bring it up in to some if the area houses.</span> <span id="s1739">The big apartment houses didn’t have no elevators.</span> <span id="s1740">And some of the paint jobs used to be two or three flights up.</span> <span id="s1741">I used to carry it up.</span> <span id="s1742">Also, you know, the painters -- you had to deliver to the houses, private painters.</span> <span id="s1743">So no matter -- depends where they worked.</span> <span id="s1744">And most of the houses were walk-ups, they didn’t have no elevators, like in East New York and Brownsville.</span> <span id="s1745">So it was plenty work, but I liked it.</span> <span id="s1746">I was never afraid for work.</span> <span id="s1747">Work never killed anybody, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">Q: So you started this job before you went to the army and then you continued?</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">SL: Not all, no.</span> <span id="s1750">But that was in 1951 I got the job at Shamus, see?</span> <span id="s1751">Now 1952 they called me in the army, so I told them, “Listen, I have to go in the army,” and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1752">So from 19 -- October 1952 to September 1954, right?</span> <span id="s1753">I was in the army.</span> <span id="s1754">So I got my -- I got inta -- inducted in Camp Kilmo, New Jersey and I took my basic training in Fort Dix, New Jersey, for 16 weeks.</span> <span id="s1755">And bay -- After bay -- And finished our basic training, we got our orders.</span> <span id="s1756">Now in that time, the -- the Korean War was on a full -- full blast and more -- I would say 99 percent of the people used to go right to -- to Korea.</span> <span id="s1757">Me and two other guys just -- we got our orders, went to Germany.</span> <span id="s1758">As a matter of fact, our -- our Staff Sergeant said, “When I come out from the barracks,” he says, “and when you see,” -- I could still see his face right now.</span> <span id="s1759">He says, “When I s -- When you see me, a big smile on my face when y -- I make your orders, you are all going to Korea.”</span> <span id="s1760">That’s what he said, right?</span> <span id="s1761">Big se -- big sergeant.</span> <span id="s1762">And he came up, and he orders with a big smile on his face.</span> <span id="s1763">I told you not -- 99 percent of the people went to Korea and my and two other guys, we got our orders going to Germany.</span> <span id="s1764">After I spent so many years in Germany, I went back to my -- my ho -- my sweet place, where I had such beautiful dreams there, and beautiful memories.</span> <span id="s1765">And I went to Germany, was in the -- let me see, I know I -- think in February I left for Germany.</span> <span id="s1766">And I got assigned to the -- the bloody red one, that was the first division.</span> <span id="s1767">And I got stationed -- they send me to the 26th regiment in Bramberg, Germany.</span> <span id="s1768">That’s where I was stationed, that was right near the Czechoslovakian border, I think.</span> <span id="s1769">And I spend there almost -- was 17 and a half months I spend there.</span> <span id="s1770">We were always on alert, because that time the -- the -- that was the height of the Korean War and there was always -- don’t know when the Russians are going to attack you from the east and so we were always someone [indecipherable] who was on alert, 24 hours a day were on alert, because you didn’t know when the Russians were going to attack or not.</span> <span id="s1771">And I mi -- I had -- I ma -- had a good time there, listen.</span> <span id="s1772">I came back -- first I was in concentration camp in Germany, then ca -- I came back with pride and showed them that I outlived you and I’m back as an occupier, I occupy you people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">Q: While you were there, beside the -- the pride that you felt, did you have what a -- I mean, did it bring up a lot of the memories?</span> <span id="s1774">Was it -- Was there a difficult aspect of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">SL: No, they didn’t -- the memories didn’t bring back.</span> <span id="s1776">Because in my mind, I felt so good because I survived you.</span> <span id="s1777">That’s what -- That’s what my -- my -- my -- my -- my heart and my mind, everything, that’s what I was thinking.</span> <span id="s1778">I survived you.</span> <span id="s1779">I came back like a conqueror.</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">SL: Not -- Not -- Not as a slave, as a conqueror.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">Q: See if you can explain something to me.</span> <span id="s1783">You know, I’ve known about the Holocaust since I was a little boy, but o-only in stories and some friends of the family and from some books.</span> <span id="s1784">I was born in 1955, so it was all --</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">SL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">Q: -- over by then.</span> <span id="s1787">Now, when -- when -- when I talk to people about it, when I talk to people, when I had this hope to be able to work a little bit with the Holocaust Museum, when I hear the stories, it just seems completely unimaginable that it actually took place.</span> <span id="s1788">It seems -- I can’t comprehend human beings.</span> <span id="s1789">I can’t comprehend -- and it seems that it happened a long time ago.</span> <span id="s1790">Can you -- Can you describe for me what -- what it was like to -- to -- those first, say 10 years after the Holocaust and during this time period that you’re talking about, how people perceived what happened, and did people really understand what had taken place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">SL: You mean the German people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">Q: Everybody.</span> <span id="s1793">In America, like say the Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">SL: A lot -- Let me tell you, a lot of Americans didn’t even realize, they didn’t even know that that -- there was a Holocaust, okay?</span> <span id="s1795">You talk to a lot of southerners, they didn’t remember the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1796">Didn’t know the Holocaust existed.</span> <span id="s1797">See, the part of Germany that I was in, there was no concentration camps there.</span> <span id="s1798">Like this, I would have taken and shown it to them.</span> <span id="s1799">Now -- And the thing is, we -- the closest one was Dachau and Dachau -- and we couldn’t get the fellow to go because we were always on alert.</span> <span id="s1800">So we didn’t get no -- to go, an-and mo-most of the hillbillies, they weren’t even interested in things like that.</span> <span id="s1801">So, even now, you talk to a lot of the Americans, they don’t know about Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">SL: So it’s -- I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">Q: What -- Did you have a -- I mean, it’s a hard -- it’s a hard question to ask, I mean, I -- I can’t even find the right words for it, but I’m curious about your -- how you lived afterwards, with the knowledge that this thing had taken place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">SL: Well, I’ll tell you, I blanked it out my mind.</span> <span id="s1806">I didn’t even think about it.</span> <span id="s1807">Because if you th -- if things like that continues on your mind, you’re going to go nuts.</span> <span id="s1808">So certainly -- You just blanked it out your mind like it never existed.</span> <span id="s1809">Forget about it.</span> <span id="s1810">I don’t know maybe ca -- I wa -- I was built in my -- my system like that, shouldn’t -- I shouldn’t go nuts or crazy.</span> <span id="s1811">I just blanked it out.</span> <span id="s1812">I didn’t even think about things like that.</span> <span id="s1813">The only thing I -- When I went back to Germany -- when I came there I felt like -- tall like a giant because I came back not as a slave but as a conqueror.</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">Q: Did a German --</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">SL: An occupier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">Q: Did the Germans know that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">SL: Oh -- Oh, I used to advertise it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">SL: I advertise it.</span> <span id="s1820">I used to say -- I to -- I told them, I was in your country, I wa -- and I used to show them my number.</span> <span

years, three years ago we were in Turkey, right?</span> <span id="s1824">In Anatalia, and -- see, a lot of Germans come to Turkey.</span> <span id="s1825">In Anatalia, there’s a lot of Germans and Jews, you know.</span> <span id="s1826">So we were in the dining room and there -- the -- some German people were sitting in our table.</span> <span id="s1827">And then we started talking, you know, and they say, “Where you from?”</span> <span id="s1828">I says, “I’m from America,” and where are you, “I’m from Germany.”</span> <span id="s1829">And after awhile I started to talk to them in German.</span> <span id="s1830">So he says to me, “Where did you learn how to speak German?”</span> <span id="s1831">“Oh,” I said, “it’s a long story,” I says.</span> <span id="s1832">“Many years ago, I was a guest of your government -- I was invited by your government as a guest,” I said, “and I spent -- I spent four years in one of your concentration camps, you know.”</span> <span id="s1833">“Oh,” he says, “I didn’t know that there was concentration camps,” okay?</span> <span id="s1834">I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">Q: He didn’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">SL: -- they -- they still deny it, okay?</span> <span id="s1837">I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">Q: And what was his reaction --</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">SL: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">Q: -- to your story?</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">SL: Oh, and he was talking and next morning, we came for breakfast, he -- he wasn’t sitting no more on our table, okay?</span> <span id="s1842">Before was very friendly and everything.</span> <span id="s1843">And then we -- When they used to saw me walk down in -- in -- in the rest -- in the -- in the hotel, he used to -- he used to look -- walk away.</span> <span id="s1844">So it still shows that a lot of th -- most of them I would say know about it, because now they teach them about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">SL: But there’s a lot of ci -- there’s a lot of these Germans in Turkey, cause the Turks go to work in Germany, if you know.</span> <span id="s1847">And there’s al-also Israelis.</span> <span id="s1848">There’s a lot of Israelis in Turkey.</span> <span id="s1849">What’s -- What wa -- I was surprised when we came there, remember Ry?</span></p> <p><span

concentration camp, I was -- I couldn’t show my feelings.</span> <span id="s1982">In other words, I was -- I couldn’t show my love, because I was afraid that anybody you loved, like in -- during the war, you know, anybody you loved, you lost, okay?</span> <span id="s1983">So I was afraid to show my love, even my -- my -- my first wife, she rest in peace.</span> <span id="s1984">I wasn’t as affectionate as I should have been.</span> <span id="s1985">And the same thing with my -- my -- my daughters, too.</span> <span id="s1986">I wasn’t as affec -- as affectionate as I should have been.</span> <span id="s1987">If I had to live my life over again, I would be completely different.</span> <span id="s1988">Because, in concentration camp, that’s what happened, you just lost your

id="s2072">So I says, “I’m very interested in that.”</span> <span id="s2073">And -- But they weren’t paying much, because they started you with 150 dollars a week.</span> <span id="s2074">And I had a family, you know?</span> <span id="s2075">Here I was making over 500 and here I’m going down to 150.</span> <span id="s2076">And I discussed it with my wife, I says, “I have good -- a good opportunity

promises.</span> <span id="s2079">So I told them I’m quitting.</span> <span id="s2080">And I left the job and I took the cookie business.</span> <span id="s2081">That’s with Wachtel Biscuit Company.</span> <span id="s2082">And, in about three months I got my own -- I was work for the company.</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">Q: What’s the name of the company?</span></p> <p><span

three months, I got my own route.</span> <span id="s2089">But it was -- it was very hard work.</span> <span id="s2090">And in the beginning it was -- and -- until you built up a good route.</span> <span id="s2091">I used to wi -- I used to -- used to leave the house like five 30 in the morning, didn’t come home til nine at night.</span> <span id="s2092">And little by little and I start to build the route up.</span> <span id="s2093">And tho -- those days, if you -- if you di -- if you did like 2,000 -- two and a half thousand dollars a -- a week business, was a good business.</span> <span id="s2094">But still, you know, we used - we used to work on 20 percent.</span> <span id="s2095">But it wasn’t enough.</span> <span id="s2096">So then they opened up -- and then the -- long hours.</span> <span id="s2097">And I -- I had -- I had 135 stores to take care of.</span> <span id="s2098">And when you go into a store, you had to, you know, check the merchandise, the bo -- you had to take out the broken cookies, because they -- the -- the store gave you the space, and you had to take care of that.</span> <span id="s2099">So I used to take out the broken coo-cookies, take out the shou -- you had to rotate the cookies, because new ones go in the back and the old ones go on top, you know?</span> <span id="s2100">And it was a lot of work.</span> <span id="s2101">Then they opened up a territory in the -- in the Bronx.</span> <span id="s2102">So he asked me, because I used to have Manhattan and Westchester, he say if I want to go into the Bronx, it’s -- it’s a lousy

fear for nobody.”</span> <span id="s2109">And I went into the Bronx and I -- I got some good stores there.</span> <span id="s2110">From the 135 I gave up, I was left with 26 stores.</span> <span id="s2111">What a pa -- I built up a business, I was doing 15,000 dollars a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">SL: And I -- And most of my stores used to be dropoffs.</span> <span id="s2114">Instead of parking out at stores, I used to drop off.</span> <span id="s2115">And I built up a nice business.</span> <span id="s2116">And from -- instead of five days, I’ll -- now, I cut it down to three days.</span> <span id="s2117">And instead, for -- from the -- from six and then one, until nine at night, I used to be -- I used to -- I used to be finished by one o’clock.</span> <span id="s2118">Ja -- The only thing was -- was just risky there.</span> <span id="s2119">I only got held up once, which it wasn’t bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">Q: With a

my heart.</span> <span id="s2145">My wife, she rest in peace, wouldn’t let me go.</span> <span id="s2146">So, what happened, you see, I was in the truck, unloading my truck, you know, getting -- preparing the order take in the store.</span> <span id="s2147">And this guy comes over to me and asks me what time is it.</span> <span id="s2148">Was right in front of the store.</span> <span id="s2149">I said, “It’s a quarter after 11.”</span> <span id="s2150">And he walks away.</span> <span id="s2151">Meanwhile, I get off the truck and I -- I put -- I put the merchandise on the hand truck and I tie up the -- the hand -- the -- you know, the -- the -- the -- the -- the merchandise on the hand truck to -- to the -- to the hand -- to -- with the rope.</span> <span id="s2152">I had 21 cases in it.</span> <span id="s2153">And I close the truck, and as I -- I ba -- you know, I -- I prepare to pull the hand truck up and on the curb, you know, backwards, had to pull it up, the guy grabbed me from the back, puts his hand in my pocket and ta -- and he took out the money and he ran away.</span> <span id="s2154">And this guy that Getz -- Getz shot, comes over to me -- that’s was the first guy that came over and asked me what time it was, “How much did he take from you?”</span> <span id="s2155">See?</span> <span id="s2156">He had the gall to come over and ask me how much he took from me, okay?</span> <span id="s2157">He was an accomplice.</span> <span id="s2158">So I told him -- took 250, I told him 750.</span> <span id="s2159">Go look for it, go fight with him.</span> <span id="s2160">That time there was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">Q: He was asking you because he wanted to make sure he got his share?</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">SL: Yeah, wants --

know, there was so many people in front of the store.</span> <span id="s2166">And nobody even bothered to come over.</span> <span id="s2167">It happened so fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">Q: No, it’s a good thing you didn’t fight with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">SL: And I -- And I’ll tell you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">Q: It’s not worth it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">SL: -- I didn’t -- I didn’t make a big deal about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">SL: I went into the store, I unloaded my hand truck, I did my -- see, he should

<span id="s2180">It’s like I just wanted to put out my mind, just forget about it, like it never existed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">Q: But did you think it was important for them to know that it had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">SL: Is you -- Yeah, I thought it was important, but I just couldn’t open myself up to talk about it, because every time you want to talk about something, it brought back very bad memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">SL: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2185">And then your minds just start to wander.</span> <span id="s2186">So instead of the -- th-the -- like happened, things like that, just ignored it.</span> <span id="s2187">Cause I in -- I understand why certain people don’t want to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2188">Q: Why they don’t want to talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">SL: They don’t want to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">Q: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">SL: Don’t want -- They don’t want to let the -- the -- the worms out of the bag.</span> <span id="s2192">Sees --</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">Q: Did you -- Did you -- Did anything different happen?</span> <span id="s2194">I was just thinking about this and there’s just sort of a -- it ca-came in my mind.</span> <span id="s2195">Did anything different happen when your children started to turn 11 or 12, about the same age that you were when you started the experiences?</span> <span id="s2196">Did you look at them and think about yourself at the same age?</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">SL: No, well, because the kids were spoiled.</span> <span id="s2198">I -- Things that they wanted, they got, right?</span> <span id="s2199">I used to think to myself, I says, “By their -- their age, I went through hell.”</span> <span id="s2200">Even right now, I say the same thing.</span> <span id="s2201">God forbid if something would happen, those children would never survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">SL: Never survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">Q: Well, what did -- How does that make you feel?</span> <span id="s2205">Now you have grandchildren who are approaching that age and wa -- one that is almost, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">RL: Right, yeah.</span> <span id="s2207">One is eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2209">SL: Listen, that’s the -- But they want -- they want be -- instead of things -- things that -- something that’s worthwhile.</span> <span id="s2210">See, our granddaughter [indecipherable] be well, okay?</span> <span id="s2211">She’s involved with cancer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">RL: [indecipherable] a 10 year old.</span></p> <p><span id="s2213">SL: 10 year old, she involved --</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">RL: Raises money.</span></p> <p><span id="s2215">SL: She raises money for cancer, because her -- her grandmother passed away of cancer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2216">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2217">Your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s2218">RL: No.</span> <span id="s2219">My mother too, but she didn’t know my mother.</span> <span id="s2220">My mother died in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">SL: That’s from the -- the father’s side.</span></p> <p><span id="s2222">Q: Oh, oh, oh, her -- yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2223">RL: That’s paternal -- paternal grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2224">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">SL: So she’s involved with certain -- with -- with cancer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">RL: Lot of money she raises.</span></p> <p><span id="s2227">SL: And she raises a lot of money, okay?</span> <span id="s2228">RL: A little girl, over a thousand dollars every year, all by herself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2229">Q: Hm, wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2230">SL: Know, she has the -- she has the heart in the right place, see?</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">SL: Which is important.</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2234">But is it -- da -- is -- has it been difficult for you to have gone from so -- so many crises and so much -- so many hard experiences, to a life that’s easier?</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">SL: You mean wa -- so -- You mean we -- what happened a -- I don’t understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s2236">Q: I-It’s a funny question and it may -- may be it doesn’t make any sense.</span> <span id="s2237">It’s just something that I thought that if you had be -- you had taught yourself to be a survivor and to survive not one or two experiences, but many horrible experiences, any one of which is worse than almost anything that almost anybody here goes through.</span> <span id="s2238">I can’t ee -- you know, when I read these stories, when I watch your videotape, you know -- I was in a car accident once.</span> <span id="s2239">I was in one, really bad, horrible car accident that -- that was one of those accidents that I probably shouldn’t have survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">SL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">Q: And you look at the car and you say, “Boy, nobody lived in that.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">SL: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2243">Yeah, your time is not up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2244">Q: And is it -- And it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">SL: You had to come and interview me, you can’t go.</span></p> <p><span id="s2246">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2247">SL: Right?</span> <span id="s2248">It’s -- I mean, it’s certain things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2249">Q: Now -- And I was very aware of that and I was aware of a gift that I had been given.</span> <span id="s2250">But even that one accident is not a comparison to anything -- any of the things that you went through.</span> <span id="s2251">And now -- And th-then I look and I’m reading your story and watching you and I’m saying, “Gee, how -- how can somebody go through all that and then -- and then it stops?”</span> <span id="s2252">I mean, of course you want it to stop and of course you want and deserve to have a -- a -- a life, and a nice life.</span> <span id="s2253">But is it -- is it difficult, the cau -- because you’ve seen so much?</span></p> <p><span id="s2254">SL: No, it’s not difficult.</span> <span id="s2255">You know, because life was meant to go on, okay?</span> <span id="s2256">If something happens, you shouldn’t say that’s the end of it and that’s it.</span> <span id="s2257">Life was meant to go on, til your time is up, then it’ll -- going to stop.</span> <span id="s2258">So don’t give up, see?</span> <span id="s2259">That’s what I believe in.</span> <span id="s2260">That’s -- Some people know, like you leave a -- lose a spouse, you know, some people just fall apart, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2261">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2262">SL: That’s the wrong way to do.</span> <span id="s2263">Listen, you survived, it’s meant for you to survive, right?</span> <span id="s2264">Life must go on.</span> <span id="s2265">I don’t think your other spouse would want you to say that’s the end of you, give up, right?</span> <span id="s2266">No.</span> <span id="s2267">My wife should rest in peace, I mean, she knows it.</span> <span id="s2268">While she was dying, she used to ask -- t-tell me, go call Riya, she lost her husband a year ba -- about a couple of months before, right?</span> <span id="s2269">Go call Riya, her mother, she -- she rest in peace, was sick in Israel, dying from cancer and we used to go to support group, right?</span> <span id="s2270">I should go call Riya and see if she wants to go out with us, or if she wants to go to -- to support group with us, right?</span> <span id="s2271">Now, she and my wife -- I didn’t even know, they used to spend ours on the telephone together, okay?</span> <span id="s2272">My wife, she rest in peace, was pushing me to her, I shouldn’t be alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2273">Q: Oh, that’s remarkable.</span></p> <p><span id="s2274">SL: Hm?</span> <span id="s2275">That’s was -- And shows that y-you can’t just give up life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2276">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">SL: I got completely different outlook.</span> <span id="s2278">I enjoy life, now.</span> <span id="s2279">I mean, you could see what -- life -- life is very short, so might as well make the best of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2280">RL: So he’s in a camp for grown-ups.</span> <span id="s2281">This is a camp for grown-ups --</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">Q: Oh, th-this --</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">RL: -- this place.</span></p> <p><span

id="s2290">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">RL: Anything you want, you have here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">SL: She like -- like her -- her daughter’s father-in-law, is also -- he lost his wife to cancer, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">SL: That -- Very nice people, lovely woman.</span> <span

soul.</span> <span id="s2299">Na -- Because they didn’t prepare themselves to -- to -- for a -- a thing like that.</span> <span id="s2300">Me and my wife, she rest in peace, we went to support groups.</span> <span id="s2301">Na -- You were expecting it, right?</span> <span id="s2302">I mean, there were -- you -- that showed up, and a -- a lot of other people go through the same thing as you are.</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">SL: You prepare yourself for the worst.</span> <span id="s2305">I mean, you know there’s no -- there’s no hope.</span> <span id="s2306">After she passed away, I went to -- I went to a -- also support group, for widow support group.</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">RL: Widow [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2308">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">SL: I mean, everybody’s in the same -- in the same shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2311">SL: So -- And also, in a wa -- helped me to s -- see aba -- in 1997, I had open heart surgery.</span></p> <p><span id="s2312">Q: 1987.</span></p> <p><span id="s2313">SL: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2314">Q: 1987?</span></p> <p><span id="s2315">RL: ‘87.</span></p> <p><span id="s2316">SL: ‘87.</span> <span id="s2317">And my whole personality changed, my whole life changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2318">Q: Yeah, tell me about that, now was that -- was it instantly or was it kind of gradual, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">RL: No, that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2320">SL: No, it was instantly, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2321">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">SL: I was healthy, I used to work like a horse, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">SL: Beside -- Besides that cookie business, had a repair business.</span> <span id="s2325">But my repair business was as a hobby.</span> <span id="s2326">I used to -- I loved to do it.</span> <span id="s2327">And what happened, one day we came back from Florida, was president -- president weekend, we went to Florida.</span> <span id="s2328">And I came back from Florida and there was some snow on the ground and I start to shovel a little of snow and I felt something, right?</span> <span id="s2329">No pain or nothing, but it’s a certain discomfort, right?</span> <span id="s2330">And my son says to me, “What’s the matter, Dad, you don’t feel good?”</span> <span id="s2331">I said, “No, Charles, I’m okay.”</span> <span id="s2332">Maybe it shows on my face.</span> <span id="s2333">And I went back to shovel snow.</span> <span id="s2334">And -- ba -- bac -- ba -- couple of days later, I we -- I broke down with my truck, and I was walking to a gas station, and I had to climb up some steps and I got the same -- the same discomfort.</span> <span id="s2335">I said, “Oh, something’s not right.”</span> <span id="s2336">It’s the first time I admitted something, see?</span> <span id="s2337">I never admitted something before.</span> <span id="s2338">See, before that, I used to -- I used to smoke.</span> <span id="s2339">And I used to have problems from the cigarettes because I used to be outside and my foot -- my left foot used to bother me.</span> <span id="s2340">So I went to orthopedic man and he says, “Oh, you got a dro -- a dropped metatarch -- metatarsal arch, that’s your problem.”</span> <span id="s2341">So what happened, he taped it up.</span> <span id="s2342">He says, “That’ll help you.”</span> <span id="s2343">But instead of helping me, made it worse, because it cut the circulation altogether.</span> <span id="s2344">So after five weeks, you know, I couldn’t walk on my foot no more.</span> <span id="s2345">I went back to him, I said, “I don’t know what it is.”</span> <span id="s2346">He says, “I’ll send you to a vascular man.”</span> <span id="s2347">And when I went to a vascular man and when I walked in and looked on my leg -- he told me later, but he didn’t tell me ri -- he thought I was going to have to amputate it.</span> <span id="s2348">There was no circulation there.</span> <span id="s2349">So the first thing he says to me, “Sol, do you smoke?”</span> <span id="s2350">I says, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s2351">He says, “Listen, if you want me to treat you, first thing you have to do is stop smoking.</span> <span id="s2352">Because if you don’t give up cigarettes, I don’t want you as a patient, and I don’t need your money and don’t even bother coming back to me.</span> <span id="s2353">I don’t need you.”</span> <span id="s2354">Okay, that’s plain and simple.</span></p> <p><span id="s2355">Q: That’s pretty good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2356">SL: Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s2357">RL: Yeah, but wha --</span></p> <p><span id="s2358">SL: And I walked out, that was a Friday night, I says, “Boy, he’s got some nerve to tell me not to stop s -- to stop smoking.”</span> <span id="s2359">And I walk out and I go into the ki -- to a grocery store and I buy a carton of cigarettes, to spite him, okay?</span> <span id="s2360">And next morning I got up, and like somebody said -- a -- a voice came into my head, “Sol, who do you fool?</span> <span id="s2361">The doctor or yourself?</span> <span id="s2362">The doctor is looking out for your health, right?</span> <span id="s2363">Not for his health.</span> <span id="s2364">If you -- If he -- If he wants you with your money, would tell you to come, smoke and come, all right?”</span> <span id="s2365">I said, “He’s looking out for your health.</span> <span id="s2366">Sto -- Stop smoking.”</span> <span id="s2367">And that’s the last time I took a cigarette.</span> <span id="s2368">I put a carton of cigarettes on my night table and I used to dare myself to take a cigarette.</span> <span id="s2369">That carton of cigarettes was laying on my night table for a whole year.</span> <span id="s2370">Never touched a cigarette since.</span></p> <p><span id="s2371">Q: And you had smoked how many years?</span></p> <p><span id="s2372">SL: I -- I haven’t smoked?</span></p> <p><span id="s2373">Q: How long did you smoke up until then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2374">SL: I smoked from 1945 -- the American soldiers gave me when they came in the concentration camp, til 1970 -- ‘78, okay?</span> <span id="s2375">That’s 30 -- 33 years.</span> <span id="s2376">No, more.</span> <span id="s2377">35 - 45 - 30 - 35 - 40 some odd years.</span> <span id="s2378">And there’s the last time I took a cig -- that’s the first time I admitted a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s2379">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2380">SL: See, before -- if you told me day, right, and I said it was night, it’s night.</span></p> <p><span id="s2381">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2382">SL: Nay -- I wouldn’t admit it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2383">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2384">SL: And that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2385">Q: But again, this is something else that’s in -- an interesting aspect of your personality --</span></p> <p><span id="s2386">SL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2387">Q: -- because most people can’t stop smoking.</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">SL: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2389">The same thing --</span></p> <p><span id="s2390">RL: Yeah, he [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2391">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2392">SL: -- I like -- I love ice cream, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">RL: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2394">SL: I love ice cream.</span></p> <p><span id="s2395">RL: -- the personality.</span></p> <p><span id="s2396">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2397">SL: Now, if I haven’t got it in the house, it bothers me.</span> <span id="s2398">My inside is just urt -- hurting for it.</span> <span id="s2399">If I have it in the house, I’ll open up the freezer and look at it, right?</span> <span id="s2400">I’m not eating you, right?</span> <span id="s2401">And I would never touch it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2402">RL: And I wind up finishing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">SL: I -- I wouldn’t touch it.</span> <span id="s2404">It could lay for a year and I throw it out.</span> <span id="s2405">She eats it up now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2406">RL: Yeah, [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2407">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2408">Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">SL: See, I have a very sa -- a very -- a very strong persa -- the personal -- the will.</span></p> <p><span id="s2410">RL: Will -- Willpower.</span></p> <p><span id="s2411">Q: Yeah, you do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2412">SL: That’s this -- That -- Like the survival, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2413">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2414">SL: So, as I was saying, so I admitted my problem and I went to the doctor and I went to my -- and he examined me and he says, “I didn’t see nothing wrong,” he says.</span> <span id="s2415">“Your heart is good, and a little high blood pressure.</span> <span id="s2416">The cardiogram is perfect.</span> <span id="s2417">Your heart, it sounds strong.”</span> <span id="s2418">He said, “I didn’t see nothing wrong.”</span> <span id="s2419">He said, “But just in case,” he says, “I’ll send you to -- to a cardiologist.”</span> <span id="s2420">So I went to a cardiologist, he examined me, gave me a cardiogram.</span> <span id="s2421">He says, “I don’t see nothing wrong.”</span> <span id="s2422">So he says, “You know what,” he says, “I’ll set you up for a stressed -- for -- for a stress test in tallium.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2423">RL: Tallium stress test.</span></p> <p><span id="s2424">Q: What’s it called?</span></p> <p><span id="s2425">RL: Tallium stress test, where they inject them with a dye --</span></p> <p><span id="s2426">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2427">SL: Dye.</span></p> <p><span id="s2428">RL: -- and you do your -- it’s stressed exercise --</span></p> <p><span id="s2429">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2430">RL: -- and it’s being monitored and -- and they monitor it, and they see how the blood flows in the heart --</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2432">RL: -- as it wor -- as the hear -- how the heart works and everything.</span> <span id="s2433">And this is when they can see that something is wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s2434">SL: So I went to my stress test.</span> <span id="s2435">I went through the whole stress test, nothing, perfect.</span> <span id="s2436">Then I went -- say -- said, after the stress test, you go home, you could eat and come back three hours later and we’ll give you the other test.</span></p> <p><span id="s2437">RL: The [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2438">SL: So when I -- when I came back, they ga -- I came back three hours later and they gave me the tallium test and they saw something there.</span> <span id="s2439">Because the dye -- Because the blood doesn’t go through, it lights up, it gets lighter.</span> <span id="s2440">So he says, “You got something there.”</span> <span id="s2441">I mean, he didn’t tell me, but they gave the report to the doctor, so when I came to the doctor for the visit, he says, “There’s something there, but we don’t know what it is, okay?</span> <span id="s2442">But I would suggest you ja -- you go to a angiogram.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2443">RL: Angiogram.</span></p> <p><span id="s2444">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2445">SL: And this -- the doctor says that, “There’s one man that’s excellent, one of tops.”</span> <span id="s2446">He says, “If I had to go, I would go to thats gatta, and the hospital’s one of the tops in the country.</span> <span id="s2447">It’s Saint Francis Hospital in Roslynn, Long Island.</span> <span id="s2448">And Dr. Ambi is one of the top men there.”</span> <span id="s2449">He says, “Call up and make an appointment.”</span> <span id="s2450">So I called him up and made an appointment.</span> <span id="s2451">The earliest appointment he gave me, was in June.</span></p> <p><span id="s2452">RL: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2453">SL: And that was in -- that was in the end of -- of February or beginning of March.</span> <span id="s2454">I says, “I’m not in a hurry, nothing bothers me.”</span> <span id="s2455">But one day in May -- in April I think it was, I didn’t feel good.</span> <span id="s2456">So I called the doctor, he says, “Okay, come down.”</span> <span id="s2457">I came down and he examined me, he said, “I don’t know, there’s nothing there.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2458">RL: What did Ambi say?</span></p> <p><span id="s2459">SL: He said, “What happened with the -- Didn’t you make an appointment Dr. Ambi?”</span> <span id="s2460">I says, “Yeah.”</span> <span id="s2461">He says, “So wh-when do you go -- When did you see him?”</span> <span id="s2462">I said, “I didn’t see him.</span> <span id="s2463">The earliest appointment he gave me in June.”</span> <span id="s2464">He says, “Let me talk to him.”</span> <span id="s2465">So he calls him up, and he took a -- speaks to Dr. Ambi.</span> <span id="s2466">He says, “Do me a favor,” he says, “this is a very good friend of mine.</span> <span id="s2467">See if you could see him earlier.”</span> <span id="s2468">He says, “Okay,” he says, “you know what?</span> <span id="s2469">Send him down Wednesday, I’ll examine him.”</span> <span id="s2470">So I came down Wednesday, he examines me, he don’t find nothing there.</span> <span id="s2471">He says, “I’m going to set you up for a stress test,” I mean, “angiogram.”</span> <span id="s2472">Tha-That was for the May first.</span> <span id="s2473">And I came May first, they gave me the angiogram.</span> <span id="s2474">He says, “You know, you are a walking time bomb.”</span> <span id="s2475">He says, “Your left artery is completely closed.”</span> <span id="s2476">He said, “You are -- You should have had a massive heart attack.”</span> <span id="s2477">And he says, “You can -- You going to stay in the hospital, you not go home.</span> <span id="s2478">Because,” he says, “I’m ta -- I’m going to try and see the angioplasty.</span> <span id="s2479">But is -- you have to wait 11 days before.”</span> <span id="s2480">I says, “I’m not going to hang around the hospital.”</span> <span id="s2481">I mean, just lay in the hospital and wait 11 days and what’s was -- an-and I don’t know what a angiogram was, never heard of it.</span> <span id="s2482">Just [indecipherable] you could go nuts.</span></p> <p><span id="s2483">RL: Angioplasty.</span></p> <p><span id="s2484">SL: Huh?</span> <span id="s2485">So, I says, “I’ll come back in 11 days,” and I went to work, like a nut.</span> <span id="s2486">I worked 11 days and I came back the 11th.</span> <span id="s2487">And he told me right away, he says he doesn’t know if he’ll be able to go through, because I was born with my left artery has like a little bend there.</span> <span id="s2488">It’s not straight, it’s a little bent.</span> <span id="s2489">So he may have a problem getting through it.</span> <span id="s2490">He says the right arteries also was clogged, but is -- that wouldn’t have no problem.</span> <span id="s2491">So I came back 11 days and they worked on me for two hours -- two and a half hours.</span> <span id="s2492">Tried to open it, couldn’t do it and I went in emergency surgery.</span></p> <p><span id="s2493">RL: And he had a bypass --</span></p> <p><span id="s2494">SL: And I had --</span></p> <p><span id="s2495">RL: -- and changed his lu -- personality.</span></p> <p><span id="s2496">Q: So tell me about the personality change.</span> <span id="s2497">When did you -- When did the personality change?</span></p> <p><span id="s2498">SL: Well, after my open heart surgery --</span></p> <p><span id="s2499">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2500">SL: My whole personality changed completely, like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.</span> <span id="s2501">I became very -- I mean, very open, I start to talk about the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2502">Q: Right away, or was it [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2503">SL: A couple of weeks after, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2504">Q: A couple of weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s2505">SL: Anything tha -- Everything I was -- I was spoken about everything, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2506">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2507">SL: It’s

affection.</span> <span id="s2513">I started to hug my kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s2514">RL: Started to cry.</span></p> <p><span id="s2515">SL: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2516">RL: Started to cry.</span></p> <p><span id="s2517">SL: And I became very sensitive.</span> <span id="s2518">I mean, years ago, before that, no matter what I saw, what I wat -- didn’t bother me at all, like -- like a piece of ice.</span> <span id="s2519">After my open heart surgery, anything sad, I start to cry.</span> <span id="s2520">Beca -- If -- If I watch a la -- a movie, you know, some with a sad part, I start to cry.</span> <span id="s2521">I became very -- I be -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning of Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s2522">Q: This is an interview with Mr. Sol Lurie, for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, November 30th, 1998, conducted by Steve Roland.</span> <span id="s2523">This is tape three, side two.</span></p> <p><span id="s2524">SL: I started to hug

to show more love to the kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s2536">Q: And what was their reaction?</span></p> <p><span id="s2537">SL: They were shocked.</span> <span id="s2538">My friends couldn’t believe it was me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2539">RL: They still don’t believe it’s you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2540">SL: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2541">It’s like -- It’s like a -- Listen, you got to -- It’s like a different person was born.</span> <span id="s2542">And agai -- and you got another chance in life, and make the best of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2543">Q: Some people -- I -- I -- I -- I think it’s not uncommon for survivors to not want to talk and at some point, they make a decision to talk, when they think maybe it’s time or maybe I better do it, maybe it’s important.</span> <span id="s2544">I don’t have the sense, when you’re telling me this story, that this was a decision that you made, it just sort of happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2545">SL: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2546">Q: Or am I wrong?</span></p> <p><span id="s2547">SL: Listen, I know so many -- I know so many people that -- from the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2548">I would say 80 percent and

hear about it.</span> <span id="s2552">There’s one guy here, he -- he talks about it, okay?</span> <span id="s2553">He goes to school, he talks a lot about it.</span> <span id="s2554">There’s another guy, he don’t talk about it at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2555">Q: No, but what I’m ap -- f-for -- I -- I want to ask you about that, but what -- but what I’m asking you is, after your surgery, was this a decision that you made to talk, or was it just something that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s2556">SL: Something that happened by itself, no decision.</span></p> <p><span id="s2557">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2558">SL: I wa -- And I was speaking to -- to a -- th-the doctor, he says a lot of times, they don’t know why, they cannot explain, but the people, the -- always, the whole personality changes, they don’t know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s2559">RL: They become very emotional, very sensitive.</span> <span id="s2560">They cry easily.</span></p> <p><span id="s2561">Q: Di-Did you have a sense that you were close to death?</span> <span id="s2562">That you ma -- that, you know, that it could have gone the other way and you could have died?</span></p> <p><span id="s2563">SL: Well -- Oh, definitely.</span> <span id="s2564">Listen, I told my wife -- I mean, when -- I said, “Listen, if something happens to me, I don’t want you to be alone, remarry.”</span> <span id="s2565">I -- An-And listen, when you go this type of surgery, I -- Y-You didn -- You don’t know if you’re going to come out or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s2566">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2567">SL: Now, it’s a little easier.</span></p> <p><span id="s2568">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2569">SL: That was almost 12 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s2570">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2571">SL: Was a different situation.</span> <span id="s2572">So -- But it’s like even th-the -- my recovery was excellent, excellent.</span> <span id="s2573">I mean, the doctors themself couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s2574">That I went in -- I went in to surgery, was three 30 -- a quarter -- a quarter after six, I was out of surgery, right?</span> <span id="s2575">By seven o’clock my wife was talking to me, [indecipherable] right?</span> <span id="s2576">The doctors told her, “He doesn’t know what’s going on.”</span> <span id="s2577">I opened my eyes, I’m shaking my head, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s2578">Q: That’s funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s2579">SL: Dowah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2580">Q: Now when -- when -- Now let’s lit -- ta -- Now, you’re tel -- You’re saying that a lot of the survivors that you know don’t want to talk about the experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s2581">SL: A lot of them, a lot of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2582">Q: Is that a -- Is that a -- Who a -- Who are they protecting?</span> <span id="s2583">Are they protecting themselves, or they protecting their families?</span></p> <p><span id="s2584">SL: See, they don’t want to open up.</span> <span id="s2585">In other words, this -- the thing that -- the thing they -- they know something that hurt them, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2586">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2587">SL: And they bury it in deep inside --</span></p> <p><span id="s2588">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2589">SL: -- and they’re afraid if they open up, it’s going to start -- bring back very bad memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s2590">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2591">SL: It’s like somebody with -- with somementally right?</span> <span id="s2592">And also, to start talking about it.</span> <span id="s2593">Before he -- he’s afraid he’s going to get int -- have a nervous breakdown.</span></p> <p><span id="s2594">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2595">SL: So they figure if they don’t -- if they don’t open it up, they’ll feel a little better.</span> <span id="s2596">They’re just afraid to open up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2597">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2598">SL: Even Hurley, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2599">RL: Yeah, he doesn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s2600">SL: He -- He -- He ca -- He goes to talk -- I -- I -- There’s a guy out here that lives in that community, he goes to talk about -- he goes to schools and talks about it, right?</span> <span id="s2601">But when you want to talk between you and him about, he don’t want to talk.</span> <span id="s2602">Now to me, doesn’t make sense.</span> <span id="s2603">Because your story is -- talk to schools about it, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2604">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2605">SL: What you experienced, why can’t we talk between ee -- with -- between the two of us?</span></p> <p><span id="s2606">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2607">SL: He wouldn’t talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s2608">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2609">SL: But -- But I tell you, [indecipherable] that I told my friend next door to -- he made a -- made a video and he talks a little more about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2610">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2611">SL: Before that, he was afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s2612">Q: How long ago was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2613">SL: This year, was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2614">RL: About a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s2615">SL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2616">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2617">RL: About a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s2618">SL: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2619">And he’s very happy he did it.</span> <span id="s2620">He used to tell me, “Gee, I don’t know why I told you I was -- I’m going to do it.”</span> <span id="s2621">I tell you, for weeks, he was li -- he was walking around like a maniac, he was afraid.</span> <span id="s2622">And I told him, “Bill, you’ll be okay.”</span> <span id="s2623">Now he’s happy he did it.</span> <span id="s2624">He says, “Now I got something to leave for m --” is -- his sons, right, is so happy to -- because he never -- they never knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2625">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2626">SL: When they watched the video, you know, they -- they couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s2627">Important.</span> <span id="s2628">People don’t realize it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2629">RL: He never watched his videos.</span></p> <p><span id="s2630">SL: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s2631">RL: You.</span></p> <p><span id="s2632">SL: Bill’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s2633">RL: Yours.</span></p> <p><span id="s2634">SL: No, I don’t want to

Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2639">SL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2640">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2641">SL: Listen, [indecipherable] watched it, he was so impressed with -- he works for NBC.</span></p> <p><span id="s2642">RL: He was here one day when they did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2643">SL: He was here too, when they were -- when they were taping it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2644">Q: Oh, they taped it here?</span></p> <p><span id="s2645">SL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2646">Q: Oh, I didn’t know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2647">RL: No, Spielberg taped

id="s2651">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2652">Are they different the interviews, the one that you did for the museum and one for Spielberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s2653">RL: A -- A little different.</span> <span id="s2654">Every interviewer --</span></p> <p><span id="s2655">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2656">RL: -- brings out himself and puts himself [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2657">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2658">SL: Well, the one that in Washington, she was a much better interviewer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2659">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span

that I got locked into my head, you know.</span> <span id="s2674">I don’t want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s2675">I mean, mo -- most -- most of the things, I talk about, but there’s certain things like your bod -- your mind just blocked it out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2676">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2677">I was thinking about that during, you know, when I watched it.</span> <span id="s2678">I mean, they asked me to talk to you about other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2679">SL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2680">Q: But if I wanted to talk about those things, I could -- there was a lot of things I could ask you about, but I didn’t -- you know, a few -- a few of them I -- in fact, really, there were a few specific things I wanted to ask you about.</span> <span id="s2681">One was, she -- she asked you a question in the early part of the interview and you said that -- she asked you if you had been beaten while you were in the ghetto in Kovno, and you said no, you’d seen other people getting beaten, but you were never beaten until you got to Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s2682">SL: Birkenau, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2683">Q: Now, what -- But she didn’t ask you about the beating.</span> <span id="s2684">Was that the time you got hit with the shovel, or was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2685">SL: Yeah, with the shovel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2686">Q: -- oh, that was -- okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2687">SL: That’s my arm, here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2688">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2689">SL: That’s the one I can’t straighten out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2690">Q: Now, and what happened, the officer was mad at somebody else?</span></p> <p><span id="s2691">SL: Well, we were walking -- we’re working on the railroad, you see, unloading.</span></p> <p><span id="s2692">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2693">SL: And a guy [indecipherable] Hungarian Jews, Romanian?</span></p> <p><span id="s2694">RL: Hungarian.</span></p> <p><span id="s2695">SL: Hungarian Jews, yeah.</span> <span id="s2696">And -- And they all -- They -- They just came into the concentration camp and they weren’t used to things like that, you know.</span> <span id="s2697">And we were -- We had like a -- It’s like a wheelbarrow, but you carry it.</span> <span id="s2698">And one guy in the front and one in the back, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2699">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2700">SL: And they used to put in rocks, or whatever, use -- you had to take it here and the other group used to take it back, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2701">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2702">SL: And what happened, we -- we loaded up -- they load -- they loaded our -- our thing up and you had to run, you couldn’t walk, you had to run with it, right?</span> <span id="s2703">And he didn’t -- he didn’t move.</span> <span id="s2704">So, because he didn’t move, we both got a beating.</span> <span id="s2705">So I got hit with a rifle on my arm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2706">RL: Shovel, you said.</span></p> <p><span id="s2707">SL: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2708">RL: Shovel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2709">SL: Shovel, shovel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2710">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2711">SL: The shovel in the arm and -- and it broke, I didn’t even know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2712">Q: Your arm broke.</span></p> <p><span id="s2713">SL: My arm was broken.</span> <span id="s2714">But I didn’t feel no pain or nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2715">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2716">SL: And all those years, up til 19 -- 1987, right?</span> <span id="s2717">It used to bother me, but my arm -- I figured maybe it’s arthritis.</span> <span id="s2718">So it used -- it used to bother me and I never paid attention to it, because my arms just were la -- and then, when I had -- when I had my open heart surgery, I had a problem with my back.</span> <span id="s2719">So I went to orthopedic man, and after -- and I was getting treatments, I told orthopedic man about my arm.</span> <span id="s2720">He says, “Let me take a x-ray,” right?</span> <span id="s2721">He took an x-ray.</span> <span id="s2722">He said, “Here’s your problem, your arm was broken.”</span> <span id="s2723">You could still see the break.</span> <span id="s2724">And it healed, but the thing is, when yo -- after a certain time, it gets arthritic.</span></p> <p><span id="s2725">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2726">SL: And that’s what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2727">Q: Now there was another story that you -- you also said ri -- in about the same part of the interview, that you were only in one fight in your life, once.</span> <span id="s2728">And she

instead of lowering the interest, right?</span> <span id="s3831">If he would raise up a -- a -- a point or two, what’s going to happen to the economy?</span></p> <p><span id="s3832">Q: I don’t know, what?</span></p> <p><span id="s3833">SL: It’s going to fall apart.</span> <span id="s3834">The stock market is -- it’ll collapse.</span> <span id="s3835">Because they getting cheap money, they could ren -- they could lend cheap money.</span> <span id="s3836">The one that ge -- the one that gets hurt is the little guy.</span> <span id="s3837">I mean, you take the stock market, it’s not worth half what people pay for it, because the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- sa -- when you buy a piece of stock, first you don’t pay no interest.</span> <span id="s3838">You don’t pay nothing.</span> <span id="s3839">The only thing you hope is on capital gain.</span> <span id="s3840">Now, why is there capital gain?</span> <span id="s3841">Because when you have money in the bank, or you buy securities, right, treasuries, they don’t pay much.</span> <span id="s3842">So people going to the stock market.</span> <span id="s3843">And the demand is there.</span> <span id="s3844">Listen, you want it, you pay for it.</span> <span id="s3845">87 percent of the stock market, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s3846">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3847">SL: You people pay for 80 per -- seven percent per dollar for this -- for the stock.</span> <span id="s3848">It’s not even worth -- it’s a -- it’s a high inflation on the stock if it’s 27 percent.</span> <span id="s3849">Now, it’s 87 percent, and who controls it?</span> <span id="s3850">Goes into Mutual funds.</span> <span id="s3851">I mean, they ga -- they have a hundred -- millions of …</span></p> <p><span id="s3852">Q: Still, I think that in --in terms of -- of that, I think -- I mean, part of it you tol -- I thought that the story that you told of your wife’s illness and her urging you to -- to -- to continue --</span></p> <p><span id="s3853">SL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3854">Q: I thought that was very moving and I think it’s -- it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s3855">SL: You’re talking on the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s3856">Q: Yes, the tape is now on.</span></p> <p><span id="s3857">SL: I’m talking about the video you’re talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s3858">Q: Oh yeah, well and -- and what you told me before.</span> <span id="s3859">In fact, let me just lay this -- this is section three of the interview with Sol Lurie and Rina Lurie, November 30th, 1998, and it’s now about three 30 PM in their home.</span> <span id="s3860">Yeah, w-wha -- I -- Just -- Just the idea of her getting sick and wanting you to continue and to be comfortable and to be taken care of.</span> <span id="s3861">I -- I found it moving.</span></p> <p><span id="s3862">SL: Well, in 19 -- My wife used to complain you know this -- that she showed blood in the -- in the stool, in 1989, just before I went -- I went -- I went to Israel.</span> <span id="s3863">So she went to the doctor and the doctor examined her and said, “Well,” he says, “I’ll set you up for a colonostopy, I don’t see nothing there.”</span> <span id="s3864">So she went for the colonostopy and they gave her the colonostopy and they couldn’t find nothing.</span> <span id="s3865">He says -- The doctor says, “Well,” he says, “you -- looks like you have internal hemorrhoids and that’s your problem, you know, that’s why you’re bleeding.”</span> <span id="s3866">And my wife listens, she took it for granted that that’s the problem.</span> <span id="s3867">I mean, th-they went in the colon.</span> <span id="s3868">So she forgot about it, but every time she used to go to the bathroom, she saw some blood, right?</span> <span id="s3869">From -- From 1989, and then 1990, me and my wife went to Israel, we met my brother and my sister-in-law and my nephew, the f -- buc -- my brother came from Lithuania and the family there.</span> <span id="s3870">And she met her aunts and uncles, I mean she had -- my wife -- and listen, while my wife was -- all the time she had the problem with -- with the hemorrhoids, so she kept on [indecipherable] the doctor.</span> <span id="s3871">He says, “Well, what do you want?”</span> <span id="s3872">He says, “It shows hemorrhoid and that’s your problem.”</span> <span id="s3873">When the -- Later on, 1990 -- 1992, she had -- she start to get pain when she was walking, in the groin.</span> <span id="s3874">So he send -- So he -- The doctor send her to orthopedic man and the doctor said, “You got -- You got arthritis, that’s your problem, that’s why you can’t walk.”</span> <span id="s3875">So she figured that’s the problem, you have to learn to live with it.</span> <span id="s3876">Now, my wife always wanted -- she wanted to move to Florida.</span> <span id="s3877">And also one -- During the time, you know, my wife’s personality changed a lot.</span> <span id="s3878">I mean, her whole character changed.</span> <span id="s3879">She became very, very hard to live with.</span> <span id="s3880">And I figured maybe it’s the change of life or thing like that.</span> <span id="s3881">And all the time, you know, she had problem with the -- with the -- with the stool.</span> <span id="s3882">And that’s -- So we went -- we went to Florida and I bought a place over there, because she wanted it and I bought a place over there and we came back.</span> <span id="s3883">That was in January of 1993.</span> <span id="s3884">And we came back and what happens?</span> <span id="s3885">She went to the bathroom and like blood just gushed out, right, from the -- from the stool.</span> <span id="s3886">So, she went to the doctor and told him.</span> <span id="s3887">He says, “Well, we’re going to get another colonostopy.”</span> <span id="s3888">And they gave her a colonostopy and it came back they -- they mi -- they misread something on -- on -- on the -- she had a -- she had a tha -- she had a polyp in the rectum, they said it was a pol -- they didn’t look in the rectum, they went right into the colon.</span> <span id="s3889">And the polyp was right behind the -- the -- the -- the -- the pa -- the -- the hemorrhoids.</span> <span id="s3890">And by that time, in 1993, by that time, the cancer was in the bones already, and it went to the liver.</span> <span id="s3891">So the doctor said, see if we could do something about it.</span> <span id="s3892">And we got a -- we got a wonderful doctor and she called him up and told him, and he saw she was very distraughted, you know, very upset.</span> <span id="s3893">This Dr. Cohen, here’s a guy, he didn’t have no office hours.</span> <span id="s3894">And -- And that day he said -- he said, “But you come into the office, I’ll see you.”</span> <span id="s3895">Okay?</span> <span id="s3896">And we went to -- So he opened up the office specially.</span> <span id="s3897">We went to him in Long Beach and he examined her and took tests.</span> <span id="s3898">And he says, “You got the cancer in the -- it’s in the liver, it’s also on the lungs.”</span> <span id="s3899">Because he was going to operate on her.</span> <span id="s3900">He says, “But in Sloan-Kettering, they have a -- they -- they have a new method, that they -- they give chemotherapy.</span> <span id="s3901">They implant radiation right into the liver.</span> <span id="s3902">So instead of the fa -- this did not give you the -- the -- give the che -- chemotherapy all over your body, it just works in that area, you know, so it doesn’t affect the rest of the body.</span> <span id="s3903">So my wife, she wen -- sh -- Evelyn went to Sloan-Kettering and had the surgery to put the implant radiation and when he opened her up, he said -- told us, he said, “The body -- cancer spread all through her body, nothing you could do for her.</span> <span id="s3904">If she live three months, it’ll be a miracle.”</span> <span id="s3905">He said if she would have come like two years before, she could have been c -- she could have been cured.</span> <span id="s3906">The type of cancer she had is the easiest cancer to cure.</span> <span id="s3907">Because they took out part of her colon, ri -- an-and the tumor didn’t even penetrate the wall, was just in the colon, the easiest cancer.</span> <span id="s3908">And -- And they didn’t -- They just closed her up and they were giving her chemotherapy.</span> <span id="s3909">And the -- the doctor said if she lived three months, it’ll be a miracle.</span> <span id="s3910">And she made up her mind she’s going to beat the cancer.</span> <span id="s3911">And whatever there was a little sl -- little hope, she went.</span></p> <p><span id="s3912">RL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3913">SL: She was ca -- from one doctor to the other.</span> <span id="s3914">She was getting ther -- chemotherapy.</span> <span id="s3915">And then the pain got bad so she was getting morphine.</span> <span id="s3916">They started her up at five milligrams of morphine.</span> <span id="s3917">And she wanted to go to Florida, I says, “Okay, let’s go to Florida.”</span> <span id="s3918">Went to Florida, she was getting chemotherapy there and wh-when the five milligrams of morphine went up to 350 milligrams of morphine.</span> <span id="s3919">And that didn’t help no more.</span> <span id="s3920">It came to a point, you know, that sh -- she sa -- she said, “I want to go to the hospital.”</span> <span id="s3921">S-So we went to the hospital -- no, she went -- she went to another doctor before -- just before that, went Sloan-Kettering and she says to him, “Is there any hope?”</span> <span id="s3922">He says, “Listen, you want to hear the truth?”</span> <span id="s3923">I mean, she was -- she gets -- used to get sores and blisters all over her mouth, she couldn’t swallow.</span> <span id="s3924">When -- They came from the -- right, from the chemotherapy and the radiation.</span></p> <p><span id="s3925">RL: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3926">SL: He says, “You want to hear the truth?</span> <span id="s3927">Could you take it?”</span> <span id="s3928">She says, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s3929">He said, “Well, there’s nothing more we could do for you.”</span> <span id="s3930">And we went home and there gra -- she says, “You know, Sol, I don’t want to live no more.</span> <span id="s3931">That’s it.”</span> <span id="s3932">And then the -- the pain got so severe, that even the 350 milligrams of morphine -- she used to get a patch -- didn’t help no more.</span> <span id="s3933">So I too -- I took her to the hospital and she was getting more morphine there and five days later, she died.</span> <span id="s3934">She died in my ma -- she was waiting for me.</span> <span id="s3935">I had to go, because in the hospital, they didn’t have the patches for the chemotherapy.</span> <span id="s3936">So I had to -- I had to go and get it.</span> <span id="s3937">So I had to wait til the drugstore opened up, because I used to be in the hospital from seven o’clock in the morning, til 12 - one o’clock in the morning -- the morning.</span> <span id="s3938">And when the -- So I went, waiting for a drugstore to open up, when I came back, the doctor was there, trying to give her intravenous.</span> <span id="s3939">She was like [indecipherable] pain.</span> <span id="s3940">And when she saw me, you know, she -- she opened up her eyes and put out her arms just like she was waiting like a Messiah came, okay?</span> <span id="s3941">And she said, “Sol,” okay?</span> <span id="s3942">And I came over to her and I told her, I says, “I’m here, H-Hava.”</span> <span id="s3943">I used to call her Ha-Hava.</span> <span id="s3944">And I was there and she calmed down, was very relaxed.</span> <span id="s3945">And then, about two o’clock, the doctors called me and he says that’s the end, there’s nothing more we can do for her, that’s it.</span> <span id="s3946">Because she made out a living will and he said, “It’s time to sign the living will,” you know?</span> <span id="s3947">So I signed the living will.</span> <span id="s3948">And they probably gave her some -- they gave her so much morphine that --</span></p> <p><span id="s3949">RL: They gave her morphine, put her to sleep [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3950">SL: They kill her.</span> <span id="s3951">She died in my arms.</span> <span id="s3952">Yes.</span> <span id="s3953">After that, listen, life has to go on.</span> <span id="s3954">I was -- was a wasted life, but life had to go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s3955">RL: It wasn’t a wasted life, she left three children.</span></p> <p><span id="s3956">SL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3957">RL: It wasn’t a wasted life, she left you plenty.</span></p> <p><span id="s3958">SL: Still, she could have lived longer, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s3959">RL: Wasn’t wasted.</span> <span id="s3960">While she lived -- She lived a nice full life.</span></p> <p><span id="s3961">SL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3962">Q: I think he meant to say --</span></p> <p><span id="s3963">SL: Yeah, but it’s not --</span></p> <p><span id="s3964">Q: -- if they hadn’t -- they made a mistake.</span></p> <p><span id="s3965">RL: It was a -- It’s a shame that -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3966">SL: It’s not, it’s the pain, the suffering.</span> <span id="s3967">The suffering that she had to go through, that’s what -- I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s3968">RL: That mistake cost her her life.</span></p> <p><span id="s3969">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3970">RL: Because that cancer is so prevented -- I mean curable in the early stages, and she got it in early stages, she noticed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3971">SL: She went in plenty of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3972">RL: Yeah, the doctor said six months before, he could still help her --</span></p> <p><span id="s3973">SL: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3974">RL: -- the surgeon said.</span></p> <p><span id="s3975">SL: What --</span></p> <p><span id="s3976">RL: She had a -- her oncologist, is a very nice man.</span> <span id="s3977">We used to -- I used to -- I knew him personally, we would talk.</span> <span id="s3978">I once talked about another friend with him, the chemotherapy and stuff.</span> <span id="s3979">He was so good, such a good man.</span> <span id="s3980">And he told -- And she was going to him and I didn’t know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3981">SL: Yeah, she [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3982">RL: And she told me she’s going to him, I says, “He’s a wonderful human being, so much heart in him.”</span> <span id="s3983">And he’s good at what he’s doing.</span> <span id="s3984">And he refused to give her more chemotherapy, so she went to the partner --</span></p> <p><span id="s3985">SL: It’s a waste.</span></p> <p><span id="s3986">RL: -- to poison her a little more.</span></p> <p><span id="s3987">SL: The doctor, he didn’t want to give it to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s3988">RL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3989">SL: Cause he know there’s no hope.</span> <span id="s3990">So the only thing -- She used to get these blisters, the whole mouth, the whole lips.</span></p> <p><span id="s3991">RL: That’s from the chemotherapy.</span></p> <p><span id="s3992">SL: The s -- throat, she couldn’t even swallow no water.</span></p> <p><span id="s3993">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3994">RL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3995">SL: It -- It’s a shame, I’ll tell you something.</span> <span id="s3996">Dr. Kevorky, they should give that man a medal.</span> <span id="s3997">I’m telling you, because people suffer.</span></p> <p><span id="s3998">RL: But Sol, she wanted, to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s3999">SL: This way, the person don’t want to live no more, that’s it, forget about it.</span> <span id="s4000">But wh-when you -- you used to -- when you went through things like that, then you know what suffering means.</span> <span id="s4001">I mean, you could see the person just being wasted away.</span> <span id="s4002">The doctors don’t care, as long as they get -- make the money out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s4003">RL: Most of them do care, Sol.</span> <span id="s4004">Oncologists do care.</span> <span id="s4005">You get burned out in that, [indecipherable] very fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s4006">Q: I would imagine.</span></p> <p><span
