born.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: I was born in Zagreb.</span> <span id="s17">At that time, it was the kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, later became Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s18">It’s Croatia now.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: And what year were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: I was born in 1921, December fifth.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: December fifth?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: 1921?</span> <span id="s24">And, what was your name when you were born, your full name?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: Officially, you know, in the documents, I was Carolina Sternberg, but I was always known as Lucie, L-u-c-i-e C-a-r-o-l-i-n-e, and that was never used except on documents.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: And your name now?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Lucie Carol Rosenberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Rosenberg.</span> <span id="s29">Now, I want us to get some sense of what your life was like in your childhood.</span> <span id="s30">So, perhaps you can start with your parents, or you can start where you would like.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: My father’s name was Manfred Sternberg.</span> <span id="s32">My mother’s name was Lili.</span> <span id="s33">Her maiden name was Prister, P-r-i-s-t-e-r.</span> <span id="s34">He was from Slavonska Pozega, which was a rural part of Croatia, and my mother was from Zagreb and her family was an old Zagreb family that had originally come from what is now Italy and is the extreme border that really is on the other side of Radiska and Achilea (ph), and places like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: And, your mother’s family was a fairly wealthy family?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: They were a wealthy family.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: And, what did her father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Her father was an architect and actually did all sorts of building both for the – some private buildings, but he did a lot of – for instance, he was building docks in Fiume at the time, and various – I think maybe some public buildings of one kind or another.</span> <span id="s39">I don’t think that he was a particularly inventive or artistic or whatever, but he was a work-a-day architect who always kept his profession, whereas the rest of his family was spending money like crazy and ended up paupers, many of them, after spending money like mad in one direction or another.</span> <span id="s40">He was always working.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: And what was your father doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: My father was an industrialist.</span> <span id="s43">I think mostly agricultural.</span> <span id="s44">Croatia obviously was a very agricult – mostly, 80 percent agricultural country, and he had alcohol – and he had an alcohol yeast factory which was a very large one, and probably the largest in that part of Croatia, and a number of other agricultural refineries and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Since I’m ignorant, what does it mean to have an alcohol yeast factory?</span> <span id="s46">What is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Well, yeast obviously, you know, is made - these we were almost monopolies because there were certain ones, I mean, not many people were producing yeast for making bread.</span> <span id="s48">Agricultural alcohol means that they would take beets, you know, various corn, for instance, and so on, and it would be refined as alcohol.</span> <span id="s49">And for a while, as a matter for fact, in Croatia, there was a law where you had to mix alcohol with gasoline, which is what they’re doing here now, and this was always very protected because there were huge, huge taxes otherwise.</span> <span id="s50">But being as it was agricultural, any kind of agricultural stuff was protected by the government because it was sort of beneficial to the state or whatever, or the peasantry or whatever.</span> <span id="s51">So, obviously there were lots of land where some of this raw material was produced, but also was bought from the peasants as needed.</span> <span id="s52">The yeast was, you know, shipped around and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: So, you were born into a very privileged life?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: So, tell me about – like, let me first ask you, what is your clearest memory of your mother?</span> <span id="s56">When you were little, when you were a young person?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: A very sweet lady getting dressed to go out somewhere elegantly.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: So, they were very social?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: They were very social, but everybody was this way, young people, and it was a social town, and it was a fairly small group, totally mixed – both Jewish and non-Jewish population.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Now, were you taken care of primarily by governesses at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Yes, but my mother supervised.</span> <span id="s62">One of my very early memories was of a German nurse with a – who were dressed like nuns, and had this long veil.</span> <span id="s63">They were special children’s nurses.</span> <span id="s64">And she was unusually unpleasant, and put me apparently into a dark room, and I do remember that, and the cook saved – me upstairs, started screaming and the woman was let go immediately, and then there was, I guess, when my brother was born, there was a peasant nanny that came and until my brother’s maybe five, this was there.</span> <span id="s65">Then I got an English governess, Miss… her name was… because the second one – the first one was called Miss “Mees Smees” – Miss Smith – she was known “Mees Smees”, who was with us for maybe six months.</span> <span id="s66">My brother was throwing tantrums and – because he couldn’t stand her, and then the nanny came back for – and stayed forever as part of the household.</span> <span id="s67">And then there was a Swiss person who was quite unpleasant for about six months, and then my real English governess who stayed for years, whose name was Agnes Coyne.</span> <span id="s68">And there, there was something kind of amusing about her because when King Alexander was killed.</span> <span id="s69">There was a…</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: That was in ’28?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: No, I think maybe ’34, ’34.</span> <span id="s72">There was a regency formed because Peter was too young to govern and one of the – I mean, the main member of this, of this regency was King Alexander’s cousin, Prince Paul, and two other persons – one was a Slovene and the other was a guy buy name of Ivo Perovic, which was a Croatian ban, which was sort of like a governor of a state.</span> <span id="s73">He had three children and lived in Zagreb, but then they moved back to – then they moved to Belgrade, and they decided they absolutely had to have our governess, and contacted her and contacted my mother, and they wanted – she didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s74">And my mother said, “You absolutely have to go because we would have sanctions against us left and right.</span> <span id="s75">You can’t say no.”</span> <span id="s76">And finally she went, but apparently she was so unhappy she phoned us practically every week, and one day appeared at our doorstep with her suitcases and my mother had to make up some big story about her being sick, having to move to England, nervous breakdown and so on, and she stayed until I guess I was 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Where did you eat dinner?</span> <span id="s78">Did you eat with your parents?</span> <span id="s79">Did you eat -</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Lunch… The main meal was at noon, and the governess and my brother and I sat at the table with them, and in the evening we sat with them when had dinner with the governess.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: So, do you remember conversations around the table?</span> <span id="s82">Were they very inquisitive about what you had done during the day?</span> <span id="s83">Or was this a very adult meal?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Both.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Both?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Both, but yes, of course, because we often didn’t have school at the same time.</span> <span id="s87">Schools were – school days were three days in the morning, three days in the afternoon from eight to one, quarter to one, something like that, and then afterwards we would have private classes of one kind or another at home in German, French, this and that.</span> <span id="s88">And, my brother may have gone – he did not go to the same school as I did, but I’m a little – I’m already high school.</span> <span id="s89">I’ll go back, if you want, to, to primary school.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: He’s three years younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Three years younger, three years younger, yeah.</span> <span id="s92">And so I’m not quite sure whether – I think I’m talking now mostly is-is already in secondary school.</span> <span id="s93">Yeah, because, but otherwise, yeah, we ate at the table.</span> <span id="s94">This was mostly for discipline.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Well, you know, you sit around and slop around in sort of a children’s room, it’s different than when you’re sitting at the table with a meal that was served with white gloves.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: So, there were people there who were serving with white gloves?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: So, did that mean you have to be very prim and proper, as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s101">Well, no, listen, because she took off her gloves and we palled around afterwards, but, yeah, it was quite formal.</span> <span id="s102">It was quite formal.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Were your parent warm to you?</span> <span id="s104">Were they affectionate?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s106">Yes, but also quite disciplinarian, both, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Were you close with your brother even though he was…?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s109">I mean, as much as you’re close with a boy who’s three years younger than you.</span> <span id="s110">You despise them mostly, but yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: And the friends that you had, were the many school chums that you had, or were…?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: First of all cousins.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Lots of cousins?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Not many, one cousin who is Mia Bauer (ph), who is two and a half younger – two and a half years younger than me.</span> <span id="s115">There was another one who died who was also three years younger, and then there were extended family – cousins who were about – but he was the oldest, except for two cousins who were from out of town, and then later on – it wasn’t a very large family.</span> <span id="s116">And the Pristers all lived apart, so this was mostly Sternberg part of the family.</span> <span id="s117">Although there was one cousin of the younger ones of the sisters that would have been – who was about my age, maybe a year younger or so.</span> <span id="s118">Yes, they were very affectionate; yes they were strict as far as school work is concerned, as far as manners were concerned, as far as -</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Did you like school?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s121">Although, I wasn’t a particularly good student at it.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: And, the private lessons that you had at home, what were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: French, later on.</span> <span id="s124">Sometimes if I wasn’t doing too well in any subjects, somebody would come and we would work on the Latin and so on.</span> <span id="s125">Then I would go out for gym of one kind or another, tap dancing.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Tap dancing?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Tap dancing at the time of Shirley Temple, I guess, it was the rage.</span> <span id="s128">But that was outside.</span> <span id="s129">I mean, that wasn’t at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: Did you ever tap dance at home once you got back?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Mildly, yes.</span> <span id="s132">Yes, I was not particularly good at it.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Go ahead, I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Also, there were gym classes of other kinds.</span> <span id="s135">Now, this is kind of interesting.</span> <span id="s136">My brother went to the Maccabi, as most Jewish kids did, but I went first to the Sokol.</span> <span id="s137">The Sokol is a pan-Slavistic – pan-Slavic gym organization and also, I guess, pan-national, pan-Slavistic nationalistic organization, that had a lot of calisthenic-type things, and I went to that which took place – I can’t remember – in some – there was a thing, yes, they had a particular hall in town which was called a Sokolan (ph), and there were dances there as a matter of fact and so on.</span> <span id="s138">And, somewhere in the early ’30s, maybe ’32 and so on, they had – there were things like the Olympics but only Slavic.</span> <span id="s139">So, they would come and, I mean, I never traveled out of Zagreb for it, but I remember there was a very large gathering and people came from Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria and Poland and who knows what, and there was this march and we did calisthenics and we did, you know, like the Germans did and so on.</span> <span id="s140">There’s these horrendous things in stadiums and in fact there was a stadium built at the time for this particular get together.</span> <span id="s141">And then later when I was about 12, again, my brother and others in the family were in the Maccabi, I was a member of the HASK, which was the Crotian academic sports club, Hrvatski akademski sportski klub, which still exists.</span> <span id="s142">It was a big soccer club and gym, and I did – what was it?</span> <span id="s143">– track, I ran marathons and that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s144">It was short marathons, and trained with it, and stuff like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: So, was your family very Jewish identified in terms of the synagogue, or was this in terms of social groups more?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: My – they were obviously members of the synagogue.</span> <span id="s147">In fact, my mother had a plaque on, you know, a seat in the synagogue and so on, and they went for, I guess, Yom Kippur and the major holidays.</span> <span id="s148">We were required to go, both in public high school and so on, on Saturday to children services in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s149">And it counted – you had to have an excuse from the rabbi if you didn’t attend.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: So, this is nationally required.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: This was nationally required as the Serbs and as the – the Serb Orthodox – and the Catholic kids had to go to services.</span> <span id="s152">This was not all the time, but there was maybe a period of three, four years where this was really seriously required.</span> <span id="s153">And we had religious classes both in public high school and obviously in the Jewish school where I went – I went to four years to the elementary school, to the Jewish school, where we learned both biblical Hebrew and then later on modern Hebrew, and sang various things and so on.</span> <span id="s154">So, it was quite interesting as far as that’s concerned.</span> <span id="s155">And, once – and then, during that, as I said, during the major holidays, the parents went and we went to the synagogue, which was just around the corner from town.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Did you celebrate holidays at home as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: There was a Challah loaf.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: On Fridays?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: No, not on Fridays, on holidays.</span> <span id="s160">And for Passover we were usually farmed out to people who knew how to do this better, or well, anyhow – we went to that and then for Hannukah, there was a candles and -</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: What would you call the family?</span> <span id="s162">Certainly not orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: No…</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: But traditional or somewhat observant?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Traditional.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Traditional?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: There were some – I mean, yeah.</span> <span id="s168">I suppose so.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: It sounds like, from what you’re saying, that you didn’t experience anti-Semitism as you a kid growing up.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: That you were integrated in the community.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: Completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: And do you think this was true of the Jewish population in Zagreb and in Croatia in general?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s175">I think so.</span> <span id="s176">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: So, you think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s179">Pretty much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: It was very different from a lot of people’s experiences in eastern Europe and central Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Totally, totally.</span> <span id="s182">I’m not talking only about Zagreb, but for instance, my father in Slavonska Pozega, his father and the priest of the one leading church there, obviously Roman Catholic, used to play cards together daily, and so on.</span> <span id="s183">Totally.</span> <span id="s184">Not only that, but my aunt was – this was the one that was a few years younger than my father – was sent to Ljubljana to a Malud, I mean, there was a school with was run by nuns, a boarding school run by nuns, which is where she sort of went to finishing school at age 14.</span> <span id="s185">She hated it, but that’s where she went, finishing school I guess in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Did you see movies as a kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Yes, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: What did you like?</span> <span id="s189">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s191">Clark Gable movies.</span> <span id="s192">A lot of German movies, of course, until the time came when we didn’t go to any German movies.</span> <span id="s193">It happened – what was it that was this wonderful Clark Gable movie where they were on a train?</span> <span id="s194">I forget the name of it.</span> <span id="s195">“It Happened One Night”?</span> <span id="s196">Yes.</span> <span id="s197">That was one I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: It’s always odd when I hear people from Europe talking about American movies.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Yes, that was one of them.</span> <span id="s200">“Gone with the Wind”, I think.</span> <span id="s201">Any possible Shirley Temple movie that came around.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Were these subtitled?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: There was subtitles.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: But you understood?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Yeah, yeah, sure, but there were subtitles.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: And were you fluent in English?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Completely?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s210">The first governess was when I was seven, Mees Smees.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Mees Smees, yes.</span> <span id="s212">Culturally, what did you do?</span> <span id="s213">Did you go to concerts?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Did you go to museums?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: We went to concerts, which were quite frequent and good musical life there.</span> <span id="s217">They had – my grandmother had a loge in the opera in the national theater with her name on it.</span> <span id="s218">So, I had to go to whatever was appropriate for children, ballet and so on.</span> <span id="s219">There was very nice – there was student, afternoon student performances with the school at a very low price, and you stood in the back if you had to, and that was permitted.</span> <span id="s220">I was always very pleased to do that.</span> <span id="s221">My grandmother had a subscription to various concerts which took place.</span> <span id="s222">And the theater of all kinds.</span> <span id="s223">The older – the parents, the grandmother and grandfather – went to Vienna every season to get clothes because we couldn’t in Zagreb, to have them made, and to the opera especially.</span> <span id="s224">My grandmother on my father’s side remarried.</span> <span id="s225">She was a widow.</span> <span id="s226">She was married, and her husband was a Croatian Jew, but he was bank director in Vienna, and she was – she loved being a Croatian, a provincial lady, and she actually brought to Vienna a Croat room, a folk room, like a peasant room.</span> <span id="s227">She went so far as to bring the wood paneling, cut out the way that they do in Croatia– a peasant room with peasant furniture, peasant dolls, stuff like that, which was kind of amusing, but she lived there so then from the time I was maybe a year old or so.</span> <span id="s228">She died when I was five, but I remember going visiting there and obviously, my mother and her mother used to go every season to Vienna, once a year at least, probably twice.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: I’m going to ask you about going to England – but I want to ask you to sort of reflect those years.</span> <span id="s230">Do you have any fond memories of your childhood or is it ambivalent?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Ambivalent in many ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Can you explain that?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: Yes, I would’ve loved to have been – I did, I was permitted from time to time to ride the trolley to school, but mostly I walked because that was healthy, but if I had been sick and the weather was dreadful, I would be driven to school, but the car was never permitted to stop there.</span> <span id="s234">I would emerge behind the corner.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Was that so the people wouldn’t see that you had been driven?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: I didn’t want it, and it would have been show-off.</span> <span id="s237">It would’ve been immodest for a little girl to be driven.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: So, you, yourself remain ambivalent about the kind of privilege you lived in.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s240">It was – there were a number of well-off families, obviously, but it was uncomfortable because the schools were totally mixed.</span> <span id="s241">You had children who were poverty stricken, who got free milk both at the Jewish school and in high school, I mean, in secondary school, and it was embarrassing.</span> <span id="s242">It was embarrassing when the governess would pick me up.</span> <span id="s243">I didn’t like that.</span> <span id="s244">Although, oddly, I was with a friend two years ago, last year, two years ago in Zagreb who remembered how disgusted Pippsi was – Agnes Coyne, we called her Pippsi.</span> <span id="s245">She said, “No, she was wonderful.”</span> <span id="s246">I said, “How can you say that?</span> <span id="s247">She was a horrible woman.”</span> <span id="s248">“No, no, she was always very nice to me.”</span> <span id="s249">You know, it was – you’re right, it was unpleasant.</span> <span id="s250">And when you walked home, if you were picked up with friends, everybody, you know, reported back to one’s mother how you – whether you greeted them properly, whether you curtsied, we curtsied.</span> <span id="s251">Still, I curtsied when I came to the States to married women always.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: So, you were taught to curtsy to-</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: Older women, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Did it make it difficult for you to make friends because of your -</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: It didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: No, I had lots of friends, very good friends in all strata, absolutely all strata.</span> <span id="s260">They would come to me.</span> <span id="s261">I would come to them – not a problem and not as far as religion was concerned or anything else, no, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: We’re going to stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: Good.</span> <span id="s264">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: Let’s talk a little bit about your political consciousness before you leave for England.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: And you go to England in 1937.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Right.</span> <span id="s271">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Are you very politically conscious?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Yes, and I was fairly Croatian – well, first I was very Yugoslav.</span> <span id="s274">And then I become quite Croatian because they – mostly because, probably because the pressure from Belgrade was really quite bad.</span> <span id="s275">You felt it and everyday life.</span> <span id="s276">In fact, if you look at a certificate, school certificate from a public school in Zagreb, it was supposed to be in the two languages.</span> <span id="s277">So, you have it in Cyrillic, in Serbian, and you have it in Serbian with Latin script.</span> <span id="s278">It went that far.</span> <span id="s279">There was a lot of indoctrination, very intensely Yugoslav.</span> <span id="s280">I guess you just become – many of our friends were Croatian, peasant party people, who were mostly nice and decent and I don’t think – they may have been anti-Semitic, but certainly not overtly so.</span> <span id="s281">I don’t know, maybe some were.</span> <span id="s282">Some were, on the contrary, very less so.</span> <span id="s283">And both my father and my uncle who was a lawyer were very, very – had friends of all kinds.</span> <span id="s284">During King Alexander, and later on actually, even Prince Paul’s regime and the various Serbian – especially after the death of Alexander, there was a lot of repression, and one of the members of my extended family was a young man who was a communist.</span> <span id="s285">He was in the same jail as Mose Pijade, and he was killed in the war.</span> <span id="s286">There was a whole group of young Communist activists, leftists, all of them, of course, very idealistic, had no idea what it really meant, and who sat in jail.</span> <span id="s287">And my uncle, who was a lawyer, was the one who was taking packages and taking care of them, and so on.</span> <span id="s288">They were in very, very notorious political prisons.</span> <span id="s289">One of them is Lepoglava where they continued giving, you know, that was also later on in jail during the Ustashe regime and so on.</span> <span id="s290">So, there was a lot of that going on.</span> <span id="s291">I’m trying to think, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: If I can ask you a question.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: How would you characterize being very Yugoslavian Nationalist versus when you talk about becoming Croatian?</span> <span id="s295">How does one distinguish?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: Well…</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: How would you distinguish?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: For me, I think this happened when I was maybe I was eleven.</span> <span id="s299">I guess you suddenly became aware of that this was a repressive regime and that people’s friends were being – were being oppressed and also the peasants.</span> <span id="s300">At that time, Doctor Macek, who was sort of the leader of the Croatian peasant party and then later on became a member of the government, was in the opposition, and you lived in Croatia and not in Belgrade.</span> <span id="s301">You have – a lot of taxes and – not a lot, most, almost everything went to Belgrade.</span> <span id="s302">So, there it was [coughs], excuse me, there was a great deal of corruption of one kind or another.</span> <span id="s303">Money that was collected in taxes simply disappeared in Belgrade, and public works that were necessary in Croatia never took place.</span> <span id="s304">They were done in Belgrade.</span> <span id="s305">They weren’t even done in Serbia.</span> <span id="s306">They were stalled along the way.</span> <span id="s307">And, later on, there was a political – I keep wanting to say the Spanish word which is convenio, but actually they – the Croatian Peasant party was actually now a public party, and it was not anything that was repressed in such a way, and there was a coalition government formed with Doctor Macek.</span> <span id="s308">And I remember during this, during the election campaign when you’d drive out in the countryside, you know, the peasants would yell, “Zivio Doktor Macek!”</span> <span id="s309">You also yelled, “Zivio Doktor Macek!”</span> <span id="s310">, and so on - May he live long.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: And what does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Doctor – “May he live long,” I mean, “Hail,” or whatever you want to Doctor Macek.</span> <span id="s313">And this – the Croatian consciousness, which had been really very, very repressed – and maybe that was one reason why all those Ustashes were successful later on because, you know, of course, they via a Bulgarian assassin killed Alexander, and after that, there was a very repressive regime in Belgrade which repressed Croatia most of all.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s315">More than any of the other…provinces?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Much more, much more.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: And did you feel that?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: I didn’t feel it, no.</span> <span id="s319">I did not feel it, but I mean, it was talked about a lot in school.</span> <span id="s320">Like, for instance, “God forbid, Croatia is not the Balkans.</span> <span id="s321">The Balkans stop at the Sava River.”</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Yes, yes, that kind of stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: So, who was Croatia, from that point of view, if not the Balkans?</span> <span id="s325">Just Croatia?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: It was Croatia.</span> <span id="s327">And actually, geographically, it does stop there, and that’s how far the Turks went.</span> <span id="s328">I mean, this is where they were stopped before going, getting into Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: At the same time, Alexander’s assassinated in 1934.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: In 1933, Hitler’s over in Germany.</span> <span id="s332">Are you very conscious of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Yes, yes, completely conscious because I remember – I remember walking through a street, I must have been reading.</span> <span id="s334">Obviously, I was reading.</span> <span id="s335">There was a – I’ll regress a little bit.</span> <span id="s336">Somewhere in 1933 or ’34, my parents went to Chicago – whenever the World’s Fair was in Chicago.</span> <span id="s337">It may have been in ’34.</span> <span id="s338">Was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Somewhere there.</span> <span id="s341">Okay, I think it may have been ’33 or ’34.</span> <span id="s342">When I tell you the next date, you will remember.</span> <span id="s343">We were in Slovenia on vacation with Agnes Coyne, Pippsi, and a friend of my mother’s, and this was right on the Austrian border, and this was the year when Dolfuss was assassinated in Austria.</span> <span id="s344">He was the chancellor at the time.</span> <span id="s345">My parents got very scared, and phoned Zagreb and somebody came to see, to remove us from the border of Austria, and that’s when things started becoming – became obvious that things were going to be happening in Austria.</span> <span id="s346">And, I remember the election when Hitler was elected as chancellor because there was a demonstration in Zagreb, and I remember seeing a – there was a newspaper.</span> <span id="s347">I don’t think the paper was edited there, but there was a shop window where the headlines were posted, the front page of one of the papers was posted, and I remember seeing this.</span> <span id="s348">Then you started talking about anti-Semitism and so on, and that’s what I, how I remember this.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: You were 12 or 13?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: About that, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: Do you and your friends talk about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: Very much so.</span> <span id="s353">In the first place, we had, very soon after that, refugees coming in.</span> <span id="s354">Not under horrendous duress, but wanting to leave Austria, and we had very intimate friends there, which was a mixed marriage.</span> <span id="s355">The husband was Jewish.</span> <span id="s356">The mother was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s357">They wanted to leave.</span> <span id="s358">They came, they stayed with us, and they finally left for Argentina.</span> <span id="s359">One of the men who were working in my father’s factory.</span> <span id="s360">Actually, he was in charge of livestock.</span> <span id="s361">He was half German and half Argentine, and as you know, they had a big cattle industry in Argentina, and he was there for years on the farm.</span> <span id="s362">The farm was part of the factory, as I told you.</span> <span id="s363">This was all – molasses were there and the cows were eating part of it, and so, this man, who had both German and Argentine citizenship, managed to get these friends, whose name was Polla (sp), visas to go to Argentina, and they stayed with us in the meantime.</span> <span id="s364">And more and more Austrian Jews were coming, sitting in coffeehouses.</span> <span id="s365">That’s when there started to be some unpleasant remarks were made, “Do we need these German speaking foreigners sitting here?”</span> <span id="s366">Then it became, “German speaking Jews.”</span> <span id="s367">And obviously they were staying either in rooming houses or hotels or with friends, but they were – everybody was –it was a coffeehouse society.</span> <span id="s368">I mean, my mother went to coffeehouse, my father – not the same one mind you.</span> <span id="s369">The men played cards in one place, and the women had their bridge game someplace else or just went for coffee.</span> <span id="s370">So, it was a coffeehouse society like Vienna, and so on.</span> <span id="s371">You know, here they are talking German.</span> <span id="s372">At that point, nobody, none of the Croatian Jews spoke German.</span> <span id="s373">We were – except to them.</span> <span id="s374">I mean, it was, “Please don’t speak German.”</span> <span id="s375">And we didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: So, you, at that point, began to feel a certain kind of threat.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s378">Absolutely, from that time on, and it was getting more and more.</span> <span id="s379">There was talk of Dachau, for instance.</span> <span id="s380">There were no killing camps.</span> <span id="s381">There were no extermination camps.</span> <span id="s382">There were concentration camps and political camps and so on, and we knew of them.</span> <span id="s383">We knew that things were starting to happen, and at that point, obviously, we were – oh, and then for instance, we had a subscription to Neue Freie Presse, which then we didn’t want to have anymore.</span> <span id="s384">Then, instead of the German papers, the Austrian papers, my father got Swiss papers, and everybody was listening to the radio to see what was happening, and so on.</span> <span id="s385">That was very – that felt threatening already.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Do you see the beginnings of the Ustashe or is it- ?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: You don’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: At this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: No, not at all, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Do you have any personal experience with people starting to say something about you as a Jewish person?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: No, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Never?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: It’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Never, and I don’t think anybody else really.</span> <span id="s398">Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: But you decide you will not talk German.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Not only I, and there were a lot of people for whom it was hard because their education had been Austro-Hungarian, and there – and their literary language was not Croatian.</span> <span id="s401">Mine was.</span> <span id="s402">I spoke German, but I never -</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Was it true for non-Jews as well as Jews the decision not to speak German, or was it mainly the Jewish population?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: I think mainly the Jewish population, yeah, because the upper-middle class, non-Jewish, probably continued.</span> <span id="s405">These were remnants of old Austro-Hungarian bureaucracy, aristocracy and so on, and they spoke German.</span> <span id="s406">And there were certain parts of Croatia where German was spoken almost as an everyday language.</span> <span id="s407">It never was with me, but for instance, Osijek, my great-grandmother, spoke Croatian, and very well and correctly, but she was more comfortable in German.</span> <span id="s408">But that was the town of Osijek where there was a great – by the way, that was a very large Volksdeutsche population around there that had come in – Slavians that had come in, I don’t know, in the 17th century, 18th century, a whole batch of them who then became quislings of the worst sort.</span> <span id="s409">But, I mean, there were villages of nothing but German-speaking people in, mostly in Slavonia.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Did you spend any time with these Austrian Jews who were coming through?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: And, how would you characterize them because they’re obviously leaving earlier than the Einschluss because you were still…</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: What is that they think is going to happen, or what…?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: They are, I don’t know, they were not comfortable.</span> <span id="s418">There was one and possibly, now that I think of it, these were mostly mixed marriages.</span> <span id="s419">There was another very well-off industrialist by the name of Alfred Braun, who was married to a non-Jewish Austrian woman, who took off for Kenya, and he was a business friend of my father’s, and I remember them coming on business occasions previously, and then leaving for Kenya from Yugoslavia, as I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Do you remember young people your age, young teenagers?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: One of them was – with families only – and another thing that happened is we all used to wear dirndls, you know Austrian – not real dirndls because they were too expensive to wear – but, you know, the little aprons and dresses with little puff sleeves.</span> <span id="s422">Everybody stopped wearing that.</span> <span id="s423">My brother had lederhosen.</span> <span id="s424">That was – I still have a picture of him as a small child, and then all that disappeared.</span> <span id="s425">It was also worn in Slovenia, you know, on the border, but we all stopped wearing stuff like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Let me ask you something, does this stop because it’s – you’re feeling anti-German?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s428">Anti-Austrian at first, and then, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: So, you want no identification in this way?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: Were you, yourself, wondering what – would there be war, or would there be concentration camps, or would…?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: There would be…a threat.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Whatever that would be.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: You wouldn’t…</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: No, there would be a threat.</span> <span id="s437">And we, obviously – I mean, then later on things started to develop and Croatia was entirely surrounded by countries to which you couldn’t go in, either pro-Nazi or were actually overrun or whatever.</span> <span id="s438">So, it was sort of like a little island, especially when the Germans entered Greece, it was very threatening, but that’s much later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Now, in the Jewish groups…</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: The gymnastic groups…</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Is there a lot of talk among the Jewish kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: About what all this means?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s447">I think so, yes, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: You do remember that, yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: I remember.</span> <span id="s450">Certainly, I remember, and I had a conversation with – what I didn’t remember was brought back to me a couple of years ago, talking to the same friend of mine who said, “Ah!</span> <span id="s451">Your father was so smart and got you out in time.”</span> <span id="s452">I said, “You couldn’t get out.”</span> <span id="s453">People didn’t have the means.</span> <span id="s454">There were many reasons why you couldn’t get out, and I said – and she said, “I became aware of that when the first Austrian refugees knocked on our door.”</span> <span id="s455">I don’t remember anybody knocking on our door to come and stay, and she said “That’s when I started pushing my mother,” who, by the way, was married to a non-Jewish Slovene of German descent or Austrian descent and so on.</span> <span id="s456">Saved them in one way or another, in other ways not.</span> <span id="s457">So, of course, we talked about it, of course we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Did you remember other people knocking at your door?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: No, people who came, I mean, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: They knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: They knew.</span> <span id="s462">Now, for instance, another group that came was this – again, this is people from my father’s hometown, their name was Dierenbach, and they were from Pozega and two brothers who went and became bankers – one in Nuremburg, the other in Dresdner.</span> <span id="s463">They both work at the Dresdner Bank, both married to very, very German Jewish women.</span> <span id="s464">I mean, very German, intensely so, and they had – they didn’t have dual-nationality.</span> <span id="s465">They were already German, and the son must have been about 13 at the time.</span> <span id="s466">This family came back and settled and the boy started learning Croatian, and spoke it.</span> <span id="s467">The mother never learned Croatian.</span> <span id="s468">And so, they were part of our group.</span> <span id="s469">I mean, he became part of fairly close knit – my cousins, and this boy, especially because they were originally – the parents were originally from my father’s hometown.</span> <span id="s470">Yeah, they kept trickling in.</span> <span id="s471">There weren’t huge boatloads, not boatloads, trainloads of people coming in.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: So, why, in 1937, did you go to Oxford, or prepare to go to Oxford, in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: My father was always very anglophile and I wanted to go.</span> <span id="s476">I didn’t want to be in my school anymore, and later on my brother came.</span> <span id="s477">He went also to school there, but that was it.</span> <span id="s478">That was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: It had nothing to do with your father worrying that maybe he should get you out, at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: No.</span> <span id="s481">No.</span> <span id="s482">No, because I kept coming home.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: Back and forth?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Back and forth all the time, no.</span> <span id="s485">Obviously, we were in England.</span> <span id="s486">My family – I must have been on vacation or something and we went back – and a whole bunch of my family – my brother was still in Zagreb, but a whole bunch of the family was in London at the time of Munich.</span> <span id="s487">And we all went back, and I remember – I remember Chamberlain, and I remember the French being – the army was called up.</span> <span id="s488">What do you call it when an army is –mobilized.</span> <span id="s489">We went through Paris, because the train you used was the Orient Express.</span> <span id="s490">That was the one way of going.</span> <span id="s491">There wasn’t anything elite about it.</span> <span id="s492">It’s just – that’s the train.</span> <span id="s493">That was the line.</span> <span id="s494">And there was some members of a family who had moved from Zagreb to somewhere else whose sons were in England already in school, that’s right, at the university both of them, two boys.</span> <span id="s495">I suspect maybe there may have been a question in that case of mobilization of kids to the army, and these were boys of the age that they would have been mobilized in Yugoslavia, maybe that’s the reason why they went there, but this was also a family that had a Precepteur, a French male governess, and then an English male governess, and they spoke English and they went to school in England, both of them.</span> <span id="s496">They were Alfred and Erich Miller, their name was.</span> <span id="s497">And they were there, their parents were there, and two uncles of ours were there, and I guess they came to leave me in school.</span> <span id="s498">And in fact, I was at Oxford.</span> <span id="s499">I was already…</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: You were there already?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: I was there already, and they picked me up and we went back because my father – they hadn’t prepared anything.</span> <span id="s502">My brother was in Zagreb, going to school quite normally.</span> <span id="s503">And then we stayed until things sort of blew over, and I went back with my brother, I remember.</span> <span id="s504">I may have the – I may have the dates off a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: As far as I know, you went to Oxford in ’37.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: It must have been earlier, I think ’36.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: You think ’36?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: I think it must have been ’36.</span> <span id="s509">Somewhere I have a piece of – no, it may have been ’37 – I have a piece of paper somewhere where my father is asking permission from the Ministry of Finance to buy a certain number of foreign currency for my schooling and my brother’s schooling abroad.</span> <span id="s510">You had to have it, and you had to show you passed whatever exams were necessary to get the next year’s quota of money, of Pound Sterling to export, because you were not allowed to take any money out of Yugoslavia.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: So, do you think before Chamberlain and Munich, which is 1938, that you were already at Oxford?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Yes, I was already, yes, I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Why would you father want you back?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: The family should be together.</span> <span id="s515">That’s why.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Do you think your father, in 1938 or even before, was thinking about how to get the whole family out of Croatia?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: I think probably so.</span> <span id="s518">I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: But you were not talking about this with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: He didn’t say anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: So you go back for a few months-</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Before the attack on Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: That whole year, almost a whole year.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: So, you’re back almost a whole year.</span> <span id="s530">Do you see your family at this point, during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Yes, probably I went on you know, on leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: Do you see brother fairly regularly?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: At Oxford, all the time, every weekend I had to take him and a bunch of other boys for lunch because I was the oldest one, and they were entrusted to me.</span> <span id="s534">It was disgusting</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: You were not happy with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: It was horrible.</span> <span id="s539">They had dreadful uniforms with boaters, you know, with straw hats, horrendous uniforms, and they handed them over to me and I had to turn them back in.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: So, how close was St. Edward’s to-</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: Very close.</span> <span id="s542">It was at Oxford.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s544">So, the women did not wear anything, but the boys were wearing these -</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: This was high school.</span> <span id="s546">This was what they called public school.</span> <span id="s547">It was horrendous.</span> <span id="s548">I was very embarrassed.</span> <span id="s549">I was the one who was taking care of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Now, you returned to Zagreb in ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: And my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: And your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: And the Englishman that I was sort of engaged to.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Right, so this is the summer right before the attack on Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Yes, right, exactly, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: So, we’ll stop the tape now because we’re at the end of the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Let’s go back, before we get to, in Zagreb in 1939, describe the scene as you’re going through Paris after Munich.</span> <span id="s560">What does that look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: This was just, just, just exactly a day or two after Munich, total chaos with French men being mobilized, some in uniform, some in half a uniform.</span> <span id="s562">The trains were, including the Orient Express, complete – I mean that we – there was only standing room.</span> <span id="s563">People were sitting on, on suitcases, and completely and absolutely chaotic.</span> <span id="s564">And then when we came to Croatia, everything was quiet.</span> <span id="s565">I mean, to Yugoslavia.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: So, it must have been frightening to see that.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: It was extremely frightening.</span> <span id="s568">It was extremely frightening.</span> <span id="s569">In fact, we almost missed the train because my father was rushing out to get the latest Swiss papers to read it from a neutral point of view, and as he was going in, he pushed somebody and he something like, “Pardon,” or something – no, my father said, “Pardon”, and the guy said in French, “Fichez-moi la paix!”</span> <span id="s570">, and my father’s French wasn’t very good and he thought he was talking about peace, but what the guy was saying to him was, “Leave me alone.”</span> <span id="s571">Or something like that.</span> <span id="s572">And, my father said, “Oui, oui, j’espère bien,” or something like that.</span> <span id="s573">Then, we went on.</span> <span id="s574">I remember members of the family sitting on suitcases.</span> <span id="s575">That’s how-</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: How crowded it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: How crowded it was in corridors.</span> <span id="s578">I mean, my mother and I sat inside in a wagonlit (ph), but it was totally crazy, and I’m trying to think where it was that it sorted petered out, all of the craziness, because when we came to Zagreb it was fairly normal, the train, but it was, for two or three hours, it was this chaotic situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Now, when you go to Zagreb for this summer of 1939, and your fiancé Joseph Heaton -</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: - is with you?</span> <span id="s582">And you’re a young woman.</span> <span id="s583">You’re 18 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: When did you meet Joseph?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: At Oxford.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: At Oxford?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: He was a student there?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: He had just graduated.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Was he your first boyfriend?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s593">Not I mean really boyfriend.</span> <span id="s594">None of these were really serious boyfriends.</span> <span id="s595">This was a serious boyfriend.</span> <span id="s596">This was a serious, engaged boyfriend, so to speak, unofficially, I would say, but expected to.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: How long had you known him?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: Maybe six months or so.</span> <span id="s601">It was pretty fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: Were you in classes together?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s604">The schools were not together.</span> <span id="s605">No, he, he – I had just started, and he had just graduated with a useless degree in history.</span> <span id="s606">But, I mean this was an Eton-Christchurch type person, and it was just love.</span> <span id="s607">We fell in love.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: He was three or four years older than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: More than that, maybe even six.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: So, when –</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: No, I know what – he is – I know exactly when he was born.</span> <span id="s614">He was born in 1917.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: 1917?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: And, I was born in ’21, four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Not bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Not bad.</span> <span id="s619">At that time, no, at that time it was huge, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Had your parents met him?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: I was bringing him home, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Yes, and my brother was the chaperone.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: And your brother knew him from-?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: My brother knew him.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: Did they like each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: Yes, sure, sure, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: So, how was your parents’ response?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: My father was very positive.</span> <span id="s630">My mother was very negative.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s633">She didn’t – she wanted me probably to marry a Jewish boy from Zagreb who I could stay home with.</span> <span id="s634">This meant to her that I was going to take off and live God only knows where, possibly in the colonies.</span> <span id="s635">Who knows what?</span> <span id="s636">His father, this guy’s father had all sorts of interests.</span> <span id="s637">His older brother was what was then called on the Gold Coast.</span> <span id="s638">He had graduated, and they had some kind of interest in Africa.</span> <span id="s639">So, my mother had these visions of my living somewhere colonial, which really frightened her, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Now, he wasn’t Jewish, and that bothered your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: And that bothered your mother, then.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: I think it may have bothered my mother, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: But she didn’t say that to you directly?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: No, she intimated it.</span> <span id="s646">[laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: But her biggest fear was you go live in those crazy colonies?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Yes, yes, yes, in the colonies and for God’s sakes in England, where the climate was so horrible and the bathrooms were so cold.</span> <span id="s649">And that kind of stuff, and “Who’s going to bring up my child?”</span> <span id="s650">By that time in England, people were having a lot of household help, let’s put it that way, and also, on top of it, his parents were divorced, which was another horrible fault.</span> <span id="s651">And, yeah, like that.</span> <span id="s652">But, my father liked him very much from the word – well, my father was much more anglophile, although my mother spoke absolutely perfect English; my father did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Do you think that she liked him, but was worried about what he was going to bring you to, or do you think she really didn’t like him somehow?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: I’m trying to think.</span> <span id="s655">He was a different culture.</span> <span id="s656">He was… No, no, for instance, it bothered her – boys in Zagreb were, you know, very much coat and tie and so on, and he was a rowing blue.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: He was a what?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: He was a rowing blue.</span> <span id="s659">He was the one who did the Cambridge, Oxford/Cambridge rowing team.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s661">So, he was wearing sweaters?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: He was wearing, yes, sports clothes, which were very, let’s say, informal.</span> <span id="s663">It was different.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: And, that was attractive to you, wasn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: I think so, yes, yes, that and being – not being obvious as I was in Zagreb.</span> <span id="s666">He talks among other people who didn’t care who I was, that anonymity was very nice.</span> <span id="s667">Then I came back and the anonymity was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: It was gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: It was gone because I remember – oh, he did have – he was wearing a pair of white slacks and a white blazer, which is what these people wore, and I was walking down the street in Zagreb.</span> <span id="s670">And somebody saw him, of my older friends, actually a very well-known historian, a woman by the name of Fici Despot (ph).</span> <span id="s671">She was one who ended up by being a Croatian leading historian, and she saw us on the street, and somebody asked her, “Did you see Lucie with the guy, with the Englishman?”</span> <span id="s672">And she said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s673">And she said, “What did he look like?”</span> <span id="s674">And she said, “Like the ice cream man.”</span> <span id="s675">So, you know, it was like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Was he shocked when he came and saw how your-?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: No, he came from a very wealthy family.</span> <span id="s678">Although the family was divorced and his mother lived in the lake district, and so on.</span> <span id="s679">So, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: So, he was perfectly comfortable?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: So, you had a big social life during that summer?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: Yes, because two days after we were there, or maybe three days after we arrived, four other people that we knew from Oxford arrived – two young men.</span> <span id="s684">Two were journalists, and two were people that I just knew who had just graduated, who were – but not friends of Joe’s.</span> <span id="s685">They met there.</span> <span id="s686">He was very jealous, as a matter of fact, but I had made these arrangements previously, and they came and they were going to go do a tour of the Balkans or Europe or whatever afterwards, and they stayed with us.</span> <span id="s687">And then there was the invasion of Poland in September, and all of them immediately went to Zagreb to the British Consulate and immediately – immediately reported, and the other four took off right away, almost immediately, to go to England, and Joe stayed maybe another week and went back.</span> <span id="s688">That’s the last time I saw him.</span> <span id="s689">They put him on the train a week later.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Did you try to convince him not to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: Oh, no, no, I would have gone myself.</span> <span id="s692">We were all very gung-ho to go fight Hitler one way or another.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: That must have been very sad time for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: It was horrible.</span> <span id="s695">I remember it.</span> <span id="s696">It was on the railroad station, and of course at that time to embrace a man you weren’t married to or whatever, kiss him on the railroad station, my parents averted their heads and went off, and it was so on.</span> <span id="s697">Maybe I was here and they were 100 meters away.</span> <span id="s698">Underneath there’s way, there’s a whole new... I think my mother was relieved.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: You think she was relieved?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: She was relieved.</span> <span id="s701">She was very fond of this person who, whose photograph I had, who was more to her liking and also, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: But this was not typical to have people who were not married kissing and certainly kissing in public.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Oh, God, terrible</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: You learned really terrible things at Oxford.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Yes, yes, but then I was supposed to have been engaged to him officially, so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s707">So, what happens then?</span> <span id="s708">You’re – you were in Zagreb, you’re obviously not going back.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: I can’t go back.</span> <span id="s710">I can’t go back to the place.</span> <span id="s711">So, then I start taking – my brother, let’s put it that way, had lost a year.</span> <span id="s712">In order to get back to high school, he had to go to a private school to make up subjects such as National History, Croatian Language, Yugoslav Geography, which was a separate subject and so on, and he went to a private school which was horrendously terrible for him because only retarded kids went to private schools, but he went for a whole year before he could make up and then go to a regular high school after that.</span> <span id="s713">That was really traumatic because – yeah, I remember that very well.</span> <span id="s714">I did odds and ends.</span> <span id="s715">I took classes in History of Art.</span> <span id="s716">There was some sort of free university which was for people who did not – who were not inscribed, that you could go to classes.</span> <span id="s717">The British Council was running English classes and I sat in on them for laughs, really, because a friend of mine had gone there and did a course in proficiency in English which oddly, somewhere in ’47, I got the results of the exams.</span> <span id="s718">Could you believe it?</span> <span id="s719">Somebody found them at the British Council after the war through a relative of mine.</span> <span id="s720">I learned typing, so I would know something worthwhile and practical for the future.</span> <span id="s721">In fact, I brought an Olivetti with me on the trip to the United States.</span> <span id="s722">I went to these ridiculous balls that were – You were launched in Zagreb when you went to a certain dance.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: And launched, is it -?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: As a debutante.</span> <span id="s725">Until you were 18, you were a snotty-nose that nobody even considered as a person.</span> <span id="s726">You were a school child, a school girl, and so on, but after the Matura, after you graduated from high school, which I did not there, but I got to be 18 years old, you went to these various balls, and the ball was the, oddly enough, the journalist ball, and once you were at the journalist ball, I guess you were ready to get married maybe.</span> <span id="s727">Anyhow, then you were in society.</span> <span id="s728">Then you can – I mean, then you were no longer led by the hand, although supervised seriously, but you were launched.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Now, these launchings, this is a mixed launching?</span> <span id="s730">This is Jewish, Catholic-</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: Oh, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: Everybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: Completely.</span> <span id="s734">Completely absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: And, this was horrendous for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: For me, it was horrendous.</span> <span id="s737">It was, you know, first of all, wearing ridiculous clothes that I hated with high heels, which I still hate.</span> <span id="s738">You had to have these dresses made on the whole, because there was no ready-to-wear, which was standing in front of dressmakers’ mirrors being prodded hither and yon by mothers, by dressmakers, by couturiers, and so on.</span> <span id="s739">It was hard, but you went.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Did your mother like this?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s742">That was the duty, this was duty, but my mother – I was, and I still am, horribly nearsighted.</span> <span id="s743">To wear glasses, my God, I mean, you know – it was torn off of my face.</span> <span id="s744">So, a number of people as I walked on the street and I didn’t curtsey properly, it was reported to my mother, and I didn’t see the poor person who was reporting me.</span> <span id="s745">Pictures, photographs were taken of no glasses on, God forbid.</span> <span id="s746">It was awful.</span> <span id="s747">It was boring.</span> <span id="s748">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s749">I had to stand straight, and I slouch on the whole; I always did.</span> <span id="s750">And it was boring.</span> <span id="s751">It was horribly boring.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: So, this was going in evenings.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: This was going on in evenings.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: During the day-</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: Or in the evenings when this wasn’t happening-</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Are there people coming to your parents’ house?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Politicians coming and discussions about-</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: About what’s going on-</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: And are you able to-</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: At least observe, or can you participate?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: Oh, no, I’m there.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: You’re there?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: I’m there.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: Can you talk about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s772">One of the things that’s going on is you’re listening to Radio Paris.</span> <span id="s773">Paris Radio had a Yugoslav by the name of – I can’t remember, but I do have his name written down – he was – oh, Petrovic, Sveta Petrovic.</span> <span id="s774">He had one of these programs, like Voice of America had later on, where he was broadcasting to Yugoslavia and railing against the Germans, and then when France fell, he went on – not to Vichy – he ended up in the United States, but he followed the French government where he could – where he was broadcasting, and he ended up in the United States, and I ended up doing translations for the censors here for him, and when he was sick doing his broadcasts for the Royal Yugoslav government, which was very funny, you were listening to that.</span> <span id="s775">You were listening again on the radio to neutral radio stations, and there were family councils around the table, and friends.</span> <span id="s776">What’s going to happen now that Hitler’s about to get us all?</span> <span id="s777">But, you didn’t know where and how.</span> <span id="s778">This was – these were family councils going on among the members of the families – dining rooms or another.</span> <span id="s779">It was constant.</span> <span id="s780">And people who had lived in the provinces, like the parents of these cousins that were in London, moved to Zagreb to be handy to be able to leave if anybody was able to leave.</span> <span id="s781">The major problem was that there were currency restrictions.</span> <span id="s782">You couldn’t send any money out.</span> <span id="s783">The other problem was that my father was a reserve officer, a captain first class, and he would have had to have gotten permission from the army to leave.</span> <span id="s784">They were sending mobilizations going on.</span> <span id="s785">There wasn’t mobilizing, but there was a – there was a state of alert, let’s say.</span> <span id="s786">My father – not my father, anybody, this wasn’t anything exclusive – had to do every – I don’t remember when you, probably, at various intervals, but at that time, I think, every two years, you had to go and do some active duty as an officer.</span> <span id="s787">He was a reserve officer in the Yugoslav army, and every once in a while, they would pull you for three months or six months or whatever to re- I don’t know – to get them up, you know, to whatever was going to happen.</span> <span id="s788">To get them ready for necessary combat, and my father – this was probably in 1940 – was in Split for three months doing his military duty, and I had nothing to do.</span> <span id="s789">So, I came to stay with him in Split, and that was very exciting, very nice first of all, nobody was supervising me.</span> <span id="s790">I was living in a hotel, and I would see him in the evening for dinner with the rest of the officers, which was also fun, I must say.</span> <span id="s791">One of the officers, there, was the Imam of the Muslim soldiers because, you know, just behind the mountain is Bosnia, and there were number of recruits who were Muslim.</span> <span id="s792">And I remember on one occasion how aware they were of Hitler and anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s793">The Imam saying to my father, “Don’t you worry about anything, Fredo.</span> <span id="s794">If they come, I will say you’re Muslim.</span> <span id="s795">The main thing has been done already.”</span> <span id="s796">So, you know, this is – this is what – I think that’s sort of indicative of what the camaraderie was all among them.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: Can you explain that because the people who are watching aren’t going to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: Muslims and Jews are of circumcised.</span> <span id="s799">That’s what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: And, the only men in Europe that who were…</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s802">That’s right.</span> <span id="s803">Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: So, what were you doing during the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Reading, writing letters to Joe Heaton.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: So, you were still keeping up obviously this connection-</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: You’re hearing from him?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s810">Absolutely, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: Was he in Burma?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: No, he was first in England getting trained, and then he was in India for quite a long time.</span> <span id="s813">He was camped in Peshawar, places like that.</span> <span id="s814">That was the summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: That’s very exotic.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: Yes, very exotic.</span> <span id="s817">In India, New Delhi and then, you know, when the heat got horrendous they went to Northwest province, which was Kashmir, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: So, you’re not dating anyone else, right?</span> <span id="s819">At this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: Not, dating.</span> <span id="s821">I’m going out, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s822">I’m going out.</span> <span id="s823">Everybody knows.</span> <span id="s824">Everybody knows, but I do go to the darned balls and to coffeehouses and so on, but you know, mildly so.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: But, now, you were able to spend time with your father alone without all of this social-</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: Do you talk together about – is he telling you now that he’s trying to figure out a way to get you all out?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: Not at that particular moment, but yes, we talked, because this group was trained to withstand the Italian army, because, you know.</span> <span id="s829">Okay, so, obviously, I mean, we know what they’re getting to, you know, to face.</span> <span id="s830">We did talk about it, sure.</span> <span id="s831">Then, as I’m walking along in Split looking at shop windows or whatever, maybe palaces, maybe Diocletian’s Palace, something more cultural, my high school class turns up on their high school graduation trip, and I joined them, and that was a rather amusing thing because I have all of these dressy clothes.</span> <span id="s832">I was dressing in the evening in this hotel where they were staying.</span> <span id="s833">So, I packed all of that up, and I left it with my father who then sent it to Zagreb, and my father was on duty and a soldier was supposed to escort me to this third-class bus that my class was riding in to go to Dubrovnik, and I made a little suitcase of some kind or other, and this was like five o’clock in the morning, five-thirty in the morning, and suddenly there’s this knock on the door.</span> <span id="s834">And I said, “Who is it?”</span> <span id="s835">in Croatian, and the man says, “The army.”</span> <span id="s836">He was some kind of guy who was in – who my father had sent to pick me up.</span> <span id="s837">So, this was the army that was getting me out of bed, and left me there, and I joined this whole group, and then we finally got back to Zagreb on some horrible third-class train, sleeping on the floor, as ____ I was saying how they were doing in Dubrovnik on mattresses on the floor, and that’s what we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: So, now do you think your father was in Split in 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: So, then, you go back to Zagreb.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: We go back to Zagreb.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: Now, is there a sense in Zagreb now for you different from what it was the year before, two years before, as a Jewish person?</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: Yes, very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: And, what is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: And my father was very anxious for me to get out, and I know that I had papers.</span> <span id="s846">I know that I had to get a piece of paper that said that I was unmarried, which I had notarized.</span> <span id="s847">I know that I went to get a birth certificate, which I had translated and notarized – translated into English and officially notarized to send to England, to have with me.</span> <span id="s848">And, I actually think that I had a Greek visa, if I’m not mistaken, which – because Greece was not invaded yet, to go, I guess, via Iraq or something, Turkey, via Iraq to India, which, of course, never took place, but I do remember getting a Greek visa, and a letter from the Counsel General.</span> <span id="s849">Those Counsel Generals are very interesting things.</span> <span id="s850">There are a number of honorary Counsel Generals who were Jewish, and one was a Greek.</span> <span id="s851">The other was Portuguese, who also gave me a visa, and the other was Uruguayan.</span> <span id="s852">These were all Zagreb Jews, well off in CD cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: CD?</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: Corps diplomatique, CD on their cars.</span> <span id="s855">Diplomatic corp.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: When I asked you that it was different for you as a Jewish person-</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: In Zagreb-</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: Is that because you could feel a certain kind of anti-Semitism toward Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: I did not feel it.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: You didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: You just know?</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: You just know.</span> <span id="s866">You feel completely surrounded by – you feel actually jailed.</span> <span id="s867">I mean, where are you going to go?</span> <span id="s868">You have to get out.</span> <span id="s869">I mean-</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: So, it’s not that in Croatia-</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: It’s that Croatia is being surrounded -</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: Yes</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: And, you don’t know what’s going to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s876">Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s877">In Croatia, you already started feeling that you didn’t want to be there when it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: Is ___?</span> <span id="s879">Or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: Yes, because I think that there must have been – there must have been intimations already.</span> <span id="s881">I’m not aware of it, but I do know that there must have been some people who were quite happy with what was going on in Germany.</span> <span id="s882">I don’t know a personal one.</span> <span id="s883">I do know that I met, the day before I left in, let’s say, the Yugoslav portugates (ph), the German ____ on March 27th, and like on March 28th or 29th, I was on the main square and I ran into two friends of mine from high school, two guys, and I said, “Guys, we’re leaving.”</span> <span id="s884">Because, by that time, we already had our American visa and everything else, and one of them, who was a Communist, who later became director of the Zagreb theater, and the other one, who’s father became director of the University under the Ustashe, were standing there, these are my really close friends from school, and they said, “Now you are leaving, when we need you?!”</span> <span id="s885">I said, “You’ll have to do without me.”</span> <span id="s886">These people were activists, but they didn’t do anything, collaborated.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: Okay, we’ll stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">End of Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: Lucie, tell me a little bit more about your meeting these two guys.</span> <span id="s891">What – they thought that you would help them in terms of resisting what would happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: Exactly, exactly, they thought I would be very useful.</span> <span id="s893">They were both at that time very left-leaning, not party members, but they were left-leaning, and they obviously knew that things were going to happen now, and as I said, “Guys, we’re leaving,” they said, “Now?</span> <span id="s894">When we need you?”</span> <span id="s895">“Sorry, I’ve got to go.”</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: Why would they have thought you would have been an activist?</span> <span id="s897">Was that something that you gave inclinations of?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s899">I think they knew where my heart was, and they knew, I mean, obviously I wasn’t a Communist.</span> <span id="s900">One of them may have been a member of the party at one time, but he did – he served in the Croatian Ustashe army.</span> <span id="s901">The other one, the other one, whose father was a very famous grammarian, we used his grammar, nowadays I think it’s still probably used.</span> <span id="s902">His name was Ivsic, became director in the Zagreb University, so, I mean the University of Zagreb during Ustashe time, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: So, you wouldn’t call yourself left-leaning?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: Yes, yes, liberal, left-leaning, liberal left-leaning, okay, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: So, you said prior talking to about this incident with the boys, that your father was engaged in trying to get you out.</span> <span id="s906">So, there must have been different plans that he was working on.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: There were different plans.</span> <span id="s908">Well, I wanted to go and see Joe, but then everything – it got to be almost impossible as various frontiers were closing around us constantly.</span> <span id="s909">I mean, you couldn’t go through this, you couldn’t go through that.</span> <span id="s910">Then, of course, the fact that he could not have, I mean, my father could not have left the country without getting permission from the army.</span> <span id="s911">I mean, he was – they would activate you immediately, and he would have had to get a permit from the army, plus you had to get a permit all together to leave the country, I mean, which was a great big do.</span> <span id="s912">People couldn’t just say, “Well, tomorrow, I’m going to go to Vienna,” or something.</span> <span id="s913">You had to get a slew of documents, and permits, and who knows what, not to mention absolutely no money whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: You were not allowed to take money.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: You could not take any money out whatsoever, so what if not that?</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: Nothing, not that.</span> <span id="s918">Very little, I think it’s probably mentioned in the passports how much.</span> <span id="s919">I’m not quite sure, but very little.</span> <span id="s920">So, the money, at one time, probably in 1941 probably, ’40, ’41, my father pro forma sold the big factory where, you know, also where the country house was to some business friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: And that’s Ljubljana or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: No, no, no, this is the place is called – it’s near Zagreb and the village or where the factory was is called Savski Marof, and that country house was called Janusevac, and he sold it to some friends in Ljubljana, some business friends in Ljubljana.</span> <span id="s923">In fact, I was just recently going through some papers, I saw some stuff about that.</span> <span id="s924">And through somebody, I don’t know how, he got some money to England, to Switzerland, and a little bit to the United States.</span> <span id="s925">I don’t know how.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: Now, you’re saying he sold the factory pro forma, what does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: That means that he-</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: It appears to mean it’s not a real sale.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: It was a sale with a thing, you know, “When things calm down, I’ll have it back.”</span> <span id="s930">But he did get the money for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: He did?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: Yes, he got a serious amount of money, but oddly enough, he had taken a loan on my mother’s house which was very valuable, not so much as, you know, a historical house, but it was in the center of the center of town, and the land was very valuable, and he got a loan from the – he took a mortgage, that’s what it is, a mortgage from the Zagreb Bank, the city bank, and was getting ready to send up money somehow underground to the States or to Switzerland or whatever, probably to Switzerland, but my mother said, “Listen, the president – I saw the president of the bank on the street, and he really didn’t greet me with as much”, I hate to say deference, but that was the meaning, “as usual.</span> <span id="s933">Would you return that loan?”</span> <span id="s934">Which he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: So, you knew that when you were – and you knew this at the time – that when you were leaving that there would be money in various places?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: Yes, but very little.</span> <span id="s937">I thought it was very little, and it was very little, but it was enough to sort of survive.</span> <span id="s938">There was some in Switzerland; that I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: You didn’t really – no, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: Why and how it was done, I really don’t know, but there was enough to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Now how did you, I mean, did you pack?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: How did you do all this?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: Yes, the last month – okay, so we got this American visa which -</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: You wouldn’t have survived – let’s describe about that and then -</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s947">The Counsel General of the United States – the consulate was the house next to ours in, I mean the office of the consulate, next to ours in Zagreb, the house.</span> <span id="s948">My father was a hunter.</span> <span id="s949">He took the Counsel General hunting – it wasn’t even the Counsel General, it was a Counsel, Mr. Miley, an American, nice middle-class person.</span> <span id="s950">My father took him hunting.</span> <span id="s951">He, I don’t know, he saw in the back of our stable a – a suit of armor that was, you know, put away, nobody was bothering with.</span> <span id="s952">He went crazy with the suit of armor.</span> <span id="s953">My father gave him the suit of armor, which was cluttering things up, and I don’t know how authentic or – it was a suit of armor that probably was authentic, and he was very happy to give us a visa.</span> <span id="s954">Now, one reason why this was going on was there were – as nobody could leave Yugoslavia – quotas – you know, the visas were given by country quotas at the time – were not being used in Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s955">So, you had masses of quotas lying fallow in consulates, and it is very easy to get an immigration visa.</span> <span id="s956">And when my father asked for the visa, and the man in the Counsel said, “Why don’t you take an immigration visa?”</span> <span id="s957">And, my father said, “What would I need an immigration visa for?</span> <span id="s958">I’m going to return, obviously.”</span> <span id="s959">And, he said, “Okay, you’ll return, but take this immigration visa.</span> <span id="s960">You never know when it might be handy.”</span> <span id="s961">And we got an immigration visa and that’s how it worked.</span> <span id="s962">Oh, and at one time, I guess, he did him a favor because he bought his Buick.</span> <span id="s963">He got a new Buick at the Counsel, and we got his Buick.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: His old one?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: His old one.</span> <span id="s966">It wasn’t all that old, but it was certainly not for Yugoslavia, and he – this Buick was very significant, by the way, and he – so, you know, it was a friendship.</span> <span id="s967">It was a – for maybe a year and a half, two years, they were – they went -</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: It wasn’t something very recent?</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: No, no, no, it was a long-term thing that was going on at that time, and he – yes, okay, we had that, but before that I was thinking we might be going, and that we didn’t get the visa, but they talked about the visa probably a month before that.</span> <span id="s970">So, in town, in Zagreb, there were five or six trunks, you know, like – steamers, huge steamer trucks.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: In the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: In the house, all the servants were there including the nanny, the present nanny, everybody was there.</span> <span id="s973">The dogs were there.</span> <span id="s974">There were three dogs running around in town, not out in the country, and by the way, all the furniture and so on from the country house was in the basement of the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Of the house in Zagreb?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: In our house in Zagreb, yeah, that was taken out.</span> <span id="s977">When he sold the factory pro forma, he took – an uncle of my mother’s stayed in Janusevac, and was going to be running the factory.</span> <span id="s978">They didn’t do him in, but he stayed there.</span> <span id="s979">So, his furniture was there, but our furniture from the bedroom and stuff like that, that was in the basement, taken by the Germans, by the way.</span> <span id="s980">Okay.</span> <span id="s981">And we were putting into these steamer trunks embroidered bed linen and tablecloths and stuff of that kind, could you imagine why we needed that, and clothing, four-station clothing.</span> <span id="s982">This was – I mean, four-season, four-season clothing, all sorts of junk like that.</span> <span id="s983">And then there were suitcases around, and this was all open standing, being filled, so that when the Germans came, they had all packed together, they just took it out.</span> <span id="s984">It’s amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: So, what did you all think?</span> <span id="s986">That this would be shipped out somehow?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: Yes, this would be shipped out.</span> <span id="s988">I mean, this is how this was going on with people who left three weeks earlier.</span> <span id="s989">There were people who left earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: So, what happened -?</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: Was you were within days of the invasion?</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: Yes, yes, yes, we were days within the invasion.</span> <span id="s994">So, this must have been, let’s say, a week before the 27th of March.</span> <span id="s995">That’s about it, but when this happened, and when Yugoslavia – they went in Belgrade, the populous starting spitting on the German flag.</span> <span id="s996">They took the car of the German ambassador and knocked it over, and then I think they put it on fire, and they were yelling all sorts of slogans: “Better dead than a slave” and that kind of stuff, and in Zagreb there was jubilation.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: Because of this tri-part agreement with, with German.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: March 25th?</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: That’s – yes, it was March 25th, and on the 27th was the putsch, yes, they abrogated – the people abrogated, and on the 28th, we got into our car.</span> <span id="s1001">We left everything there.</span> <span id="s1002">We packed suitcases.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: So, you had some little suitcases?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: We had – they weren’t that little.</span> <span id="s1005">There must have been quite a few because when I think about what I dragged over like typewriters and riding boots, necessary things of that kind, and urban coats.</span> <span id="s1006">[laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: Urban coats?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: An urban coat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: So, it was good it was a Buick with a big trunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: Yeah, and they were quite – yes, yes, I don’t know big of a trunk.</span> <span id="s1011">It was a very large car.</span> <span id="s1012">It was very large.</span> <span id="s1013">My parents – so, then, we had the American visa, but my father didn’t have the permission from the army to leave yet, nor did he have an exit visa for Yugoslavia, an exit permit from Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s1014">There’s a piece in the passport, there’s a Cyrillic thing that says “Official Visa”, and he – and he had to have written in that he was a delegate on the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, otherwise he couldn’t have gotten out, but particularly not the army, because he would have been activated almost immediately.</span> <span id="s1015">So, we got into our car – my parents, my brother, I, my uncle – my father’s brother, who was a lawyer, Felix, and our driver who grew up in my father’s family.</span> <span id="s1016">His name was Josip Levac, who was part Volksdeutsche, but that was – he was never anti-Semitic or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1017">His father was a cooper.</span> <span id="s1018">He made barrels for my grandfather’s factory, and this man was schooled by – my father had him schooled and he went with us to Belgrade.</span> <span id="s1019">We went through my father’s hometown, which was Slavonska Pozega, which was where this man was from also, and my father had to report to the barracks.</span> <span id="s1020">As we drove into the town, we were stopped by the army, by some recruits, and one stuck the gun into the car, not with the bayonet, but just the muzzle of the gun, and he said, “Legitimacija”.</span> <span id="s1021">We gave him whatever, IDs and so on.</span> <span id="s1022">So, I gave him my ID.</span> <span id="s1023">My father showed his army ID, said he was going to the headquarters there, I don’t know about the headquarters, but anyhow to the barracks because this is where he would have had to report to, and when he saw the paper, he called out, “Anybody more literate around here?”</span> <span id="s1024">I’m sure he was illiterate, and couldn’t read it.</span> <span id="s1025">Okay, so, somebody more literate came and he said, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s1026">So, we waited for my father in the car while he went to the barracks.</span> <span id="s1027">I don’t know whether my uncle went along or not.</span> <span id="s1028">I don’t think so, and Sepa, I think went to, the chauffer, went to talk to somebody in his family was left over there, and then we proceeded to Belgrade.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: Excuse me, was there any doubt that your father would get permission?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: If they had felt that they wanted to be unpleasant, maybe he would have bribed somebody.</span> <span id="s1031">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1032">I don’t know, but if they had wanted to be unpleasant, if he hadn’t had – he probably had some other paper there that he showed them, that he was going to Belgrade to do something with – I can’t imagine it any other way.</span> <span id="s1033">He must have been, because it was very recently, he had just very recently done this, you know, training in Split not so long ago.</span> <span id="s1034">And, you know, he probably would’ve survived because all the prisoners of war survived, almost all, and just as aside, a friend of ours who was a Serbian officer, by the way, who’s father was a general, his wife’s father was general, and so on, was a prisoner of war in Germany, and he told me that the Jewish prisoners of war and the Serbs and everybody were together and that one time, the Germans wanted to separate the Jewish prisoners of war from the others, and these people went on strike and called the Red Cross and who knows what, and they left them together.</span> <span id="s1035">And almost all of them survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: What is the atmosphere in the car?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: Horrendous, awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: Are you really frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: Frightened, because you could see things were about to start.</span> <span id="s1040">We were listening to the radio.</span> <span id="s1041">There were mobilizations.</span> <span id="s1042">There was army all over, you know, you could see army left and right as you went -</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: So, you were sure that the Germans -</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: Oh, absolutely, absolutely, there was no doubt in our mind that something would happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: Your one fear was that you wouldn’t get out soon enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: Absolutely, that was the fear.</span> <span id="s1047">Plus we had no visa to any country where we could have gone through.</span> <span id="s1048">We had-</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: You just had the visa-</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: We had the – no, we had the immigration visa – no!</span> <span id="s1051">We got – oh, yeah, we had the immigration visa.</span> <span id="s1052">That was it.</span> <span id="s1053">That was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: But, you had no way to traverse -</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: We had no other, no way to traverse.</span> <span id="s1056">I think, if I look in the passport, that all of this was obtained in Belgrade, the various consulate and embassies and so on.</span> <span id="s1057">So, when we came to Belgrade, first of all, we had the permission from the army, then they wrote in this delegation thing that he was going as a delegate of the Ministry.</span> <span id="s1058">Otherwise would have not been able to get there.</span> <span id="s1059">And we all got these official visas, because you didn’t just get a visa.</span> <span id="s1060">You got an official visa.</span> <span id="s1061">I know that my uncle – my uncle, I think had an affair with the prime minister’s – the prime minister’s wife.</span> <span id="s1062">He was all over the place.</span> <span id="s1063">He was a very, a popular guy, and had generally all sorts of connections.</span> <span id="s1064">He was divorced first.</span> <span id="s1065">He was a likeable, nice guy who had connections, and I think he helped somehow hasten things.</span> <span id="s1066">We spent one horrendous night.</span> <span id="s1067">There were two other members of the family, one or two – my aunt’s husband was also a lawyer who was a businessman, who was there in Belgrade and I don’t know why, and somebody else.</span> <span id="s1068">And at the very last minute, we found that there was an industrial or some kind of fair, either industrial fair or an agricultural fair or something like that in Budapest, and they were giving visas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: To be able to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: To be able to go, and this was the only – this was the only – the only place, the only border you could cross.</span> <span id="s1071">You couldn’t go anywhere else.</span> <span id="s1072">The Germans were in Greece already, couldn’t go through Bulgaria, couldn’t go through Italy, couldn’t go through Austria via Slovenia.</span> <span id="s1073">This was the only way to go, and this was some kind of probably excursion visa, I’m not quite sure, but they were giving these visas because there was this fair.</span> <span id="s1074">We spent the night in Belgrade, and the next morning – naturally Yugoslavia was completed mobilized by that time – and decided that the chauffer would help us with the cars and go with us to the Hungarian border, and then be able to report back to the family whether we crossed or not.</span> <span id="s1075">And in the train, my father wrote out an affidavit or something and said to the chauffer, who clearly was a member of the family, “You will need to take care of your family.</span> <span id="s1076">Use this car as a taxi or whatever you want.”</span> <span id="s1077">And he gave him all the papers, and the piece of paper and the letter in which he said that he should take this car, which he did.</span> <span id="s1078">[laughs] And the very first week, Artukovic, the Croatian minister of the interior became, I mean, he became his driver.</span> <span id="s1079">The car was requisitioned and he became his driver, and stayed with him until the very last, and didn’t tell him that he was fleeing, and this poor guy was caught by the British, and Artukovic took off to Argentina and finally ended up here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: So, he -</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: He gets us-</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: To the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: To the – no, he gets us to the train, and he goes with us to the border, to the Hungarian border on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: To say that the family-</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: That we crossed, yes.</span> <span id="s1086">At that time, there were German soldiers in the train – officers and soldiers in the train already going towards Belgrade.</span> <span id="s1087">There were troop trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: You mean in the train station, not in your train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: No, no, in the train station in Belgrade, this was total chaos, and there were recruits with peasants with their wives sitting on packages.</span> <span id="s1090">I mean, you could hardly make a step.</span> <span id="s1091">It was total complete chaos.</span> <span id="s1092">This was the mobilized peasantry that was going to be fighting the Germans, all over the Belgrade station.</span> <span id="s1093">No, he went – he left us on the Hungarian border, when the train, just before the train crossed to Hungary.</span> <span id="s1094">Now, there were German officers on the train already going – I don’t know where they were going – but there were German officers in jackets and everything going up and down in the train, but the war had not been declared yet, and troop trains going in the other direction towards Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s1095">And we arrived in Budapest, got into a nice hotel, and phoned Belgrade and told them, “We’re here.”</span> <span id="s1096">Meanwhile, tried to find out where other members of the family were, the ones who were in Zagreb.</span> <span id="s1097">Some were getting ready to go to Dubrovnik, which they knew was going to be, if anything happened, it would be Italian, but they were not there yet.</span> <span id="s1098">Other members of the family stayed in Belgrade, and we talked to them when we got to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1099">That night, maybe six hours later, they were bombed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: But, they wouldn’t listen to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1102">They thought that we were-</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: They thought you were crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: They thought we were – we called them from Budapest and we said, “Listen, this is what we saw.”</span> <span id="s1105">And they said, “You’re so in panic among us.</span> <span id="s1106">Leave us alone.”</span> <span id="s1107">And so on, and the same thing they said when we called them from Switzerland at midnight, and they were bombed six hours later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: When you got to Budapest, you did not have papers for the next stage?</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: I think we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: You had?</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: I think – I can look in the passport because I’m thinking there are some – we went and we stayed two nights.</span> <span id="s1112">We went to Vienna overnight, and those were not so hard to get.</span> <span id="s1113">There were transit visas to, I think that they, I don’t know whether they still called it Austria, probably Germany.</span> <span id="s1114">It was Germany already, and we came in the middle of the night, and we got to some kind of dreadful hotel near the railroad station.</span> <span id="s1115">I know that they stole a suitcase of my brother’s, and immediately at dawn, we got on the train to Switzerland, but did not make it to cross.</span> <span id="s1116">We had to spend a night in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: And your father was interrogated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: And my father was interrogated for hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: And this is at an inn that you’re staying in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: This is at an inn in Austria, right on the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: And were there Germans in that Inn?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: There were Germans, German troops, and German officers in that inn, and they were singing one of those lovely war songs about Prince Eugene, that’s a boy, I guess, going to Belgrade conquering Belgrade.</span> <span id="s1123">It’s a march song.</span> <span id="s1124">It’s a march that we all knew, and it’s part of – I’m trying to think in which one of the classic – it’s part of a classic composition this is taken from.</span> <span id="s1125">It’s like a march.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: Was your father brutalized?</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s1128">He was questioned for a long time, very thoroughly, and as his German was very good, I guess that was part of the thing.</span> <span id="s1129">He said, “We are immigrating to the United States, please.</span> <span id="s1130">Here’s my immigration visa.”</span> <span id="s1131">The war wasn’t on yet, but I was a very thorough in- And my brother and my mother and I were sitting in this inn absolutely quaking with fear.</span> <span id="s1132">It went on for hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: And he was in the inn?</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: Somewhere in the inn.</span> <span id="s1135">They took him in the room, a bunch of German officers who came and knocked on the door when, you know, in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s1136">The way it was, my mother and I slept in one room.</span> <span id="s1137">He and my brother slept in the other.</span> <span id="s1138">So, he came to tell us, and then my brother joined us in this room and we waited there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: Okay, let’s change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">End of Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: So, was your father – we were talking about your father’s interrogation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: Was he interrogated all night?</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: No, but some three hours at least.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: So, it must have been just horrible for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: It was horrendous.</span> <span id="s1148">We were terrified, and by that time, we had see these troops going.</span> <span id="s1149">By the way, Vienna, when we got there, was blacked out, and the windows were blacked out in the hotel, and so on.</span> <span id="s1150">There was no light whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1151">I don’t know how we – it must have been fairly close, this hotel, to the station because I have a feeling we walked there in the dark.</span> <span id="s1152">We came at night and we left at dawn, and I remember just darkness, and then – a blackout, a plain blackout.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: Where was your Uncle Felix?</span> <span id="s1154">Did he stay in Belgrade?</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: At that time, he was in Belgrade, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: So, he didn’t go with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: No, no, no, he just – he was in Belgrade, and he stayed in Belgrade.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: And having this…relationship…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: Yeah, probably just visiting around.</span> <span id="s1160">I recently found – two days ago, three days ago – an incredible letter written by the person who was the Uruguayan Consul General who was a friend of his and he tells of this story of how he and a couple of others were fleeing, and my Uncle Felix was already in Italian territory going back because of some love interest or something like that, to Zagreb, and how they were jailed and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: Did Felix survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: Yes, he survived.</span> <span id="s1163">He went – he went – he remarried.</span> <span id="s1164">He went – why he came to the United States via Cuba, but first on some kind of Ellis Island, Cuban Ellis Island where he spent, it was several months before they would let them out, but he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: Before we get to Geneva, where you stayed for about a month-</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: I’m going to ask what’s going to sound like a funny – what happened to the dogs?</span> <span id="s1168">You had three dogs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: I have absolutely no idea.</span> <span id="s1170">Everybody, the whole staff was in the house.</span> <span id="s1171">There was a cook.</span> <span id="s1172">There was a – two maids, the nanny.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: They were all in the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: They were all in the apartment in Zagreb.</span> <span id="s1175">They weren’t even, you know -</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: So, you assume they took care of the dogs.</span> <span id="s1177">Maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: I hope so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: You hope so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: Yeah, maybe it was Sepa, maybe the chauffer did.</span> <span id="s1181">No, I hadn’t heard anything.</span> <span id="s1182">I had no idea what happened.</span> <span id="s1183">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s1184">There were two Dachshunds and an English Setter I brought in the apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: I was a little concerned because -</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: Oh, I was very concerned.</span> <span id="s1187">I was very concerned.</span> <span id="s1188">Somebody must have taken them in.</span> <span id="s1189">I mean there were other people there who might have taken them.</span> <span id="s1190">Somebody who was a hunter would have taken them.</span> <span id="s1191">He was a very bad hunting dog, but he looked as if he could do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: Was it easy to get into Switzerland?</span> <span id="s1193">There was no problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: There was a lot of frisking and stuff like that, quite serious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: Yes, and probably interrogation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: Probably interrogation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A: Interrogation also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: But you didn’t experience this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: It would’ve been your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: My father and probably my mother.</span> <span id="s1203">I think they – I think they searched her in various manners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: Did they search you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: Amazingly no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: Because you’re not a kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: I’m not a kid.</span> <span id="s1210">Nobody touched me, but my mother was searched, both in Spain-</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q: And in Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: And how about Mario?</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: But, he’s-</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: My mother was very embarrassed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: Oh I imagine.</span> <span id="s1218">Do you begin in Switzerland, once you get through this interrogation-</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: And you stay for a month in Geneva-</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: Are you feeling a little bit more secure?</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: Yes, yes, but not completely because, I mean, no.</span> <span id="s1224">Our visa – our permit to be in Switzerland would’ve run out after a month.</span> <span id="s1225">We would’ve had to leave.</span> <span id="s1226">Maybe it would have been possible to prolong it somehow, but I don’t remember how long our permit was in Switzerland, but I – no, it was important to get going.</span> <span id="s1227">Plus, the other visas would’ve run out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: So, you didn’t – you were in Geneva because your father was trying to get the next set of papers, or…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: We were in Geneva.</span> <span id="s1230">Well, first of all, we had to get a French visa.</span> <span id="s1231">We had to go through occupied France which was in a car, which was locked, sealed.</span> <span id="s1232">It was a sealed car.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: A sealed train car?</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: A sealed train car, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: By the way, what was it like in Geneva for that month?</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: We were in a very nice hotel.</span> <span id="s1237">We were in the Hotel d’Angleterre which was lovely, but it was very tense.</span> <span id="s1238">It was extremely tense.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: So, here your father had some money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: Yes, and there were some people who we knew in Switzerland who had left earlier, who were in the lumber business, and I don’t know what kind of nationality they had, possibly they had some other nationality, not Yugoslav.</span> <span id="s1241">They were there.</span> <span id="s1242">My mother’s cousin who was this Baroness de Vateville, who was in – who lived in Lucerne at the time, my mother called her and she came to Geneva in a women’s Swiss Auxiliary uniform speaking Switzer Dietch.</span> <span id="s1243">It was very funny to hear, but was very helpful.</span> <span id="s1244">She came and offered to help in any way.</span> <span id="s1245">I don’t know what kind of help it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: Phone calls?</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: I forgot, naturally.</span> <span id="s1248">The night that we arrive and called Belgrade at midnight of April 5th or 6th and speak to the family, and they say everything is quiet, we shouldn’t be crazy.</span> <span id="s1249">Six hours after that they were bombed.</span> <span id="s1250">This was the first time that I saw my father cry.</span> <span id="s1251">When the whole army, everything, collapsed right away.</span> <span id="s1252">There was no more Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s1253">I mean, this was such a Blitzkrieg there that this all went to pieces and was really in bad shape.</span> <span id="s1254">I was very happy I was going to go to wherever – India, or – I didn’t want to have anything to do with that anymore.</span> <span id="s1255">I wanted out.</span> <span id="s1256">My mother was very sad, but I don’t think she cried, but my father actually cried, and then the next thing he did, he went to Bern to talk to the representative of Yugoslavia, and nobody knew what to do.</span> <span id="s1257">I mean, it was completely unclear what, you know, what was going to happen to Croatia.</span> <span id="s1258">Not Croatia, I mean, what was going to happen, one way or another.</span> <span id="s1259">It was still Yugoslavia, completely falling apart, and there was very little news except the bombing Belgrade, nothing else.</span> <span id="s1260">And, then later on, we found out, when we went on, we saw what was happening.</span> <span id="s1261">When an independent Croatia was declared, but that was later.</span> <span id="s1262">We went on this sealed train, came to Spain, and at first – this was very shortly after the Spanish Civil War – we stayed in a very nice hotel, but it was very obvious that this was very obvious that this was a country that had gone through a war, and it was completely obvious.</span> <span id="s1263">Crazy thing, here we want to go to the Prado, first time we were in Spain, but the Prado is closed.</span> <span id="s1264">So, we go sit in a café to have breakfast and there’s some rolls, but it’s obvious that there was a war.</span> <span id="s1265">I mean, it looked shabby, and then children without limbs started coming to the window of this café and we’re sitting there having food and asking for food.</span> <span id="s1266">This was the first time I had seen a country – I mean, this was a very short time after the civil war in Spain, and these children – this was the saddest thing about war – without an arm or without a leg, just holding their hands up, and emaciated, and so we took all the food and gave it to them and walked away.</span> <span id="s1267">You couldn’t sit and eat because of what was going on.</span> <span id="s1268">We sat pretty much, and walked around a little bit through Madrid, but it was very sad, and it was very empty, and it was very obvious that they had gone through a war.</span> <span id="s1269">Then we went to Barcelona and spent a couple of nights in Barcelona and we got on this horrendous bus that got us to Lisbon, and there, I think, we became very much aware of things are falling out because we didn’t go to a very fancy hotel.</span> <span id="s1270">We went to some kind of pension.</span> <span id="s1271">It was very nice, but it wasn’t a palace hotel in any place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">Q: Now, are you at all feeling a certain kind of ambivalence?</span> <span id="s1273">On one hand, happy getting out-</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: And on the other hand, a certain kind of sadness?</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: Totally, totally, and also you had this feeling in Lisbon, Portugal that this is the spy capital of the world.</span> <span id="s1277">It was very – it was eerie.</span> <span id="s1278">You didn’t know who you could talk to.</span> <span id="s1279">People would approach you and say, “I’m going to get you a prolongation of your visa.</span> <span id="s1280">Are you interested?</span> <span id="s1281">You’re going to get a ticket on such-and-such a ship to go hither and yon.”</span> <span id="s1282">It was bad.</span> <span id="s1283">And we walked around, but it was a beautiful town we had never been to.</span> <span id="s1284">In Lisbon, we walked around.</span> <span id="s1285">I have pictures of all dressed up in suits and hats and the works.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: So, you have all your luggage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A: All the luggage, all of that is standing around, yeah.</span> <span id="s1288">We’re wearing spring suits.</span> <span id="s1289">I think there’s even a picture of my mother with a fur boa or something like that, a dead fox on her.</span> <span id="s1290">I think so.</span> <span id="s1291">I’m almost certain.</span> <span id="s1292">And my brother and I walking there.</span> <span id="s1293">There were really some quite unsavory characters that would come and ask him, and they’d be helpful in the hotels and everything.</span> <span id="s1294">But we then started doing some traveling around, and you know, and first of all, we had – okay, the United States maritime union was having a strike.</span> <span id="s1295">So, United States’ ships were not going anywhere, and we had reservations on some sort of ship, but ___ American export.</span> <span id="s1296">Nothing was else was going on in the rest of the country, I mean, the rest of Europe except for Portugal was at war.</span> <span id="s1297">So, there were no neutral things except Portugal and, I guess, the United States that had ships going back and forth to the States.</span> <span id="s1298">So, there was this maritime strike, and we had to stay longer, and there was danger of, again, our Portuguese visa running out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: So, you’re there for how long?</span> <span id="s1300">Days?</span> <span id="s1301">Weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: I don’t – three weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: Three weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: Not many.</span> <span id="s1305">So, my father goes to the consulate or whatever, whatever the Yugoslav representation there is, and the poor person who is in charge of it, first of all, whoever was a Croatian employee quit and went to free Croatia, or thought they were – anyhow, they quit the Yugoslav Consulate, but there still the Yugoslav Consulate.</span> <span id="s1306">There was a – what is the insurrection of sailors called, there’s a word for it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1308">It’s a mutiny.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: Mutiny.</span> <span id="s1310">There’s a mutiny on Croatian ships that are in the harbor in Lisbon because, naturally, the sailors are Croats.</span> <span id="s1311">They’re not Serbs.</span> <span id="s1312">So, these are all Dalmatian Serbs.</span> <span id="s1313">By that time, there’s a – those Ustashes have gotten to Zagreb, and it’s obvious what’s going to be in Zagreb.</span> <span id="s1314">So, they went back.</span> <span id="s1315">They went with their ships.</span> <span id="s1316">So, this poor person has nobody to talk to because, obviously, there’s not – no connection, no telephone, no nothing to Yugoslavia, or ex-Yugoslavia, and so he’s having this conversation with my father.</span> <span id="s1317">What can he do with this mutiny?</span> <span id="s1318">This mutiny?</span> <span id="s1319">And my father said, “Let them go.</span> <span id="s1320">What are you going to do with them?</span> <span id="s1321">You can’t hold them there.”</span> <span id="s1322">So, he said, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s1323">So, they took off.</span> <span id="s1324">The next thing -</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Q: Not with the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: With the ship.</span> <span id="s1327">They took everything and went back to Croatia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">A: As far as I know.</span> <span id="s1330">I mean, this is – this is the way it was decided.</span> <span id="s1331">They were taking the ship, and they were – there were a couple of them, I think.</span> <span id="s1332">I’m not quite sure.</span> <span id="s1333">Then, they had no money to pay whoever was employed there.</span> <span id="s1334">No money from Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s1335">I don’t know what happened to the rest.</span> <span id="s1336">So, my father lent him, I think, $500 to pay off the staff.</span> <span id="s1337">There was some Croats in the staff, no doubt, but most of them wanted to go back.</span> <span id="s1338">For all I know, he was a Croat, but maybe not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: But your father is known enough so these people know-</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: No, he goes – he walks in and he’s got an official visa in his pocket, and-</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: Of course, he’s a representative of the transport and commerce, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: Yes, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1343">And so, they have a conversation.</span> <span id="s1344">So, he gives – and I have the receipt.</span> <span id="s1345">I recently found it under the papers.</span> <span id="s1346">It was little.</span> <span id="s1347">I think it’s $500, plus a letter which asks that we take along when we get to the ship, a – well, when we get transportation, to take along a Persian carpet for the representative of Yugoslavia in Washington, D.C., who was a guy by the name of Protasce (ph) at the time, which I think I saw on one occasion when there still was a Yugoslavia, which we took along.</span> <span id="s1348">Then, we found somebody who got in touch with us, a family of a French diplomat.</span> <span id="s1349">I guess it was a small place, and people heard who was where, or maybe this Yugoslav woman who I’m going to talk to you about now heard that – must have gone to the Yugoslav Embassy or Yugoslav Representation to talk about what’s going to happen to her, and so on.</span> <span id="s1350">She was married to a, I think, the cultural attaché of France in Portugal, and he was supposed to go back to France, and they had a little boy.</span> <span id="s1351">She was originally from Zagreb, and her sister’s husband worked for my father in the yeast factory, the alcohol and yeast factory.</span> <span id="s1352">And in fact, I was wearing a jacket that her sister, who was a weaver, had woven the material for.</span> <span id="s1353">I used that for a long time.</span> <span id="s1354">And we took this child, and took it to his godparents who were a Yugoslav – a Croatian Jew by the name of Alexander and his Russian non-Jewish wife who were in New York already for a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: So, you had added-</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">A: We added some, so then there were-</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: Five of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: Five of us in the cabin plus the rug, maybe not the rug.</span> <span id="s1359">It may have been somewhere else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: So, this SS Sibornay was the ship…</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: Sibonay, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: And what country is the ship from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: US, US Export Line.</span> <span id="s1364">The strike was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: It was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: The strike was over</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">Q: And that was the original ship you were supposed to go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">A: I don’t know, but it was probably a United States export line ship because they were doing this traverse.</span> <span id="s1369">It was full of all sorts of flotsam and jetsam from Europe on the ship, and then the consul from Pavelic, from Bern and his American wife were also on the ship.</span> <span id="s1370">They came later.</span> <span id="s1371">I mean, they came to Portugal later.</span> <span id="s1372">So, we had somebody to have, to sit at the table with.</span> <span id="s1373">When we got to Bermuda, it was quite, I mean, there were German U-boats there, and they were trying to avoid the U-boats, but the United States was neutral.</span> <span id="s1374">So, we got to Bermuda.</span> <span id="s1375">The British got on the ship and took off a bunch of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">A: Yeah, German spies, they said, and so on, maybe 10, 15.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q: How many people are on the ship with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1380">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s1381">It was a big ocean liner, and there was interrogation then.</span> <span id="s1382">The British looked at all of our passports and so on, but there was no problem whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1383">They took off a number of people.</span> <span id="s1384">Some, probably, were perfectly honest, decent people.</span> <span id="s1385">In fact, one was a German leftist, who then found us in New York.</span> <span id="s1386">So, they must have obviously let him go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: Now, was the route to go to Bermuda, or they went to-</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">A: No, no, I think it was – I think it was – no, they were avoiding probably.</span> <span id="s1389">I don’t know, because the only thing that happened in Bermuda is that these – that these British officers-</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q: Interrogated people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">A: Yeah, boarded and interrogated people.</span> <span id="s1392">And, then, it wasn’t there too long, two hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: I see, and then-</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: And then directly in New Jersey, Hoboken, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">Q: Hoboken?</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">A: I believe so, but definitely New Jersey.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: Did you see the Statue of Liberty?</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: You did?</span> <span id="s1400">Was that great?</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A: It was great, and we did not go to any Ellis Island or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1402">United States immigration people came on board, and interrogated us on board, as I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: So, you disembark?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: We disembarked in New Jersey, got into a taxi, and went into the tunnel, which was very impressive to go through, and my father was saying, “This is under the Hudson which we’re going now.”</span> <span id="s1405">It was very exciting.</span> <span id="s1406">We went to 57th Street and 6th Avenue to the Hotel Salisbury, where they had sort of apartments, small, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: They had an apartment already?</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A: No, they didn’t.</span> <span id="s1409">Actually, yes, because my uncle’s divorced wife had married a Czech who was a schoolmate of hers, and they were in the hotel next door, which is something called the, next door also on 57th Street, something like – not the Berkshire, but something like that.</span> <span id="s1410">Also, on 57th Street between 6th and 7th Avenue.</span> <span id="s1411">There was a wonderful automat, Horn and Hardart, where you could put money in and you could get coffee or cocoa and it would go into a cup from out of the wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Q: Could you imagine trying to do this without money?</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">A: No.</span> <span id="s1414">Maybe yes, up to – yes, but with a lot of difficulty, probably no Hotel d’Angleterres in Geneva and-</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: But, your father was also prominent enough that he knew people and he could get a certain recourse that most people couldn’t get.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: Yes, yes, sure.</span> <span id="s1417">A lot of – of course, there were a lot of people including very good friends of ours who had children already outside the country.</span> <span id="s1418">This is a rather interesting thing.</span> <span id="s1419">This was a very prominent Jewish family.</span> <span id="s1420">In fact, at one time, the father was the head of the Jewish community in Zagreb, and he had two daughters living in South Carolina, in Dillon, South Carolina, planted paprika.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q: Paprika?</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">A: Paprika, because you couldn’t get any paprika from Hungary anymore so this was the business, and they had gone a year earlier to the United States to find out what, you know, where paprika could be – what would be the best land and climate for paprika and that was Dillon, South Carolina, and they had a paprika plantation, believe it or not.</span> <span id="s1423">And these parents – although, my father went to before we left, and they had two daughters and family, they could’ve easily come along.</span> <span id="s1424">People were afraid.</span> <span id="s1425">These people could’ve done it, and other people that I know could have easily done it, and thought, “Oh, no, we’ll get out.”</span> <span id="s1426">So, it was quite strange how this functioned.</span> <span id="s1427">More people definitely could have helped themselves.</span> <span id="s1428">I’m not saying young people who had no money, but there were very prominent Jewish and non-Jewish families that could’ve done it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Q: Was it easy for you to adjust to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">A: I think it was in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1431">Later on, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Q: Later on, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: Later on I became – at first, you know, we’re in a hotel that had a kitchenette and a closet.</span> <span id="s1434">We thought this was absolutely wonderful.</span> <span id="s1435">We went to a five and ten and bought – my brother and I went to buy things with, you know, with flowers on it, for heaven’s sakes, mugs with flowers.</span> <span id="s1436">We’d never seen it.</span> <span id="s1437">I thought this was terrific, like four spoons and so on.</span> <span id="s1438">And then my father decided before we moved – we then moved later on to Riverdale, in New York, and my brother went to school there for some time.</span> <span id="s1439">Fieldstone School, I think it was called.</span> <span id="s1440">He bought a car.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Q: Mario?</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A: No, my father bought a car.</span> <span id="s1443">No, Mario, the first summer, was sent to camp in Maine, and we bought a car and got a chauffer, and traveled through New England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">Q: Fabulous.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">A: That was fabulous, and then finally when we came back we took apartment.</span> <span id="s1446">But I remember buying the car and having to pay cash because our, whatever account we had, bank account was blocked because we were aliens probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q: You’re illegal aliens?</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: I think so, for a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">Q: When is your brother – we have to stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">End of Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">Tape #6</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: You came to the United States in 1941.</span> <span id="s1453">Did you get here in May or June?</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A: May.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: Now, your brother is still at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: Oh, wait a minute, I’m trying to think, I think it would have been early June or May, maybe like you know the manifest is there.</span> <span id="s1457">We can see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">Q: Is your brother – does he volunteer to go into the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">Q: But are you US citizens?</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">A: No, but he became as soon as he joined the army, almost immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: Was your family wanting him to, or was it okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A: It was obvious that they were going to recruit him anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">Q: Even as a foreigner?</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">A: Yes, and at the time when he got him, he was told to change his name.</span> <span id="s1466">He was going to be sort of an interpreter, but never was anything.</span> <span id="s1467">He died in, near Sainte-Mère-Eglise, which was horrible battle in Normandy.</span> <span id="s1468">He was in Texas and New Jersey and so on, is where he got his basic training, and it – whoever his officer was said, “Listen, it would be a good idea if you changed your name because they can find out this way.</span> <span id="s1469">It won’t be so obvious right away.”</span> <span id="s1470">And he did, and then my uncle changed his name also, Felix to Sorel.</span> <span id="s1471">And I don’t know why because this name, what’s not clear to me is because when I was doing the broadcasting to Yugoslavia, sort of a women’s program, whether I first used Sorel, whether my brother first used Sorel, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1472">It was one way like that, except all my friends who heard knew – it was in Yugoslavia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q: And, when did you get the job with Voice of America?</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: That was a fairly interesting thing.</span> <span id="s1475">There was no Voice of America when I joined.</span> <span id="s1476">It was something that was sort of a precursor of OSS, and there was something called, I believe, the analysis section, and I looked at the papers, and I think it was ’43 maybe, and I was doing some research in – language research – at the library in New York, and then there was a Balkan desk where, again, I wasn’t doing much.</span> <span id="s1477">I was doing translations and nothing much.</span> <span id="s1478">Then, this guy that I told you that was doing the broadcasting from Paris originally, was doing broadcasting in – it wasn’t even Voice of America, I think it was still part of Coordinated Information, if I’m not mistaken, is what it was called.</span> <span id="s1479">But they had broadcasting facilities.</span> <span id="s1480">So, from the same place where Voice of America was, he was broadcasting there, and I was translating it into English for the censors.</span> <span id="s1481">Then, the man got sick, and I was the one who was broadcasting, and I had to end the – I said who I was because they knew who he was and so on, and I said I was broadcasting in his name, and it ended up, “May God save King Peter forever.</span> <span id="s1482">May God save forever King Peter of Yugoslavia.”</span> <span id="s1483">_____ This was for about six weeks or so, I believe, I was doing it, and then finally something like the Balkan desk was established which was under – the chief was an Albanian, of all things, then there was some Greeks who had been – they were been shuttled back and forth, and I don’t think that we actually broadcast as Voice of America in Serbo-Croatian until ’44 probably, and so that’s that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Q: So, are you doing this work at the same time that Mario went into the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">Q: And, how did you – when did you and your parents hear about this?</span> <span id="s1487">Was it soon after the ___?</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">A: Very soon.</span> <span id="s1489">My mother was at home alone, and a Western Union person came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: Western Union?</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: Western Union came with a telegram, and I remember I was at the hairdresser after work, and I called to say, “I’m coming home.</span> <span id="s1492">I’m sorry, do you need anything along the way?”</span> <span id="s1493">Then we were living on 102nd and Riverside Drive, and she said, “This man just handed this.”</span> <span id="s1494">So, my father was in the mustard business in Brooklyn, and – which was quite a strange thing, and he came home.</span> <span id="s1495">It was horrendous.</span> <span id="s1496">It was horrendous.</span> <span id="s1497">I can’t tell you how horrendous.</span> <span id="s1498">On the other hand, it was happening all over.</span> <span id="s1499">There were several families, friends of ours, who had lost, in the States, sons.</span> <span id="s1500">So, it was in the middle of this whole dreadful trauma for everybody.</span> <span id="s1501">We weren’t the one that was picked out as the only one to live through, you know, badly.</span> <span id="s1502">The training that they had, I don’t even know how long the basic training was, and he was in Germany – in Britain for a while, and he wrote a letter that made us know where he was, and he’s buried in Saint-Laurent, you know, that big cemetery.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">Q: Have you gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">A: Oh, several times.</span> <span id="s1505">I went, the first time I went there, it was still only wooden markers, no Mogen David there, and then there was one British person who was an administrator, and then of course, it went on to became this super, huge, enormous cemetery which has lost some.</span> <span id="s1506">I mean, in a way that more moving and impressive, and in another way, it’s less, because this was, so to speak, raw earth, just lines and lines of wooden crosses, and with names on them, that’s all there was.</span> <span id="s1507">And then we lived in France in the ’60s.</span> <span id="s1508">So, we went several times.</span> <span id="s1509">This was a decision my parents made, especially my father.</span> <span id="s1510">He said, “You know this will be a grave that will be taking care of.</span> <span id="s1511">It will not depend on whether you’re paying some kind of duty, or somebody should be there to watch this.”</span> <span id="s1512">And I think it was a very good decision.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: Rather than bringing him home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">A: Yes, because friends of ours did, and that was better for them, and I also have a feeling maybe my father wanted to save my mother more trauma.</span> <span id="s1515">I think my mother was closer to my brother, then – not closer to him than to me.</span> <span id="s1516">In a way, I think, she was closer because we were women, but this was the carrier of the name.</span> <span id="s1517">So, that counted, and it was an extremely macho society, Yugoslavia, not only, I mean, for everybody, for all people, for all Jews and for everyone, Serbians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">Q: So, in some ways he was more important?</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">A: Oh, yeah, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1520">I think maybe I was closer to my father.</span> <span id="s1521">All together, he was, and it’s crazy to say “mama’s boy”, because that’s not, you know, in that sense, but I think he was more – I think he was independent.</span> <span id="s1522">I don’t know, maybe because I was older.</span> <span id="s1523">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s1524">Maybe, because he was better looking than me.</span> <span id="s1525">He was very good looking person, and I was, for a while there, a very thin child with glasses who was sloppy, and that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1526">He was a good looking young man.</span> <span id="s1527">So, I think – for a child, and they fed him well, and he got round, and I was always scrawny at that time.</span> <span id="s1528">So, you know.</span> <span id="s1529">I think that may have been part of it.</span> <span id="s1530">And Yugoslavia was a country where women walked behind the donkey while their husbands rode.</span> <span id="s1531">I won’t say in our society, but underlying that.</span> <span id="s1532">It carries over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">Q: Did it affect your father the way it did your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">A: I think it affected my – my father was a soldier through four years or more, and he knew of the horrible possibility existed, and I mean, he didn’t sit in an office during World War I.</span> <span id="s1535">He was in the Russian front among ____ going on, this, that and the other came out.</span> <span id="s1536">And, horrible as it is, I think in a way it may have been an interesting experience for him.</span> <span id="s1537">He told a story which has nothing to do with this, but I just want to mention it.</span> <span id="s1538">When he got – I guess this must have been on the Russian/Polish border somewhere, he said that a man came to him who was in the Russian army and surrendered, and said that I’m Jew soldier (ph), and so he -my father took him home to Pozega along with his horse, and the man stayed I don’t know how long with the family as a prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s1539">So, he was in a nice regiment, hunter’s regiment with nice uniforms, and so on.</span> <span id="s1540">Although, he was in trenches, and he knew how horrible – I think it’s a different experience to them than to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: So, when did you hear about Joseph?</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: He was missing in action for more than a year, the poor soul.</span> <span id="s1543">We kept writing to each other, and suddenly there was no, nothing anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">Q: He was writing to you-</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">A: I was in New York.</span> <span id="s1546">We were in New York.</span> <span id="s1547">We were writing practically daily in New York, and there was no answer, and then finally, the mother wrote me, and his insurance policy was written for me, which I find incredible, I mean, they needed it probably less than we did.</span> <span id="s1548">Maybe he felt I was here, the poor refugee sitting in New York, which was true, but he made it out to me, and the mother heard – no, first he was missing in action from both of us were writing back and forth.</span> <span id="s1549">Finally, my parents were sending food to England to her because she was in horrible shape at the time.</span> <span id="s1550">She married a Colonel Enzeing (ph) of all names, and his brother, they couldn’t find him, his brother.</span> <span id="s1551">He was missing in action.</span> <span id="s1552">His brother went to look for him, in Burma, and they recognized him by his boots a year later in the jungle.</span> <span id="s1553">This was – my brother’s death and all of that was at the same time, at about the same time.</span> <span id="s1554">It was about the same time.</span> <span id="s1555">For a year, more than a year, he was missing in action, and something called the Duke of Wellington’s regiment, and this is also bizarre to think of.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Q: And, when the war was over, were there any relatives alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q: In Zagreb?</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A: In Zagreb, or in Croatia, far off.</span> <span id="s1560">Some came back.</span> <span id="s1561">Some were in camps in Italy.</span> <span id="s1562">Others had gotten from Italy to Latin America.</span> <span id="s1563">Here’s another very, very interesting thing about – they were helped by a group of monks, not monks, but religious, an order that was called San Rafaele, that was formed to help refugees.</span> <span id="s1564">They help Jews.</span> <span id="s1565">They helped Ustashe.</span> <span id="s1566">They helped Germans.</span> <span id="s1567">They helped everyone.</span> <span id="s1568">That was their job, and these people took their passports to Zagreb.</span> <span id="s1569">The Uruguayan consul had left who was Jewish, and was fleeing, and this is the letter I just found of eight pages, left the official seal with his secretary and this order carried the passports to Zagreb under their robes, had them stamped, brought them back to Rome, because they had these, they were given exit visas from Italy and transit visas from Spain.</span> <span id="s1570">That was my father’s sister, husband, daughter and then the young man that she fell in love with and they finally married, and my uncle Felix somehow went to Cuba, where he sat in a sort of a holding camp because I guess they didn’t feel like letting people out or couldn’t get enough money out of them.</span> <span id="s1571">He finally came to the States, and actually my father visited him and he had a Cuban visa at that time, in ’44 or ’45.</span> <span id="s1572">I think it’s stamped in his passport, and then finally Felix got married to an Italian Jewish woman who was a scientist, and then they ended up in Caracas, Venezuela.</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">Q: Is there anything more you’d like to tell us about your experiences?</span> <span id="s1574">I know you have a full life afterwards which we can’t go into now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">A: No, of course.</span> <span id="s1576">A wonderful husband who I met.</span> <span id="s1577">He was working in Belgrade – actually, it was not Voice of America, it was the United States Information Agency, he established the office for them in Belgrade.</span> <span id="s1578">Before that, he was an Albania during the war – Italy, Albania and so on, and we met at Voice of America.</span> <span id="s1579">He came back to tell us how we were getting, you know, how we were accepted and heard and so on.</span> <span id="s1580">And we got married.</span> <span id="s1581">We have two daughters.</span> <span id="s1582">We’ve lived all over the place.</span> <span id="s1583">We lived in Venezuela for I don’t know how many years, six maybe, seven.</span> <span id="s1584">Then, we came back to New York.</span> <span id="s1585">We went to Mexico, and then we had 11 years in Paris, then went back to Mexico, and now we’ve been here since – it’s 14 years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">Q: You were married in 1949.</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">A: No, before that, ’47, yeah, and I got my citizenship without him.</span> <span id="s1588">I had been here the length of time.</span> <span id="s1589">I didn’t get it – it wasn’t any shorter because I had married an American citizen.</span> <span id="s1590">I got it on my own.</span> <span id="s1591">I’m very pleased with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: So, when did you become an American citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">A: On the nose, five years after I came here, exactly, ’46.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">Q: Lucie, thank you so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: Now, we’ll stop the tape and look at some of the photographs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Q: Can you describe this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">A: This is Zagreb, and the address is Jelacic Trg, which means Jelacic Square, which is the absolute center of town, and this original house in front, which is the oldest house on that square, was built somewhere in the 1840s, maybe 1850, a very famous architect called Feldinger.</span> <span id="s1600">When they started building it, Jews were still not allowed to have houses within the confines of the city, and then after that, by the time they finished, it already was built and my great-grandfather lived there.</span> <span id="s1601">It was built for two families.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: And this picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: This picture is Janusevac, which is our country house built somewhere in the 1840s, and so on, we were one of the last owners, I suppose, and it’s about 15 miles from Zagreb.</span> <span id="s1604">We stayed there as long as there was no school.</span> <span id="s1605">Let’s say we stayed there from April through October, but as there was no central heating, we then went to town and lived on Jelacic Trg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A: And this is the entrance hall of Janusevac, and these two bronze vases or whatever they are, are actually from China.</span> <span id="s1608">This came from somebody, I don’t know, friends whose parents were there during the Boxer Rebellion, brought it back, and I don’t know how they came into the family, and in the middle is this round room which we used to call the chapel, which – we called it the chapel because there was a – not organs, but a harmonium – were there, and it had a nice cupola.</span> <span id="s1609">As children we used to dance there mostly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: This?</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: This is what we used to call the chapel, a round room, and I guess we used to call it the chapel because it was there big musical instrument that’s normally in churches, and from that door over leads to a drawing room which is where the piano was, and it led to the balcony, the front balcony.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">A: This was the main drawing room, I guess.</span> <span id="s1614">There was some original frescoes up there, but one of them was missing so, one of them is false.</span> <span id="s1615">There’s nothing there now.</span> <span id="s1616">Maybe some shelves.</span> <span id="s1617">I think my father had them restored, and had one of these painted originally, the one on top maybe – I have no idea who the painter was of these paintings.</span> <span id="s1618">This particular stove was from my grandmother’s house in town.</span> <span id="s1619">I don’t know when it was brought to Janusevac.</span> <span id="s1620">I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">A: This is my bedroom, and this is a portrait of my mother at age 17, and that’s the only thing that exists.</span> <span id="s1623">The portrait disappeared and that’s all gone, and there’s a wooden saint there – I believe it was Saint Christopher.</span> <span id="s1624">As I said, that’s my bedroom.</span> <span id="s1625">You can even see the salon, look at that.</span> <span id="s1626">[New picture] This is the house.</span> <span id="s1627">This is what the country house looked like after the war.</span> <span id="s1628">According to one story – we know that the Germans kept ammunition in the cellar, and we’re told that they exploded this when they were retreating.</span> <span id="s1629">On the other hand, others said that the Ustashe did it, but who knows?</span> <span id="s1630">And, after the war, there were fewer and fewer, and fewer bricks because they insisted on rebuilding it unnecessarily for my taste, after the war, and the peasants needed to get their houses fixed.</span> <span id="s1631">So, they just went and got all of the bricks.</span> <span id="s1632">So, finally they had to build a brickyard to rebuild it, which I think was ridiculous, and now it is apparently an archive of the city of Zagreb.</span> <span id="s1633">I don’t know what’s inside.</span> <span id="s1634">Dora was there.</span> <span id="s1635">She was the last one there, and it’s all painted up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">Q: This?</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">A: This is a group on my seventh birthday.</span> <span id="s1638">The woman behind me, the girl behind me, was a year older than the rest of, is still alive.</span> <span id="s1639">Her son – her name is Angie Zaus (ph), her son is a professor at Zagreb University.</span> <span id="s1640">The girl in the sort of sailor suit is Zora Krajce.</span> <span id="s1641">Her father was a banker.</span> <span id="s1642">She was killed in the most – no, she actually committed suicide by going to lie down with a bunch of people who had some infectious disease because they took away her child and threw it into the Danube, frozen Danube.</span> <span id="s1643">The girl on the other side is somebody by the name of Cerhov (ph), she is alive and living in Israel.</span> <span id="s1644">The other girl, her name is Rudfeld, and she was a – she lost her mother, and I don’t know, she was a classmate.</span> <span id="s1645">The little one who is sitting on the chair, she was in Bergen-Belsen and she lost her child there.</span> <span id="s1646">On the bottom is a cousin of mine with the dark hair, Anica Bauer living in Venezuela.</span> <span id="s1647">The next is a cousin who died.</span> <span id="s1648">The next is my brother.</span> <span id="s1649">The next is Mia Bauer Pinkas, who is my cousin, who lives in Venezuela and in Geneva and in Florida.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">Q:</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">A: This is my father, Manfred Sternberg.</span> <span id="s1652">He’s wearing the uniform of the Yugoslav army of which he was a captain in the reserve, and the decorations are Saint Sava and got a Georgia Crown of I don’t which order, but this apparently was with my brother when he was killed in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">Q: And the other picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">A: The other picture is me in this dress.</span> <span id="s1655">That’s an evening dress, sitting.</span> <span id="s1656">Behind me is my mother, on the left – no, okay, this is Dragon Mauntner who was killed by the Nazis very early on.</span> <span id="s1657">It’s almost legendary what happened to him, and the other is – on his left is Zlata Mainic (ph), who was a good friend of mine from childhood on, he became an Ustashe and then fled to Argentina.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">A: This is in a place called Glovidin Adolf which is on the northern Adriatic coast.</span> <span id="s1660">This was in 1939, probably June, early June, and this is Joseph Heaton, who was then my fiancé, who was an Englishman who was killed in Burma.</span> <span id="s1661">[New picture] This is Josip Levac, known as Sepa, who was our chauffer, and actually family friend.</span> <span id="s1662">His father was – worked for my grandfather.</span> <span id="s1663">In the back is my cousin who died.</span> <span id="s1664">My father gave him this car when we left Yugoslavia, and he became the driver of Artukovic, the Minister of Interior for Croatia and he was forced to do that.</span> <span id="s1665">[New picture] This is my brother Mario Sternberg who was killed in Sainte-Mère-Eglise in Normandy, obviously an American soldier.</span> <span id="s1666">He was three years younger than I was, and I think this was the one formal picture we had of him in his uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">Q: _______?</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">A: Uh, 19, he might be 20, somewhere there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">A: This is a picture of my mother Lili Sternberg, who was extremely pretentious here, which she was not, taken after the war, and that’s all.</span> <span id="s1671">It’s somewhere in New York.</span> <span id="s1672">This was taken in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">Q: She looks lovely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">A: She was very lovely, but she didn’t look like this.</span> <span id="s1675">She wasn’t really stiff.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">A: This is my husband Morris Rosenberg.</span> <span id="s1678">When he was working for the United States government abroad, they were meant to wear a uniform and they hand sewn-on ranks of captain and so on, in case they were captured because they were working in Belgrade and so on, and the Germans were still around.</span> <span id="s1679">He was 32 or 33 years old, and then worked for the Office of War Information, and later became a journalist.</span> <span id="s1680">mostly with the Associated Press.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">Q: Was he wearing the uniform when you met?</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: I think he – he had the uniform.</span> <span id="s1683">I don’t think
