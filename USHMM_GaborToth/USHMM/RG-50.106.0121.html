exams on the end of the year, school year.</span> <span id="s85">So I had enough time to go and to do this, and I was doing – being honest, I wa – didn’t like too much the law, I – I preferred to be probably just an engineer, but this was not the profession which you could do in Poland, especially for a Jewish fellow.</span> <span id="s86">And in family of four we were five lawyers.</span> <span id="s87">My brother-in-law, the oldest one was a lawyer.</span> <span id="s88">My oldest sister was a lawyer, my youngest sister was a lawyer.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: And so you – when you

Warsaw was the university, which had name later Pilsudski, but in my time was Warsaw University, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Can you describe one of the incidents early on in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Yes, yes, I do, because one of my friends from Kielce, which we were in school together, was also studying law.</span> <span id="s106">We went one day, was

professor said the Jewish people stood and should sit on the left side.</span> <span id="s109">And when we’re going out, they were waiting for us, you know, and was purpose, to show that we are not afraid, I showed him to go out first, and he knew what’s going on, so he showed me, and I went, so he got beaten up.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: By other students?</span> <span id="s111">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s112">And I knew about others, I didn’t experience too much myself, because as I said, I was going there only for on the end of the year to take the exams, and that’s all what was.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s114">All right.</span> <span id="s115">And then the years – it was 1935 - ’36?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Th-Th – ’36.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: And you finished law s –</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: School in 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: And then what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: That’s a – what I said I pul – went to the lawyer for a – usually you could go to that court for three years and then to have two years with the lawyer or you could go for five years with the lawyer.</span> <span id="s121">And so I decided to take this five years and after three years was already everything over, so I didn’t graduate, you know, I didn’t pass the bar exams because I wasn’t – didn’t have the five years.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s123">And then –</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: And the rest is history.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: And the rest is history.</span> <span id="s126">Lo – okay, let’s talk about now with the war breaking out, because up to that point you were doing your re – working with the court.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s129">And then when your – your first memories of when the war started, can you describe –</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: That first memory?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Yeah, of when the war started.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: In 1939, as a matter of fact we were on vacation.</span> <span id="s133">When I say we were – because it happens that my wife was there on vacation too, together.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Were you married at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: We met only in 1935, this was the year my wife graduate from high school in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s138">But in 1939 we found ourselves in the same hotel in the country on vacation.</span> <span id="s139">And as a matter of fact –</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Where was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: This was the Arensha(ph) in the mountains of Poland, and because I was going very often there the summertime, every summer, almost, so I had su – few friends.</span> <span id="s142">One of them was a teacher there, and just before September first, which war started over there, he told me, he said he read already mobilization paper, which was not outside, and I told this tha – my wife now said, I saw this and it would be smarter to go now back to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s143">And we took together the train and we found ourself if I am not wrong, a day before September first, so – and the next day war started.</span> <span id="s144">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: What do you remember of that day, of September first?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: I found myself in my sister and my brothers-in-law apartment.</span> <span id="s147">They were in the country this time with the both children, girls.</span> <span id="s148">And a maid was there already.</span> <span id="s149">On September second, if I am not wrong to the dates, about I can be day or two off, the bomb hit the back of the building and destroyed everything what was in the back.</span> <span id="s150">If I say back, in Poland usually the apartments had the front entrance and the back entrance, you know, for deliveries and maids was from the back and from the front.</span> <span id="s151">So everything from back, no more entrance through the maid.</span> <span id="s152">This – she was there, I think – the maid was, a day or two more after this bombing and she decided to go back to neighborhood of Kielce, which usually my mother was sending the maids being sure that they are the right ones, she went back and I found myself in this apartment, waiting until they would come.</span> <span id="s153">In meantime I found out that my brother-in-law was already in the service, and my sister came few days later with the both girls, and – yeah.</span> <span id="s154">Then a few days later again SS came, high officers of SS, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Came to the apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: To the apartment because they had –</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Were you home?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: – they had the names of the lawyers, and because he was a lawyer too like my sister, so they came because – and what he found, the his – my brothers-in-law coat, which was full of blood inside, somebody brought to us the coat and we thought that he is dead.</span> <span id="s159">So she kept this coat, my sisters kept the coat in the closet and when he looked, saw the officer’s coat, she told him that that’s what she got from somebody who brought this.</span> <span id="s160">And then he changed for a moment and he said that he will be – in few days the people will come and will confiscate everything.</span> <span id="s161">He doesn’t want to write anything, whatever they will find, they will confiscate.</span> <span id="s162">And they left, and my sister sold everything almost, in the next two days, or was giving away, but to get rid.</span> <span id="s163">And really when they came, they didn’t have too much to take it out.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Were you there when the SS officers came?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: When the officers came?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: The first time.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: Yes, I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Did they say anything to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Nope.</span> <span id="s170">No, they were interested in confiscation of furniture and whatever.</span> <span id="s171">They asked to open the – how you call it, the –</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Closet?</span> <span id="s173">A: The safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: And in the safe he took out only a one pin, diamond pin, put on his uniform and said looks nice, and of course then put back.</span> <span id="s176">But I think that this officer coat saved this time my sister.</span> <span id="s177">And later, I wasn’t there when they came to confiscate, but I found out that they didn’t because wasn’t any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: Then where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Then I decided that I will go and find out if my father – if my brother-in-law is dead and my sister is alone, or I will find him and I will bring back.</span> <span id="s180">And I decided to go to the Russian side.</span> <span id="s181">Poland was divided this time.</span> <span id="s182">And because he was, before he became a lawyer, he was a judge in the town of Bialystok, which probably you heard about, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: What was your brother-in-law’s name?</span> <span id="s184">A: Nathan(ph) Erlich(ph).</span> <span id="s185">And so I decided to go there and to find out if anybody heard, and I found him there.</span> <span id="s186">He had just came from hospital.</span> <span id="s187">The coat was brought by a friend, also an officer, who was almost sure that he is dead and couldn’t face my sister, so he left the coat there and he took off the bandages.</span> <span id="s188">We went to make a picture and with this picture I came back to my sister and we were there for quite awhile until my brother came from Kielce.</span> <span id="s189">Left the parents and came there because parents sent some money for my sister and for my brother-in-law who was still in Bialystok.</span> <span id="s190">So we decided that we’ll go there and deliver this money.</span> <span id="s191">It wasn’t so simple crossing the border, neither with Germans or Russians, so we split the money between, but we delivered money together.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: We?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: We, my brother and myself and we were separated for a moment, but we found ourself.</span> <span id="s194">My brother – I left my brother there, together with my brother-in-law and I went back to Warsaw because I didn't want my sister to be alone.</span> <span id="s195">Even that two of the sisters who were just then together.</span> <span id="s196">And because they had only two daughters, so they were only girls, so I decided that I will go because this side – my brother-in-law was not in condition to come.</span> <span id="s197">Just before war started between Russians and Germans, they came, they left Russian side and they came back to Warsaw and my brother left right away for my parents to Kielce and were there.</span> <span id="s198">And later was changing, we needed to give up the apartments because they were moving people to ghetto, which was –</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: This is in Kielce now?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: This is Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Oh, now you’re talking about Warsaw, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: As a matter of fact, I’m talking more now here about myself than I am talking about the – the reason I am here, to talk about the Germans.</span> <span id="s203">And I hate to talk about myself, this reminds me always, you know, when you’re going to the bank and you want the loan, you need to show off how ri-rich you are, and believe me I wasn’t a hero during the war.</span> <span id="s204">I was more a coward than – than a hero, so I hate to talk about, but I know that the – I went to Kielce to visit my parents – this is, I’m backing up now a little bit and this needed to be in 1940 and I was there for a few days only – I decided to be only for a few days, but in this few days I went to visit my friends from school, and of course when I visited them, they hated to see that I am wearing the Jewish – because they were not Jews, so they told me to take off, and with them, they don’t see the difference.</span> <span id="s205">And – and I spent out –</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Jewish star you’re talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: The Jewish star which we were wearing.</span> <span id="s208">And I took off and I – I was with them and when I left them, I forgot that I had the star in my pocket and two regular German soldiers, not SS, stopped me and I don’t know how – oh no, no, I know – now I didn’t know how, but now I know.</span> <span id="s209">Two soldiers, German, were walking and I remind myself this time that I didn’t put, so I put my hand in the pocket and I put on.</span> <span id="s210">They saw this and they stopped me and they pushed me in their hallway and they asked for money.</span> <span id="s211">But I didn’t have too much and I offered them also a watch, and this was not enough.</span> <span id="s212">So I told them that if they will walk with me home, I will give from my parents, I will get money and I will give.</span> <span id="s213">And that’s what it was, I was going in front, they were walking behind.</span> <span id="s214">An SS stopped three of us, there’s two soldiers and them, asking why they are walking behind this Jew.</span> <span id="s215">So they told him that, so they were arrested by SS for mixing in, and I was arrested for not wearing the – the s – this was, by law, even that you could be sentenced for death.</span> <span id="s216">But my parents used the intervention of my ex-German teacher, who was married to a Italian foreign diplomat, and they went to her, and she was able to pull me out from the jail.</span> <span id="s217">I was only two days in jail.</span> <span id="s218">And I left, of course, Kielce the day after, it was my accident – experience was –</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Le-Let’s go back a little bit, you – you were – came back to be with your sister.</span> <span id="s220">We jumped ahead a little bit, and you had seen your brother [indecipherable] came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Yeah, they had the beautiful apartment in [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Okay, and then – and then what happened to –</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Everybody needed to start to move, to give up this apartment, but it was time that they permitted you to exchange, so that –</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Is this still 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: No, 1941.</span> <span id="s226">’40 - ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Oh, okay, but you had visited your – your brother-in-law and then came back to be with your sister.</span> <span id="s228">I’m moving behi – back – back again.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: No, no, no, when – we talking about when the brother-in-law came back, they were together and I was together with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: So he came back to his apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: He did come back, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: Oh yes, and my brother only went to bi – to the parents, to Kielce.</span> <span id="s234">He was –</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Okay, and then did you stay living with your brother-in-law, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: And my sister and my two nieces.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: And what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: As a matter of fact, who – we’re funny [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s239">Many Jewish people wanted to sell their properties.</span> <span id="s240">Of course, not to Jewish people who were buying.</span> <span id="s241">Now, if this deal would be made after the Germans came, wouldn’t be legal.</span> <span id="s242">So what was done, that was predated that it started before the war, it started some time in 1939, and then didn’t finish, and in the beginning of the 1939, when war started, it means on end of ni – ’39, by picking up mutual guy was sign as an agreement to fill.</span> <span id="s243">I was the guy whose supposed to be the guy who signed his own papers.</span> <span id="s244">So of course this way they were getting quite cheap the properties.</span> <span id="s245">Our friends were getting the money and we’re getting our pay for it.</span> <span id="s246">And that’s what was a living continuously scared.</span> <span id="s247">From time to time they were catching us, the Germans were catching on the street and taking to labor.</span> <span id="s248">Sometimes one day only and sometimes was a few days and a few nights.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Did anything happen to you in 1940 in –</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: Yes, I was caught a few times to – to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: What kind of work?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: The physical work, digging and moving furniture and whatever they had to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: This is in – in Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: But – Warsaw, everything Warsaw, or in – or around Warsaw.</span> <span id="s255">They – this time they were taking us by trucks and bringing back the –</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Where were you living?</span> <span id="s257">Were you still living with your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Always – always – this time I was living with my sister and my brother-in-law, it was in their apartment.</span> <span id="s259">Later the apartment was changed for apartment – different apartment and also is a big as this, but they had other friends which are leaving.</span> <span id="s260">And this was going on until they started just to close.</span> <span id="s261">This time my father got a problem with the prostate in Kielce, and needed to be operated.</span> <span id="s262">And I think that I am coming now close to 1942, this was –</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Well, we’re still –</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: – yes, I – in this time –</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: – we’re still 1940, were – anything else in 19 –</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: You know, this is – this – everything is –</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: The same.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: War was the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: In 1941 –</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: ’41, I don’t remember ’41 or something like this, because wait a second, wait a second, wait a second, wait – yeah, the –</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: The ghettos –</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Ghetto started in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: October 19 –</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: And this was this, what I was just saying before was everything about already in the ghetto, what we’re doing together with my brother-in-law and my sister, you know, sending this – this was already in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s275">This time was very simple, because the courts, which were on the border between the ghetto, one entrance was from the ghetto side, the other entrance was – from the other side was very simple to get in.</span> <span id="s276">So that’s what was this – the [indecipherable] were possible to do it, because you could go to the court and to – put in everything le – to make it legal, this everything.</span> <span id="s277">Now, in 19 – sorry, in 1942, my father had already this problem with prostate and was not permitted by Germans to be operated in Kielce.</span> <span id="s278">Was my mother who had so-called good looks, Aryan looks, decided to cover most of the face of my father, he was very sick this time, took him by the train and she brought to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s279">He looked this way, that if wou – my mother wouldn’t be there, I wouldn’t recognize my own father.</span> <span id="s280">He had already infection, urine in the blood.</span> <span id="s281">And they tried, you know, to help him before operation, but in – he died soon after.</span> <span id="s282">So this was only one member of the family that because of Germans, but was buried –</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Wa – so what – when did he die?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: 1942, and I would say this was January 18.</span> <span id="s285">I will tell you why.</span> <span id="s286">Because January 19 - 18, in 1943 was th – by Jewish, after 11 months you stopped talk – saying Kaddish, and then a month later you saying the Kaddish, so I said this Kaddish and the next day I lost my mother and my sister.</span> <span id="s287">So almost exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: What were the conditions in 1941 in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s289">Did you have enough food?</span> <span id="s290">Do you –</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: As I said before, we were lucky because we were ha-having help from our parents financially and we were making money, like I told you before.</span> <span id="s292">Yes, I am maybe right now ashamed to say, to compare what was in Warsaw, yes we did have – we didn’t have – we didn’t suffer hunger.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: What were your living arrangements that you – it was just your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: As I said before, this was, on the beginning was a big apartment change for bigger, but some of the rooms were giving to the friends, mostly lawyers.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: So you shared?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: From other si – from not necessary Warsaw.</span> <span id="s297">Mostly not from Warsaw, from different cities, but by profession lawyers and they had so – was crowded but still, there were still two rooms for – for us.</span> <span id="s298">And they –</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Well now it’s 1942, and you say your father died in the early part of the year.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Oh, this was terrible –</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: – because example – example, I decided once to take a bicycle and to take a chance and to go to cemetery.</span> <span id="s303">And believe or not, I gr – I didn’t make it.</span> <span id="s304">This was once that I couldn’t make it to cemetery because of Germans.</span> <span id="s305">Second time, when war was over and I came back to Warsaw and I found my wife, I decided to go – first I went to Kielce back – no, no, to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s306">Mixing up.</span> <span id="s307">And I decided to go to see the grave of my father.</span> <span id="s308">I couldn’t get in because this time Russians had the fa – the exercises –</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Did your father – was your father able to have a funeral?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: He was.</span> <span id="s312">Okay, now we’re –</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: If you call it – this funeral.</span> <span id="s314">But anyway, not at least like others said, you know, together 20 - 30 bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: He had this –</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Now it’s – we’re in 1942, anything in the spring of ’42 that you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: ’42, a very important thing was that August 12, this date sticking in our memory, in group of our friends we decided that we’re married, and also decided that we’ll not stay together because it’s not too safe, and especially that it’s war, so you know, you never know what will happen.</span> <span id="s319">So we’re not together, but so-called, the whole time when I was in all the concentration camps, I was wa – tho – thinking about my sisters, about – I knew that my mother and the younger sister are out.</span> <span id="s320">In concentration camp I found out from my brother-in-law that my sister was arrested, the older one.</span> <span id="s321">So I also wasn’t too sure.</span> <span id="s322">Him, I didn’t give a chance, her I – my wife I didn’t give a chance to – she was too fragile, in my opinion.</span> <span id="s323">She was too much under the cover of her older sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: So you say you got in – you – this is August –</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: I thought that my two nieces would survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: So that – so in August of ’42, you decided to get married.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: And – and did you have a wedding ceremony?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A2: No, we didn’t have anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: You – you had no wedding?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: Just – A2: We didn’t have papers, we didn't –</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Almost – almost two – three years later – no, two years later, actually [indecipherable] almost two years later, September of 1945, I found my wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s335">We’ll get to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: I found my brother-in-law, the name only, and I found the name of two my nieces, they made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Okay, it’s August of 40 – of ’42, and then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: This is still going on til 1943.</span> <span id="s339">In 1943, I went to –</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A2: Uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: – Lublin.</span> <span id="s342">Upri – oh, this is uprising, I forgot it completely about the uprising, which I had preferred not to remember again, because its organization which I supposed to represent, represent to be a member of it, which I found out was giving the position where to be and a gun, only not bullets in it.</span> <span id="s343">And I was put together with the other fellow.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: This was on the fight of – get – ghetto fight.</span> <span id="s346">And the – the German machine, automatic machines shoo – was shooting and one of the bullets hit the guy which was next window to me, hit in the face and took off the – half of the head, and he was dead at this spot, and I thought that I got also a bullet, but not the face, only that the head and seeing him, I thought that my head is off.</span> <span id="s347">So scary, which I told you I never was a hero.</span> <span id="s348">I looked my hand and I saw blood, and I passed out.</span> <span id="s349">So the Germans woke me up and [indecipherable] and going and they pulled us to a place, to a spot where was a big hole, because the other group of the fighters, different groups, did mar – put the mine and Germans were killed when they came to this spot.</span> <span id="s350">So they were putting guys around and shooting them.</span> <span id="s351">And probably if they would have enough, they would put somebody else, but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s352">As long as we are waiting for [indecipherable] they pull my watch and they pulled my ring.</span> <span id="s353">They didn’t put us, they took us, and this was where I was taken to concentration camp on the train and I was sick, because I had open only wound right here, and continuously bleeding, but what worse was, when stop bleeding, was closing my eye.</span> <span id="s354">And this time I found myself on the train with my dear friend who just passed away, Henry Fenigstein from Toronto.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: Let’s talk a little before, and we’ll talk about your train ride.</span> <span id="s356">Were you active in the resistance at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: You were not.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: In the last moment –</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: The last –</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: – they – they put this in, the saying about hero, because after the war I met some of the guys who did belong to it and – and they wrote it on [indecipherable] paper that I was, and didn’t touch it because I wasn’t a hero, I wasn’t fighter, I was only fooled by myself and I was hit by a bullet, which I shouldn’t stay there, at the window.</span> <span id="s362">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: – you know, when you’re talking about that, I hate to talk about myself, is that from all my members of family, I was definitely the worst.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s366">We are – okay, now you are – y-you were talking about the April of 1943 uprising in Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: And now you’re on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s370">The train went to Lublin, which was Majdanek.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: What kind and what was the con – what were the conditions on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Terrible.</span> <span id="s373">As I started to say, this was not regular train only, you know, for animals and we were – crowded is not the word.</span> <span id="s374">We – you – you couldn’t fall down.</span> <span id="s375">Wherever you could sit down, you were sitting, if somebody was laying on top of you, conditions were awful.</span> <span id="s376">And as I said, my friend is – this physician, Henry Fenigstein, who was with me as a matter of fact, if I am alive now, partially because of him, because with a pocket knife, from time to time before coming, you know, for inspection of Germans, you know, how we looked, he was cutting in, opening the wound, so was opening my wound, my [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s377">And we were in Majdanek for a few days –</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: And how long is it –</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: – as a matter of fact, I need to look up this, this is the Lublin, it’s the first, one stop –</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: No, no, how – how long did the train ride take?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: I don’t remember –</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Was it only men in the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Only men?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: Only men.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Only men in the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: On this train were only me – I don’t remember [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: And so you got –</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: I don’t recall, could be that the women were there too.</span> <span id="s390">I don’t know, because I – as I said, I wasn’t feeling well, I was sick this time, because as a matter of fact, I don’t remember too well about the staying in Lublin, in the camp, and as a matter of fact, whatever I remembered, was funny story, Henry re-remembered differently.</span> <span id="s391">And we were sitting and talking about and he didn’t remember some of the things which I said, I didn’t remember some things which he said.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: What were – what were some of the things you remembered about being in Lublin?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: Example, I remembered that there was a woman this time in Lublin and she was a wife of a lawyer, young lawyer, whom I knew f – whom I met in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s394">And when she came and she saw me – she was working there – when she saw me and ask me what – why I am, you know, ti – my suit was full of holes because, you know, ghetto was burning and on the top – on the attics were most of the feathers, so there was –</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Flying down?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Flying down and was making holes in everything.</span> <span id="s397">So she went and she brought a new – not a new, but a good one, jacket for me and Dr. Fenigstein.</span> <span id="s398">And I remember this exactly, I cannot recall her name.</span> <span id="s399">He doesn’t remember – he didn’t remember this.</span> <span id="s400">Now, I don’t think that I made up this story, because I remember even who was it, I cannot remember the name.</span> <span id="s401">I see her, I see him, even.</span> <span id="s402">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Did you work in Lublin?</span> <span id="s404">What did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: No, no, this – we were – only this was a all transition to send into different camps.</span> <span id="s406">And I remember only that we had the inspection.</span> <span id="s407">Again the Germans came and picked up 600 guys.</span> <span id="s408">And with the help of Dr. Fenigstein I passed because he opened, and m-my eyes were open, the left eye was open too, and I was among the 600 together with him, and – and again is a story which I remember, he remembers only partially, that when the 600 of us were there, the guys who were working, and there were Jews who used to be in the Polish army, they told us if we leave the gate and we’ll go straight, then we’re going for – they will finish us.</span> <span id="s409">If they will – will – will pass the gate and will turn to the right, it means we are shipped to the other camp.</span> <span id="s410">So this time I thought that this friend, this doctor told me, let’s stay on the outside, so in case they taking us straight, we’ll go up there – because they told us, do whatever you’re doing when you go inside, because you’re going for finish.</span> <span id="s411">And he doesn’t – didn’t remember, I don’t remember exactly, but anyway it was not important because we came out and we turned around.</span> <span id="s412">I am sitting here, so we didn’t go straight and we didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s413">Came a guy by the name of Flaggs(ph), whom I wouldn’t recognize except that I remember very w-well the name, and took us to the first camp, labor camp, which was Budzyn.</span> <span id="s414">And if you want, because I have right here this box, which my friend was engraving when we were there, and this was Budzyn, if we can read here, was on April 30th, 1943, and we were there til February 14, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: What kind of work did you do there?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Now, when we came there, this is funny story, when we came there, I didn’t do anything because I went right away to hospital.</span> <span id="s417">And – and they decided that I have – surprisingly, that I have a malaria, this German – Au-Austrian doctor, Dr. Firsten(ph).</span> <span id="s418">I remember him because after the war, again, he became the Red Cross doctor in Vienna.</span> <span id="s419">He told me when I came out from hospital, after few days, I don’t remember, or a week, he told me not to get scared when I will feel bad, because I am coming back because usually repeats, and that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s420">But I know that whenever – how long I was in the camp, when I woke up, I asked the male nurse who was there, who – with whom I became later friendly, I ask him, where is the men’s room?</span> <span id="s421">And he said to me, you are going every day, so why are you asking me?</span> <span id="s422">I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s423">He told me all my life’s story because supposedly I was talking.</span> <span id="s424">Really, I went, after a few days, working again, this time working, going to.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: What kind of –</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: And what we were doing?</span> <span id="s427">Now, when we came to this camp, Budzyn, they told us not to admit that you have a free profession, except dentists and doctors.</span> <span id="s428">I wasn't a dentist, I wasn’t a doctor, so everybody else should say that he is a locksmith.</span> <span id="s429">Now, I never saw, in my te – I never held in my hand [indecipherable] but locksmith.</span> <span id="s430">So there were few hundred locksmiths.</span> <span id="s431">And the next day they told us to clean the roof.</span> <span id="s432">That’s was the locksmiths.</span> <span id="s433">Anyway, they didn’t believe it that being a Polish locksmith, we know what means locksmith, so they get us umschalag(ph).</span> <span id="s434">It means a school again, and I this time, first time in my life I knew what means [indecipherable], I knew what is a [indecipherable] and I knew how to make it.</span> <span id="s435">This was made there.</span> <span id="s436">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: What were your living conditions like?</span> <span id="s438">Where were you living?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Were living in barracks, sleeping on the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s440">I think we had [indecipherable] one next to the other.</span> <span id="s441">What I remember from this time, I remember only most of it.</span> <span id="s442">I remember that the whole night I was running only to urinate, you know, that’s what it was, because I decided one thing, food was not enough.</span> <span id="s443">Again, I’m talking only about myself.</span> <span id="s444">But I wouldn’t sell my bread.</span> <span id="s445">I was a smoker, and I wouldn’t smoke.</span> <span id="s446">I wouldn’t buy bread because I didn’t have money.</span> <span id="s447">I wouldn’t sell my bread either.</span> <span id="s448">So I stopped smoking and I was drinking plenty, like everybody was doing.</span> <span id="s449">Guys who were selling the bread for cigarettes were falling, you know, swelling and dying.</span> <span id="s450">And – and I survived.</span> <span id="s451">Was one slice of bread for a day, and not a big slice, and bread was awful.</span> <span id="s452">But I shouldn’t say this because I met in this camp a client of mine from before the war, who always, I remember him as a sick man, he had the ulcers, and rich fellow, but suffering terrible, all kinds of medication.</span> <span id="s453">And I am talking about before 1939, even America didn’t have too much medication of ulcers li – today we have miracles [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s454">And in the camp he suddenly didn’t have any ulcers.</span> <span id="s455">This bread, he would eat as much as possible, and he didn’t have any ulcers.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: What was the – what was a typical day like?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Getting up very early in the morning, get together for counting outside.</span> <span id="s458">Getting a cup of the cold coffee, dirty water and this time you got the slice of bread, which I, on the beginning I was breaking to eat half on the beginning and half later until they stole this other half, so I was eating, finishing completely.</span> <span id="s459">And this was not a bad camp to compare with the other camps.</span> <span id="s460">And then, together we were marching to the factory, which was not far away, by the name of Heinkel(ph).</span> <span id="s461">They were preparing the people for making planes later, which in other camps I was working on planes, which – we didn’t suffer, but Germans suffered because no one plane took off.</span> <span id="s462">And we, in my opinion, we didn’t do this with purpose, we just didn't know how to do it.</span> <span id="s463">And if anybo – End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: – talking about your staying in Budzyn and working in the factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Yes, after – this is an – every day the same story repeating, and when it comes, you know, to conditions, as I said before, were awful, people were dying because this was one of the camps, this was so-called labor camp, not concentration camp yet, and I am talking now because – about this Budzyn because from experience of the other camps which I had later, they were not used – we were not used to these conditions.</span> <span id="s466">Example, I was dreaming always about a pair of underwear.</span> <span id="s467">Socks.</span> <span id="s468">I was dreaming all the time in all the concentration camps, I was dreaming about potatoes, I don’t know why not bread, but potatoes.</span> <span id="s469">Now, we can – we came to one day, they picked up in – in Budzyn – let me only recall what was the reason.</span> <span id="s470">Oh, they call – pick up a group of people to send to different camp.</span> <span id="s471">And we didn’t know – anyway, I didn't know this time that they are – they decided already to change Budzyn for concentration camp.</span> <span id="s472">I wasn’t there when they changed.</span> <span id="s473">I was sent with the group to Mielitz(ph).</span> <span id="s474">And this was, looking in on my box here – excuse me.</span> <span id="s475">Mielitz(ph) was February 16 to – ’44 to July 24, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: How did you get from one place to the other?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: Oh, the ba – definitely by trains again, the same ones, but not as bad as was from Warsaw to Lublin or from Lublin to Budzyn was a little bit better then.</span> <span id="s478">This was not as bad, but the same crowd and the same kind of trains.</span> <span id="s479">And we arrived in Mieletz(ph) and we got a lousy welcome.</span> <span id="s480">A good welcome from the guy in charge of the camp, the Jewish fellow, but a lousy from other people, because I don’t know why, because not everybody was the fighter on Warsaw ghetto and they called fighters [indecipherable] heroes, and they didn’t like us.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: What was your health like at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: I probably was in excellent condition before I went, because when I – when war was over I was very light, but the UGA(ph) when checked, they found out everything okay, was exceptional.</span> <span id="s483">One left eye – and I thought that this – and this was not, because if this, then the right eye would be wrong, but that’s [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s484">No, this – this was not on my mind never, and as a matter of fact, answering this question, all my years in the camp, I don’t compare to the way my wife went through not being in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s485">Because I had my number, I had my yellow and blue Jewish star on then, this was showing that I am a Jewish communist, because all Jews had this, and the number.</span> <span id="s486">And I knew that not today, so would be tonight, or tomorrow, this is the end, but I am – I was myself, I was always myself.</span> <span id="s487">She never was herself.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Did you always wear your – your star?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Yes, yeah, because I – the sign we were wearing only when was concentration camp.</span> <span id="s490">Mielitz(ph) was changed to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s491">That’s what we got, those two letters, which means concentrations lager.</span> <span id="s492">And we found out later that this was under the Dachau.</span> <span id="s493">Everything from then, from Mielitz(ph) we’re going, including that we went to Dachau itself, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: So you got to Mielitz(ph) and –</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: To Mielitz(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: – in February.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: In Mielitz(ph) – in Mielitz(ph) we were working again in a factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: What kind of factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: Th – everything was prepared for war.</span> <span id="s500">As a matter of fact, again I need to go to ex – my experience.</span> <span id="s501">I supposed to drill on an electric drill press, to drill one of the pieces on an angle.</span> <span id="s502">And being later here in United States in the metal business, which I was, and I will come back later to you, how the life is playing tricks on us, I was – I broke one of the bits.</span> <span id="s503">Now when you usually were getting five bits and one broke, you were going to – for more, which again, one of us was there and was giving you not markings, so this way they didn’t find out how many were broke.</span> <span id="s504">But when I broke this piece, the piece was spoiled, because you couldn’t get this half of the bits back.</span> <span id="s505">So I took out and I didn’t know that the Germans were staying behind me.</span> <span id="s506">When I took out this he says, you spoiled the piece.</span> <span id="s507">So I needed to pull my hands, and he was giving me five whip on the right and wi – five of left.</span> <span id="s508">And this cracked.</span> <span id="s509">And you would say bad, right?</span> <span id="s510">No, this was not bad, this was good because I was sent to the camp and in the camp the doctor put the stitches; 12, I think, stitches he put, and the – I was sent back to the camp – to the factory.</span> <span id="s511">When I came there, there were Germans, they knew everything.</span> <span id="s512">One hand, two hands, three hands, one leg.</span> <span id="s513">They send me to machine which is working only with one hand.</span> <span id="s514">But then they came and they said, who knows how to write and read?</span> <span id="s515">And again everybody is afraid, but I had only one hand, so I picked up, I know how to read and write.</span> <span id="s516">To hell with it, what wa – wi-will be, will be.</span> <span id="s517">And they send me into a room which was sitting a German at the desk and he was a – a draftsman.</span> <span id="s518">And he told me that – and bu – I forgot to say only that in school my foreign language was German, so I could talk, and he told me that he will show me how to make – to become a draftsman, and will be his helper.</span> <span id="s519">Now, I don’t know if he was provoking me or not, but every morning when I was coming there, there was a sandwich, I think a sandwich in the paper, and he never said that I should take it, but I never took it.</span> <span id="s520">So this – that my hand was hit and I got the stitches, was only help me that I was in a clean place.</span> <span id="s521">He permitted me even to wash my shirt, and to dry there and then to put again on, and he ti – taught me how to be a draftsman.</span> <span id="s522">Not only to be a draftsman, but German draftsmen needed to make on the machines the first piece, so he taught me even how to work on the machine.</span> <span id="s523">From there this – this camp was changed to concentration camp, as I said before, and we got the letters and we got the concentration camp uniforms, in Mielitz(ph).</span> <span id="s524">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: What – what month was that, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: Now what month was this?</span> <span id="s527">I will not be able to tell you because I told you how long we were in Mielitz(ph) –</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: Right, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: – and then we were – this was not long before leaving Mielitz(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: And this time we are already in concentration camp, Mielitz(ph) changed to concentration camp, and of course –</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: And how did the conditions change when it became –</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: How we felt the condition changed?</span> <span id="s534">I think – because again, is something, what happened, which I told you on the beginning, never was a hero, was a coward, I couldn’t – this is only one army, the German army that I cannot recognize what –</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A2: Rank.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: – they are officers, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Rank, the rank.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: – rank, never, never could.</span> <span id="s539">I know everythi – everybody’s else’s, I couldn’t recognize.</span> <span id="s540">Russian is very hard, but I got it.</span> <span id="s541">But here – or my head doesn’t want to remember, or I couldn’t remember this way, no faces.</span> <span id="s542">Now, I think that the – number one, that we got electric wires around the camp.</span> <span id="s543">I think this time we got, which was not too good for us, not only because nobody was running away, but the guy in charge, this SS man had the horse there, outside the camp, and the horse once, fly or something bother, and he started to kick, and kicked the fence, and dropped dead.</span> <span id="s544">So we were suffering because we killed the horse, so when you want to know about the conditions – I think the change was also that instead of – of guys, special army, SS came in and they were in charge of the camp.</span> <span id="s545">But other ways the conditions were similar ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Still the one piece of bread a day?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Yes, the same, that’s almost the same, didn’t change.</span> <span id="s548">Not that I recall.</span> <span id="s549">From Mielitz(ph), as already, we went to Wieliczka.</span> <span id="s550">I remember now, I think that Wieliczka, which were not too long there.</span> <span id="s551">We were from July 25th, to August first, so what was this, a week?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: A week.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: Something like this.</span> <span id="s554">We were there and from there we were sent to Flossenbürg, I don’t remember if Flossenbürg was Germany or Austria, but anyway we went to F-Flossenbürg, and we were there – the trip was quite long.</span> <span id="s555">Now – now – now I don’t recall here – you see, he made a mistake here and he crossed out this, and here is li – written that on September four, we came to Flossenbürg.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Do you remember –</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: And I don’t remember if we left Flossenbürg, because he has only one date, September 4th, 1944 li – Flossenbürg.</span> <span id="s558">Flossenbürg was a very different camp.</span> <span id="s559">No other camp that I ever was, was the same.</span> <span id="s560">The – first, was in the mountains, and was in a different levels of the – of the mountains.</span> <span id="s561">On the very top were Americans prisoners of war, on the very top.</span> <span id="s562">Now, we were, when we came there, they first, they undressed us and they changed the – the places, so if you had something you hide – was hiding, you lost, because they took you naked to the other place.</span> <span id="s563">We got the shower and then they gave you a potato sack.</span> <span id="s564">And everybo-body needed to go to sleep in this potato – I was sure that this is the end probably, he will – we’ll go to the potato sack and this will be the end, but no.</span> <span id="s565">And the next day they gave us clean uniforms and we were there, we were not doing anything in Flossenbürg.</span> <span id="s566">Every day was only to get up, to counted that – that we were – that’s what – probably what he wrote to Flossenbürg, that we were very short time, and probably days only.</span> <span id="s567">And floss – Flossenbürg we were sent to Leitmeritz.</span> <span id="s568">And I am almost positive that Leitmeritz was in aus – Austria, not – not in Germany.</span> <span id="s569">And there we were from July 10 – no, no, no, wait a second, June – that’s right, no, August 10 – how can be September there and August 10 to October 1944 in Leitmeritz.</span> <span id="s570">Leitmeritz, Leitmeritz, Leitmeritz is not far away from, because we heard about, was from this show camp –</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A2: Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s573">And I think Theresienstadt was not in Germany, right, this was Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: So this was Austria too.</span> <span id="s576">And in Leitmeritz I have a very funny experience, that I was sent once by the guy in charge of our group to pick up the bread, you know, for – for everybody.</span> <span id="s577">S-So many guys were sent, and I came there and the guys who were giving out the bread was talking Polish.</span> <span id="s578">And so I turned to them and I started to talk to them.</span> <span id="s579">And one of them walk away, comes to me and he says, where are you from?</span> <span id="s580">And I was used this time, being so many years in Warsaw to say from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s581">And he says oh, so not you, because you remind me somebody.</span> <span id="s582">I said, not from Kielce?</span> <span id="s583">He says yes.</span> <span id="s584">And he not only get me the bread, for everybody, but he also put the package of salami, which not only I ate, everybody, and everybody got sick.</span> <span id="s585">Okay, so this where my [indecipherable] Flossenbürg – Leitmeritz, excuse me.</span> <span id="s586">In Leitmeritz – what would bring Leitmeritz?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: Were you working there?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: I always wor-working.</span> <span id="s589">Experience was –</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A2: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: – I seen a – the [indecipherable] were almost that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: There were so many of them.</span> <span id="s593">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: I don’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: [indecipherable] Do you ever – do you remember ever being terribly, terribly frightened up to the –</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: I was always frightened.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: What were your thoughts?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A2: About suicide [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: Because you see, as I told you before, I knew it.</span> <span id="s600">Said any day will come the end.</span> <span id="s601">I didn’t know only how.</span> <span id="s602">And if I am not wrong, this was Leitmeritz even.</span> <span id="s603">In Leitmeritz, in our barracks specially, were quite few Yugoslavs.</span> <span id="s604">And very often, when you got up in the morning, one of the Yugoslav was hanging, suicide.</span> <span id="s605">From my experience, the nicest people with whom I was in the camp, were the Yugoslavs.</span> <span id="s606">Maybe because of language was similar and maybe of their behavior and maybe because of this experience, that I didn’t come across in concentration camp, of suicides committed by anybody else but Yugoslavs.</span> <span id="s607">And I promise myself, this time I thought so, said when – I will not fall asleep.</span> <span id="s608">Only I will be waiting, and if I will see that somebody’s doing, I will follow and I will do the same.</span> <span id="s609">A funny story, when I didn’t fall asleep, I was tired the next day and nobody did commit suicide.</span> <span id="s610">But when I did fall asleep, somebody did.</span> <span id="s611">So what I figure out, probably when I heard the noises that somebody’s trying to commit, being a coward, I fall asleep.</span> <span id="s612">I-I’m not joking, but probably that’s how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: When you were in these different camps, how aware were you of what else was happening in the rest?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: On the beginning I knew, when I was in the – in Budzyn, even Mielitz(ph), Wieliczka, sometimes we got some news.</span> <span id="s615">As a matter of fact in Budzyn I got the news from my brother-in-law that my sister was arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A2: Now this was Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: Because these are all Polish –</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: As a matter of fact, I got to the sister of this Dr. Fenigstein, who was playing a Aryan, brought money from my brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s620">So we had – later we didn’t.</span> <span id="s621">We were getting some news.</span> <span id="s622">How they were coming, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s623">I think that the first real news what was going out, we got in Dachau.</span> <span id="s624">Then later, after the war I found out that they had the underground.</span> <span id="s625">But then we got what is going on, and Dachau was already –</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: But we’re still in Leitmeritz, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: Yes, Leitmeritz.</span> <span id="s628">No, Leitmeritz we didn't know.</span> <span id="s629">We knew only – Leitmeritz we got only news that Theresienstadt is not far away.</span> <span id="s630">That there is better, but nobody was sent there.</span> <span id="s631">And as a matter of fact, in Leitmeritz, and I read here what he wrote there, that friends were someplace when – and I thought that in Leitmeritz this was, but it’s not – he – he wrote in some place that our friends – because there were two camps, and you see, very often when the groups were sent to different camps, there were at least to two different camps.</span> <span id="s632">And you could switch, you could go from one to the other because I don’t think that they did care really, if x,y,z went to one camp, even that they were release, because the – most of the release were not completed because people were dead already by this time, or that they did care which ones are going.</span> <span id="s633">So if you moved from one group to the other group, they didn’t make a issue of it.</span> <span id="s634">And I’m saying this because I am holding in my hand this box which this Greenstein(ph) made, and he was there, young fellow, he was probably four or five years younger than I was, and had even younger brother and wherever I went he was saying he wants to go to and I – in Leitmeritz especially, I remember that we’re choosing and I said boy like that’s enough it’s enough.</span> <span id="s635">Maybe I am picking up the wor – the bad camp and you will suffer because you follow me.</span> <span id="s636">Don’t.</span> <span id="s637">But he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: And so, from Flossenbürg, we went –</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Leitmer –</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: – to Leitmeritz.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: And then from –</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: And Leitmeritz we went to Grakow(ph).</span> <span id="s644">Now, I don’t remember [indecipherable] – to Dachau, first to Dachau.</span> <span id="s645">And in Dachau we were from 23 to 29 of October ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: And from there –</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: What – do you remember that week?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: Dachau yes, I remember.</span> <span id="s650">I remember the first, I will never forget in my life, on the gate was written Arbeit macht frei.</span> <span id="s651">And the – Horthy(ph) was on the – on the gate, the gardener there.</span> <span id="s652">He was one in the uniform.</span> <span id="s653">I don’t know even who showed us that this is Horthy(ph), but when we came here – and the other experience was that they were keeping us outside on the – you know, not going to the barracks.</span> <span id="s654">Before we enter even, they kept us for 12 hours with the toilets, you know, on the field, because they thought that maybe people will – could hide something, you know, that – that – so they had all worked out scientific – scientifically.</span> <span id="s655">And then we were sent and I – if you saying about Dachau these few days, I remember only that that guy in charge of this barrack, which welcome us, was number red triangle, which means he was a communist and had number 999.</span> <span id="s656">He was in the Dachau since 1933.</span> <span id="s657">German, older guy, beautiful spoken, welcome us and told us that every guy, we get two covers.</span> <span id="s658">And please, when you will be leaving, I beg you, leave this too.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: The blankets.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: The blankets [indecipherable] ghetto.</span> <span id="s661">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: Were you still – you were still wearing your Jewish star all this ti –</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Di – di – always you had this triangle and the number, which was changing from camp to camp.</span> <span id="s664">As a matter of fact, I never remember my number.</span> <span id="s665">I remember what I was wearing, and I had to remember, because from quite long time, and I think I met him in Mielitz(ph) but I got very close with him in Augsburg, or someplace there, was a deaf mute fellow, an excellent tailor, excellent.</span> <span id="s666">As a matter of fact, in the camps he was getting extra bread from Germans because he was fixing their uniforms.</span> <span id="s667">He – he was a artist.</span> <span id="s668">And whenever they were – we’re called, he couldn’t hear his name, his number, so what I was, and I could talk with him by hands.</span> <span id="s669">I don’t know language, but my hands, I could talk to him.</span> <span id="s670">So I pushed him when his number was called.</span> <span id="s671">And he was just deciding, if they said right and he wanted to go left, he played dumb and he went left.</span> <span id="s672">So he was choosing, and he survived the war, too.</span> <span id="s673">Now –</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: What – what – what else did you do in Dachau?</span> <span id="s675">Did you do any work in that week, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: No, Dachau was only, we were in this barrack, only few si-sis – you know, few days and from Dachau we’re sent for work to – first was Augsburg.</span> <span id="s677">In the Augsburg, believe or not, we were staying outside, out of the city, in suburbs, and every morning we were walking through the city of Augsburg to the other side of [indecipherable] preparing for a airport, for future airport.</span> <span id="s678">And I don’t know if this was really for the airport, that’s what they were calling.</span> <span id="s679">We were doing stupid things, digging and closing and filling and – and – and – and – and nothing, nothing productive, but that’s what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: How long were you in Augsburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: In – in – in Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: No, in Augsburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: In Augsburg we were from October 29 to December first of 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: And then from Augsburg we were sent to Leonberg.</span> <span id="s686">Leonberg.</span> <span id="s687">Do you think that I remember now Leonberg?</span> <span id="s688">I don’t remember Leonberg too good because I know – I remember that from – how long we were in Leonberg?</span> <span id="s689">We were in from December – December first, the same day.</span> <span id="s690">So you see, Augsburg and Leonberg are very close to each other because the same day we were there.</span> <span id="s691">Til ’44 – til February of ’45, only two months.</span> <span id="s692">So again probably – again doing nothing – not – nothing important, nothing productive, no more was building the planes or something, that’s what I recall.</span> <span id="s693">Then we were sent again to Kaufering, which everyth – every single one, Augsburg, Nuremberg, Kaufering, lager one, lager two and Landau and Ganacker, these are all camps of Dachau, which was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s694">And I don’t recall doing anything except few – few experiences again which you had the example, in one of this Kaufering lagers, a guy wanted to – was walking too close to the fence, wire fence, electric wire fence, probably because somebody was throwing something.</span> <span id="s695">I was not a hero like I told you before, I wouldn’t bother cross, and the gar – guy on the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: Tower?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: Tower, sh – did the shoot in his direction and hit his testicles.</span> <span id="s698">And he grabbed the testicles and run to this male nurse and he never knew what to do with that, and he put plenty of bandages around, and few hours later we deci – they decided that we changing the camp and going.</span> <span id="s699">And that guy was suffering, but this was shortly before the end of it.</span> <span id="s700">Americans came and they operated him.</span> <span id="s701">And as a matter of fact, we met him after the war, he was not only married, but he had children too.</span> <span id="s702">What else?</span> <span id="s703">Other camp, one vo – one of the lager, two, during the night, we were in the barracks which different – you know, digged out from in the ground and on the roof above, and not too many guys, maybe 12 guys in one of this.</span> <span id="s704">And during the night this – that mute guy w – was shaking me, I woke up in dark.</span> <span id="s705">I was asking what is it, and he showed me that we’ll be going.</span> <span id="s706">Now, nobody heard this.</span> <span id="s707">He was right, and we were going to other camp.</span> <span id="s708">This was one of the very end.</span> <span id="s709">We went to Kaufering.</span> <span id="s710">The name was – this was April fourth.</span> <span id="s711">And this is already 1945, so this is just – just before the end of the war, and we were in lager – lager one, lager two.</span> <span id="s712">If you want to hear – this not about me, but about the guys who were in the camp with me.</span> <span id="s713">You know, in one of the camps, Americans came down and were shooting around the camp because around the camp the Germans put the small planes, and the Americans found out about this, so they came down and they were shooting from inside the camp, not to hit us, to the planes, and the planes went on fire.</span> <span id="s714">And the guys from the camp used this to cook something on the belly the planes.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: So was this where you were liberated from?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: Yeah, this is the experience of – the last one was Ganacker, and in Ganacker one day – it was Landau or Ganacker, was one day and they decided the whole camp, wh-which if I am not wrong were close to a thousand of guys, oh, to take us, and the Germans said that we’re going to Landshut.</span> <span id="s717">You probably heard about, this was quite the camp too, and the specific camp, because when I was in Dachau the chimneys were not working, it means they were not burning anybody.</span> <span id="s718">But Landshut was still working.</span> <span id="s719">W-We knew that is active.</span> <span id="s720">And they were supposed to transport us walking there.</span> <span id="s721">On the way, on a big one field, they told us to sit down on the ground.</span> <span id="s722">And few minutes later, they disappeared, their whole group of s-m – SS mans disappeared.</span> <span id="s723">We found ourselves without a guard.</span> <span id="s724">And as I said, thousand people.</span> <span id="s725">And a German fellow, who had that green triangle, green triangle it means he was a killer who was sent from a jail to the concentration camp, that’s what he had, the green one.</span> <span id="s726">Tall one fellow, he told us why he was in jail.</span> <span id="s727">He killed a owner of a villa which he thought that is empty, and he went there and he found him, so was one solution, him or her, or the owner.</span> <span id="s728">So they found him and they sent him back there to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s729">This guy, when he saw that the SS men disappeared, went on a big –</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A2: Podium?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: Not podium, though it was a podium [indecipherable] only pieces of wood and he said to us, look fellows, we are in southern part of Germany, which is called Niederbayern.</span> <span id="s732">This is Catholic part of Germany.</span> <span id="s733">These people hate Hitler and Jews.</span> <span id="s734">That’s what he said.</span> <span id="s735">So from now on, no one is a Jew.</span> <span id="s736">We are Catholics, even when you are Protestants.</span> <span id="s737">Then you will get help from these people.</span> <span id="s738">And now we cannot go thousands, so let’s make small groups and go.</span> <span id="s739">So we made small groups and we decided to go all different ways.</span> <span id="s740">Thousand people and only one fellow, who acted very nicely in all the camps, by the name of Markowski(ph), which was a secretary in few camps, it means he was keeping books and everything, and he was very nice.</span> <span id="s741">He told me that he is a lawyer from the part of Lvov, Poland.</span> <span id="s742">And I remember that in the camp, where we were this time, I needed to say Kaddish after my father.</span> <span id="s743">And I went to him and I said to him – I was very friendly with him, and I said to him that I have a problem.</span> <span id="s744">I need to have 10 Jews to say the Kaddish.</span> <span id="s745">And he looked at me and he says, look, I don’t know Jewish religion, but – you know, I’m not a Jew, but I think that your religion is saying 10 men, not 10 Jews.</span> <span id="s746">Now if you will not ask if somebody is Jew or not, I will call the people and I will say Joseph, it means we are 10 here.</span> <span id="s747">And you go to the window and you do whatever you want.</span> <span id="s748">And so it was.</span> <span id="s749">He decided to take a group of Polacks.</span> <span id="s750">Polacks it means not like us Polacks, only Polacks – Catholics, and I should take a group of 10 Jewish with us, and we will go together.</span> <span id="s751">We went together only for two days.</span> <span id="s752">After two days we had bloody noses.</span> <span id="s753">It started the calling names, and fights.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: Between the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s756">And we needed to split.</span> <span id="s757">He went with his group, we went with our group.</span> <span id="s758">Now, in this time, we’re running away, not knowing we are in Germany, not knowing where we’re running.</span> <span id="s759">We were afraid – we still didn’t know what’s going on, if we will not come against – against SS or whomever.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A2: And everybody thought [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: So we – we decided – we decided to hide during the day and move only in the evenings.</span> <span id="s762">And so we’re doing.</span> <span id="s763">One woman – we came to a place, and we thought that we are safe, then two SS men showed up and they grabbed us and they brought us to a – a farm where they had already few other people, I don’t know if from our ex-camp or different camps.</span> <span id="s764">And in this we were watching and were two entrances.</span> <span id="s765">One was from the left and one was from the right.</span> <span id="s766">And the two SS men were walking around this building, so we could see them where they are on one side, and when they coming on other.</span> <span id="s767">And being next to one guy, I told him, when they will come on this side and they will pass, I am going out this way.</span> <span id="s768">I don’t want to be here any more.</span> <span id="s769">We made a mistake, I want to – and he says, I am going, too.</span> <span id="s770">Before knowing, six of us – ye – one knew about the other, when they came here, we took off, and we run.</span> <span id="s771">I-If you ever saw coward running, we were – we could break all records, until we came to the woods.</span> <span id="s772">After the woods there was a wall, brick wall, we jumped over and we didn’t hear anything any more, and walking.</span> <span id="s773">I told this story because I want to tell you, after the war, when we found ourself again – we, my wife and myself, in this part, in Germany, I took my wife to show her, and I went to the same place, I showed her where are the two doors, and I said on the right door when they were on the left, we run, let’s walk.</span> <span id="s774">And we walk and there was a forest.</span> <span id="s775">And we went through the forest, we came on the end of the forest and there was a brick wall seven feet tall.</span> <span id="s776">And I looked on it and I said no, this was not this.</span> <span id="s777">Probably I made the mistake.</span> <span id="s778">This is the other side, it’s the other door.</span> <span id="s779">I might – no, there was no the other door.</span> <span id="s780">I took all the guys who jumped this wall and they didn’t want, even one wanted to believe that we made this seven foot wall.</span> <span id="s781">She saw it.</span> <span id="s782">It was impossible.</span> <span id="s783">What you could do when you are scared.</span> <span id="s784">And that’s what we run, we were s – hiding me and the other guy, because we split that more and more for safety.</span> <span id="s785">And with the other fellow who didn’t – who survived the war, but we split it after the war because he married a German young girl.</span> <span id="s786">She was younger than the youngest daughter of here would be.</span> <span id="s787">And because of it – so we split it.</span> <span id="s788">We were during the day in the woods and during the night were sleeping at the farmer, who knew that we are hiding because we were [indecipherable] of course.</span> <span id="s789">And one afternoon we were already tired to sit in the woods, we decided it’s not dark yet, but let’s go, cause no movement.</span> <span id="s790">And as we’re walking out from the forest, we see a Jeep on the – on the highway and we stop and the machine gun went to our direction and the soldiers shouting to run.</span> <span id="s791">So we started to run not moving, only run up and down, and I say I am running back to the woods.</span> <span id="s792">And the fellow says, I don’t think that we have a chance.</span> <span id="s793">And we came – we were so scared, that we didn’t see the American star.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: And then you – and then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: Then – this was called freedom.</span> <span id="s796">Few days later, when we got together, a few of our fellows from different hiding places there, from different farmers, we thought that that’s all what is leftover, you know, survivors.</span> <span id="s797">Everybody else died, probably.</span> <span id="s798">So we wanted to know if any Jews are in American army.</span> <span id="s799">So we’re waiting and we’re talking Polish and one of the Polish fellow American, when we ask in Polish if there are any Jews in the American army, he said to me, Jews?</span> <span id="s800">Jews are in – in America making money.</span> <span id="s801">Now, he didn’t know who is his major because the next day was a big sign that they major by this – this name I don’t remember now, American name, wants to see all Jews.</span> <span id="s802">And we said this is the end, we’re not going.</span> <span id="s803">So we had one fellow who knew a little bit English, and we said, he will not grab this one when he knows that there are other ones.</span> <span id="s804">So when he will not come back, it means that to me he wants the Jews.</span> <span id="s805">If he will come back we will know what is about.</span> <span id="s806">No, he came back to tell us that he is a Jew, and he won’t beat you.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: Then you met with the – the – the Jewish officer, American Jewish officer –</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: Oh yes, as a matter of fact –</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: And what happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: – as a matter of fact, he was a major of the army, he was quite touched when he saw quite a group, because I – he was the one who told us that we are not the only one who survived, that there are other guys too.</span> <span id="s811">We were in terrible physical condition.</span> <span id="s812">Terrible I am saying this way, that some of the [indecipherable] were not more in the war, we were free.</span> <span id="s813">When we looked, I could see the – exactly all the bones on the face and of the [indecipherable] especially guy by the name of Ackerman(ph) who few months later – and I am exactly a few months later because we talking we were freed on May 1st, 1945, and on the beginning of 1946, I was back in the same part with my wife already.</span> <span id="s814">And we met this Ackerman(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: So what – what happened right after, after you were free?</span> <span id="s816">Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: We were – right after we were free, the first reaction was from the farmer, that we didn’t admit that we are Jews because we thought that this will be not nice to him that we are playing Catholics to save us, that to – now to – to tease, so we were staying there.</span> <span id="s818">I remember only that he wanted to give us to eat anything he has there and he moved us to his bedroom and he moved out from the bedroom.</span> <span id="s819">Two of us, he put.</span> <span id="s820">And I didn’t want to drink milk.</span> <span id="s821">I was afraid.</span> <span id="s822">I was skinny and I was afraid of fat.</span> <span id="s823">I loved milk, but I was adding water to it, and meat altogether I couldn’t look on it.</span> <span id="s824">So he killed a pigeon and – and – and prepared.</span> <span id="s825">But my friend who didn’t care about and was eating the meat, he survived too, and he – and he was okay.</span> <span id="s826">I was a coward, I was afraid of everything.</span> <span id="s827">And as a matter of fact, I don’t think – I don’t think that I ever admitted to this farmer, small farmer, I never admitted that I am Jewish, even when I came later with my wife to visit him, because I thought he was a nice fellow.</span> <span id="s828">Remember his name even, Markmel(ph).</span> <span id="s829">And – Peter Markmel(ph).</span> <span id="s830">And as a matter of fact, he liked this fellow from concentration camp, this was a green triangle, said that they are – they hate Jews and Hitler.</span> <span id="s831">He hated Hitler, really he hated Hitler.</span> <span id="s832">Ha – about Jews, I never spoke to him about, so I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: Where did you go after you saw the major?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: After – after I felt a little bit stronger, I found out that not far away from [indecipherable] where I was staying, this time I was freed there in Langerfelden(ph), I decided to go to next town, which was [indecipherable] because I heard that there this Markowski(ph), which I told you before, this fellow who was splitted, was preparing the Polish pe-people for repatriation to Poland.</span> <span id="s835">So I wanted to see him.</span> <span id="s836">In funny way I felt that I must go to him and to say that in my opinion, he is a Jew.</span> <span id="s837">And I came there, and I told him.</span> <span id="s838">And he said to me, thank you, but I will to disappoint you, I am not a Jew.</span> <span id="s839">And – but it’s nice of you, because I understand what you mean.</span> <span id="s840">And this was everything what I heard about him.</span> <span id="s841">He ask me also if I’m going to Poland, and I said yes I am going because I need to find out what happened to my family.</span> <span id="s842">And you know, in the beginning I told you that I found my wife, my two nieces and my –</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: So you went – you got back –</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: After I got back to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: How did you get back from where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: By that same train, which was taking the official repatriates, I went with the – the Polack – I went there and I just walked together with them and – but I wasn’t officially coming, but I found myself in Poland.</span> <span id="s847">As I said, I found my wife, I found my two nieces, I fen – found my ex-brother-in-law.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Was this in Warsaw?</span> <span id="s849">Where was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: The – my – the – the story was this way.</span> <span id="s851">My wife, as I mentioned before, she was false papers.</span> <span id="s852">She survived.</span> <span id="s853">She wasn’t as – as – as delicate as I thought she was.</span> <span id="s854">She needed to be strong and she showed that she is a strong woman.</span> <span id="s855">My two nieces were placed with Catholic families.</span> <span id="s856">My brother-in-law found himself in a concentration camp for a short time on the very end.</span> <span id="s857">My sister [indecipherable] he noti – notified me in camp that was arrested – was arrested because she helped him to survive and she was arrested and she was killed also by Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A2: Your other sister, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: My other sister was killed together with my mother, but this was in ghetto.</span> <span id="s860">My brother-in-law was shot.</span> <span id="s861">They were taken to probably Treblinka, which later I figure out.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: How long did you stay then in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: Very short.</span> <span id="s864">I was – was one month alre – A2: No, but [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: – no, no, I pi – I p – I – I remember where we left, because I came September 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A2: In November –</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: And November 11, 1945 we left Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: To go where?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: Because we went in po – End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: Can you tell us something about what happened in Poland after the war was over, between September –</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: – after September 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: Number one, when I came to Warsaw I went to the Jewish Committee, like I said, to find out if anybody survived and I found out there that my two nieces and my brother-in-law were registered.</span> <span id="s874">And – and my wife, which my friend said not – you will not find her in Warsaw, you will find her in Lódz.</span> <span id="s875">And I didn’t look for ne – neither one of the nieces or my brother-in-law, I decided to go to Lódz.</span> <span id="s876">A one hour or two hours trip usually was taking the whole night, or the whole day, whichever you preferred.</span> <span id="s877">I came to Lódz and I lost myself because I didn’t ask this friend of ours what is address of my wife.</span> <span id="s878">So he said to go to Lódz to the Jewish committee.</span> <span id="s879">I just took the train and went back to Warsaw to get the address, and the next night I decided to go back to Lódz.</span> <span id="s880">Now, when I came – A2: But I was under my false name.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: When I came there, knowing the address what I supposed to go, so I came.</span> <span id="s882">This was a second or third floor walkup, of course.</span> <span id="s883">And I saw iron door, because someone had s – before the war even too, safety doors.</span> <span id="s884">Saw two cards on the door.</span> <span id="s885">One was the false one name of my wife and the other was written ell – I. Wokaszevicz(ph), major – M.D., major of Polish mil – military.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A2: Army</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: I looked on it, door was closed, nobody home, I looked on it and I said I came too late.</span> <span id="s888">Because I don’t know, probably from the stories you heard from other people, that the husband were coming to the weddings of – of their wives.</span> <span id="s889">Here wouldn’t be because we’re le – really not – we’re not legally married.</span> <span id="s890">So – and she couldn’t believe that I survived, and she couldn’t – I didn’t believe it that she will.</span> <span id="s891">So I thought better let her think that I am dead, and I turned back and went to these people where I was staying, only – family of my brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s892">And I came back and I told them that I saw this, and was a nice fellow.</span> <span id="s893">So sitting at the – in the evening and having the supper – because you know, we think differently in Europe, the big meal you see in the lunchtime.</span> <span id="s894">So the small meal – he says to me, don’t do it.</span> <span id="s895">You understand and you are honest.</span> <span id="s896">Go, tell her and just say that, bless her and that’s all.</span> <span id="s897">But at least let her know.</span> <span id="s898">I said, this is teasing, and – but I decided to go, later – few hours later I went and the door was open, this – this iron door.</span> <span id="s899">So I knocked at the door.</span> <span id="s900">She came and backed up.</span> <span id="s901">So I said, hey, you made a mistake.</span> <span id="s902">So I thought, turn around and go.</span> <span id="s903">But she says, what you staying, what you waiting?</span> <span id="s904">And I [indecipherable] and I said, who is the Major Doctor?</span> <span id="s905">She says this is Irene [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s906">She wasn’t a doctor, she wasn’t a major.</span> <span id="s907">But she had guts enough that the war – she became later a doctor, M.D.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A2: And she married a Christian and she didn’t tell him anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: But she – this time she already was.</span> <span id="s910">And this time I told my wife, sitting there and telling about how I went and how she went, and I told her, what I went is nothing to compare what you went.</span> <span id="s911">And we decided that Poland is no more place for us.</span> <span id="s912">Warsaw was a cemetery.</span> <span id="s913">Like I told you before when I went to Warsaw because I wanted to see the grave of my father, I couldn’t get in.</span> <span id="s914">So, was only one thing to go.</span> <span id="s915">And to go [indecipherable] officially from Poland, I got to – one, I was nominated as a judge for Breslau Wroclaw.</span> <span id="s916">Second, to get the paper to go to West Germany, when I got nomination and they ask me when I was born, I said this time, Eggenfelden niederbayer.</span> <span id="s917">And the secretary looked at me, I said, don’t look so at me, because I am Polish citizen, only my mother was pregnant when they were in Germany, and I was born there, but my home is really Kielce and I got everything in Kielce.</span> <span id="s918">But when you asking me I need to tell you where was this?</span> <span id="s919">This was, you know, southern part of Germany, that’s where I was born.</span> <span id="s920">I figure myself, I am from – born, and really the birth means so important.</span> <span id="s921">I am going back because my parents, when were in Germany, and they never were, and I was born there, they decided to stay there for awhile and they buy – bought some of real estate.</span> <span id="s922">Now, war is over, I want to sell the real estate, so I want to go there.</span> <span id="s923">So together we left, you know, Warsaw and we were going to Rychbak(ph), this was Rychbak(ph) but through Wroclaw.</span> <span id="s924">And when we came there, we met a fellow who was with me in the concentration camp, but he was working already for the political – A2: Secret service [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: – ta – eff – F.B.I.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: Intelligence –</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: That’s right, Intelligence, Polish Intelligence.</span> <span id="s930">And we were sitting and after awhile talking, talking, he said to me, you know what?</span> <span id="s931">You’re not staying here.</span> <span id="s932">You will not be a judge here.</span> <span id="s933">You want to leave Poland.</span> <span id="s934">I say, I will tell you something, if I cannot tell you the truth, then I will not be able to tell anybody truth, yes I am.</span> <span id="s935">He says, with my blessing.</span> <span id="s936">I will do the same soon.</span> <span id="s937">And I said – and my wife told him experience which we had in Lódz.</span> <span id="s938">Right after I came, and I was very dis – weak this time.</span> <span id="s939">I was in good condition still to compare to everybody, but I was skinny and weak.</span> <span id="s940">We were going and we decided to go to bakery to buy something, cake or bread, I don’t remember and were few steps, as we were reaching this bakery, a Polish drunk, about completely drunk, he couldn’t stay on his feet, was walking down and he recognize right away that I am a Jew and he said oh my God – in Polish, of course, oh my God, I thought that Hitler finish all the Jews, but there are more.</span> <span id="s941">And as weak as I was I grabbed him by the shoulders, and to the wall and my wife behind me, leave him alone, leave him alone.</span> <span id="s942">And I left him alone and she told this guy, and I said I still didn’t forgive her because I should kill him.</span> <span id="s943">And he says wait, hold a second.</span> <span id="s944">You wouldn’t be able to kill him [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s945">Now it depends who would come there.</span> <span id="s946">If I would come I would finish this guy with a gun and not tell you to go, but if this would be a different group and this would not be a Jew, you would be the dead one.</span> <span id="s947">So you didn’t do those stupid things, but that’s what was my welcome.</span> <span id="s948">So Warsaw was a cemetery, Poland was no more for me.</span> <span id="s949">We passed the border and of course I went to this part of Germany which I was free.</span> <span id="s950">Before we stop in the – on the way in Berlin, she got the typhus from the German soldiers who were running away.</span> <span id="s951">I probably went through this in concentration camp, not knowing even about.</span> <span id="s952">And – and we were – we got to spend, because she went to hospital, excuse me, in Berlin.</span> <span id="s953">And then after, in 1946, we got the – because the New Year’s Eve of 1945 we spent still in Berlin.</span> <span id="s954">And a few days later, officially the Americans took us – A2: It was American –</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: – from – because I was born in Germany, so they took us back to Germany and since then we were there, waiting always that we’ll go someplace, and this waiting, waiting was til 1949.</span> <span id="s956">And what – our biggest mistake, especially my, because at least my wife made it up, I didn’t, was that through this five years of being in Germany – A2: Three and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: – we could start – we – four and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A2: Three and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: Oh, three and a half.</span> <span id="s960">We could start anything we wanted, really, to educate ourself again, and I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: Where did you stay between

<p><span id="s984">A: No, as a matter of fact, as a matter of fact, to be honest –</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A2: Less.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: – I became less.</span> <span id="s987">I still don’t understand what I saw, that I could not believe it, that exists a whole – God, because okay, we all are guilty of something doing, but little children, whose head were broken on the wall by Germans, and – and you could be religious after?</span> <span id="s988">No, I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s989">When I came – I was always a Jew, but not religious, until when our son was born and started to grow, I knew that I need to give him religion and the way I feel, I will not help him.</span> <span id="s990">So we decided to join a temple, and we joined a Reform one.</span> <span id="s991">My son always was complaining that my house is not religious enough, his will be more religious.</span> <span id="s992">Now, I don’t know, maybe yes, maybe not.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A2: No, it’s not.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s995">But he is re – a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A2: A believer.</span></p> <p><span

<p><span id="s999">Q: What are the names of your children and when were they born?</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: Harold Koplewicz is my son, physician.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: When was

1959.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: Have you talked to your children about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: Yes, but a little bit different maybe, that I was talking today.</span> <span id="s1010">No, maybe not, maybe the same.</span> <span id="s1011">I wasn’t scaring them.</span> <span id="s1012">I was just telling them, and when they wanted more, I was telling more.</span> <span id="s1013">My son wanted to hear more.</span> <span id="s1014">My daughter didn’t want to hear at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A2: Less.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: S – my son picked up even Polish.</span> <span id="s1017">We didn’t teach him.</span> <span id="s1018">I dream still in Polish.</span> <span id="s1019">I’m not ashamed because this was my language.</span> <span id="s1020">Some people are thinking that this is awful.</span> <span id="s1021">I don’t have anything against language, not even German language.</span> <span id="s1022">I have against German people, not language.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: What did you speak at home, did you sp –</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: Did you speak any –</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: I understood Yiddish, but I didn’t speak Yiddish, I don’t know how to speak today Yiddish, but I understand.</span> <span id="s1027">I’m going to Jewish theater, and I understand.</span> <span id="s1028">I don’t know only how to talk.</span> <span id="s1029">If I talk, I talk German, which is very similar, but it’s not Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1030">But my son picked up Polish, and he – you couldn’t [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1031">My daughter hated every Polish word.</span> <span id="s1032">But still, few months ago she proved – at the table I didn’t want the people to understand what I want, so I turned to my son and I said in Polish that I want him to do.</span> <span id="s1033">And she put the hand, my s – daughter put the hand on him, she got up and she did.</span> <span id="s1034">When she came back I said, Edie, you’re not supposed to understand.</span> <span id="s1035">She says, I understood.</span> <span id="s1036">So it probably is.</span> <span id="s1037">I know definitely that she is also Jewish, because – A2: She is from Jewish mother, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: But anyway, anyway, my son is probably – no, tradition I – I think I am as much as him, maybe even a little bit more, even that we don’t light the candles on Friday and they do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: Does the war still affect you?</span> <span id="s1040">Your experi – you experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: Yes, I would say yes.</span> <span id="s1042">I will say yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: The best way to say that yes, our son wanted to come with us here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A2: Oh, he was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: Because he was feeling that is [indecipherable] especially we didn’t see the museum and he told us not to see before.</span> <span id="s1047">Yes.</span> <span id="s1048">You know, I always had the insight.</span> <span id="s1049">Me.</span> <span id="s1050">Didn’t come out until I didn’t fight for a bread in this country.</span> <span id="s1051">When I had already bread and butter, it came back.</span> <span id="s1052">And I went for help.</span> <span id="s1053">I went to – to a psychiatrist.</span> <span id="s1054">I was on – had how many months I don’t remember, sessions.</span> <span id="s1055">And one day he told me that he cannot help me any more, and any time I want to come back, I can come.</span> <span id="s1056">My son, who started as a pediatrician change and he became child psychiatrist, and he’s well known psychiatrist, not only in New York, but also Washington.</span> <span id="s1057">And so he understood that this will be hard, but we decided that we’ll do it.</span> <span id="s1058">And like I said on the beginning, I am doing this not only for them, but specially that are still people today who are saying this didn’t exist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: Is there anything else that you would like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: Anything you want to share.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: That many, many times I was thinking about people who are saying that we should forget and forgive.</span> <span id="s1063">Now, when it comes to forgive, maybe if they would act differently.</span> <span id="s1064">If they would come [indecipherable] and specially that the young ones who were not active and say our fathers, our grandfathers, brothers, uncles, did shame – we are not responsible for it, but it shouldn’t repeat, maybe this time I will say we should forgive them.</span> <span id="s1065">But forget?</span> <span id="s1066">Even that my wife in 1948 said that maybe Israel became independent country because we lost our dear ones.</span> <span id="s1067">It’s not enough.</span> <span id="s1068">I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s1069">Really, I am not [indecipherable] to crying, I am not.</span> <span id="s1070">I think that that’s will be everything.</span> <span id="s1071">I will tell you something, going back to this box, I will try to get the picture and then to leave this with – send back to here – here.</span> <span id="s1072">You see, this was my last will.</span> <span id="s1073">As I told you, I never believed that my wife or my sisters, or this –</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: You want to read what it says?</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: – here was put, in Polish was put, to deliver to my
