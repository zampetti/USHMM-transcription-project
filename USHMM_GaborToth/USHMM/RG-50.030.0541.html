First of all, thank you very, very much, Lili, for agreeing to talk to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Answer: My pleasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: We know that this is not about the easiest of topics, and we’re very grateful that you’ve agreed to share your story with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: It’s fine, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: You’re welcome.</span> <span id="s16">Let’s start li – where we always start, and where they say in the fairly tales, too, let’s start at the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Can you tell us a little bit about who you are as a child: when you were born, the date you were born, the family you were born into, and we’ll take it from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s20">I was born in 1938, June 2nd, 1938, in Iaşi, Romania.</span> <span id="s21">And we all lived in a courtyard, the whole family, cousins.</span> <span id="s22">I have a brother, his name is Morris, and my mom and dad.</span> <span id="s23">And my dad was a tailor, but he was a designer, and we were quite comfortably well off in Iaşi.</span> <span id="s24">And I believe at the time that war broke out, which was, I think I was four years old, and there was a lot of commotion out in the backyard; meaning actually the front part of this courtyard where about four of our family, different families lived; which grandparents usually just buy a house and continue to build so the family can stay together.</span> <span id="s25">And this commotion started, and my grandma –</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Can I stop right there?</span> <span id="s27">We’re still gonna talk about family at this moment, before the war breaking out.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: I’d like a few more details.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Is the – was this courtyard in the building where your family lived, was it in in the middle of a town, li – in Iaşi, or was it over to the side, was it a suburban area?</span> <span id="s32">How would you describe that?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: I would – the little bit of memory I have of it is, it was more on the side, it definitely wasn’t in the main city.</span> <span id="s34">Iaşi is a very small shtetl, which is like a little town, and it was definitely in the farmer part, very rural.</span> <span id="s35">And my cousins, my grandmother – my grandfather wasn’t alive when I was born, and my grandmother lived in one of the houses, and I’m not sure if one of the cousins lived with her.</span> <span id="s36">Then there were other cousins.</span> <span id="s37">And I – my memory serves me, we – there had to be about four or five families.</span> <span id="s38">My –</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: All related to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: All related.</span> <span id="s41">And we lived in this courtyard that apparently, before my time, I guess my grandparents built this, and just kept on expanding as people got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: But it wasn’t farming country, it wasn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: It wasn’t farming country.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: – farming country.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: On the side there were farms, but we weren’t into farming.</span> <span id="s46">I believe my grandfather, who I never had a chance to meet, was a fisherman.</span> <span id="s47">Very well-to-do and very well acknowledged in the community, which my mother always told me he had a great big monument that was dedicated to him.</span> <span id="s48">I never had the pleasure of meeting him.</span> <span id="s49">We, I remember, lived in the front part, whether we were the last family, or my mother was yul – the youngest to get married, and I think she was, that’s where we lived, and my father, being a tailor, worked out of the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: So it sounds like – it sounds like you lived in either a small town or a village, but in – inside the village, rather than i-in the ac – in a really rural are – areas.</span> <span id="s51">When you’re a tailor –</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Oh, I would say inside, yes –</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: When you’re a tailor, then you have clients that come on the main street, or a side street, and they come with their – their – their –</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: But he wasn’t just a tailor my father, he really – some people use patterns, he made his own pattern, and that’s – that’s another part of later on in the story.</span> <span id="s57">And he actually designed women’s coats.</span> <span id="s58">So it was, you know, out of the house, and he had a couple people working for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: So it’s like a dressmakers’ shop.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: Exactly, not so much female – both, but mostly coats.</span> <span id="s61">Coats, jackets.</span> <span id="s62">And I remember as young as I was, which I had to be about four years old, that’s when my memory serves me, is I remember my grandmother took care of both my brother and myself.</span> <span id="s63">My brother Morris is two years older than I am.</span> <span id="s64">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: That was one of my questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Yes, and my grandmother, who was well in her, I would say 80’s, who was more like a mother, she really brought us up, because my mother worked with my dad, and there were other workers; so they obviously were well off enough, cause there was help.</span> <span id="s67">But we were taken care of by my grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Do you remember your father in the shop at all, or do –</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Oh, absolutely, I could –</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: What kind of me – what kind of memories come to your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: About my father?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: About your parents, their working in the shop.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: My mother was slim, pretty, fortunately did not, and later on in the story I’ll explain, did not look Jewish, which is what saved us.</span> <span id="s74">My dad – I resemble my dad more than my mom – was just – I – in my eyes just a wonderful, kind, very gentle with us.</span> <span id="s75">And he – he – they were busy, but my dad was never too busy to pay attention, to myself especially, being the girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Well, you were the little girl, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s78">And the cousins I remember as young – going way back in my memory, my favorite place at the time, from what I’m told, and I do remember is the play – the house must have been up on stilts or something, because the kids played underneath, in the dirt.</span> <span id="s79">And my cousins and I, that’s what I remember wa – we’re going way back, and my mother and my dad and my brother reminded me that that’s where we loved to play, in the mud underneath.</span> <span id="s80">And my cousins loved to throw stones, and a couple of times actually cracked my head, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: And boy, did they get into trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: – being that Romanians are Gypsies, my mother had her theories about certain, I guess holistic, or whatever.</span> <span id="s83">If you have a wound on your head, you get bread and vinegar and put it on the wound.</span> <span id="s84">And those things I remember being told to me because that’s how it affected my brain.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Well, did you – do you remember having a – you know, th-the bump on your head , do you –</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Oh yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: And I reconnected this way back with my cousins who are the only ones who survived in Israel, and reminded me that that’s what he did, and very happy about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: But that’s about where it – it stops, til war.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: And do – was this then your world, the world of the courtyard, your family –</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Absol –</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: – your mother and father, nobody outside.</span> <span id="s94">Or did you have a sense of neighbors, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Yes, there –</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: – Gentiles, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: – there were – it’s funny you said, next door there were Gentiles, and now – how I happened to know, and I don’t want to go ahead with the Holocaust, or the beginning, or the bombing, is my mom, who used to wear a babushka on her head, and my dad was always busy with – the measuring tape was always around him, and he always had a scissor in his hand – my neighbor – our neighbors were of – not of the Jewish faith, because when things started, my mother – I don’t know if you want me to go into that now, that’s – that’s the next part I remember is suddenly there was a lot of commotion, and I don’t remember exactly how it happened, but I know we had to put on – my grandma told me we have to put on this yellow band with the Jewish star.</span> <span id="s98">And the neighbors next door, that part I remember, were just looking at us.</span> <span id="s99">And I was young, and my – my mother didn’t look Jewish, and my father was taken out with a lot of other men, and there were guns and things, and thi – all I remember th – my grandmother taking my head, and hiding it in –</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: In her stomach.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: – her apron.</span> <span id="s102">And I remember my mother saying, and I remember hating her that, don’t kill him, don’t shoot the Jew.</span> <span id="s103">I’ll take care of the Jew in my own way.</span> <span id="s104">The neighbors knew she was Jewish, but thank God they didn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Say anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: – say anything.</span> <span id="s107">And this is one memory I really don’t want to remember, but the next thing was, all of a sudden I peeked out from my grandmother, and there was this woman yelling don’t, please don’t.</span> <span id="s108">And I remember she had a fat belly.</span> <span id="s109">And they shot, something came out of her belly, and I remember a – it was a – a fetus.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: It was a baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: And I remember her just yelling, I couldn’t understand this – I’m sorry –</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: That’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: – she said, just – just kill me, you’ve already killed me, just kill me.</span> <span id="s114">And I thought well, it’s a matter of time where they’re gonna get my mother, they’re gonna get my brother, they’re gonna get my grandmother.</span> <span id="s115">That’s all that I remember, really, right there, that to me –</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Did you know the lady?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: N-No, no, but that went on, and those are the memories that – that’s one of my worst remembrance, and from there on, things just – I – I remember thinking, how can my mother say she would – she will kill him herself, how could she do that?</span> <span id="s118">And that’s about where it stopped.</span> <span id="s119">The only memory I have after that, we were fairly well off, and I think there were even people who helped my mom clean the house, and obviously my dad must have been doing all right, is suddenly, two [indecipherable] we were si – all sleeping in our house, ourselves, my mother and my father, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Can I bri – I’m sorry I interrupt, but I want to bring back to – to what you had said earlier.</span> <span id="s121">Your – if we – you se – you remember your neighbors just looking out the window or looking in the street –</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: No, no, they were out –</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: – on the street –</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: – in their yard looking.</span> <span id="s125">There was like a fence, like a picket fence, and they were looking at us, and my grandmother and my brother and I were like in a corner.</span> <span id="s126">My mom was like right next to these – they were Germans.</span> <span id="s127">And she wasn’t wearing the band, and I couldn’t understand why we were wearing the yellow band.</span> <span id="s128">And my father was there and they took all the men, and it looked like some of them were – they – they were fucking them with the gun.</span> <span id="s129">And I thought they’re gonna kill my father.</span> <span id="s130">And I couldn’t understand how we were doing that, we were wearing the band and all, and she wasn’t.</span> <span id="s131">And then she said what she did.</span> <span id="s132">From there on, I don’t – I can – I can’t remember just exactly what happened except this horrible, horrible – this woman being shot, and yelled whe – I don’t even remember, I remember my grandmother just took and put our heads in the apron so that we couldn’t hear anything, she covered our ears, and I – it’s like everything blacked out from there.</span> <span id="s133">There could never be a worse enemy or a worse thing I could ever see in my life other than what I just saw there.</span> <span id="s134">That was the ugliest thing I’ve ever seen in my life, what happened to the woman.</span> <span id="s135">I do –</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: At age four –</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: – I don’t even ha – remember – my father was spared, obviously, and – because we went back in the house and I didn’t – I re – I remember not seeing anything, because my grandmother just totally –</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Do you have a feeling, when you looked at the neighbors on the – on the other side of the picket fence, were they – did you have any sense of how they were looking?</span> <span id="s139">Was it curiosity, was it horror, was it grief?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: I – I –</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Were these people you knew well and liked, or were they distant?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: I – I don’t really remember.</span> <span id="s143">All I do remember is they didn’t tell, because they knew my mother was Jewish, and I think they were in awe, and I think it was a combination of everything you just said.</span> <span id="s144">They were in shock, they were petrified.</span> <span id="s145">They had to be.</span> <span id="s146">And knowing my mother was Jewish and denied it, and she wasn’t wearing – fortunately they didn’t say anything, and obviously they were fond of her, and I – I – I think they were just frozen in space.</span> <span id="s147">From there on, as I say, my gram – the only thing – I remember my grandmother, but yet I don’t, but I remember she covered both our heads, and I – we cou – I couldn’t even breathe, I remember, and I didn’t want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: You were four years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: I didn't want to see.</span> <span id="s150">I was four years old –</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Four years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: – but that’s something I will never forge – I’ll never forget.</span> <span id="s153">That was the worst thing I’ve even seen in my life.</span> <span id="s154">I couldn’t believe a human being could do something like that to another human being.</span> <span id="s155">But that was the beginning of many horrors that I saw that I never should have seen, which is why I’m here.</span> <span id="s156">It – it never should have happened, that people can do this to people.</span> <span id="s157">And that –</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Did you – were – the age difference, was there an age difference between your parents?</span> <span id="s159">Your father and your mother, was he older than she was?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Yeah, he was just – my – my father was born, I believe, 1911, and my mother in 1913.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Oh, so very – they’re the sa – almost the same age.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Yeah, they were –</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: – the same generation.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Yeah, yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Did he look Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: I don’t know what looking Jewish is –</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: – because I don’t think you do, and I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: But he was of fair skin, and she wasn’t really dark, but she did not.</span> <span id="s171">And she –</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: So she di – she definitely did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: – she played a good part, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: My mother played a good part, and the understanding goes that when – after the Holocaust, and what have you, a lot of things happened to her that – I don’t know, apparently she was pregnant and thrown down the street, or downstairs.</span> <span id="s176">I didn’t see any of that.</span> <span id="s177">I don’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: Okay, we’ll come to those moments –</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: – where – where you can tell us what you do remember and what you were told, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: – and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: But from there on it was like a blank, it’s like, to this day I didn’t want to re-remember that – that [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s184">And then the journey started, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: So, after this, do you have like a blank?</span> <span id="s186">I – do you remember going back in the house, do you remember –</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: I do remember going back in the house, but I don’t remember what was said.</span> <span id="s188">There was a lot of mumbling among my mother and my – my – my grandmother, who apparently – I don’t know if – I can’t even tell you if grandma was killed when the bombs came, because shortly after that, I remember we were sleeping, and there was like a – a – a – like a rubber thing li-like – like an earthquake.</span> <span id="s189">And I remember – it still – it was a joke in the family that my mother said, what’s happening?</span> <span id="s190">My father said, it’s tun(ph) pasheening(ph).</span> <span id="s191">In Romanian that means it’s a tank on rubber wheels.</span> <span id="s192">And she said, no, no, it doesn’t sound like that, it sounds like, you know – then we looked out and all of a sudden it was like Fourth of July, and it was just – it wa – like firecrackers were going off.</span> <span id="s193">And I remember they tried to grab, and it just happened so quick.</span> <span id="s194">They – my mother grabbed my brother and my father, myself and we ran.</span> <span id="s195">And as we ran, it was in the courtyard, and like, the courtyard was gone.</span> <span id="s196">It was just – bombs were – were falling all over, and I don’t know if – in Europe the – the Russians wear these fur skwerta(ph), th-the fur coats.</span> <span id="s197">Somehow or other she had that.</span> <span id="s198">Well, she – all I remember, we were running a – out of the courtyard, and as we’re running, I guess the force of the bombs lifted me up because I was th – to the point they had to drag me down and somehow or other we managed to go against this, I don’t know if it was a – a wood wall or a stone wall, and I remember thinking, we’re gonna be hit, I don’t – these things, there’s fire, the whole courtyard, and our house was blown up, there was nothing to – the clothes on our bodies is all we had, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: So you made it out in the nick of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Apparently.</span> <span id="s201">All I remember is we stayed there, and as we ran there were bodies, bodies all over the place.</span> <span id="s202">We just ran and ran and we stayed next to this wall.</span> <span id="s203">And the bombs were going up.</span> <span id="s204">My mother kept on saying, pray to Grandma.</span> <span id="s205">So apparently Grandma must have – I don’t know if she was alive or dead.</span> <span id="s206">And we ran, and in running, my parents were saying don’t look, don’t look, but there were just bodies all over the place.</span> <span id="s207">And we ran, and I do remember this, we ran to a hospital, that’s the only other part I remember.</span> <span id="s208">And at that time, I don’t know I – if it was Russians or what, but we – we were sitting on these benches type of thing against the wall and wa – I – I – all I remember is my father stood up to, I think it was a Russian, they wanted the watches and the jewelry, and they’re women.</span> <span id="s209">And my father was very upset.</span> <span id="s210">I remember I never saw him this upset, I remember I never saw him this upset and this frightened.</span> <span id="s211">I can’t – I blacked out what happened after that, but the part I do know, from that hospital, how we got out of there, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s212">But after getting out of there we must have run all the way to Bucharest, Romania.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: So, ha – Iaşi –</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: I d – I don’t know how that – that –</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Yeah, do you – do – have you looked on a map where Iaşi –</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: – and where Bucharest –</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: – and are they far apart?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Bucharest is the capital, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: I – how far – I – I – I did when I went to the school, but I – I – how far, it was like one of the small – Iaşi is one of the small st – rural [indecipherable] Bucharest.</span> <span id="s223">And we stayed there, and that was quieter for some reason, and my father, apparently they rented, I don’t know exactly what it was because I think one of my cousins somehow or other was there.</span> <span id="s224">Whether this was a family that lived there, I can’t remember the connection.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: So – can I interrupt for a minute now?</span> <span id="s226">Iaşi, was it near Moldova?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Was – okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: So, in other words, it wasn’t Germans who came in where all this was happening, it was Russians who came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Germans were bombing us, the Russians were robbing us.</span> <span id="s232">I remember the Russians were robbing us, but it was the Germans that were bombing –</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: Bombing, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: – Iaşi.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: And who shot the woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: It wa – they were German.</span> <span id="s237">They were German because the word I’ll never forget, du bist Juden.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Ah, yeah.</span> <span id="s239">That’s German.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Du bist Jude –</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Du bist eine – eine Juden.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: – eine Juden.</span> <span id="s243">I’ll never – du bist eine Juden, and we had to wear that.</span> <span id="s244">There were parts, I’ll be honest, I was so young, that whether in ya – in Bucharest or what – I remember hiding, hiding in attics, hiding under the floor, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: I want to stop for a moment before we get to Bucharest, just clarify as much as we can.</span> <span id="s246">I know that you were a child, and I know that – that – that these memories are – they’re not sequential, they come, and you know, you remember one thing and another.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: But I – until this moment, I didn’t realize that it was also – that you first had like – your first exposure was a German.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: And this – and this bombing and the shooting, but that also you had experienced something, must have been that later the territory came under Russian control.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: And – and the – and the robbing came.</span> <span id="s253">Is that what – is that what –</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Well, how the Russians got into it, all I know is I wore the yellow star, and the – this woman and my father was taken out du bist Juden, I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: We had to wear that –</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: The ye-yellow star.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: – and this was in Iaşi.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: In that courtyard.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: But in the hospital, when you were ther –</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: We’re – how we got to the hosp – I know it was all by foot.</span> <span id="s263">We actually – I don’t want to get ahead, but we did run by foot –</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: – from Bucharest, from Iaşi to this hospital, which had to be part, or out of Iaşi possibly, could be further out, closer to Bucharest, I don’t know, but that’s where we ran.</span> <span id="s266">From there, I have no idea how we got out, into that hospital except for shelter –</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: – and there were people.</span> <span id="s269">But it turned out the people in there, I remember them, devie(ph) chesso(ph) that’s in Russian –</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: That’s right, that’s give me your watch.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: – means give me your watch, and then the word for women.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s273">Chingechinna(ph)</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: And they were – yeah, they were coming on to my mother, and I remember my father stepping in front –</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Trying to protect.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: – and yelling, I’ve never seen him that upset, and again, blacked out.</span> <span id="s277">I have no idea –</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s279">Okay, so bring me back then to Bucharest.</span> <span id="s280">When you’re in Bucharest, and you –</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: We’re in Bucharest.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: – it’s a little bit quieter.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: It’s a lot quieter.</span> <span id="s284">We were like in an alley, and my father again opened – was working, and he was now making some uniforms for the Germans, which he did not want to do.</span> <span id="s285">My mother, I remember saying, well you have to, how else are we gonna survive?</span> <span id="s286">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Were you still wearing the yellow star?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: No, the yellow star came off in Bucharest.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: So that means, were you passing?</span> <span id="s290">Wer – do you think the family was trying to pass as non-Jewish?</span> <span id="s291">You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Possible.</span> <span id="s293">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s294">I-I mean, I have no – I really cannot say yes or no, I’m not sure, but I know we didn’t wear the yellow s – but then, it was put on again.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Can I ask also, when you were in Bucharest, was it just the four of you, your mother, father, brother and yourself, or was it part of the extended family, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: There was a cousin there, and his name was Pompa(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: And I don’t – either they were there and we joined them, cause they couldn't have been in the courtyard.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: There was nothing in that courtyard left, that I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: So the – some of the bodies could have been of your relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: Could have been.</span> <span id="s303">All I know is we ran on foot, and as young as I was, and it – there was total blank.</span> <span id="s304">Everything – my other cousins – and it turned out they – some did survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Do you remember what time of year it was when all of that happened in the courtyard?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: It – it wasn’t – it had to be closer – November.</span> <span id="s307">October, November, December, because it was cold, it was cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: And by the time we got to Bucharest, it was warm.</span> <span id="s310">It was warm.</span> <span id="s311">So we ran –</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: So it was several months?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Oh, we ran, yeah.</span> <span id="s314">We – we hid in forests and I – I – all I – the part after the bombing and the – the hospital is – I remember that.</span> <span id="s315">After that, I remember, it’s like waking up and being in Bucharest.</span> <span id="s316">I know was warm because I remember all I had was like a slip, and so it had to be warm.</span> <span id="s317">I just remember slight pictures.</span> <span id="s318">And I remember my dad was working, he had a factory and he was working making clo – coats and stuff.</span> <span id="s319">My mom worked with him.</span> <span id="s320">We were basically on our own, my brother and myself, but that’s the way you were brought up, and we stayed within the courtyard.</span> <span id="s321">And I remember my father saying he couldn’t do this.</span> <span id="s322">He’s making coats for people who are killing and killed our relatives, and the other picture that I do remember in Bucharest is my brother – my brother and I were going somewhere, I don’t know where it was, a movie, or I don’t even know.</span> <span id="s323">He was to take care of me, that was his responsibility.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: For a little boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: No matter for – yeah, he was two years older, so whether I’m six now, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s326">But I remember some street, and I know this was Bucharest, there was this man who was like stretched out with a stick in his stomach and he was opened up, and it said, this is what happens to Jews.</span> <span id="s327">And there were flies all over him.</span> <span id="s328">And my brother took my face like don’t look, don’t look, and I remember thinking, I saw something like this.</span> <span id="s329">[aside: No, no.</span> <span id="s330">Somebody wants to see?]</span> <span id="s331">I saw something like this with the woman, and here was this ugly picture.</span> <span id="s332">That’s all I remember.</span> <span id="s333">That – and somehow or other, back came the yellow bands, and from then on, all I remember is running.</span> <span id="s334">War broke out, running.</span> <span id="s335">And my next memory is, we’re somehow or other ca – we’re like in trenches, in – in these trenches, my mother and my father and my brother.</span> <span id="s336">Somehow or other we got caught.</span> <span id="s337">Exactly how we got, I don’t know, but then we were put, and we were well off and all, we were put in this cattle type of boxcart, and they were – it seemed like a hundred people just – we couldn’t breathe.</span> <span id="s338">It was dirty, it was th – and everybody was like – I don’t know, like in shock.</span> <span id="s339">And I – I – as young as I was, I couldn’t understand why are we on here with these people?</span> <span id="s340">We don’t belong here.</span> <span id="s341">And people were crying, there were babies crying, people were defecating and i – we were just mobbed together.</span> <span id="s342">And we figured, you know, a lot of people were crying, saying we’re gonna be killed, we’re gonna be killed.</span> <span id="s343">Everybody had the yellow star on their arms.</span> <span id="s344">And then, all of a sudden the boxcar must have dis-attached, because we were moving fast, like the train were just move – real fast.</span> <span id="s345">And suddenly, everything stood still, and we – you couldn’t see out because there was a bok – there were no windows.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: So you were locked in this dark space –</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: We were locked in this dark space, and we had no idea what was in there except a lot of people crying, yelling, what have you.</span> <span id="s348">My m – again, now I’m, my mother, my brother, my father, and I don’t even remember where, it was just fear.</span> <span id="s349">And in my mind I thought we were just going to go on a trip, but why all these people?</span> <span id="s350">Cause I was so young.</span> <span id="s351">But then when it got dis-attached, when the boxcar became dis-attached, everybody stopped, and you know, they couldn’t open the door, and the men, somehow or other managed to open the door, and we saw the rest of the boxcar, with probably more people, go on, and I was le – we were left on the track.</span> <span id="s352">So the men, some ar – I gathered the men, the people in there opened it up, and everyone just scattered out.</span> <span id="s353">Families just ran every which way.</span> <span id="s354">And I remember we never left my mother and my father, we weren’t allowed to, we just had to stick like glue.</span> <span id="s355">And we ran and we ran and we got into – and this was cute, I was telling my husband, we crossed – what they used to do is they used to take a wad of money and wrap it around an explosive.</span> <span id="s356">When you’ve picked up the money the explosive goes off, but being at the age that I was, we ran over – this I remember definitely – this little bridge, and I saw there was a wad of money.</span> <span id="s357">And I went for it, and my mother’s going no, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s358">She really thought I was gonna explode any minute.</span> <span id="s359">Well it turned out it really was –</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: A wad of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: – a wad of money.</span> <span id="s362">And that wad of money crossed us – we were no – we ran by foot, or from this boxcar, wherever we were – it took us.</span> <span id="s363">I remember it was in Budapest.</span> <span id="s364">And we stayed in this very – it – it looked like a great big – I remember it had a white picket fence, and it was like a colonial type of beautiful house.</span> <span id="s365">And this is gonna sound very strange, it’s like in – I’ve been there before.</span> <span id="s366">And we were in the cellar, and what you do is – these were, I think Jewish people who crossed you over the border.</span> <span id="s367">They took your rings if you had no money.</span> <span id="s368">They took money, well I had the money, and my mother had rings, or I guess she had jewelry she had hidden, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s369">But I remember we were to leave, and my mother told my brother and I that I was a rotten kid, because I decided I’d been here before and I – I’m gonna go upstairs –</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Investigate.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: – because I haven’t seen the daylight.</span> <span id="s372">And I wandered out, and I knew exactly.</span> <span id="s373">And I – how I remember this is my parents a – even told me.</span> <span id="s374">I knew exactly.</span> <span id="s375">If there’s such a thing as déjà vu, this was – I knew exactly where I was.</span> <span id="s376">And I walked around the block and I knew where I was, no one can tell me otherwise.</span> <span id="s377">I knew where I was.</span> <span id="s378">And the man who was supposed to cross us over, not borders, to another place, into the woods, and in the woods somebody else would meet us.</span> <span id="s379">And if you have more money, you give them and take you to another destination, that I remember.</span> <span id="s380">Well, they – my mother and father didn’t want to leave because I was gone.</span> <span id="s381">Fortunately, I found – I knew where I was, I found my way back, got a heck of a whack on my rear end, and we ran.</span> <span id="s382">And I was just telling my husband that the woods were so thick, that now I – I – I’m amazed why there were no animals, but that’s where we stayed, what – there was no food, we weren’t given food.</span> <span id="s383">You pay the money to the person who takes you to that part of the woods and you hide there, and from there someone, at dusk or nighttime, I can’t even remember that part, takes us and leads us to another destination, and you hide in that wood, and – in the woods.</span> <span id="s384">And the woods was, you couldn't see.</span> <span id="s385">How – I remember being so young, thinking how are they gonna find us?</span> <span id="s386">I can’t – it’s all dark in the woods.</span> <span id="s387">But apparently we made our way all the way to another place, where somebody reported us.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: In Hungary now.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: In Hungary.</span> <span id="s390">And there, we’re put in jail.</span> <span id="s391">And for the first time – one minute – first time my mother and I, and my brother and my father were separated.</span> <span id="s392">The men had to go in one, it’s like a courtyard.</span> <span id="s393">I remember it had like a fountain in front, and there were women and the women had babies, and they were trying to feed the babies.</span> <span id="s394">People would – the women were defecating, and I never s – I would never see my father or my brother again, so we figured this is it.</span> <span id="s395">We were caught.</span> <span id="s396">We got this far, we’ll never survive again.</span> <span id="s397">But again luck was on our side, somehow or other.</span> <span id="s398">The door – I don’t know if we were there a day, definitely overnight – they pushed water and stale bread on – under the door.</span> <span id="s399">And if you got to it, you got to eat, if you didn’t, fine.</span> <span id="s400">But somehow or other the door was left open, this one, was it night or dusk, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s401">I do remember my mother grabbing my hand, and we ran, along with the other people.</span> <span id="s402">And we hid out, was like a farm, and there were – I don’t know what you call, but they were like a stable, and there was hay.</span> <span id="s403">And I don’t even – I can’t remember how, but I remember they put tape on our mouth, and we were told don’t a – don’t breathe.</span> <span id="s404">So, some –</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: Your mother’s mouth too, or just children’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: The kids, the kids, and we were not to sneeze, cough, nothing.</span> <span id="s407">And the part that I remember, which is almost comical, and I was thinking – and I didn’t know my father and my brother were also let out.</span> <span id="s408">Somebody left the door open, I think it was done deliberately.</span> <span id="s409">What happened is we were in hay, covered with hay, and I remember my mother saying, not a word, don’t move.</span> <span id="s410">Whispering, don’t move, don’t cough, don’t breathe, nothing.</span> <span id="s411">Well, all I can remember thinking is, I looked down and I saw these gorgeous blue eyes.</span> <span id="s412">It was a German.</span> <span id="s413">It was a German man.</span> <span id="s414">Blonde hair, these piercing blue eyes, and he had a pitchfork.</span> <span id="s415">And I’m thinking to myself, if he’s going to take that and push it in, how is my mother gonna know that I’m gonna be killed and I’m hurting.</span> <span id="s416">And I’m – I couldn’t imagine, how do I let her know, how do I let my mother know that he’s gonna do that.</span> <span id="s417">He saw me.</span> <span id="s418">We made eye contact, there’s no question about that.</span> <span id="s419">And I thought, this is it, he’s gonna do that, my mother won’t know.</span> <span id="s420">The blood will – these crazy things –</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Well, they’re normal, they’re logical for a child.</span> <span id="s422">You’ve been told not to breathe, not to talk, and this –</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Well, and I remember somebody yelled du Juden?</span> <span id="s424">Are there Jews there?</span> <span id="s425">And he said, nein, nein, nostu(ph) kein Juden.</span> <span id="s426">But he was looking right at me.</span> <span id="s427">And I thought, oh God, God, maybe he won’t do it.</span> <span id="s428">After that, I remember they took the tape off and the running started.</span> <span id="s429">Now we ran from –</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: We – I – wa – was your father and brother also in that hay?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Yeah, but we didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s432">We –</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: So when you –</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: – my mother and I just ran and then she must have realized that I didn’t know, but I saw, and we had no time to acknowledge or hug, we all ran.</span> <span id="s435">And somehow or other there was four of us.</span> <span id="s436">There probably were a lot more, but everybody ran.</span> <span id="s437">The only thing I remember after that, and we were very lucky, I have no complaints, is we again hid.</span> <span id="s438">There were nobody to cross the borders, whether we got – I think we ran by foot, that becomes blank.</span> <span id="s439">I remember cold.</span> <span id="s440">All we had was – bathing, there was no such thing.</span> <span id="s441">Food, I don’t know how and what my mother gave me, or even if we ate.</span> <span id="s442">That wasn’t even important.</span> <span id="s443">Survival was the only important thing.</span> <span id="s444">And again hiding, and being quiet.</span> <span id="s445">It was like I’ll never talk again.</span> <span id="s446">I’ll never see my family again.</span> <span id="s447">It – it was just, this is my way of life, this is how I have to – we have to live.</span> <span id="s448">And my brother wouldn’t even talk to me, he – there was no talking, it was just surviving.</span> <span id="s449">Save your strength, survive.</span> <span id="s450">And we hid out, I believe, in fields.</span> <span id="s451">We got, somehow or other my next memory is ot – in Salzburg, Austria.</span> <span id="s452">And we were like, hiding in a field, but I remember seeing this – I assume it was a German – Austrian lady, was in her garden, and I remember she was pulling up carrots or some – and she deliberately took them and threw them like behind her, like here they are; here Jew, eat; which was wonderful.</span> <span id="s453">So we had – and my – my next memory was in Beth Bialik, that’s the displaced persons camp.</span> <span id="s454">How we got there, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: But you were still together as a family?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: We were still together, we – we ran together everywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: It’s a miracle.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: It was a miracle, and we are very lucky, because we should have been – we were going to either Auschwitz or Dachau, or – half of the people that didn’t survive.</span> <span id="s459">Only I think two people sur –</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Well, I don’t mean to s – to suggest it was easy, I’m just saying it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: Oh no, no, no –</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: – it was simply that, oh my gosh, that the –</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: We survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: – that mother and father were there –</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Yeah, but we never – we were never – actually, when we got to Beth Bialik, was the name of the d – displaced persons camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Was it in Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: It was in Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: It was in Austria.</span> <span id="s470">How we got there –</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: And so now the war is over?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: We didn’t know if it was over, because now the quota was open.</span> <span id="s473">We couldn’t go to Isra – we stayed back up – we were in this displaced people’s camp, and there were people from Russia, people from ru – each one was a group.</span> <span id="s474">The Romanians, we were like in – I would say the size of this room.</span> <span id="s475">There was like a great big, I don’t know what you call them, like cabins, long –</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: Barracks, exactly.</span> <span id="s478">And each family had like a bed, and if you had two or three kids, the kids slept in one bed, and the mother and father slept in – but could have been five, six, eight, 10 families in these bar – one on one side, hi – and a curtain on one side, a m-material curtain blocking at night and another.</span> <span id="s479">My father, for it’s – how, I don’t know, because he wasn’t a violent man, but he came that – became that, is he was in charge of the Romanians, another man was in charge of the Polish, another one the Lithuanians and Russians.</span> <span id="s480">And somehow or other I remember always sleeping with my brother.</span> <span id="s481">I do remember having lice in my hair from the sweating, what have you.</span> <span id="s482">But I remember the one thing which was always awful, is if anyone in that camp was caught stealing, or doing anything against the other one, they would be punished.</span> <span id="s483">My father, the – my gentle father was the head of the Russians, and I do remember this and to this day I will not sleep with my back to a door, is I happened to peek out and I saw this man walking on the ledge up a – and I was the only one, I saw his face, but we never – anyway, they caught him.</span> <span id="s484">My father had to punish him to show the rest.</span> <span id="s485">Children, everybody had to watch.</span> <span id="s486">And I thought, he can’t do this.</span> <span id="s487">I remember he took the man’s hand and put it in the door and crushed his fingers.</span> <span id="s488">And that was so unlike him, he was not a es – he was not a bad man, but I thought, my father, look what it’s done to him.</span> <span id="s489">He actually hurt this man, and the – the – the screaming that he broke his fingers.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Was he there to steal, was that what they was doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: He was watch – walking along the ledge, and, like there, and looking to where – and I guess he stole some stuff.</span> <span id="s492">To this day I ne – I would – I – I saw his face, he – he must have seen me, and I put the blanket over my head, that’s just another memory of mine.</span> <span id="s493">And I – I – he – he was found out, I don’t know how, they found the stuff on him.</span> <span id="s494">But I remember thinking I could never love my father like I used to.</span> <span id="s495">How could he do this to another human being?</span> <span id="s496">So I was convinced this – it did change my father, it did change my mother.</span> <span id="s497">And from there on, the quota – oh I, we almost – the quota opened up, we couldn’t go to Israel because the British wouldn’t allow us in, and he was just a tailor.</span> <span id="s498">They took the doctors, the lawyers to the U.S. And they had dozens of tailors, that was the – the most common profession.</span> <span id="s499">Even though he was a designer, it didn’t matter, that was his trade.</span> <span id="s500">And ironically enough, I – somehow or other, we were playing spin – I don’t know, I sat on the bottom of a bottle, and I still got the scar.</span> <span id="s501">And my parents were horrified because there was a chance we could go and – not to the U.S., but Canada.</span> <span id="s502">And there were – there was no penicillin and if it was infected, and I remember my mother trying to hide, cause it was in the bone, it was right in the knee.</span> <span id="s503">How we found out, my brother says, why is the grass around you red?</span> <span id="s504">And then when I stood up, my whole leg on my left knee was cut.</span> <span id="s505">And instead of – I didn't understand what was happening to my parents, instead of, oh my God, are you all right, it was, we’ll never get out of here now.</span> <span id="s506">Our chances of getting out of here – and I thought, oh my God, I – they – they’re not gonna allow my parents to get out of there because of me and I – what do I do?</span> <span id="s507">And somehow or other she camouflaged it, I don’t know how.</span> <span id="s508">And we did, and my next memory is, I guess there were an X amount of people, some went.</span> <span id="s509">If you had family in the U.S. and they were willing to take you in, and you were clean, at – as my pictures show, and you had to make sure that you were healthy, and they were petrified that they’re gonna find that I have this cut on – bad cut on my knee.</span> <span id="s510">And we were allowed to go –</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: To the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: – to – no, to Toronto, Canada was the only one.</span> <span id="s513">We had family in New York, but sadly enough, the one in New York didn’t – I don’t – somehow or other didn’t want to help, or whatever.</span> <span id="s514">We ended up in Toronto, Canada.</span> <span id="s515">That wasn’t pretty –</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Did you have family there?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: No.</span> <span id="s518">That wasn’t pretty either.</span> <span id="s519">The Jewish Federation helped bring you over.</span> <span id="s520">And when we got to Toronto, Canada, my mother – well, w-with – the boat was horrible, because I remember everybody – I remember my father was so sick.</span> <span id="s521">We were a great – the name of the ship was Samaria and the ship has since, I guess, gone under.</span> <span id="s522">But I remember we were, the DP people who were transported Toronto, Canada, we were at the bottom where, you know, they put the coals and all, but we were grateful.</span> <span id="s523">We were getting out of Germany, and they, you know, when you go to America or Canada –</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: – or au – you’re gonna live.</span> <span id="s526">So it didn’t matter if a rat ran over you or what have you, and there was, whatever they didn’t eat upstairs they throw downstairs.</span> <span id="s527">But it – what I do remember is how green and horrible and sick my mother was.</span> <span id="s528">And I really thought she was gonna die, my mother was gonna die, because it was just – it was just inhuman.</span> <span id="s529">But we made it, and from there we – it was still not pretty, we got to Toronto, Canada and we actually stayed in – on Kensington Street.</span> <span id="s530">I remember how awful that was, because it’s the only place that – the Jewish Federation gave us clothing, and I said – I – I found out I – gave us clothing, gave us shelter.</span> <span id="s531">We ended up staying th-the – the front of the house was where they – they killed the chickens, kosher chickens and there was blood, and I thought, oh God.</span> <span id="s532">And it was a Jewish school, and I remember it – I forgot their names.</span> <span id="s533">It was an older lady and a wonderful couple.</span> <span id="s534">And all they could offer us was during the day – it was a Hebrew school – we could sleep there at night, but we had to vacate, and all they could offer was the floor.</span> <span id="s535">We were grateful, and that I remember, the four of us slept on the floor at this Hebrew school at night, but during the day we had to vacate it.</span> <span id="s536">And I remember the smell of the chickens and the blood from the chickens, thinking to myself, we really didn’t survive.</span> <span id="s537">Those chickens, I – as a child I remember thinking, this is what the Germans were doing, and they’re doing this to chickens.</span> <span id="s538">Well, from there we moved –</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Can – can I stop a little bit here?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: Want to go back to a couple of – couple of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: Two question – no, no, no, you’re doing fine.</span> <span id="s544">I know it’s hard.</span> <span id="s545">I know it’s hard.</span> <span id="s546">You talked about how you saw your parents change.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Do you have a sense of yourself as a child, and how you changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: How I changed?</span> <span id="s550">My parents changed, because I remember my mother – my father was a designer and we were wealthy.</span> <span id="s551">My mother, in a way, was spoiled, because there was always money there.</span> <span id="s552">And suddenly – now that you bring that up, the only job they – we had to pay back Jewish Federation, and I remember hearing my mother saying – you know, I know now that all these donations that we give to the Jewish Federation, maybe it’s different now, and they worked – they were able to work in the delicatessen store.</span> <span id="s553">My father never did cold cuts, ne – my mother never really worked, other than tailoring.</span> <span id="s554">And oh how he hated it.</span> <span id="s555">It was not his trade.</span> <span id="s556">And then it actually became comical, because the little bit they made, half of his salary, say if he got 10 dollars, five had to go back to the Jewish Federation.</span> <span id="s557">We know for a fact the clothes were donations.</span> <span id="s558">And I’m not putting down the Jewish fe – but every single paycheck, they had to pay back.</span> <span id="s559">And we wore hand-me-down clothes.</span> <span id="s560">I do remember this wonderful, wonderful teacher, and we moved – we had six moves in one year, til they managed to save some money.</span> <span id="s561">And it was made known that whatever we give you, and put you up, you will pay, and they did.</span> <span id="s562">But I remember finally going to school – and I knew how to speak eight languages.</span> <span id="s563">By now I’m eight years old, but you – a child picks eight – I was able to speak Romanian – fluent Yiddish, Romanian, Yiddish, little bit of German.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Language at home, was it Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Oh, it was Yiddish – Romanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: So, what – your earliest –</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: And then it became –</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: – memories was Romanian?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Romanian, only Romanian.</span> <span id="s570">Being in DP camp, we learned Yiddish, because it was the mutual language, and other dialects.</span> <span id="s571">But there were also Polish, so, you know, it became [speaks foreign language].</span> <span id="s572">You pick up.</span> <span id="s573">And then, a lot of the kids were Russian.</span> <span id="s574">They picked up Romanian, I picked up – and the advantage of this is it opened up a lot of doors in my later life, because I was able to go to school and use those languages, so it did – oh –</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Well, a child’s like a sponge when it comes to language.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s577">And – but, we made our way with Mom and Dad, and we got to school, and when we got to school –</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Was this the first school you’d got to?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: I’d – I’d – I didn’t mention one thing which I should have.</span> <span id="s580">The other way that way back I survived, my mother put me in parochial school.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: When?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: That was –</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: And where?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: This was way back in Iaşi, I forgot to say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Cause I remember the nuns boc – he – with the f – the – the – the rulers and – and they found lice in my hair too, then.</span> <span id="s587">But that – that’s just clicked in, I should have said it earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: So you must have been a kindergartner in parochial school.</span> <span id="s589">Did you learn any –</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: Oh yes, oh yes, but it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s591">If I was in parochial school I was safe, and I didn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: Have to wear the yellow star.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: My mother, somehow or other – yeah, that just popped into – that’s probably another way I survived, or, you know, and I’m sure my brother did, too.</span> <span id="s594">But I do remember that ruler coming down on my knuckles.</span> <span id="s595">But, back to present, they couldn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Did you – the question of how did you change.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: How did I change?</span> <span id="s598">I think I became – my brother always took care of me.</span> <span id="s599">There were a lot of other things I probably didn’t have, but he – i – he – hi-his responsibility – death would have gotten to him unless he to – his job was to take care of me.</span> <span id="s600">And he did as best as I could, but I remember getting into fights, which was not my nature.</span> <span id="s601">But the kids, I guess, were making fun of – I couldn’t – I could speak all these other languages, and the teacher, of course, all loved me.</span> <span id="s602">Couldn’t be – didn’t – didn’t know where to place me, because so much school was missed.</span> <span id="s603">And somebody called me, I don’t know if it was dirty Jew or something, and I-I just jumped on her, oh, I – I wa – i-it wa – just wasn’t – the anger came out of me like an animal, and I remember my brother peeling me off of this girl.</span> <span id="s604">And I remember going to the principal’s office, or somebody.</span> <span id="s605">And they – I couldn’t speak to them, I couldn’t tell them.</span> <span id="s606">And, the [indecipherable] came down, and he said, why did you do it?</span> <span id="s607">And I remember yelling, I’m Jewish, I’m Jewish.</span> <span id="s608">And that’s the only part I remember is, I’m Jewish.</span> <span id="s609">But the girl didn’t do it because I was Jewish, but I couldn’t understand why she was picking on me, and making fun and laughing.</span> <span id="s610">So the answer, it did, it hardened me.</span> <span id="s611">And even though my brother was to look after me, I realized that it’s time to look after myself, this is going to happen.</span> <span id="s612">And I’ll just have to fill my own shoes, because he’s two years older, he’s now in another grade, and this is life.</span> <span id="s613">This is life, and we’re very lucky, and you know, I can’t be his responsibility and actually it started to take hold, and I made my own friends and learned the language faster then, and skipped two, three grades.</span> <span id="s614">Fortunately, I guess I had a brain because it start – they didn’t know where to put me.</span> <span id="s615">They started off with first grade, and then I think the last was third grade.</span> <span id="s616">And then fourth – by fourth grade, I remember by then I was speaking English, made my friends, gave my brother a breathing room where he could go with his friends.</span> <span id="s617">But it made me bitter.</span> <span id="s618">Bitter, not – definitely bitter against the Germans, which, they weren’t – it made me very – to this day I have no love, and you can’t blame the whole, and I mean, I hate the language.</span> <span id="s619">And ironically enough, even as I got a job in public health nursing and put myself through school, I used the German lan – I had to use the German language to be in a clinic, to interpret to German refugees in Toronto, Canada, of what to do with their babies.</span> <span id="s620">And a couple of times, I literally messed up, and I knew I messed up, and I didn’t even, God forgive me, resent it.</span> <span id="s621">I really didn't – I didn't feel bad about – not that I told her the wrong thing, I just said to her, in – in German, can’t understand, na – na [German] fa – you know, mixing Jewish with – and they – it’s like I – I guess my best way of inter – I mixed the ger – Jewish with the German deliberately.</span> <span id="s622">I wanted them to know I’m a Jew, and I’m helping you speak this language for your baby.</span> <span id="s623">What did you do for us?</span> <span id="s624">That’s where I was wrong.</span> <span id="s625">But that’s – I – I can actually say from there on, I feel very fortunate.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: I want to stop again, I’m sorry to do –</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: But you had mentioned earlier that something had happened to your mother, that she had fallen downstairs.</span> <span id="s629">Ge – what’s – what was this episode?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: That must have happened either after I was born – all I know is the Holocaust, or the Germans were paying for the people that went through the Holocaust, and it was making retribution.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: Retri – reparations.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: Right.</span> <span id="s633">And there were paintings and stuff, and what have you, which were either burnt, we had no idea.</span> <span id="s634">As I remember, her being interviewed, this is in Canada, to go to New York, and my father, and to be interviewed so that if you are eligible for this.</span> <span id="s635">And I remember she did, and my father did.</span> <span id="s636">My father, for some reason they said – and he was beaten up many times, I think, I can’t remember, because they said he – he’s mentally unbalanced, of what he’s saying.</span> <span id="s637">My mother got some retribution.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Re-Reparations.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: Rep – yeah, I keep making [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: But my father didn’t.</span> <span id="s642">Whether it’s possible he – I don’t know.</span> <span id="s643">I – I really don’t know why, because in all honesty, he suffered more.</span> <span id="s644">But I remember she did, and the story went, which I was too young, is she was pregnant and she was thrown down the stairs and lost the baby.</span> <span id="s645">And of course, the other things that happened to us, with the running, the house was destroyed – excuse me – and she got some kind of, I guess, pension.</span> <span id="s646">Not for long, but she is – she was eligible, but I couldn’t understand – then, we were told, both my brother and I, that we too.</span> <span id="s647">And this is my second marriage.</span> <span id="s648">And I did marry a Jewish gentleman who I met my first time, first year out of nursing school, anyway, and was married to a Jewish man for 20 – almost 28 years, had my three beautiful daughters.</span> <span id="s649">And at the time I was living in Connecticut, and my brother – my mother and father moved to be with me, cause they weren’t getting along with my sister-in-law, but it doesn’t matter, they wanted to be close.</span> <span id="s650">And that was fine, we brought them over.</span> <span id="s651">And she was getting some money wa – and I remember my brother said, you know, you gonna go.</span> <span id="s652">And my husband said, go.</span> <span id="s653">And I says well, I’ll give them a call.</span> <span id="s654">And I think I spoke to someone on the phone, if I remember correctly.</span> <span id="s655">This – we’re going back, I would have been married 50 years.</span> <span id="s656">And they said, you have to speak German and you have to go through all this.</span> <span id="s657">And I said, you know what?</span> <span id="s658">There’s no money you can give me to bring back these memories, I don’t want to go through it, not then.</span> <span id="s659">And my brother, to this day, because Cara(ph) called him, and das – my husband is – we just went to a Bar Mitzvah, and I said, Morris, how can you not remember?</span> <span id="s660">I’m – he and I are the only survivors, my mom and dad passed away.</span> <span id="s661">And he says, I don’t want to remember it, I don’t even want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s662">Cause she did call him, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: And so he’s never given his testimony to anybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: No, and he doesn’t want to.</span> <span id="s665">And he probably remembers more than me, but he – he wants to forget it, he says, I don’t want to remember it.</span> <span id="s666">And I – I didn’t want to push it because I saw him welling up.</span> <span id="s667">And I’m not – the reason I’m doing is, I have that gentleman, my husband to thank, cause I had these few pictures, and I do have more at home, and I was treasuring them.</span> <span id="s668">And, ironically enough, to end the story, my husband said to me, look, the pictures are gonna just crumble up and they’re gonna get lost.</span> <span id="s669">Have them, you know, put them in the Holocaust, and you know.</span> <span id="s670">So I did, and I’m glad I did, because ironically enough, then a letter came, and I wrote my little story, and my granddaughter, which I’m very proud to say, and that’s the reason I’m here, says, Grandma, can I use your paper and talk about your experience in that – the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s671">And I said absolutely, and she used that and got an A plus in her – and then I went to speak to 90 – 90 kids, three classes of sixth graders, and my two grandchildren were there, all big-eyed, looking at me, proud as punch, and I thought, there is a reason.</span> <span id="s672">And I really thank my husband for this, because the story has to be told, it did happen, and the kids should know.</span> <span id="s673">My – my grandson, who lives in Florida will be here December – no, April, he was chosen, he’s very gifted.</span> <span id="s674">And when he pushes that button, and sees some of the pictures, the story will go on.</span> <span id="s675">I may not be here, but the story should be told.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: I’m very – we’re in a – I hope you don’t think we’re finished, unless you – because I have –</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: – many more questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: Go right ahead.</span> <span id="s680">The hard part I have to get off my chest.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Yeah, yeah, I – yes, and – and thank you for –</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: Thank you for doing that.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: Thank you, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Thank you for sharing it.</span> <span id="s686">I can’t imagine what a little girl, has this implode on her life.</span> <span id="s687">You know –</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: Felt good getting it out.</span> <span id="s689">It did.</span> <span id="s690">Felt good getting it out.</span> <span id="s691">[crying] I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: It’s okay, please don’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: I don’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: Had you – had you told your daughters?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: No.</span> <span id="s696">I –</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: Your daughters had never asked you, or you’d never really told them about –</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: Not really, no, no, I – I sort of stifled it.</span> <span id="s699">They know, they read, but I never – no.</span> <span id="s700">It’s not that I’m ashamed of it –</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Of course not.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: – it just – so, I think, gruesome.</span> <span id="s703">Very gruesome.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Well, you know, if –</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: I told my husband some of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: But if you were my mom, I would be crying along with you because I would –</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: – be thinking, my mom is a little girl, and she has all this happen to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: I think they know, and I don’t think – my – my first husband wasn’t too proud that we were foreigners for some reason, I don’t know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: He was an American Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: He was an American Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: And I guess the story goes, you know, you come to America, golden land, but we worked for everything, nobody – my family had nothing to give us.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: But that’s the wonderful part, we made it the hard way, and we’re here.</span> <span id="s716">As far as telling the kids, they know I was there.</span> <span id="s717">And I – I – I can’t really say I’ve – they’ve ever heard all that I just told you.</span> <span id="s718">Certain parts, that we were in DP camp and what have you, it’s like maybe they didn’t want to put – it could be they didn't want to put me through telling this.</span> <span id="s719">But, when I told them, they were very, very excited that I am telling the story.</span> <span id="s720">And as I said to my daughter, when you do go, and you really want to hear, because she’s never heard, this is my middle daughter, press the button.</span> <span id="s721">Or go see the archives.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Well, we’ll give you a copy of the interview, that you’ll be able to share with them, if you want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: What happens to this?</span> <span id="s724">Q: Well, what happens to this is that, this is a digital recorder.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: And once it’s – once we stop, it has a little card in it.</span> <span id="s727">The card then gets put into another gizmo – you’re gonna hear my technolo – technological knowledge here, it’s this thing, gets connected to my computer, or somebody’s computer here, gets transferred there.</span> <span id="s728">And then there’s a process which we’ve just started, because we con – we were still doing cassette when we did audio, up until maybe a year and a half ago, we were still recording things on cassettes.</span> <span id="s729">And now we’re trying to digitize all of our collections.</span> <span id="s730">So the interview will be digitally transferred to a server, it will be assigned a number and a name.</span> <span id="s731">It will be your name.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: And – and at some point – this takes awhile, even though it du – it’s not that long a process because it goes through the, several departments, it takes awhile.</span> <span id="s734">And then it gets put in our catalog, and someone can look up, even online when they press archives, Lili Brody-Carmosino, and there will be oral history with Lili Brody-Carmosino.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: They won’t be able to, off-base, offsite access the interview as yet.</span> <span id="s737">Sometimes on our website you can access parts of them.</span> <span id="s738">Sometimes there are interviews that have transcripts connected with them.</span> <span id="s739">But – but when you come here, in a number of months, one would be able to ask, at the desk that we pass by, the archives desk, I’d like to have the interview with Lili Brody-Carmosino.</span> <span id="s740">She’ll look it up and see oh, it has our record group number X,Y,Z.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: And then, at a computer terminal, there it is, you put on the headphones –</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: – and you can here the interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: I know they’re coming in April.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: And we’re planning on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: So, I think that by then –</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: Hopefully.</span> <span id="s750">I’m hoping.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s752">That it will be –</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: And that’ll be the first time she will hear it.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: Oh my, oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: Well, you know, if –</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: I have a – I have a few – okay, you want to just say something?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Sure, no, go ahead.</span> <span id="s758">No, no, I was just going to say is, if you ask, you’re told.</span> <span id="s759">I’ve learned one thing, there’s just so much you can tell a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: And there’s certain things I – I wouldn’t – I don’t want it to be gruesome.</span> <span id="s762">It’s part of history, but I’ve always said to them is Grandma, Grandpa, myself and Morris are so lucky, we never got – and I still feel that way, we never got to go to Dachau.</span> <span id="s763">We have friends that their children were killed, and they did experiments on them.</span> <span id="s764">I mean, there were a lot of people who my parents stayed close to, that were horror stories.</span> <span id="s765">I says, we’re alive, and the four of us were spared, that we have – we’re very fortunate.</span> <span id="s766">So that’s where I let it go.</span> <span id="s767">If they ask more, I would have told them more.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: Well, you know, it’s – it’s a funny thing, because there are contradictory truths, yes?</span> <span id="s769">One could say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: But look at what – but that doesn’t mean you didn’t suffer.</span> <span id="s772">That doesn’t mean you didn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: Oh yeah, it’s changed me, but it’s also made me stronger, where I can actually say Americans, Canadians don’t know.</span> <span id="s774">It happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: It was a horrible thing, and it does – you can either – it’s like life, you either lay down and let it take you over, or you get up, you brush yourself off and you go on, and how – I – I chose to brush myself off.</span> <span id="s777">Not just there, after a bad marriage too –</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: – but ye – this is life.</span> <span id="s780">And that’s one of the things I – I will treasure, because I saw it and it added to my life, and I think made me stronger.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: I want to go back to your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: We’re back in – in Toronto, your father’s working in – in the delicatessen, which is not his.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: When we first arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Yeah, when you first arrived.</span> <span id="s786">Did he – what happened with them, and did they ever change back to the parents you originally knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s788">My – my father and mother worked in the delicatessen til – they hated it, but it was the only way – the only job.</span> <span id="s789">Eventually, he went back to his tailoring, and my mother worked too, and that was one thing that bothered my dad, because she only worked with him, and was able to go back into the tailoring and worked there and made a nice living at it.</span> <span id="s790">And after years of slowly, after all these moves, they bought a house –</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: In Toronto.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: – and – in Toronto, Canada, and it was on Essex Street, and that’s where I became a person.</span> <span id="s793">We had a house.</span> <span id="s794">We did rent the upstairs, we didn’t have a – a penny, but I actually – I went to grammar school during the day, made sure my grades were done.</span> <span id="s795">It – it was different in my time, that I told the kids.</span> <span id="s796">I had school to do, nobody cared whether I went to school, got As, Bs or Fs.</span> <span id="s797">My job, unlike my brother now, the story reversed, I was to cook, I was to clean.</span> <span id="s798">He was a boy, he could do whatever.</span> <span id="s799">So I went to elementary school there, Essex, and had a job, I think I was 11, and worked with my girlfriend Marcy’s father’s store after school.</span> <span id="s800">Went to work there, but before I could do that, I had to clean and do whatever, cook.</span> <span id="s801">My mother bought me a little stool and I could mix the soup and what have you.</span> <span id="s802">And that was my responsibility, so the shoe reversed, my brother had the freedom, but I became the housekeeper.</span> <span id="s803">And I kept my grades up, my teachers were wonderful.</span> <span id="s804">Learning was a wonderful thing for me, and working made me independent, and bought my own bicycle, made friends and my father and mother stayed in Canada and we lived there.</span> <span id="s805">Then we upgraded.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: Was it a warm family, even though they had changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: No, the marriage, no.</span> <span id="s808">They argued a lot, and was mostly money.</span> <span id="s809">It was not the same people that I remembered, but I just figured the hardship – there was arguing, arguing and it was mostly money.</span> <span id="s810">And we supposedly moved up to Shepherd Avenue because of me, so that th – you know, I would meet better people and get married, because at 16 they were convinced I was gonna be an old maid.</span> <span id="s811">And as it turned out, at 18, I was married.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: Yeah, met my husband and at 18 I was married.</span> <span id="s814">At the age of 20 I had an ectopic pregnancy, was told I couldn’t have kids, but fortunately I did.</span> <span id="s815">And then – now I’m in Connecticut and had my three beautiful daughters, I don’t know if I’m jumping.</span> <span id="s816">And my parents came to live with us – with me.</span> <span id="s817">Well, not in my house, my – my n – my husband now in Connecticut, because we would go home, I would say every three, four months, because you’re not allowed to re-enter, once you leave Canada, I didn’t have dual –</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: Citizenship.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: – citizenship.</span> <span id="s820">So we would go back, like in six months I could go back, and my parents were having a rough time there, because I was really the –</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: Support.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: I was now the keeper.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: And I have been since the age of 12.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: You know, a lot of arguing, when you say changed, a lot of arguing.</span> <span id="s827">They loved each other deeply, but it was just a turbulence, a lot of turbulence.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: It was too much for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Too much for them, yeah, I think it got caught up, and even though slowly, slowly they made their way into, you know, my mother stopped working, my dad was still working, they weren’t happy.</span> <span id="s830">Then my brother got married, I was – moved to Connecticut.</span> <span id="s831">They were unhappy, so finally my husband said, let’s bring them here.</span> <span id="s832">And we did, and he opened up a little tailoring, cleaning and tailoring, did extremely well.</span> <span id="s833">And I took care of them.</span> <span id="s834">And then, as time went on, my dad started to get Alzheimer’s and things got – and I – I was the keeper, I –</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: You kept it together.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: Every se – oh, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s837">My kids say you were the matriarchs, and I – yeah, yeah, I actually can’t say that – my girlfriend always says my hands are like 90 year old.</span> <span id="s838">But I did the cleaning, the cooking, what have you and I’m – I b – I didn’t – she didn’t really want to do this, I – I think she was – my mother was a bright woman, who ha – probably never really should have had kids, being that she loved learning, she loved business.</span> <span id="s839">And my father was more the caretaker.</span> <span id="s840">That’s the best way I can describe it.</span> <span id="s841">And I was close, he was a wonderful man, I loved him deeply.</span> <span id="s842">Ended up with Alzheimer’s and could never be separated from my mother, he just adored her.</span> <span id="s843">And the saddest day, probably almost as sad as the Holocaust, is have to slowly take his license away, and then put him in a home.</span> <span id="s844">Only because what was happening is he would wander off.</span> <span id="s845">And I – now I’m – I was separated from my husband, things were tough.</span> <span id="s846">But my parents were my upkeep, and it got to the point where a wonderful visiting nurse says, you can’t keep doing this, cause I had three kids to take care of, and my parents.</span> <span id="s847">And the kids were easier to take care of than my parents.</span> <span id="s848">But it was difficult, because I think all of this took a toll on him.</span> <span id="s849">And the forgetting, but the wandering – wandering off, and we got him the bracelet, the I.D. bracelet and all.</span> <span id="s850">It – it got tough.</span> <span id="s851">Put him in the Jewish convalescent home, and Mom had to go there too, because you couldn’t separate them.</span> <span id="s852">And I watched him deteriorate.</span> <span id="s853">That was hard.</span> <span id="s854">That was, I think the hard – one of – as hard as the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: So you – you know, you still loved him, even though –</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: Oh, I adored my dad.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: I – I loved my mom, and I took care of my – as my husband knows, we were there two – twice a week, three time – she was also in a Jewish home, and I da – she died holding my hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: Loved music.</span> <span id="s861">I can honestly say I took care of the both of them, thank God.</span> <span id="s862">Thank God that –</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: But what an ex –</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: It made me strong enough that I could do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: But also, what an example for your girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: Oh, I hope to God they never have to do what I did.</span> <span id="s867">I really don’t.</span> <span id="s868">I’ve got long term care so that they’ll never have to go through what I – you know, that was hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: It’s tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: That’s hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: It’s tough, it’s tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: It – it was very tough.</span> <span id="s873">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: What –</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: – again, I –</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: What years did they pass?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: My dad was in his 80s, and my mom, God bless her, was 93.</span> <span id="s878">93, and I was able to give her an incredible 90th birthday party – birthday party with [indecipherable] band, and as much money I could [inaudible].</span> <span id="s879">And a – she may na – not have been the greatest mom, but in my heart, I did what you can do, and I –</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: That’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: – would do it all over again.</span> <span id="s882">But – and I would not want my children to ever have to do that.</span> <span id="s883">It’s too much of a responsibility.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: Yes, but th-the values are – are the kinds you want your kids to see.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: Oh, you may – yeah, I loved her.</span> <span id="s886">I mean, I’d have liked her – at times I loved them.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: And my dad, even though he was tough to live with, he was – he was a sweetheart.</span> <span id="s889">He was a sweetheart.</span> <span id="s890">There was nothing I couldn’t ask my dad, and maybe not my mom.</span> <span id="s891">I loved my dad.</span> <span id="s892">He was tough to live with, but I loved my dad because – I’ll add one thing, my mom didn’t care what – the grades or what have you, but that was because she – her mother had her at 50.</span> <span id="s893">It’s a gap, so her mother took care of us.</span> <span id="s894">But, when I graduated elementary school, I had to get, those days, like a prom dress.</span> <span id="s895">And my mom said, just – my father said, I’ll take you.</span> <span id="s896">It was probably the ugliest dress in the whole prom, cause I was short and fat.</span> <span id="s897">And – but I was just so proud that my dad, not my mom, went with me.</span> <span id="s898">So, we were close.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s900">Do you ever know what happened to your grandmother, who was –</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: She – she died.</span> <span id="s902">I never would – was never explained to me, did she died during the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s903">I remember – I don’t remember a funeral, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s904">So, did she die in the bombing?</span> <span id="s905">It was never brought up.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: And the family, the con – family compound, was this your mother’s family, or your father –</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: It was your mother’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: No, my mother’s, my mother’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: It was family.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: My father’s father was a farmer.</span> <span id="s912">Two of the most wonderful people.</span> <span id="s913">She was just a tiny little thing.</span> <span id="s914">He – my father resembled, he was the gentlest man, the –</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: Your grandfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: – I think I’ve only seen twice, as young as I was.</span> <span id="s917">And I know the whole farm was big, and I remember him milking the cow and bringing it to me warm, out of – right out of the cow.</span> <span id="s918">But when the war broke out, either they were killed – I know my father’s sister, very tragically, there was a movie that was called, the brievela(ph) de Mama.</span> <span id="s919">You understand what that means?</span> <span id="s920">Letter to your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: And apparently, some fire broke out, and she was trampled to death.</span> <span id="s923">And her name was Anutsa(ph).</span> <span id="s924">And my father told me this.</span> <span id="s925">It was just before, I guess, war first broke out.</span> <span id="s926">And that was tragic.</span> <span id="s927">Beyond that, I never really knew.</span> <span id="s928">I was too young.</span> <span id="s929">What happened to them, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s930">His sister was alive in Israel, made it, but when war broke out, every – everybody just flew in different direction.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: Another question.</span> <span id="s932">How did you choose your profession?</span> <span id="s933">Where did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: Oh, I had a few.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: Yeah, then – you mentioned the nursing.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: Supposed to go to nursing school, but it didn’t work out, because I couldn’t stand anything being blood.</span> <span id="s937">And I was very good with my hands, and very athletic, as my mother was.</span> <span id="s938">She used to call herself a Maccabee, which she was in.</span> <span id="s939">I – I actually had a multitude of, after I got married, would bef – before I met my husband I worked for public health nurses.</span> <span id="s940">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s942">That would have been in Canada.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: That would have been in Canada.</span> <span id="s944">And I did volunteer work at a veteran’s hospital up to the age that I got married.</span> <span id="s945">From about 15, myself and my friends would go every Sunday and cook for the veterans.</span> <span id="s946">And I remember writing, they were parachuters, and all that remained of them was just their bodies, they were like in – I don’t know what you call those swings, you know, it’s just the netting, it’s like –</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: And I remember they couldn’t write.</span> <span id="s949">And I would write letters to their sweethearts, nobody came to visit them.</span> <span id="s950">They gave me tremendous – myself and my friends, but I loved that.</span> <span id="s951">We – I – I loved doing that.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: It was meaning.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: It w – it – I don’t – I can’t – I mean, at 16 you don’t do things like that.</span> <span id="s954">There were five of us, who we just stel – reunited in Toronto, Canada, and that’s what we did every Sunday.</span> <span id="s955">And it’s – that – that was very fulfilling.</span> <span id="s956">That’s the only way I can describe it, very fulfilling, and back to your question as far – then I got married, and when I arrived in Connecticut I remembered all I could d-do – I was an excellent typist, so the thing to do was transcribe.</span> <span id="s957">And I applied to Manpower or something, and my typing was excellent.</span> <span id="s958">And ended up doing typing.</span> <span id="s959">And then my languages opened up doors again.</span> <span id="s960">My children were born and then I stopped working, and my husband was in the printing business.</span> <span id="s961">And because of my languages, a friend called and says, Lili, you know how speak Yiddish fluently, and German and a little bit of Russian and Polish.</span> <span id="s962">There’s a job opening at the Jewish center for the hot lunch program that consists of like 150 people.</span> <span id="s963">You have to do programming, it’s quite involved.</span> <span id="s964">I said, I don’t know, because my husband didn’t want me to work.</span> <span id="s965">Went down, I applied, got the job, was able to take – I was not allowed to work unless I brought – til my kids were in school, home for the kids after school, those were the rules.</span> <span id="s966">And that was fine.</span> <span id="s967">So I brought my little one, which is my youngest, Stacey with me, and I remember loving work, just loving it.</span> <span id="s968">Prior to that – oh, after that, I remember – I thought, okay, I did that, she came with me.</span> <span id="s969">Now it’s time to put her in a daycare and I will put her in a daycare and get myself a job.</span> <span id="s970">The other two were in school, and I’ll work around the kids.</span> <span id="s971">And ironically enough, I went to sign her up, and I was sitting on the floor, reading her a book til I could get the director.</span> <span id="s972">And I had three or four kids on my lap, a couple on my back, and I’m reading these books and these kids are all over me, and I think, what the heck?</span> <span id="s973">And she says to me, would you – well, what’d you come here for?</span> <span id="s974">And I says, to sign up my daughter.</span> <span id="s975">And she says, well, I’ve got a better idea.</span> <span id="s976">You come work for us.</span> <span id="s977">You see?</span> <span id="s978">So I ended up having a full time job, my daughter got in free, and I started to work for the daycare.</span> <span id="s979">After that, I just loved working, and I end – from there, I went to work for special ed, as an aide.</span> <span id="s980">And because of my grades and what have you, I found myself working one on one, and I absolutely loved it.</span> <span id="s981">And I would go to different schools, and there was one, you know, some kids were wheelchair bound, couldn’t talk, one was sign language.</span> <span id="s982">And I would work one on one – one on one with them.</span> <span id="s983">That was another job.</span> <span id="s984">After that it was a multitude of incredible jobs, I don’t know how I got them.</span> <span id="s985">Dad had to go, because now the kids were all in school, and I thought, well, it’s time to go on.</span> <span id="s986">I believe, if I’m not mistaken, I worked for a bank.</span> <span id="s987">And that was again up to three o’clock, and be home for the kids.</span> <span id="s988">From the bank, I thought, well, let’s see what else I can do, I love people.</span> <span id="s989">I went to work for, happened to be two Jewish ladies, physical therapy.</span> <span id="s990">I was a wer – answered the phone.</span> <span id="s991">It’s – and I ended up giving physical therapy, which I didn’t want to do, but she says, you’ve got some nursing background.</span> <span id="s992">I ended up doing physical therapy, which I shouldn’t have done.</span> <span id="s993">And then, next thing I know is this friend of theirs wanted to open up this thing, adaptive clothing for the handicapped.</span> <span id="s994">And she had – that’s when Velcro first came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: And she said, what do you think, Lili?</span> <span id="s997">So the one who owned the physical, she says, I want you to meet this woman who came in, I think it was either Las Vegas, or I-I’m not even sure where she lived, califor – someplace.</span> <span id="s998">She was a wonderful lady, we hit it off immediately.</span> <span id="s999">And she says, will you work with me on this, and we’ll – somehow or other I got involved with her, and we opened up this thing.</span> <span id="s1000">But, my husband decided it’s – it – that’s enough.</span> <span id="s1001">It was every eat – when I worked for the Jewish Center, I was in the paper, because I was talking to governors and mayors and what have you.</span> <span id="s1002">Whether that threatened him, I don’t know, and I was in the paper, and then when I ope – started with this adaptive clothing for the handicapped, again it was, you know, ribbon cutting, and that did it, it was just – I’m – I’m exposed, and there’s just too much.</span> <span id="s1003">So then, I think there was another job I was applying to, and that was – there were – I loved physical fitness and people, so I applied at, I remember, the YMCA in Hamden, Connecticut.</span> <span id="s1004">And I thought, there’s no way I’m gonna get it, I mean, this is director for – and he says, I’m very interested.</span> <span id="s1005">And I came home to tell my husband that I’m going to possibly – you know, I – I interviewed and there’s a good chance, that was the end of my married life, and what have you, and he says, no you’re not, you’re coming to work at Brody Printing Company.</span> <span id="s1006">If you’re so great, you can prove it to me.</span> <span id="s1007">And that was a bad move, because I found the things – this was not the man I was married to, and working for him was not the things to do because the way he talked to people and handled people is the way he hated other people handling him, not to get involved.</span> <span id="s1008">And the marriage fell apart.</span> <span id="s1009">And you ready?</span> <span id="s1010">I was there with well, not three, because my daughter moved out, my oldest daughter, and she went to college, and so did the middle one.</span> <span id="s1011">And the marriage – we went to Israel, my treat.</span> <span id="s1012">The only way the kids went on vacation is if I paid for it.</span> <span id="s1013">And this was a wealthy man, who really didn’t like kids, but he wasn’t a bad father, he just wasn’t around, so I was basically a single mom anyway.</span> <span id="s1014">The reason I’m saying this, and there is where the Holocaust, and my experience is making me what I am, I’m grateful for.</span> <span id="s1015">What does a woman do with no credit cards, two children, three to take care of, had a beautiful home, went on vacations, now I’m alone, because the silence was deafening, the relationship fell apart, and I kept on saying – you know, I – I – I – I go on vacations, I have a beautiful home, three beautiful children, what’s going on, why am I unhappy?</span> <span id="s1016">There was no conversation, it was – everything fell apart.</span> <span id="s1017">There was no interaction, and I was going into depression and I ended up div – taking the family, the last hurrah, to Israel, where I met the cousin who split my head.</span> <span id="s1018">And there were, I think, 12 of us at a table, and because my husband was well off at the time – and I treated, with 7,000 dollars for that trip, and the best trip ever.</span> <span id="s1019">And we got – the kids got to see Israel.</span> <span id="s1020">I met my – the family that was left over.</span> <span id="s1021">And that – that was it, 1985, I went on my own.</span> <span id="s1022">When we came back, the marriage was over, unbeknownst to me, there was somebody else for 15 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: That was – and back in the thing, I had to now, no credit cards, no car.</span> <span id="s1025">What am I gonna do?</span> <span id="s1026">Sold the house, which was mine, and went to school, and learned how to be a court reporter.</span> <span id="s1027">I worked in the court system.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Oh, my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: And that was – I became very independent, I made nice money, and thank you Holocaust for making me the strong woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: And here I am.</span> <span id="s1032">I was able to give a mar – up a marriage of almost 28 years, brush myself off, start bu – all over again, and meet this wonderful man, who may not be the same faith, but has taken over the Judaism and goes with me to synagogue, and that’s what comes from going through that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: It made you strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: I become strong.</span> <span id="s1035">I could never have done it otherwise.</span> <span id="s1036">Not that I didn't fall down –</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: – and not that I didn’t panic, but I stood up, I made it, and I’m very proud of myself that I made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: I think you have every reason to be.</span> <span id="s1040">Every reason to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: [indecipherable] I really.</span> <span id="s1042">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: Thank you, Lili.</span> <span id="s1044">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: Thank you for listening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: Is there anything else you’d like to add to this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: Only that someday my grandchildren, or gra – their grandchildren will hear this and just know it did happen, and their grandmother, or great-grandmother, or great-great-great grandmother went through it.</span> <span id="s1048">And it did happen, and I’m very proud to tell the story, and they should be very proud that they’re Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1050">Thank you.</span>
