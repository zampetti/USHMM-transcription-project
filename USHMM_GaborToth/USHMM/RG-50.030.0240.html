Vogel.</span> <span id="s12">V-O-G-E-L.</span> <span id="s13">I was born November 29th, 1923.</span> <span id="s14">Q: Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: I was born in Jacovce, J - A - C - O - V - C - E, Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Tell me about your childhood, about your growing up.</span> <span id="s17">What was it like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: I come from a family, my parents, my father was a businessman, he was a cattle dealer, in the small community of Jacovce.</span> <span id="s19">We stayed in Jacovce until I became six years old.</span> <span id="s20">I had an older sister and a younger brother.</span> <span id="s21">We then moved to a larger community which is called Topol_any, T - O - P - O - L - C - A - N - Y. C with a umlaut [ha_ek].</span> <span id="s22">And the reason for the move, because of schools.</span> <span id="s23">My father wanted to put us into a larger school, school which was in Topol_any.</span> <span id="s24">And we lived in Topol_any, we started, uh, Jewish schools, and soon after, two more children were born in our family.</span> <span id="s25">I can give you their names.</span> <span id="s26">My name used to be Moshe, which was, uh...they used to call me M - I - S - O, S with an umlat [Mišo with a ha_ek].</span> <span id="s27">My sister who was older than my, uh, than I am, was name was Rose, Ro_i--R - O - Z with an umlaut [ha_ek]- I. My younger brother, who was not quite two years younger than me, his name was Arpad, A - R - P - A - D; and I had a sister Marta, M - A - R - T - A; and a little brother, the baby brother, whose name was Maxmilian.</span> <span id="s28">We lived a fairly happy life in Slovakia.</span> <span id="s29">Well, it was part of Czechoslovakia--this was the region of Slovakia.</span> <span id="s30">It was Czechoslovakia, but our part was called Slovak.</span> <span id="s31">We were the Slovaks.</span> <span id="s32">Antisemitism was there, always there.</span> <span id="s33">I remember when we used to play soccer as kids, there was never boys against boys, it was always the Catholic against Jews.</span> <span id="s34">That was the kind of soccer games we used to play.</span> <span id="s35">But we got along as well as one could get along.</span> <span id="s36">We stuck to our ways and they stuck to theirs.</span> <span id="s37">Uh, we were quite religious, especially our mother.</span> <span id="s38">I even remember my bar mitzvah in 1936.</span> <span id="s39">Uh, my grandparents on my mother's side, my mother by the way came from another community, uh I would say sixty, seventy kilometers from Topol_any.</span> <span id="s40">Her maiden name was Feldman, and our grandparents, her parents, were there at my bar mitzvah, which we called the grosse shul--the big temple, the big shul.</span> <span id="s41">Our rabbi was a very famous guy.</span> <span id="s42">His name was Abraham Weiss.</span> <span id="s43">And we had to go to temple, to shul, every morning and especially before I became bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s44">And then of course after that, every morning.</span> <span id="s45">We all went to the Jewish schools, except my sister.</span> <span id="s46">My sister was sent to Vienna.</span> <span id="s47">Now she was a pre-teener, pre-teenager, where my father's youngest sister lived; and she stayed with her a couple of years to go to school there.</span> <span id="s48">Uh, I would say from '35 to '37.</span> <span id="s49">And then she was sent back when Hitler started the rumbles.</span> <span id="s50">This was before the Anschluss in 1938 in Austria.</span> <span id="s51">We knew of problems in Germany.</span> <span id="s52">We knew of some problems but no one...no one paid much attention.</span> <span id="s53">Everyone felt ah nothing's going to happen to anyone.</span> <span id="s54">But we found out later that it did.</span> <span id="s55">Because in 1938 when Hitler marched into Austria, and annexed Austria so to speak as part of Germany, he started to take the Jews on the streets.</span> <span id="s56">We heard on the radios, those of us who had radios, what was going on - the beatings of the Jews, the break-in of the shops and that type of hooliganism that was going on.</span> <span id="s57">And pretty soon we found the Austrian Jews were running away from Austria and came to our towns.</span> <span id="s58">And my mother took an Austrian lady in to us.</span> <span id="s59">We didn't have a huge home but the five children but we gave her a spot to stay.</span> <span id="s60">But most of all I remember is when the Czechoslovakia mobilized its armed forces.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">And the reason for the mobilization was because Hitler wanted to take part of Czechoslovakia which known to us as Sudetenland into Germany.</span> <span id="s62">He wanted to annex Sudetenland into Germany.</span> <span id="s63">That was a Germanic-speaking part of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s64">And I remember my father was also taken into service, and I still remember the narrow street as the five children and our mother walked with our father to the railroad station to wish him well, to say goodbye to him.</span> <span id="s65">And, of course, the famous Neville Chamberlain quote, "peace in our time."</span> <span id="s66">And peace in our time never came; because as soon as he [Chamberlain] probably closed the door of 10 Downing Street, Hitler marched not only into Sudetenland but he took over the Czechs, Bohemians, Moravians.</span> <span id="s67">But Slovakia, the region where I was born, didn't, never seen a Nazi.</span> <span id="s68">Nazi soldiers never marched into Czechoslovakia, into Slovakia.</span> <span id="s69">So what happened with us, the Hlinka Guard, Guard, Hlinka, which H - L - I - N - K - A, was formed, and then in March 15, 1939, is when Slovakia became the puppet government of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s70">The Hlinka Guards, these were people that were our neighbors, people that our parents did business with, that grew up, and lived with practically.</span> <span id="s71">They became the Guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: O.K., the Guards did what?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Guards?</span> <span id="s74">Their function was, this was the Nazi-type, almost like an SS-type guards.</span> <span id="s75">So what happened with the Jews in particular, of course, only to the Jews in Slovakia as a matter of fact, all Jews from the age of six had to wear a yellow Star of David, sewn on the left breast of their outer clothing, with the inscription, Jude, Jew in German.</span> <span id="s76">I remember we couldn't, couldn't walk the streets together.</span> <span id="s77">No more than three or four Jews could walk the streets together.</span> <span id="s78">And, of course, curfew.</span> <span id="s79">By eight o'clock all of us had to be in their homes.</span> <span id="s80">We couldn't shop, uh, uh, any time we wanted to, only designated hours.</span> <span id="s81">And since my father was, uh, a cattle dealer and horse dealer, while my father was, uh, gone, I became, I was the oldest boy, my sister was older than me of course, so I was sort of in charge of knowing some of the millers, some of the flour millers, and go to pick up flour for our family.</span> <span id="s82">And you couldn't do it during the day because if you got caught, the Hlinkas would get to you and of course you were punished.</span> <span id="s83">Midnights, uh, middle of the nights, was when my mother and I and a couple of other Jewish ladies would go, go to the miller and pick up flour so we could have bread.</span> <span id="s84">And it was all black market, and you always paid through the nose.</span> <span id="s85">(Laughter) Everyday there was a new law read to us or posted on, on bulletin boards - they had these little round, uh, stalls where you would come and read the bulletin what happens next to the Jews.</span> <span id="s86">Uh, we were harassed, beaten on the streets, and of course the businesses were taken away from all the Jews.</span> <span id="s87">My father business, my father's business was given to the person who worked for him.</span> <span id="s88">And my father had to work there to show him how to do the business, to sell the cattle.</span> <span id="s89">And my father never believed that anything would happen to us.</span> <span id="s90">Almost to the last minute.</span> <span id="s91">He said no, he - the reason for that was because most, most of these people, first of all, we were Slovaks, Czechs, we were born there.</span> <span id="s92">No one's going to bother us.</span> <span id="s93">And second, my father also dealt with the Czechoslovakian government.</span> <span id="s94">He sold cattle and horses to the government for, for the armies and that, uh, type of business.</span> <span id="s95">So he said no, nothing's going to happen.</span> <span id="s96">This will, ah, this will pass.</span> <span id="s97">But it didn't.</span> <span id="s98">Because we were harassed, we were beaten, and in early 1942, end of 1941, early 1942, we heard that they are going to put us into camps.</span> <span id="s99">There was a rumor at one time, too--which was not even a rumor.</span> <span id="s100">Actually it was the truth, that the Jews will be shipped to Madagascar.Uh, I was a kid, I never knew, I was a small young teenager.</span> <span id="s101">But it didn't happen.</span> <span id="s102">Instead of Madagascar, myself, my older sister, and my next brother--Rose, myself and Arpad--were told to report to the Town Square.</span> <span id="s103">All young Jewish boys and girls.</span> <span id="s104">When they rounded us up, they told us that we're going back to our homes, pack our belongings - take food and clothing with you - you're going to be relocated and your parents will join you.</span> <span id="s105">They took us about two hours from our home town to the first war camp.</span> <span id="s106">It was called Arbeitlager.</span> <span id="s107">And the camp, the name of the camp was Nováky, N - O - V - A - K - Y, manned by large group of SS, of, uh, Slovakian Hlinka Guards.</span> <span id="s108">Mind you, we have yet to see an SS officer.</span> <span id="s109">Let me, let me re-track back for a moment if I may.</span> <span id="s110">Uh, the first time that have seen German soldiers was when Germany was invading Poland, September 1st, 1939.</span> <span id="s111">And how we seen them, the German army was going through Slovakia to get to Poland, because we were first and then came Poland.</span> <span id="s112">But we felt them.</span> <span id="s113">My father had to take the cattle from his stalls, from his, and the horses, and deliver it to the Town Square for the German army.</span> <span id="s114">Beaten by these, uh, by the Hlinka Guards behind him, going fast, to give this for the Germans to take with them as, as food and and horses for, for carrying their materials, war materials.</span> <span id="s115">That was the first time that I'd seen a German soldier.</span> <span id="s116">And when we'd seen them on those little motorcycles with the side little car and, and, and trucks and horses pulling their, their - that's how we've seen - that's the first time we've seen the Nazi soldiers, the German soldiers.</span> <span id="s117">This was the Wehrmacht at the time.</span> <span id="s118">So, we never had anything to do with them as far as being our guards yet, because our guards were the people that spoke Slovak just like we did.</span> <span id="s119">And when we arrived to Nováky, they loaded us on to trains after we loaded, after we packed our belongings at home.</span> <span id="s120">They came with us to our homes so we wouldn't run, we wouldn't hide, and they had enough of these guards all over, all over the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Did you know any of your guards?</span> <span id="s122">A: Oh, absolutely, by names.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Tell me about your conversation with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: Well, they would come, first of all they became ruthless.</span> <span id="s125">O.K.</span> <span id="s126">The word "_id" was common. "</span> <span id="s127">_id" is a Jew.</span> <span id="s128">"We finally got you _ids," and that type of words, and beating.</span> <span id="s129">They all had clubs and rifles and canes.</span> <span id="s130">Whatever they had they would beat you.</span> <span id="s131">These were people, this one guy in particular, his name was Martin_ek (ph), who was the barber, who was our barber.</span> <span id="s132">We used to go to the barbershop - he worked for a Jewish barber called Dezider (ph) 1 The Jews were never deported to Madagascar.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Banau, B - A - N - A - U.</span> <span id="s134">The poor guy perished in Auschwitz, but you know.</span> <span id="s135">And this Martin_ek (ph) was my barber.</span> <span id="s136">He cut my hair, cut my family's hair, and he, you couldn't ask for a nicer guy during the time (laughter).</span> <span id="s137">He was also an alcoholic but most of them were.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">And when we arrived to this camp, we seen guards from our home town.</span> <span id="s139">You would go close to him and would ask him nicely, you know, please don't help or something.</span> <span id="s140">Boom, the first thing would happen you would get hit.</span> <span id="s141">When they took us to Nováky by train, by, by passenger train, and when we arrived there it was a huge complex.</span> <span id="s142">With wooden barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Girls on one side, boys on the other side of the barrack, camp.</span> <span id="s144">And we were assigned to our bunks, unloaded our belongings, and then we had to line up in front of our barracks and then the guards would read us the laws.</span> <span id="s145">And, by the way, food at the time was still plentiful in Slovakia.</span> <span id="s146">Slovakia was a farm country, so the food was there.</span> <span id="s147">The cooks were our people.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">The Jews became, those who were appointed to be the cooks.</span> <span id="s149">We had meat, we had, we had potatoes, we had eggs, we, we still that.</span> <span id="s150">And we were also allowed at the time still to be receiving packages.</span> <span id="s151">So the parents would send some stuff to us.</span> <span id="s152">So that was still allowed because it was our, you know, still in our country.</span> <span id="s153">When the next morning when they woke us up and lined us up in front of our barracks, they told us after breakfast, you're going to report to work.</span> <span id="s154">What kind of work?</span> <span id="s155">Something which really, uh, none, nothing, uh, useful, just carrying bricks or stones and making piles.</span> <span id="s156">Because they didn't build anything.</span> <span id="s157">There was nothing to build.</span> <span id="s158">This was a camp, just a big grounds with holes where they were digging, some people were digging sand.</span> <span id="s159">My job, I was assigned to carrying stones in my bare hands and making a pile.</span> <span id="s160">And after we made that pile high, then we take that pile and make another pile.</span> <span id="s161">And this was the daily, daily routine.</span> <span id="s162">There was some people, there was even railroad tracks with small, small cars that ran on the railroad, that we pushed on the railroad.</span> <span id="s163">And we would just carry sand, dump it and carry more sand.</span> <span id="s164">No reason.</span> <span id="s165">There weren't homes built.</span> <span id="s166">There weren't roads built.</span> <span id="s167">There was just a camp, just a detention camp.</span> <span id="s168">And beating.</span> <span id="s169">Yea, we still had music and our singing groups.</span> <span id="s170">None of us believed what, what was waiting for us.</span> <span id="s171">When in April 1942 the first transport, well actually it was the end of March, the first transport from Nováky was taken and my brother Arpad was there and so was my sister Ro_i, Rose.</span> <span id="s172">I stayed behind.</span> <span id="s173">Of course, I didn't know, we didn't know where they were going.</span> <span id="s174">Neither did they.</span> <span id="s175">And I found out of course much later, my sister Rose ended up in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s176">My brother Arpad ended up in Lublin-Majdanek.</span> <span id="s177">Couple of months later my turn came.</span> <span id="s178">I, I left with a bunch of people, Slovakian people from my home town also, and we, this is what they told us.</span> <span id="s179">This is how they did it.</span> <span id="s180">They lined us up in front of our barracks.</span> <span id="s181">They told us we're going to be relocated to the east.</span> <span id="s182">Pack whatever you owned, report back in front.</span> <span id="s183">We did that.</span> <span id="s184">They loaded us into trucks, and I will never forget, just as, just as the trucks started to move, in unison we all started to sing the Hatikvah.</span> <span id="s185">I'll never forget that.</span> <span id="s186">Just the trucks moving, and we singing the Hatikvah anyway.</span> <span id="s187">And when we finished the Hatikvah, still being Czechs and Slovaks, we sang the Czech national anthem.</span> <span id="s188">When we came, the trucks stopped at a railroad siding.</span> <span id="s189">Railroad siding is for the, load, uh, freight.</span> <span id="s190">We've seen, oh, I would say about twenty cattle cars lined up, on the railroad tracks, and each cattle car had a wooden plank, doors wide open, and the plank leading into the cattle car.</span> <span id="s191">They loaded us into the cattle car, between eighty and hundred of us, boys and girls together.</span> <span id="s192">A metal bucket was put on each end of the car which was used for bathroom.</span> <span id="s193">The cattle car's doors were locked and sealed.</span> <span id="s194">We could hear them locking it.</span> <span id="s195">This was the last time that we have seen the Slovakian Hlinka guards.</span> <span id="s196">Some of the boys got friendlier with the guards, and they say, "Goodbye to you.</span> <span id="s197">You know, this is it, we won't [see] you no more."</span> <span id="s198">And the train started to move, and Nováky is approximately 24 hours distance from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s199">Of course, we didn't know we were going to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s200">They told us we were being relocated and our families will join you.</span> <span id="s201">Your families will soon join you.</span> <span id="s202">I would say approximately 24 hours later . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Tell me, before you go on, tell me about those 24 hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: That cattle car - first of all, it was jam packed, uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s205">People were fighting for places.</span> <span id="s206">You could not, not all of us could sit down.</span> <span id="s207">Hardly anyone could lay down.</span> <span id="s208">People were crushing each other.</span> <span id="s209">And of course they were fighting for the bathroom facilities.</span> <span id="s210">That was the worst part.</span> <span id="s211">Those people who couldn't hold, and then of course the buckets would be over-filled, and there was nothing else you could do, just relieve yourself as close to the corner of the car as you possibly could.</span> <span id="s212">We stopped once, on the cattle car, just the cattle car stopped once to relieve the buckets and they gave us some water, one, on one trip.</span> <span id="s213">I don't remember where - I was told it was in Jinna, that was the name of the town, but who could tell.</span> <span id="s214">And we got the buckets out and then they gave us some water.</span> <span id="s215">I would say next morning, now I would say next morning we arrived to our destination.</span> <span id="s216">The cattle cars stopped.</span> <span id="s217">The cattle cars were opened.</span> <span id="s218">And this was the first time that we have seen SS guards, SS soldiers, and SS officers.</span> <span id="s219">And every SS guard had a dog on a leash, either a German Shepherd or a Doberman Pincher.</span> <span id="s220">Mostly German Shepherds.</span> <span id="s221">Their rifles with bayonets sticking up, and either wooden walking cane, a bamboo cane or a whip in their hands.</span> <span id="s222">And of course, most of us, all of us in Slovakia I should say, spoke German.</span> <span id="s223">If you were Czechoslovakian, you spoke German, Hungarian and Slovak.</span> <span id="s224">That was our language.</span> <span id="s225">These were our languages.</span> <span id="s226">And they yelled, the Nazis would yell, "Juden raus schnell!"</span> <span id="s227">-- "All Jews out fast, fast!"</span> <span id="s228">With a beating.</span> <span id="s229">And we have seen, among the SS, people in striped uniforms, prisoner striped uniforms.</span> <span id="s230">And these were the boys that worked the railroad track.</span> <span id="s231">Of course we didn't know why.</span> <span id="s232">The Nazis, the SS would tell us to line up.</span> <span id="s233">And the boys, the prisoner boys, the people in prison uniform, would come to us and tell us either in German or in Czech or whatever language, line yourself up in rows of five.</span> <span id="s234">Of course, all done with beatings by the SS.</span> <span id="s235">When they separated the boys from the girls, when we were all lined up in rows of five, everything in Nazi concentration camp was five, because of easier count, and with the Nazis, with the dogs on the side of us, we started to march.</span> <span id="s236">I would say a mile and a half maybe.</span> <span id="s237">And we came to a gate of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s238">A gate with a half moon sign, that says "Arbeit Macht Frei," work makes you free, or gives you freedom.</span> <span id="s239">After we were in Auschwitz, I'm going to jump a little bit if I may, in Auschwitz for what, three, four months, and we used to march through this gate, in and out of this gate, with the orchestra playing.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">As we marched through this gate, we used to say among each other, "Arbeit Macht Frei, Krematorium drei"--"Work makes you free when you end up in crematorium three."</span> <span id="s241">And those of us we always looked who survived, who's still alive.</span> <span id="s242">As we marched through the gate, the girls on one side of the camp, the boys on the other.</span> <span id="s243">Auschwitz is built of solid brick.</span> <span id="s244">It's, everything is brick.</span> <span id="s245">Even the road, the streets are made of brick.</span> <span id="s246">The barracks, solid barracks.</span> <span id="s247">Before the Nazis invaded Poland, this part of Auschwitz used to be a Polish Army camp.</span> <span id="s248">So they marched us through the gate with whips and beatings and dogs jumping at us.</span> <span id="s249">We came to a huge brick building.</span> <span id="s250">They shoved us into the huge brick building, and there were prisoners and SS telling us what to do next.</span> <span id="s251">There was tables, long tables.</span> <span id="s252">The first area we had to undress, strip our clothing.</span> <span id="s253">There were hooks behind us.</span> <span id="s254">You put the clothing through a piece of wire, hang the clothing up.</span> <span id="s255">Take our shoes off, put the shoes on the floor.</span> <span id="s256">Next table were the barbers, the camp barbers.</span> <span id="s257">Where they shaved our head, cut our hair, shaved the entire body.</span> <span id="s258">They said this for hygiene.</span> <span id="s259">Then we moved to another table where the tattooing was done.</span> <span id="s260">So the tatoo was done on left forearm.</span> <span id="s261">There was one person who rubbed the little piece of dirty alcohol on your arm, and the other one had the needle with the inkwell, and he would do the numbering.</span> <span id="s262">So my number is 65,316.</span> <span id="s263">That means there were 65,315 people numbered before me, tattooed before me.</span> <span id="s264">After the tattoo, tattooing was done, they put us, they gave us the clothing, but not what we came with.</span> <span id="s265">They gave us, issued us a striped brown cap, a jacket, a striped jacket, a pair of striped trousers, a pair of wooden clogs, and a shirt.</span> <span id="s266">No socks or underwear.</span> <span id="s267">Then the last area, when they gave us the uniform, they gave us two strips of cloth.</span> <span id="s268">The cloth I would say was about six inches long, maybe inch and a half wide.</span> <span id="s269">And it would star, starred with the Star of David, corresponding with the number on your left forearm, sewn on your left breast and on the right pant leg.</span> <span id="s270">And then the last item which was the most important item that we received was a round bowl.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">And this bowl was the life blood of your being.</span> <span id="s272">First of all, without it you couldn't get the meager rations that we got.</span> <span id="s273">And second, the bathroom facilities were almost non-existent.</span> <span id="s274">Uh, uh, even at Auschwitz, each barrack on the bottom had a washroom.</span> <span id="s275">But you couldn't use it.</span> <span id="s276">It was only for the privileged.</span> <span id="s277">You could use it special times if you were quick, because they only gave you like two, three minutes.</span> <span id="s278">But most of us couldn't use it.</span> <span id="s279">So, when they gave us the numbers and the bowl, you are now, we were recorded, also by prisoners.</span> <span id="s280">This was the, what they call today the Nazi documentation department.</span> <span id="s281">These were, they were the officers that did all the paper work.</span> <span id="s282">And these were prisoners that worked in the Nazi documentation department.</span> <span id="s283">Every transport, how many people arrived, and what their names, where they came from, where was the transport from, where it originated, and so on.</span> <span id="s284">These people were the ones to do that type of work.</span> <span id="s285">And most of these people were actually office workers from homes - bankers, uh, people that worked as accountants possibly.</span> <span id="s286">So after they documented all that, we no longer had names.</span> <span id="s287">The Nazis called us Häftlings, prisoners.</span> <span id="s288">I became Häftling , prisoner 65,316.</span> <span id="s289">Then they marched us to our homes, to our barracks.</span> <span id="s290">In Auschwitz as well as all concentration camps, all buildings where prisoners, Häftlings, were housed, were known as blocks.</span> <span id="s291">I was assigned to Block 16 in Auschwitz, and Auschwitz , our main camp Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s292">Each barrack, each block, had between three to five people that were in charge of the blocks, and their name, their, their ranks and names would be such.</span> <span id="s293">The head guy was called Blockältester, block elder.</span> <span id="s294">Next to him would be a guy called Stubendienst; "Stube" means room, "Dienst," "assistant."</span> <span id="s295">He was the assistant of the Blockältester and the third guy was the most important guy actually he was the Schreiber or the register and the reason for which he was so important because he would write people he had in each block, and how much artificial tea or artificial coffee was served, how many slices of bread, and how much potato peel, potato soup was served in the evening.</span> <span id="s296">That guy was the one responsible for that.</span> <span id="s297">And everything was done by number.</span> <span id="s298">One of the most cruelest things in any camp was called the Appell, the roll call.</span> <span id="s299">The roll call in Auschwitz, I will, uh, so many people got killed during roll call, murdered.</span> <span id="s300">Many people ran to the wires just, just before roll call.</span> <span id="s301">Of course even that the Nazis didn't let you do, run to the electric wires and fry.</span> <span id="s302">But that was the most cruelest thing.</span> <span id="s303">I, I, that was so bad, they would wake you up with beatings anywhere between four and six o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s304">It depended on how early they got up.</span> <span id="s305">And then, you had to line up in rows of five.</span> <span id="s306">And the whole camp was counted with the main prisoner, who was called the Lagerältester, the Lager elder, who in most cases was either a, a German criminal or came from Poland.</span> <span id="s307">I also want to make one thing very strong, very clear.</span> <span id="s308">The people in charge of the barracks in most cases, and I would say 90% or better, were Germans or Poles, Germans or Poles.</span> <span id="s309">These were the ones with the green triangles - then the green triangles were, were the criminals.</span> <span id="s310">The red ones were the political prisoners.</span> <span id="s311">And we had some red ones also in charge of us.</span> <span id="s312">But these people had better way, better living, better uniforms, underwear, regular boots or shoes.</span> <span id="s313">They had little rooms in each barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Blockältester had his room.</span> <span id="s315">Stubedeinst and Schreiber had a room, and they had food which was organized in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s316">These were the murderers, the murderers among us.</span> <span id="s317">They were prisoners, but these are the killers.</span> <span id="s318">And during roll call they would kill many of us.</span> <span id="s319">Kill us for the simple reason that someone did it in their pants.</span> <span id="s320">They, uh, soiled their pants, soiled their uniform.</span> <span id="s321">Poor guy couldn't hold it.</span> <span id="s322">Dysentery was, was something very, very common.</span> <span id="s323">After two weeks of Auschwitz your eyes would swell up from water.</span> <span id="s324">Your, your whole face would be blown up from water.</span> <span id="s325">Your legs would puff on you because of malnutrition and hygiene.</span> <span id="s326">And then you became a skeleton which was called Muselmann by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s327">After the roll call, and only after the whole camp was counted and the count was correct, only then we were able to go to the labor, slave labor work sites we were assigned to, labor Kommandos they were called.</span> <span id="s328">Every group in Auschwitz as well as all concentration camps was called Kommandos.</span> <span id="s329">I was assigned, well, let me give you the barrack.</span> <span id="s330">There were four people in each tier.</span> <span id="s331">There were three tiers.</span> <span id="s332">Two men to a blanket.</span> <span id="s333">No mattresses, no nothing, just one little blanket for two people.</span> <span id="s334">You never dared to take your uniform or shoes off, clogs off, because if you did the next morning you couldn't find them.</span> <span id="s335">Because during working hours when we were working, many of us lost our clogs in the mud and there, that was it.</span> <span id="s336">No shoes.</span> <span id="s337">You died sooner anyway.</span> <span id="s338">So after the roll call they gave us our first ration of the day which consisted of artificial tea, artificial coffee.</span> <span id="s339">The Nazis called it Ersatz tea, Ersatz cafe, Ersatz's tea, Ersatz's cafe.</span> <span id="s340">Then your Kapo Kommando, Kapo who was in charge of the Kommando, you would have to report to him to be assigned to slave labor.</span> <span id="s341">My first job in Auschwitz was in Buna, which was a munition factory.</span> <span id="s342">We did, uh, artificial tires, rubber, uh, synthetic tires.</span> <span id="s343">There were two main factories like that.</span> <span id="s344">One was the Krupp Werke and one was Buna.</span> <span id="s345">Krupp is well today in American because they sell the coffee makers here.</span> <span id="s346">I see every time I walk by the department store coffee makers I just cringe.</span> <span id="s347">I worked in Buna, I survived Buna I would say almost three months.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Describe the work please.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: O.K.</span> <span id="s350">The Buna work, there were a lot of civilian workers which the Nazis brought from different European countries.</span> <span id="s351">The masters, the foremen, uh, the engineers.</span> <span id="s352">I want to make this very strong that a prisoner could not converse with these civilian workers.</span> <span id="s353">We could not talk with them, although some of us snuck through and tried to, uh, they would throw us sometimes a piece of bread if they weren't afraid, because these, these people too, they had an arm band and the arm band would identify them as civilian workers.</span> <span id="s354">See.</span> <span id="s355">They knew what was going on, but, but they couldn't talk about it.</span> <span id="s356">A lot, there were some from Slovakia, those Yugoslavs, there were Poles, the Polish civilians.</span> <span id="s357">There were some people from France and Germany.</span> <span id="s358">These were the people that were building, that that did the work there.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Actually these were the masters, we were the laborers.</span> <span id="s360">They would tell the SS how many people they need and what they want us to do.</span> <span id="s361">And it was hard labor.</span> <span id="s362">Most of the time you didn't work with tools.</span> <span id="s363">Everything was done with hands.</span> <span id="s364">There was a break for lunch right around noon.</span> <span id="s365">The factory whistle would blow and you'd go outside to lunch.</span> <span id="s366">And prisoners with wagons would bring our noon meal which consisted of the soup.</span> <span id="s367">The soup had mostly potato peels - no meat whatsoever.</span> <span id="s368">Hardly none, no fat whatsoever.</span> <span id="s369">Just a little margarine thrown into it.</span> <span id="s370">And by the time they brought it to us in, to different, you know, they had more groups to bring that.</span> <span id="s371">They brought it on a wagon what they pushed by themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">They didn't come by cart or trucks or anything.</span> <span id="s373">Pushed by prisoners to the work sites.</span> <span id="s374">By the time we got it of course it was cold.</span> <span id="s375">It didn't, you know, and then we go back to work half an hour later.</span> <span id="s376">Back to the same.</span> <span id="s377">I will never forget when they lined us up in rows of five to march back to Auschwitz, to the camp, you would carry fifty, sixty of our comrades on our shoulders, either dead or dying.</span> <span id="s378">Back to Auschwitz, back to the camp.</span> <span id="s379">Because no one was allowed to die outside or be left outside.</span> <span id="s380">Because when we marched through the camp, the gates were open and they would count us there.</span> <span id="s381">Then we go to our own barracks.</span> <span id="s382">But not upstairs to your barrack where you could relax and sit down and lay down.</span> <span id="s383">You stayed in front of your barrack until the whistle blew, the horn blew, Appell.</span> <span id="s384">And the Appell was always yelled out from the first barrack and then like an echo, each barrack had a person that yelled Appell.</span> <span id="s385">There was an SS in charge and he would be in a tower.</span> <span id="s386">He would be the one who would initiate the Appell call.</span> <span id="s387">And like an echo, it would just go throughout Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s388">The Auschwitz itself, the Auschwitz camp itself was not that huge.</span> <span id="s389">So when everyone was lined up, then the Lagerältester, the main prisoner who was in charge of the whole camp, would, the SS hierarchy, the SS officers, they would count from one barrack to the next to the next and the next until all.</span> <span id="s390">And this is how we sound over the phone, over the echo: Block , - Block seven, count correct.</span> <span id="s391">Eight, correct, and so on and so on, correct, until they came to a block where was not correct.</span> <span id="s392">You stood there until the person was found.</span> <span id="s393">In most cases, the person either was somewhere in dying under some, under something, under, under a bunk.</span> <span id="s394">Or he was so sick he didn't care one way or another whether he lives or dies.</span> <span id="s395">Or someone ran to the wires, to the electric wires.</span> <span id="s396">But only after everyone was counted, even those we brought on our shoulders.</span> <span id="s397">He was dropped in front of his barrack on the Appellplatz, on the roll call place.</span> <span id="s398">And that's where he was.</span> <span id="s399">And after the roll call, each barrack had to clean up their sick and, and the dead and carry them to a barrack which was a holding place.</span> <span id="s400">And then the dead ones would be picked up the Leichen (ph) Kommando.</span> <span id="s401">How would I translate leichen (ph) - as a dead, a Kommando that, this was a group of, of, of Jewish prisoners that worked with a wagon.</span> <span id="s402">They would go from barrack to barrack, from camp to camp, to pick up the people that died at work, and those who died over night.</span> <span id="s403">And then they would be taken to the Leichenhaller (ph), to the dead cell, where they were stacked up like sardines.</span> <span id="s404">And the next after that, they would be taken to the gas chambers, or to the pits, whichever was available, and the body would be burned.</span> <span id="s405">I survived Buna...I would say, close to three months.</span> <span id="s406">Then one evening after roll call, a friend of mine from not too far from my home town whom I got to know, he told me that he just got a job, and he said if there's a way to survive Auschwitz, I think I got it.</span> <span id="s407">And there was a try out in front of Block Sixteen, our block.</span> <span id="s408">He was also in Block 16.</span> <span id="s409">He asked me, told me, try out and see if you can make it.</span> <span id="s410">So the try out was held by SS.</span> <span id="s411">They had suitcases there, and they put suitcases on the arm to see how fast you can run.</span> <span id="s412">Of course, we didn't know why.</span> <span id="s413">I made it.</span> <span id="s414">And I was assigned to a group called the Canada Kommando.</span> <span id="s415">It's like the country of, it was named by the Nazis and the prisoners, the Polish prisoners named it Canada Kommando and the reason they named it Canada, because the final solution, of course I knew nothing about final solution in those days.</span> <span id="s416">I knew nothing about anything else far as, other than being in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s417">But the Canada Kommando was, or the organization was called Canada, because we unloaded all incoming Jews from every Nazi-occupied country, European country.</span> <span id="s418">By this time, this was still in 1942, this was like September 1942, this time they were bringing in entire families.</span> <span id="s419">Not just young people.</span> <span id="s420">Families from their homes, families from holding camps like Nováky, and from, uh, Vienna, from from France, from Belgium, from Holland.</span> <span id="s421">We had people coming in from every different, every country.</span> <span id="s422">And the Canada Kommando consisted of start out I would say about four hundred and fifty people.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">And we had two shifts, day shift and night shift.</span> <span id="s424">I was assigned to the day shift, and we would go to the railroad tracks.</span> <span id="s425">This is still Auschwitz I. And before we went to the railroad tracks, the Kapos would line us up, and the SS would tell us in no uncertain term, if there is anyone here that will talk to the people you are unloading other than what you are supposed to tell them.</span> <span id="s426">See they told us you will only tell them, leave you belongings behind in the language that you understand or they understand, that they speak.</span> <span id="s427">Anything else you can't talk to them about.</span> <span id="s428">You can't say anything to anyone else other than what you're supposed to do.</span> <span id="s429">Anyone caught talking to the people that are arriving will be dealt with.</span> <span id="s430">And I've seen many that was being dealt with.</span> <span id="s431">Some of us found their families.</span> <span id="s432">Some of us found their brothers and sisters and parents.</span> <span id="s433">When they unloaded them.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: What happened when they tried to talk to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: They were killed.</span> <span id="s436">The Nazis would take them behind the cattle car after we unloaded the people and slowly torture and murder them.</span> <span id="s437">We carried a poor, a poor, poor soul back to the camp.</span> <span id="s438">Nothing stopped the transport.</span> <span id="s439">In many cases, an SS man depended where the transport came from.</span> <span id="s440">Western European countries for instance which people came from Holland and Belgium.</span> <span id="s441">Well dressed.</span> <span id="s442">When they came, an SS officer would get over a bull horn, and he would tell, ladies and gentlemen, I want to apologize that you've been a little inconvenienced, but you know this is a war on, and we don't have the facilities for to better trains, but you will be soon taken care of.</span> <span id="s443">You are in Auschwitz, that's a work camp and if you work you will live.</span> <span id="s444">Just leave your belongings behind, and everything will be brought to you after you are cleaned, disinfected.</span> <span id="s445">You will get hot tea and so on.</span> <span id="s446">And of course we couldn't do anything about that type of stuff.</span> <span id="s447">Although many of us tried, tried by telling them, don't take, to a mother we'd tell, don't take a child with you because if you do, you're not going to survive.</span> <span id="s448">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s449">(Pause) Some got caught, some people got caught doing that.</span> <span id="s450">Didn't live until the transfer left.</span> <span id="s451">That's when they took care of them.</span> <span id="s452">After, I would say today, then I didn't know, really none of us knew, I would say that approximately 10% of the incoming people with the families were selected to be taken to slave labor.</span> <span id="s453">The rest were taken to the crematorias.</span> <span id="s454">There was, uh, one crematoria at the time only in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s455">This is 1942.</span> <span id="s456">And uh, they couldn't, they couldn't, uh, eliminate so many bodies in the one crematoria so they build trenches, ditches, and that's where they would pour gasoline or some kind of inflammable item on them and that's how they would burn them.</span> <span id="s457">And I want to make clear we didn't see it then.</span> <span id="s458">That we still didn't see, except we knew the boys that worked in Sonderkommando, and these boys, the kind of Kommandos on this Kommando were constantly tried to be, oh we will not, they was isolated.</span> <span id="s459">They lived in the barrack that you were not allowed to go to.</span> <span id="s460">But we already had enough Pole, old-time prisoners so to speak.</span> <span id="s461">Some of us knew how to get away from there and the Sonderkommando knew how to get away from their area, and by bribing certain officials, certain people, you were allowed to communicate between each other.</span> <span id="s462">It was an underground, uh, well, it was called Organizierung, organizing.</span> <span id="s463">The underground, uh, resistance group was always there, from day one.</span> <span id="s464">Some of, some of our boys were the leaders of the group.</span> <span id="s465">They, they, they knew how to organize well.</span> <span id="s466">I was a youngster myself, eighteen years old, ah, not quite.</span> <span id="s467">I was seventeen when I arrived there.</span> <span id="s468">I really, I was part of the group that brought the riches from Canada back to the camp, smuggled it in.</span> <span id="s469">I was the young smuggler.</span> <span id="s470">There was three of us that did that job.</span> <span id="s471">And we would bring it to our families, to our friends, those of us who had sisters and brothers in the camp or mothers in the women's camp.</span> <span id="s472">And there were those who, who knew how to get it to them by bribing some of the Nazi officials.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Can you describe that process, but I think maybe it makes sense to break the tape at this point.</span> <span id="s474">We've got fifty minutes.</span> <span id="s475">Let's break and change the tape and we'll pick up with describing . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s476">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s477">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s478">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Take us back, you were starting to describe the Canada and how it worked.</span> <span id="s480">Can you do that please?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s482">The Canada Kommando, after we unloaded the people, after the Nazis made sure that we go to the tracks, and that we don't speak to no one, the main job was to tell the people and try to keep them calm.</span> <span id="s483">And when, the first thing that would happen after the people were unloaded, in those days there were trucks, dump trucks.</span> <span id="s484">The first people they would get rid of were women with children, the old, the sickly, the ill, uh, the people with, uh, cripples.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">These people would be loaded on to trucks, and taken away right away, and the last people that the Nazis would march were the people that were selected to go to slave labor.</span> <span id="s486">With the belongings, some of it on the ground, but most of it in the cattle cars.</span> <span id="s487">And when these people were taken, men to the men's camp, women to the women's camp, and the same process was dealt with them as it was done with us.</span> <span id="s488">Numbered and shaved and showered and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Assigned to the barracks.</span> <span id="s490">Only then we started to work on the mountains of luggage which was loaded in to trucks and it went to the Canada warehouse.</span> <span id="s491">It was a huge complex where girl Canada Kommandos, mostly Slovakian girl Canada Kommando, worked.</span> <span id="s492">And their job, they were, they were the only ones dressed up almost like, not a civilian but nice, a dress, and they all had babushkas [NB: kerchiefs] tied on their heads, because their heads were shaven.</span> <span id="s493">And these girls worked with the clothing.</span> <span id="s494">Disinfecting of the clothing.</span> <span id="s495">And when we, we, first we would do this.</span> <span id="s496">Load it into trucks.</span> <span id="s497">Unload it into Canada warehouse.</span> <span id="s498">And there were boxes in front of us, SS guards walking back and forth watching us, what we were doing.</span> <span id="s499">And we would take first the valuables would we put into boxes.</span> <span id="s500">Monies in one area, gold and watches and rings and that type of stuff in another box.</span> <span id="s501">And everything had its place.</span> <span id="s502">Then we started to work with the clothes.</span> <span id="s503">Of course, we search the clothing - search the pockets, the shoulders, the shoulder pads were, were, were felt for any, any hard stuff or any soft clothing, or soft monies, and then we had to rip some of it off.</span> <span id="s504">Even shoe heels were opened, because the Nazis found out that the shoe heels the people saved.</span> <span id="s505">And toothpaste, in those days because the toothpaste in Europe was not the greatest, not like America, and they would squeeze and look for diamonds and gold, which was found there.</span> <span id="s506">Then we started to work with the clothing.</span> <span id="s507">Separate the clothing.</span> <span id="s508">Men's, women's and children's clothing separate.</span> <span id="s509">There was a blanket on the ground always where we dumped the clothing.</span> <span id="s510">After the blanket was full enough, you bundle, you put on your shoulder and took it to the girls.</span> <span id="s511">Now, let me make a very strong point.</span> <span id="s512">When these bundles of clothing were taken to the girls, many of us brought food to the girls, in the blankets.</span> <span id="s513">But, there was always an SS man standing by, he was watching of course the girls too.</span> <span id="s514">But the girls, he couldn't watch the girls doing that, because the girls wanted to, working with the clothing.</span> <span id="s515">They were watching what, as we were dumping, if there was any food.</span> <span id="s516">They knew we were bringing food there.</span> <span id="s517">In a way they let us, we played a cat and mouse game with these guys.</span> <span id="s518">If they caught you, you got beaten.</span> <span id="s519">Twenty-five on your behind.</span> <span id="s520">You bend down and then you get twenty-five.</span> <span id="s521">You had to count them, twenty-five.</span> <span id="s522">And you count twenty-five on your buttocks, and the Nazis stop you.</span> <span id="s523">They say, how many did I give you.</span> <span id="s524">And you say, seventeen.</span> <span id="s525">Wrong.</span> <span id="s526">All over again.</span> <span id="s527">This was a sport.</span> <span id="s528">They called it sport.</span> <span id="s529">And that's how we used to bring the food to the girls.</span> <span id="s530">And, information to the girls from the camp.</span> <span id="s531">She had a brother there, or a father there, not working in Canada Kommando but working in Marashar (ph) which was uh, uh, people that work with the bricks and, and, and, mortar, that type of people.</span> <span id="s532">And they would say, your father told me to say this and that, they could keep up and so on, whatever.</span> <span id="s533">And then they would write, they would find pencils. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: How, how did they find pencils?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: From us.</span> <span id="s536">From Canada Kommando.</span> <span id="s537">We had the pencils, the papers, the watches, the clocks, the compasses.</span> <span id="s538">We, we, people from Europe, from France, Belgium, Holland, they used to bring stuff with them that you wouldn't believe.</span> <span id="s539">And of course everyone brought the finest finery they had because they felt they can sell it to save their life.</span> <span id="s540">That was another thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">They even told them, some of them, bring, bring, because winters, you need, a lot of them came with nice fur coats and, you know, it was all gone.</span> <span id="s542">And so, I mean, I mean, so we would bring these girls and the girl would send a note to their father or their brother or their cousin or their husband.</span> <span id="s543">There was one boy who died last year, his name was Fisher.</span> <span id="s544">His wife was working in Canada Kommando, in women's Canada Kommando.</span> <span id="s545">He worked in the men's Canada Kommando.</span> <span id="s546">So that's how these boys, that's how that was.</span> <span id="s547">And I, I worked there, the warehouse and the railroad tracks.</span> <span id="s548">Then I was put on the night shift.</span> <span id="s549">You know, you see, you couldn't survive Auschwitz by yourself.</span> <span id="s550">You had to have a partner.</span> <span id="s551">In Yiddish it was called, in Hebrew it was called shitif (ph).</span> <span id="s552">Shitif (ph) is a partner.</span> <span id="s553">And I had three partners.</span> <span id="s554">Not one of them is alive.</span> <span id="s555">The last one was Fisher, who died uh last year.</span> <span id="s556">And without a partner you couldn't survive.</span> <span id="s557">After we finished a day's work at Canada Kommando, you just couldn't go home, back to the camp, without being searched, first at the work site - lined up, stripped naked in most cases.</span> <span id="s558">And if you weren't stripped naked, your pants dropped because they knew that some of us carried money in the places that is, uh, kind of dark.</span> <span id="s559">Uh, but we do, we also knew how to smuggle out, smuggle the stuff in.</span> <span id="s560">For instance, you in this row, and your friend is in the row in front of you.</span> <span id="s561">You always stood behind your friend, behind your partner.</span> <span id="s562">And as you partner was already searched, you shoved it to him.</span> <span id="s563">And he stepped forward.</span> <span id="s564">And then you were clear.</span> <span id="s565">A lot of times we got caught, beaten and caught.</span> <span id="s566">Let me give you one incident what would happen to the clothing.</span> <span id="s567">After the girls cleaned the clothing, it was bundled again, and carried by us, there was at the Canada warehouse, there was a railroad siding, railroad tracks, with freight cars waiting.</span> <span id="s568">And this was taken by us, loaded into cattle cars, into freight cars, and shipped to Germany.</span> <span id="s569">I remember one incident very, very clearly.</span> <span id="s570">I don't know, I don't know if names, German officers' names mean anything.</span> <span id="s571">Uh, there was one guy named Otto Graff (ph).</span> <span id="s572">There was another guy named Unterscharführer Wiglet (ph).</span> <span id="s573">That's a rank.</span> <span id="s574">He was in charge of the Canada warehouse.</span> <span id="s575">And a young boy from Grodno (ph), a Polish Jewish boy, as he, the one boy stayed in the cattle car, in the freight car, and stacked the bundles, and the other ones like us, we would carry the bundles.</span> <span id="s576">He would fill the car.</span> <span id="s577">This boy from Grodno hid himself with the bundles and the freight train took off.</span> <span id="s578">Now it's evening time, ready to be lined up to go back home.</span> <span id="s579">And we were counted.</span> <span id="s580">Fisher, by the way, was a registrar of the Canada Kommando.</span> <span id="s581">Besides being working there as a Canada Kommando worker, he had the job of registering all the prisoners.</span> <span id="s582">He's counting, he was short one.</span> <span id="s583">Now, they started looking.</span> <span id="s584">First all over the warehouse.</span> <span id="s585">A lot of us would rest sometime without the Nazis knowing in the bundle where the girls worked, on top of the heap, and they would cover us and let us rest.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">And they would take, we had lemons a lot of times from the transports.</span> <span id="s587">You know, the lemons would come, they would make hot lemonade.</span> <span id="s588">Just hot water, but there was a place that cooked the food, you know, that cooked for the Nazis.</span> <span id="s589">And we'd get hot water from there and make lemon, or squeeze the lemon into hot water.</span> <span id="s590">So this boy who was bundled himself up in, in with the clothing, train left and he went with it.</span> <span id="s591">Of course, we didn't know he went with it.</span> <span id="s592">Looking for him, the Nazis are looking for him, not us.</span> <span id="s593">The Nazis and the Kapos are the ones who start looking, searching the, all Canada warehouse.</span> <span id="s594">Can't find him.</span> <span id="s595">All of a sudden Otto Graff, the SS officer, jumps on his motorcycle, goes after the train.</span> <span id="s596">And they bring him back.</span> <span id="s597">As close as I'm sitting to you, there was a tree on the ground.</span> <span id="s598">Otto Graff lines the boy up against the tree and goes to his neck, and shoots him right here, in front of our eyes.</span> <span id="s599">And he tells us right then and then, this is how you will end up if you try to escape.</span> <span id="s600">And we carried the boy from Grundo, I can't think of his last, his first name, Jankl (ph), and carried him back to camp.</span> <span id="s601">Many of us tried.</span> <span id="s602">There's so many people tried and never made it.</span> <span id="s603">September 23rd, 1942.</span> <span id="s604">(Cough).</span> <span id="s605">It's a day that I will never forget.</span> <span id="s606">I was working night shift.</span> <span id="s607">My friends were, some of my partners were working day shift.</span> <span id="s608">September 23, 1942 fell on Erev Yom Kippur, when my mother and my father, my little sister, Marta, and my little brother, Maxmilian, were brought to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s609">My mother, my little brother and my little sister were gassed upon arrival.</span> <span id="s610">My father was assigned to slave labor.</span> <span id="s611">My mother was only 42 years old.</span> <span id="s612">My father was assigned to slave labor, and we met in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s613">Not in the same barrack of course.</span> <span id="s614">My father was assigned to work with horses, being that he, that's what, many times they asked, in most cases they asked how old are you, what is your profession.</span> <span id="s615">So my father was assigned to work with horses, to do some work.</span> <span id="s616">My father took ill, uh, second week of November 1942, and he was put into a Krankenbau, a sick bay, Block 7 in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s617">Auschwitz I, still Auschwitz I. I would come to see my father every night after roll call.</span> <span id="s618">I was not allowed to go inside the barrack, but to the window.</span> <span id="s619">I would yell to him through the window and he would come up.</span> <span id="s620">I will never forget the last time I've seen my father.</span> <span id="s621">He, uh, said to me, and by then he knew there was only two of us left in our family, whatever you do, try to survive and carry on the name.</span> <span id="s622">I came to see him the next evening, and, uh, yelled for him and called for him and he never came out.</span> <span id="s623">Another person came out and he said to me that they took him this morning.</span> <span id="s624">They gassed him this morning.</span> <span id="s625">First of January, first part of January 1943, the Canada Kommando was moved to Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: Can you go back...is it too hard?</span> <span id="s627">A: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: How did you know that your family had arrived.</span> <span id="s629">How did you know that your mother and children were taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: O.K.</span> <span id="s631">The boys that worked the day shift unloaded my family.</span> <span id="s632">One boy from my hometown's name was Yako Buchler, Jacob Buchler, B - U - C - H, Buchler in this country.</span> <span id="s633">Buchler was, I would say, fifteen years older than me who knew my family quite well.</span> <span id="s634">We lived in the same town.</span> <span id="s635">And he told me what happened to my family.</span> <span id="s636">Yako Buchler ended up in Israel after the war.</span> <span id="s637">In 1981 I went to the World Gathering of all us survivors.</span> <span id="s638">(Long pause - crying) and that's when we discussed and we talked about that then too.</span> <span id="s639">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s640">(Long pause - take your time - conversation) O.K. Oh dear, I didn't believe this would happen to me.</span> <span id="s641">(After you went through it, it's real to you.)</span> <span id="s642">Alright.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: So you found out really the details.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Yea, we were partners, and, uh, of course I went to see my father (pause - conversation), and my father's birthday was November 8th.</span> <span id="s645">My father was born in 1898, and my mother was born in 1900.</span> <span id="s646">So in 1942 she was 42 years old and my father was two years older.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">(PAUSE)</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: You wanted to pick up . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: We moved, they moved us from Auschwitz I, [to] what the Nazis called Auschwitz zwei, Auschwitz II, which was Birkenau.</span> <span id="s650">Course we knew nothing about it.</span> <span id="s651">The only thing we knew there were boys working in Birkenau, building a new camp.</span> <span id="s652">As I told you at the outset, Auschwitz I was solid brick.</span> <span id="s653">Birkenau was all wooden huts.</span> <span id="s654">Dirt roads practically, muddy.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">The Canada Kommando was housed in Block 28.</span> <span id="s656">Then the railroad tracks already led into Birkenau.</span> <span id="s657">We didn't have to go back to Auschwitz railroad tracks to unload the victims.</span> <span id="s658">In front of all the people because Birkenau was a camp on two sides, two sides of the road.</span> <span id="s659">Let me explain.</span> <span id="s660">Only one entrance, but here's a road in the middle.</span> <span id="s661">There are camps, rows of camps such like this way, and rows of camps same way this way.</span> <span id="s662">We were, the first camp were the girls.</span> <span id="s663">Wires in front of us.</span> <span id="s664">A ditch in between, you know, wires, in between the camps.</span> <span id="s665">Guard towers all around the complex, all around, constantly manned by SS.</span> <span id="s666">We, the Canada Kommando, were so gutsy already by then, seasoned, knew how to bribe some of the officials, some of the SS, would go close, as close to the, to the wires as possible, and the girls would meet us on the other side.</span> <span id="s667">And we would throw over food to them.</span> <span id="s668">But we paid.</span> <span id="s669">We knew which SS we paid for it.</span> <span id="s670">Because the SS were not allowed to take in front of you, in front of them.</span> <span id="s671">But they, they would say, Canada Kommando , Canada Kommando, what do you have today.</span> <span id="s672">Ye , I have today a gold watch.</span> <span id="s673">And it's all right, you drop it there, so when he, when he is relieved from the post by the other SS man who relieves him, then he tells you where to drop it and he picks it up.</span> <span id="s674">Then he would turn his back and you would throw something to the girl.</span> <span id="s675">All the other guards could see, but the other guards were busy with same way.</span> <span id="s676">One, two, three of us would go to the wire, and they would, you could never go close enough.</span> <span id="s677">You made your, you made the arrangements the day before.</span> <span id="s678">You would say, , I come tomorrow, I got a sister here.</span> <span id="s679">See.</span> <span id="s680">And he says , what are you going to bring me?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">, what would you like?</span> <span id="s682">You know, whatever I find, you know.</span> <span id="s683">And that's how we did it.</span> <span id="s684">I survived because of Canada Kommando.</span> <span id="s685">And uh, if it wouldn't be for that, I probably would be one in six million.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: Tell me about Birkenau.</span> <span id="s687">Birkenau was...</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: Birkenau, as I said, was nothing but mud.</span> <span id="s689">The water was in pipes.</span> <span id="s690">The water came out real thin spritz [Yidd: a spray] of water of pipe.</span> <span id="s691">You couldn't drink the water.</span> <span id="s692">If you drank the water, you died.</span> <span id="s693">But the Canada Kommando were the organizers.</span> <span id="s694">And the Sonderkommando were the organizers because the Sonderkommando got the valuables from the clothing of the people that were gassed.</span> <span id="s695">Canada Kommando got the valuables of the, of the the big valises, and luggage and baggage of the people.</span> <span id="s696">So, we were treated differently by, even by the SS to a degree.</span> <span id="s697">They killed us, they beat us, that part they did with us.</span> <span id="s698">But we were the clog in the machinery.</span> <span id="s699">If you got caught you got killed, regardless who you were.</span> <span id="s700">Where you could be close to the SS who you gave so much because he couldn't pick it up, even the SS work in the Canada Kommando.</span> <span id="s701">But they were hoarders, these people were, were hoarding, uh, uh, valuables, monies and whatever, but they couldn't pick it up themselves.</span> <span id="s702">So they knew.</span> <span id="s703">In Birkenau they treated us differently.</span> <span id="s704">And by the gate some of the SS who were jealous of the other SS who worked the Canada Kommando, they would say, ah, here comes the Canada Kommando, let's search them.</span> <span id="s705">Always at the gate.</span> <span id="s706">And when we searched them, we dropped it, they would take it.</span> <span id="s707">So everybody got a piece of the action, so to speak.</span> <span id="s708">But the camp itself, this was really and truly the death factory.</span> <span id="s709">Birkenau had four crematoriums, two gas chambers, two crematoriums on one side of the road, two gas chambers, two crematoriums on the other side of the road.</span> <span id="s710">And the railroad tracks went right into, close to the crematoria.</span> <span id="s711">And the whole camp could see.</span> <span id="s712">You could see the flames, not just the smoke, you could see the flames from the chimney.</span> <span id="s713">Well, of course when burning the Muselmann, the people that were skeletons, only the smoke.</span> <span id="s714">But when there were fat people, with still fat on them, there were flames.</span> <span id="s715">And a lot of people when they were coming, when they came to Birkenau, they thought, they thought it was a bakery.</span> <span id="s716">The smell, they they, thought it was a bakery, something was baking.</span> <span id="s717">(SHORT PAUSE) April 7, 1944, the first two successful Jewish boys escaped Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s718">First name was Walter Rosenberg--who changed his name after the war to Rudolph Vrba-- and the second was Freddie Wetzler, W - E - T - Z - L - E - R, who kept his name.</span> <span id="s719">And these two boys escaped.</span> <span id="s720">Three days they were buried in an empty camp in Birkenau called the Mexico Camp.</span> <span id="s721">Nazis called it Mexico because when they brought the Russian prisoners there, they didn't have any clothes, so they put blankets on them.</span> <span id="s722">So they called it Mexico Camp.</span> <span id="s723">Mexico.</span> <span id="s724">Nazis had names for everything.</span> <span id="s725">And these boys for three days were buried there, and we had to stay on roll call three days without food, without water, until, the third day the Nazis - would, this is what would happen.</span> <span id="s726">If someone escaped, the siren would blow, everyone had to go out regardless of what time, stand the roll call.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">When the person was found, he would be displayed in front of us.</span> <span id="s728">In most cases they would bring him dead or dying or shot up or tortured, and he always, they would sit him in a chair and they put a sign in his hand, and the sign would read, hello, -------.</span> <span id="s729">Hello, I have returned.</span> <span id="s730">And then they would display this guy in a 36-inch space between the, by the gate.</span> <span id="s731">There was a 36-inch space between, wire, wire space.</span> <span id="s732">They would sit the chair there and as you marched in and out to work, you would have to look at that person.</span> <span id="s733">But with Vrba and with Wetzler, and Walter Rosenberg who changed his name to Vrba, they didn't catch them.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">They successfully escaped.</span> <span id="s735">We didn't believe it ourselves that they escaped.</span> <span id="s736">Because I remember one time, three Polish Jewish boys escaped, and they were gone for two days.</span> <span id="s737">And they got them.</span> <span id="s738">The Polish population would turn them in.</span> <span id="s739">See.</span> <span id="s740">They, we didn't have any friends even then outside.</span> <span id="s741">And they brought these three Jewish boys in, and the law, the policy of the camp was such that when there was someone brought back who escaped, there was a public hanging.</span> <span id="s742">The whole camp had to be involved in that, had to watch it.</span> <span id="s743">And Nazi would beat his drum, and the other guy behind him would read a, read a sentence, why he had sinned against Third Reich.</span> <span id="s744">And who were the people who did the hanging?</span> <span id="s745">They would take prisoners, put hoods over them, over the prisoners, that did, not only the ones that were hanged, but did the hanging.</span> <span id="s746">And these three Jews, Polish Jewish boys were hung.</span> <span id="s747">In public.</span> <span id="s748">There were, Sundays were the hanging days.</span> <span id="s749">That was common, very common.</span> <span id="s750">There was a single gallows that was, they built the gallows for more than one.</span> <span id="s751">And some of them sang and yelled the last words.</span> <span id="s752">You know, revenge, and I remember one Polish Jewish boy said, , the Polish national anthem.</span> <span id="s753">He started yelling it.</span> <span id="s754">I stayed in Birkenau until October 21st, 1944, when again, an order came in the middle of the night that we're being transferred.</span> <span id="s755">Pitch dark, you couldn't see two feet in front of you.</span> <span id="s756">Of course, the darkness was because of the bombers come.</span> <span id="s757">You could hear the bombers already then.</span> <span id="s758">You could hear fire, gunfire.</span> <span id="s759">We didn't know anything really.</span> <span id="s760">We were, the only thing we knew how, when the war was bad, when it got worse, it got worse for us.</span> <span id="s761">Less food, more beatings, more killings, more eliminating, more, more, uh, trying to, uh, cover up, more, the evidence.</span> <span id="s762">Of course, we didn't know that either.</span> <span id="s763">We just seen when it was bad for them, it was worse for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: . . . in '44.</span> <span id="s765">We have a picture here of you with a Hungarian transport.</span> <span id="s766">Can you talk a little about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s768">Of course, I didn't know this photo existed.</span> <span id="s769">This is from an original from the Nazi documentation department.</span> <span id="s770">This photo was taken in May, May 1944.</span> <span id="s771">And it's a photo I'm one, I don't know if I can point it out which one I am.</span> <span id="s772">Which, what, I can't tell from this side.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Turn it around and find yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: Oh, excuse me.</span> <span id="s775">OK.</span> <span id="s776">Here on this end, I'm one of the persons unloading the belongings of Hungarian Jews that were brought there, May 1944, that already been gassed.</span> <span id="s777">This came from the zunda (ph), from the gas chambers, from the undressing rooms.</span> <span id="s778">This photo, by the way, was given to me by historian, Czech historian, Czechoslovakian historian, Jewish man.</span> <span id="s779">His name is Erich Kulka.</span> <span id="s780">Erich Kulka had this photo and he used this at one time in Germany in a court to identify a Nazi.</span> <span id="s781">And there were two boys in there that were cut in, in, in, in the court, and I was already living in Detroit at the time of course at the time when this was going on.</span> <span id="s782">Detroit, Michigan.</span> <span id="s783">And there, here, here we are unloading the belongings of, uh, Hungarian Jews that were brought to Auschwitz, Birkenau actually.</span> <span id="s784">This photo was given to me, uh, in, uh, June 1981 when I attended the, uh, World Gathering of holocaust survivors in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s785">Erich Kulka lives in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s786">He knew I was alive, and when I got back to my hotel, there was a message for me to call Erich Kulka with a phone number.</span> <span id="s787">Of course, I didn't know who Erich Kulka was, because Erich Kulka's name in Auschwitz...he changed his name after the war.</span> <span id="s788">His name was Schöen, S - C - H - O with two dots - E - N.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: (inaudible)</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: Erich Kulka, as I told you, was named Schöen.</span> <span id="s791">He's from the Czech part of Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">He was brought to Auschwitz, I believe it was November 1942, and he came from Neuengamme, from another concentration camp.</span> <span id="s793">Erich Kulka and I became friends in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s794">I was one of the persons that would bring Erich Kulka food and material to give to the people.</span> <span id="s795">Erich Kulka had as workers, as a, as an electrician.</span> <span id="s796">He doubles his job in the camp, locksmith; he did locksmith work, he and an another person named Otto Kraus.</span> <span id="s797">And I got friendly with these two boys, not just myself but other boys.</span> <span id="s798">And we would bring them the materials to help our people.</span> <span id="s799">And Erich had more of a freedom, not a freedom in Auschwitz, but he could move because of his assignment as a locksmith, he could go from camp to camp.</span> <span id="s800">Of course, he couldn't go away from the complex but, because it was all locked in, fenced in.</span> <span id="s801">So when I had the message to call Erich Kulka, I called the name and then he told me, "Mišo, my name is Erich Schöen.</span> <span id="s802">My name was Erich Schöen."</span> <span id="s803">What he did, he changed his name.</span> <span id="s804">Took his wife's maiden name.</span> <span id="s805">His wife was killed.</span> <span id="s806">She also was in Auschwitz and then transferred to another camp in Germany, Stuttgart, Germany, and she was murdered there.</span> <span id="s807">She died there.</span> <span id="s808">As I told you, I stayed in Auschwitz until October 1944.</span> <span id="s809">We were put into cattle cars.</span> <span id="s810">We thought for sure that's the end of us.</span> <span id="s811">Two other boys, two of my partners, Buchler was one and Ziedler (ph) was the other one, were also taken.</span> <span id="s812">We came to Oranienburg, which is Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s813">They didn't have any room for us.</span> <span id="s814">They had to let us sleep on the street of the camp.</span> <span id="s815">And the American bombers and the British bombers were bombing Berlin.</span> <span id="s816">Sachsenhausen is very, very close to Berlin.</span> <span id="s817">And we didn't know it then of course.</span> <span id="s818">We only knew, the only thing we knew we were in a camp and what's going to happen to us next we didn't know.</span> <span id="s819">From there, because there was no room for us, we went to Dachau.</span> <span id="s820">We got to Dachau, practically the same thing.</span> <span id="s821">Not much room there either.</span> <span id="s822">So the last camp they took us to was called Landsberg.</span> <span id="s823">And there we stood until March 1945 when the Allied were very close, I don't know how many kilometers, but they were close.</span> <span id="s824">We heard the bombs.</span> <span id="s825">We heard, uh, we heard the shootings.</span> <span id="s826">So they started to evacuate that camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: When they evacuate, tell me about Landsberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: Landsberg.</span> <span id="s829">Landsberg was also a dirty wooden camp built like in bunkers.</span> <span id="s830">The, the barracks were very low, built like in, like, like in down...almost like bunkers.</span> <span id="s831">Landsberg was horribly, terribly lice infected.</span> <span id="s832">Which all camps were by the way.</span> <span id="s833">You could put your hand under you arm and just throw lice out like this.</span> <span id="s834">But Landsberg had, had awful diseases.</span> <span id="s835">No crematories, no burial places.</span> <span id="s836">Just dig a ditch and that was it.</span> <span id="s837">And you carried these bodies like, like sardines.</span> <span id="s838">And we did nothing in Landsberg as far as labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: No Canada Kommando?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: Uh, there was no Canada Kommando.</span> <span id="s841">We went out to work on farms.</span> <span id="s842">OK.</span> <span id="s843">The farms, we worked the German farms.</span> <span id="s844">They didn't have much.</span> <span id="s845">They had potato rows, you know, covered with dirt.</span> <span id="s846">That's how, I worked in that.</span> <span id="s847">And the food was hardly non-existent.</span> <span id="s848">And when we started to move from Landsberg, there were a bunch of German prisoners in Landsberg.</span> <span id="s849">And I know of two of them who were given SS uniforms, to be our guards.</span> <span id="s850">(Laughter) I remember the two, Kapo Hantz (ph).</span> <span id="s851">His name was, he was a Kapo, Kapo Hantz.</span> <span id="s852">He got a German uniform, he became the guard.</span> <span id="s853">They gave him a rifle.</span> <span id="s854">And we started marching.</span> <span id="s855">And we marching and some of the older prisoners, uh, older German guards, as we were marching we had, there was a wagon always behind to pick up the bodies.</span> <span id="s856">As we were marching, you know, picking up the bodies, the Germans would come to you and they say, sign that I was good to you.</span> <span id="s857">Sign that I helped you.</span> <span id="s858">You know, I gave you bread.</span> <span id="s859">And of course none of, none of us did.</span> <span id="s860">You know, believe me, none of us did.</span> <span id="s861">By then we, we had a feeling either we going to be all die, all killed, or some of us will survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">During an American air raid, daytime air raid, American bombers come down bomb daytime, we all run in the ditches--including Nazis--and we made a human SOS.</span> <span id="s863">And myself and two other boys ran for the woods.</span> <span id="s864">I never forget that human SOS.</span> <span id="s865">That was so beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: Did the bombers move away?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: The bombers didn't go after us.</span> <span id="s868">The bombers were hitting some, some target.</span> <span id="s869">They had a target because we could see.</span> <span id="s870">The bombers were going real low.</span> <span id="s871">So, I disappeared with the other two boys.</span> <span id="s872">And no one even cared anymore then.</span> <span id="s873">Because we've seen Nazis running.</span> <span id="s874">We've seen, in the woods, we've seen Nazis running.</span> <span id="s875">We got into a farm house.</span> <span id="s876">And we got old civilian clothes, whatever we could find, and shed the clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: Were there people in the farm house?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: (inaudible) We knocked on the, you know, they, the Germans knew already who we were then you know because they were afraid of, they were afraid of their own shadows.</span> <span id="s879">Your know, there were no men, no men folk home.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: They let you in?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: They let us.</span> <span id="s882">We got some shirt, a side room.</span> <span id="s883">I got a shirt, big farmer's shirt (laughter) and a pair of old boots that didn't fit.</span> <span id="s884">And that's how we walked around.</span> <span id="s885">Took two weeks about when I was picked up by the United States Army.</span> <span id="s886">Seven - yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: What did you do in those two weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: Just walked the woods and eat whatever we could find.</span> <span id="s889">Knock on farm, farm windows and farm doors.</span> <span id="s890">Cooked potatoes in the wooded area.</span> <span id="s891">Seen Nazis running left and right.</span> <span id="s892">Soldiers running with no rifles at all.</span> <span id="s893">Uh, we seen them going without any, any of their markings, just plain uniform.</span> <span id="s894">They threw away their, their sergeant's stripes, whatever they had.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: Tell me . . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: Three GI's in a jeep met me on the street, on, on the road.</span> <span id="s897">And I went with them.</span> <span id="s898">They took me with them.</span> <span id="s899">The other two boys went east someplace.</span> <span id="s900">They disappeared.</span> <span id="s901">We split.</span> <span id="s902">And I was picked up which was then the 774 Tank Battalion.</span> <span id="s903">These boys brought me with them, cleaned me up, gave me a pair of fatigues.</span> <span id="s904">Didn't speak a word of English, not one word.</span> <span id="s905">But one of the boys was a Polish national.</span> <span id="s906">He was born in United States, Chicago boy, and he spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s907">And one was a cook in the Army, the other guy.</span> <span id="s908">And they took me in and I worked as, as, in the field kitchen, Army field kitchen.</span> <span id="s909">And I stayed with this outfit from Germany to Czechoslovakia, all the way to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s910">From Czechoslovakia, this outfit was on the way back.</span> <span id="s911">In World War II there were point system.</span> <span id="s912">They had enough points to go home.</span> <span id="s913">The Army point system.</span> <span id="s914">If you had, if you've been in the Army such and such long time, if you have so many children, you have points for each child.</span> <span id="s915">And this outfit was on the way back home.</span> <span id="s916">So I'm with them all the way through.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: Great.</span> <span id="s919">Well, I learned English real quick, real fast.</span> <span id="s920">While I was with the United States forces, of course the Stars and Stripes were a great teacher for me, and I remember there was a teacher in this outfit who was teaching me English.</span> <span id="s921">And we lived in tents by the way.</span> <span id="s922">There were no, no barracks.</span> <span id="s923">Army tents and this, they would teach me English.</span> <span id="s924">This guy made me read the Stars and Stripes aloud.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: The newspaper Stars and Stripes?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: The newspaper Stars and Stripes.</span> <span id="s927">And then he would tell, teach me how to write, how to read English, how to pronounce some of the hard words.</span> <span id="s928">And I do have a good ear for languages.</span> <span id="s929">I pick them up quite, quite easily.</span> <span id="s930">I stayed with this unit.</span> <span id="s931">Of course, food was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: What was it like to taste the first food and know you could have it, as much as you wanted?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: Well, uh, when you line up for chow, which was Army chow, we all got mess kits.</span> <span id="s934">And I was like a soldier, I had everything what they had.</span> <span id="s935">And you line up and in the morning.</span> <span id="s936">In those days we had fresh eggs because it was all farms, and the GI's would pick up the eggs from where ever they, whatever community they were at.</span> <span id="s937">They would send out a mess sergeant with someone to look for food.</span> <span id="s938">And of course the Army had food shipped to them.</span> <span id="s939">We had powder eggs, but in, in this unit, because most field units they would find chickens, they would find eggs, in, in the farms.</span> <span id="s940">And when you had enough food, when they were cooking, you could eat all you wanted and the baked biscuits and the baked rolls, you know.</span> <span id="s941">You couldn't believe your eyes.</span> <span id="s942">And what, what, how much they would throw away.</span> <span id="s943">What was this, waste so much, I just, just couldn't understand it.</span> <span id="s944">You know, coming from where I came from, I see.</span> <span id="s945">Then we would get fresh fruit, fresh oranges, they would ship us bananas.</span> <span id="s946">I said, oh, my God.</span> <span id="s947">You know.</span> <span id="s948">It was amazing.</span> <span id="s949">Now.</span> <span id="s950">So I stayed with this unit all the way through Germany, Czechoslovakia, then back.</span> <span id="s951">Oh, we were stationed once in, one part in Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s952">OK.</span> <span id="s953">Nuremberg is where the big stadium is where Hitler, the Olympics.</span> <span id="s954">This is where he had the big, huge, huge stadium.</span> <span id="s955">And the GI's used to play baseball there.</span> <span id="s956">So we used to go watch the baseball games there.</span> <span id="s957">Which I knew nothing about.</span> <span id="s958">(Laughter) I knew nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: Describe your first contact with American baseball.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: Well, I, there was a guy named Shoemaker, a soldier in my outfit, and he would play catch with these guys before game, you know.</span> <span id="s961">This was, these were guys that were good, good baseball players.</span> <span id="s962">You couldn't prove it by me, but they were good baseball players.</span> <span id="s963">And Shoemaker had always had a baseball mitt with him.</span> <span id="s964">He came, traveled with that, he carried it all the time with him.</span> <span id="s965">And he would play, he would play catch with the guys.</span> <span id="s966">And I was a soccer player.</span> <span id="s967">I didn't know anything about baseball.</span> <span id="s968">I would kick the darn thing.</span> <span id="s969">(Laughter) And I found out you can't kick a baseball.</span> <span id="s970">Real quick.</span> <span id="s971">And then we would go to Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s972">We went to Nuremberg to watch a baseball game, a real baseball game.</span> <span id="s973">Yeah.</span> <span id="s974">And of course, what I was always most afraid of was doctors.</span> <span id="s975">That was the biggest thing that scared me.</span> <span id="s976">Dentists was most.</span> <span id="s977">Fear of dentists.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: How did you deal with it?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: Ah, very badly.</span> <span id="s980">They took me to a dentist.</span> <span id="s981">As a matter of fact, the Shoemaker guy took me to a dentist.</span> <span id="s982">Because I had an abscessed tooth.</span> <span id="s983">And all my gums were pretty well dried up, uh, from malnutrition; and they took me to a dentist.</span> <span id="s984">And I remember, they gave me a capsule and I took the capsule and opened it and took the powder in my hand out, you know.</span> <span id="s985">I didn't know how to deal with it, the guy didn't tell me what to do with it.</span> <span id="s986">That was horrible.</span> <span id="s987">And I ran away from the dentist chair I was so scared.</span> <span id="s988">I never forget that.</span> <span id="s989">I ran away from the dentist chair.</span> <span id="s990">When we got back to France. . . Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: How did they fix the abscessed tooth if you couldn't stay in the chair?</span> <span id="s992">A: They didn't.</span> <span id="s993">They didn't.</span> <span id="s994">They didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: You lost the tooth?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: Oh yeah, lost most of them.</span> <span id="s997">They didn't.</span> <span id="s998">I was deathly afraid of it.</span> <span id="s999">I was so much afraid of doctors.</span> <span id="s1000">I never trusted any of them.</span> <span id="s1001">Never trusted, as a matter of fact, the biggest problem was not trusting anyone.</span> <span id="s1002">Always, always being afraid there's someone behind you.</span> <span id="s1003">Some, you always figure the Nazis will come after you.</span> <span id="s1004">You looked, you always look behind you.</span> <span id="s1005">It was in the camps, if you didn't take you cap off in front of a Nazi you got beat.</span> <span id="s1006">If you did take your cap off in front of a Nazi you got beat.</span> <span id="s1007">They would, they would call you all the time and ask you, come over here.</span> <span id="s1008">Do you know what day it is?</span> <span id="s1009">They would always pick a Jewish holiday.</span> <span id="s1010">But if you told them you knew what day it was, if you didn't tell them what day, it didn't make any difference.</span> <span id="s1011">Same thing.</span> <span id="s1012">So my fear was with me a long time.</span> <span id="s1013">My trust didn't come back to me for, oh my God, for, forever almost.</span> <span id="s1014">But I was very, very lucky that I was picked up in the outfit I was picked up in.</span> <span id="s1015">Because when we got back to France, we came to a camp called Camp Lucky Strike.</span> <span id="s1016">And Camp Lucky Strike was a camp for all the GI's that were on the way home.</span> <span id="s1017">It was like a tent city.</span> <span id="s1018">The whole camp was loaded with tents, and the GI's would stay here until their their turn came to be taken to Le Havre, France to be put on a ship to go home.</span> <span id="s1019">So one of the guys took a picture of me and this, this is me in the Army, and this was the (conversation) this was the, the first American picture I have of myself in an American uniform.</span> <span id="s1020">And I stayed in this Camp Lucky Strike until September 1945 when my outfit was taken to Le Havre, France and me with them, to be put on a ship, a troop carrier called "James Parker".</span> <span id="s1021">And our commanding officer whose name was Lt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Colonel Conrad B. Sturgis (ph), a West Point man, he practically made the decision to put me on the ship with the unit, with unit and take me home.</span> <span id="s1023">Home where?</span> <span id="s1024">Oh, by the way, I'm going to have to retrack a little bit because I didn't tell you.</span> <span id="s1025">By then, I already knew of the family I had left.</span> <span id="s1026">My father's youngest sister lived in Detroit, Michigan.</span> <span id="s1027">I didn't know, I knew she was in America, but I didn't know where, see.</span> <span id="s1028">But nothing was done yet in 1945, so . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: How could you have found out where she was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: Well, I gave the Army her name, her married name, because this is where by sister went to school in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1031">She was from Vienna.</span> <span id="s1032">And she arrived in the United States in 1939.</span> <span id="s1033">And my father's younger sister whose name was Ethel Shotten, S - H - O - T - T - E - N.</span> <span id="s1034">She was married to a man named Rudy, Rudolph Shotten.</span> <span id="s1035">So when I gave the names to the Army, the Army and the Red Cross started to look.</span> <span id="s1036">Put ads in the paper.</span> <span id="s1037">Here we have this and this guy, born such and such a place, area, and then I would say about two or three months later, I get a letter from my aunt.</span> <span id="s1038">Where she lived.</span> <span id="s1039">So the commanding officer came to me and said, oh, you got your ad, you know.</span> <span id="s1040">What we'll do with you, we'll put you on a ship and when you, we're going to Boston, they were originally, the ship, the, the United, the, the force, the the outfit was going to Boston.</span> <span id="s1041">And they were going to be mustered out.</span> <span id="s1042">In the Army, they muster you out.</span> <span id="s1043">And then, from there you go to, to Detroit and report yourself to, to Immigration Authorities he told.</span> <span id="s1044">Well, we had a captain whose name was Captain Yogurling (ph); and he was a lawyer, an attorney at home.</span> <span id="s1045">And he says, "Don't do this.</span> <span id="s1046">Because if you take him there, they're going to deport him.</span> <span id="s1047">He has to have papers and everything else."</span> <span id="s1048">So what he did, before the ship sailed, they got my belongings, my duffel bag and everything that I owned, and the boys took up a collection.</span> <span id="s1049">And I got, we had already changed our money, our money was already changed into American dollars . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: Did you have money?</span> <span id="s1051">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: Where did you get it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: Well, from the Army would give me "X" amount of dollars, you know, from the, from the cooks and from the captains.</span> <span id="s1054">See, I worked the mess, the mess hall for the officers; and the...the colonel took a liking to me and, and he called me "Czechsky (ph)."</span> <span id="s1055">So I was like his orderly so to speak.</span> <span id="s1056">So they they took up a collection, and, and I had enough dollars to you know.</span> <span id="s1057">So Captain Yogurling calls Camp Home Run which is in Le Havre, we were in Le Havre already then, now we are at the docks, OK, to be shipped.</span> <span id="s1058">Calls up the commanding officer in Le Havre, and they take me in there.</span> <span id="s1059">And he says since you've got your aunt here, in the meanwhile nothing was done with my aunt other than a couple of letters, and I wrote to her and she wrote to me, and my, this was in September of, uh, uh, and I'd already found her.</span> <span id="s1060">November 29th is my birthday so my aunt sent me a, a Bulova watch for my birthday.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">So that was my birthday present from my aunt, my first present.</span> <span id="s1062">And they say they're working, I shouldn't be impatient and so on.</span> <span id="s1063">In the meanwhile, while I'm in Camp Home Run, October 1945, myself and a, a Spaniard, a Spanish national, two of us, was sworn into the United States forces.</span> <span id="s1064">We were sworn in by, by a major.</span> <span id="s1065">A colonel.</span> <span id="s1066">By a colonel, I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s1067">And I had the papers for me ... I showed them to you.</span> <span id="s1068">And when we were sworn in, and, uh, the other person, person's name was Raymond de la Fontana Quintas (ph).</span> <span id="s1069">The only thing they made an error.</span> <span id="s1070">They swore us in under regular Army form.</span> <span id="s1071">So, there are two Armies, the peace Army is the United States Armed, you know, the Army that you, you, you are, uh, have to join when something happens like in the war you, you join, you are forced to join the service.</span> <span id="s1072">You, you are being, uh, uh, elected to join the service.</span> <span id="s1073">Like during the war, they, they take us in.</span> <span id="s1074">And the other thing is the regular Army you have to be, a foreign, a non-citizen cannot join the regular Army.</span> <span id="s1075">So the War Department sent our papers back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Attached to the papers were the proper papers.</span> <span id="s1077">But in the meanwhile my aunt was working on my, uh, coming to the United States.</span> <span id="s1078">So the colonel says to me, you don't want to join now, cause you're going to be shipped to the Pacific to replace the forces.</span> <span id="s1079">So this, that's what happened to Raymond de la Fontana Quintas.</span> <span id="s1080">He was sent to Far East and he became a regular Army person.</span> <span id="s1081">He joined after, I mean he joined the Army of the United States, and after that, he become a citizen, boom, right, right now.</span> <span id="s1082">After you, after you're sworn you're now a - they also swore you in as a citizen in those days, in war time.</span> <span id="s1083">So, I didn't join.</span> <span id="s1084">But they gave me a job at Camp Home Run, in the, in the camp, to be in charge of the officers' laundry and dry cleaning.</span> <span id="s1085">And dry cleaning was done with gasoline.</span> <span id="s1086">You soak it in gasoline, and then you hang it up.</span> <span id="s1087">That was the dry cleaning.</span> <span id="s1088">Laundry was done in, in, in the wash tubs, and I was in charge of that.</span> <span id="s1089">And I stayed there until my aunt wrote a letter that there is a very strong possibility that I will be able to come sometime in the Spring of 1946.</span> <span id="s1090">They're working on it.</span> <span id="s1091">The only thing is she said you need, you need all the papers.</span> <span id="s1092">You got to have a passport, you got to have a birth certificate.</span> <span id="s1093">And I had none of that, see.</span> <span id="s1094">So the Army gave me a furlough to go my home town.</span> <span id="s1095">And that wasn't easy either, because I was in France, and Slovakia was in a Russian zone.</span> <span id="s1096">So I got to Regensburg, Germany, and there the Army, uh, applied for the Russian zone, to let me come, to let me go across to Slovakia on the train.</span> <span id="s1097">I come to my home town, which is Topol_any.</span> <span id="s1098">Go to City Hall, tell them who I was.</span> <span id="s1099">They tell me, "All Jewish records were destroyed."</span> <span id="s1100">But they knew who I was.</span> <span id="s1101">So I got nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Got back on the train.</span> <span id="s1103">Came to Paris.</span> <span id="s1104">Went to the Czechoslovakian Embassy; and they gave me a passport, no birth certificate.</span> <span id="s1105">Went back to Le Havre, to Camp Home Run; told the captain what happened, told the chaplain what happened, and they all started to work on all my papers.</span> <span id="s1106">I got a judicial record from the Army, a record of what I did in the Army, and that the uh Ambassador should uh accept this because of I, and my stay in a concentration camp and all the records were destroyed.</span> <span id="s1107">However, passport I got from Czechoslovakian Embassy.</span> <span id="s1108">That's the only legal paper.</span> <span id="s1109">You know how I got this passport?</span> <span id="s1110">I gave the guy a carton of cigarettes, I remember that.</span> <span id="s1111">And I needed three photos.</span> <span id="s1112">So in Paris he tells me where there is a photographer on the street.</span> <span id="s1113">Right around the, the Embassy is this, you get three photos over there.</span> <span id="s1114">And I, I looked like a scarecrow in Army uniform and, and, and in fact, I, I, I, this is the uniform I took a picture, my passport picture in.</span> <span id="s1115">So I ran, you know, this this is the kind of uniform, this, this is what, this is a little better.</span> <span id="s1116">The other one I look like a scarecrow.</span> <span id="s1117">So I got this, everything together.</span> <span id="s1118">Come back to the Ambassador.</span> <span id="s1119">I gave him a carton of cigarettes, he gave me the passport.</span> <span id="s1120">Went back to Le Havre from Paris.</span> <span id="s1121">Now I'm ready to go.</span> <span id="s1122">Now I'm waiting for my aunt to get all, everything together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: We have three minutes.</span> <span id="s1124">Let's pull it together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: OK.</span> <span id="s1126">So what happened, I got to Le Havre.</span> <span id="s1127">The captain made arrangement for me to go outside of Paris, a place called Maison Lafitte, to live with a Red Cross Field Director, waiting for my aunt's, all, everything the Army had done for me.</span> <span id="s1128">And May 10th, 1946, I got on a plane.</span> <span id="s1129">Came to New York, came to some friends that knew my family.</span> <span id="s1130">From there I went to Detroit.</span> <span id="s1131">And about a year later, I had met a young woman, young lady, also survivor, whom I married a year later.</span> <span id="s1132">We are now the proud parents of four children and four grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1133">And as we say, uh, among the survivors, from ashes to life.</span> <span id="s1134">(Pause) This was tougher than, uh, tougher than talking, than lecturing, I'll tell you.</span> <span id="s1135">(PAUSE) I couldn't take any more of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">(Conversation)</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: Could we just do the pictures?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: What pictures do you want to do?</span> <span id="s1139">Q: All the ones . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: We didn't do this one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: Hold that one up just so he gets it and describe what it is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: Uh, this what the Nazis called the Orchestra Platz, the Orchestra Place where the band, the finest musician, uh, Jewish musicians, from every European country, would play at the entrance to the, in and out of the camp, as we were marching to and from work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">(Technical Conversation - Pauses)</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: Which one should I show next?</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: Uh, let's do it in order.</span> <span id="s1146">Let's do the camp . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: How's is that.</span> <span id="s1148">This is the original crematorium in Auschwitz I. Which by the way is still standing.</span> <span id="s1149">Very primitive.</span> <span id="s1150">The ones they built after that were the death factories in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1151">Auschwitz II.</span> <span id="s1152">Oh, there's a small photo--I don't know if you can do anything with that at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION This was the first American unit that I ran across that, I got this in Dachau, outside of Dachau, and one of the GI's gave it to me.</span> <span id="s1154">And I've been carrying it ever since.</span> <span id="s1155">As you can see, the cattle cars there, this is where all the bodies were unloaded.</span> <span id="s1156">Of course, they un, unloaded by the, the Germans.</span> <span id="s1157">The GI's brought the Germans to, to show them what what was going on, like they didn't know.</span> <span id="s1158">(Pause) Well, this is the entrance to hell.</span> <span id="s1159">This is Auschwitz, entrance to Auschwitz, "Arbeit Macht Frei," which by the way, Birkenau also had a sign, "Arbeit Macht Frei."</span> <span id="s1160">They all had "Arbeit Macht Frei."</span> <span id="s1161">But this is the first one that I've seen, I'm, that I came to.</span> <span id="s1162">(TECHNICAL CONVERSATION) All right.</span> <span id="s1163">This - the happy times, the American Army and Mike Vogel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: Next picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: I don't think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: You have one more.</span> <span id="s1167">Of you in the Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: Oh, the tent city!</span> <span id="s1169">My goodness gracious.</span> <span id="s1170">Well, I should have shown that one first.</span> <span id="s1171">This is in Camp Lucky Strike.</span> <span id="s1172">This in France, in a farm country in France, that we waited for to be taken to Le Havre, France to be loaded on to ships to go back to the United States, except I stayed for another few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">End of tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">TAPE # 3</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: We're picking up with the third tape, and we're going back, and you had started to tell me during the break, uh, about Heinrich Himmler coming to the camp.</span> <span id="s1177">Could you tell me about Himmler and tell me about the preparations for him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: Yes, uh, this was before Birkenau was built.</span> <span id="s1179">Actually, they were building Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1180">We didn't know it, I didn't know it at the time, what was going on.</span> <span id="s1181">But Himmler came there, and before Himmler came to Auschwitz, the camp had to be cleaned from, from top to bottom.</span> <span id="s1182">The streets of the camp were swept.</span> <span id="s1183">They got rid of all the Muselmanns, all the skeleton-type people.</span> <span id="s1184">And we all went to be disinfected.</span> <span id="s1185">We didn't know why.</span> <span id="s1186">We didn't know who Himmler, we didn't even know, we knew of Himmler from before, but we didn't know why he was coming or what was the reason.</span> <span id="s1187">The only thing we knew that it was a big, big Nazi officer coming and we were beaten by our Blockältesters to get, get to the disinfectant area.</span> <span id="s1188">And this is the way they disinfected us.</span> <span id="s1189">They would take our clothes and put them, take them away from us and gave us new sets of striped uniforms with our numbers sewn back on the left breast and the right, right pant leg.</span> <span id="s1190">And we went to a disinfecting area.</span> <span id="s1191">Small shower, shower with hardly, hardly any water pressure, but they would swoosh (ph), swoosh (ph), swoosh (ph), spritz (ph) us, uh, with some sort of a disinfectant, and then they would dress up, and when the time came from, for Heinrich Himmler, for the big-wig Nazi, to come to Auschwitz, to the, right to the camp, we were all lined up in front of our barracks, in front of our blocks.</span> <span id="s1192">The Blockältester made sure that we're standing straight, we're clean, and he found one Polish Jew, Jewish boy, one of the buttons was missing of his tunic, of his jacket.</span> <span id="s1193">And this Blockältester, Mietek was his name, M - I - E - T - E - K. Mietek.</span> <span id="s1194">He was a murderer.</span> <span id="s1195">He was a Polish, uh, uh, murderer.</span> <span id="s1196">He was our Blockältester, and he, he pride himself that he could kill one person with a blow to the proper area in his neck.</span> <span id="s1197">So he could kill him.</span> <span id="s1198">And this poor, poor Jewish prisoner, Jewish boy got murdered with one blow and taken away from there.</span> <span id="s1199">And the camp was standing still, holding for Heinrich Himmler to come and inspect the camp.</span> <span id="s1200">I will never forget.</span> <span id="s1201">I, I, in my time in Auschwitz, Himmler came twice to Auschwitz, but I will never forget with this happening in my block, this, this murder in front of my block when Mietek, Mietek murdered him.</span> <span id="s1202">And there were number, there were more than one person like that.</span> <span id="s1203">There was one other, a German prisoner they used to call Monkey Tin (ph).</span> <span id="s1204">He was another one.</span> <span id="s1205">Mietek and Monkey Tin would have a bet who can kill more people with one blow.</span> <span id="s1206">And that's...this was Himmler's visit to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">That's how they cleaned up the camp.</span> <span id="s1208">First, they got rid of all the people that didn't look well enough.</span> <span id="s1209">The streets were swept, the barracks were cleaned.</span> <span id="s1210">Of course, Himmler never went into the barrack.</span> <span id="s1211">The only thing, he came is just march with the Lagerältester whose name was Rudolph Hoess by the way.Rudolph Hoess was the commandant of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1212">And this commandant of Auschwitz, Mr. Rudolph Hoess, would walk with Heinrich Himmler and other lieutenants, their... their lieutenants, and just go from barrack to barrack on the 2 Rudolph Hoess was the commandant of Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">inspection.</span> <span id="s1214">Yes ma'am.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: We would also be talking about Mengele and could you tell us about your meetings with Mengele?</span> <span id="s1216">I gather you did so often.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: Yes, well, Mengele arrived to Birkenau, not to Auschwitz, in May 1943.</span> <span id="s1218">I still remember when, uh, there too a big fuss was made about the doctors.</span> <span id="s1219">The doctors were the ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Because in all the Krankenbaus, all the, all the sick bays, where ever they put prisoners, there never doctors.</span> <span id="s1221">The only reason doctors came there is to make a selection in who was no longer was fit to be kept alive or selected to go to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1222">And they had a holding, they was a 7, 11 block in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1223">Block 7 in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1224">And this is the block that they would take prisoners that were already on their way, on the to the gas chambers, gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1225">And they would hold them there until they had enough, and then they would just walk them in Birkenau to, to the crematorias.</span> <span id="s1226">So, but mostly I remember Mengele, first about the Mengele selections in the camp, OK.</span> <span id="s1227">Of course, we didn't know when the selection would be.</span> <span id="s1228">But all of a sudden, in most cases on a Sundays, cause everyone was in, in the camp.</span> <span id="s1229">The whole camp was taken out to Appellplatz, to roll call place, lined up in rows of five, stripped naked, and your clothing was dropped by you in front of your feet.</span> <span id="s1230">And Mengele, with the, with the Lager... Lagerältester, who was a prisoner, and the Lagerführer, and also the commandant; they would go from barrack to barrack, block to block.</span> <span id="s1231">And behind Mengele was a prisoner registrar--a Schreiber what they called--and as Mengele would, this is how, how it would be.</span> <span id="s1232">You in a row of five, always in rows of five.</span> <span id="s1233">The first five, step forward.</span> <span id="s1234">Mengele would walk in front and in back.</span> <span id="s1235">As he walked this way, left or right, left or right, and those who picked up their clothing were still staying alive, because, we didn't know, we found out later how it worked.</span> <span id="s1236">First, first time, second time, you didn't know which, what was going on.</span> <span id="s1237">If you living or if you going to die now.</span> <span id="s1238">Those who left their clothing were taken into a holding block and Mengele's selections would last practically all day because by the time he completed - Birkenau was a huge camp - by the time he completed the whole camp, OK, after he finished the camp, those who of course the clothing stayed behind were taken into another block and waited until everybody was taken from all, the whole camp, then they were standing there.</span> <span id="s1239">You could hear them yell, scream, and beg for water, beg for, for help.</span> <span id="s1240">They knew where they were going see.</span> <span id="s1241">See, and those of us who stayed, we picked up our clothing.</span> <span id="s1242">Then with whips and sticks by the SS and by the Kapos and by the Blockältester, by the Stubedienst, all the big-wigs of the prisoners and the SS, we were beaten into a, uh, shower area.</span> <span id="s1243">And we bundled our clothing with a piece of wire with the number outside and threw them in a huge gas chamber, in, in a room, where Zyklon B gas was put on the clothing to disinfect the clothing.</span> <span id="s1244">They disinfected the clothing while they disinfected us.</span> <span id="s1245">Spray a little water and they sprayed us with some disinfecting, uh, water, some sort of a disinfecter.</span> <span id="s1246">And then they opened the gas chamber, the room where, where the clothing was, and you started looking for your clothing.</span> <span id="s1247">But the gas fumes were still there.</span> <span id="s1248">And I'll never forget, I got weak and dizzy from the gas fumes one time.</span> <span id="s1249">And, uh, I was fainting and my friend, Buchler and Fisher, which I mentioned before, grabbed me under their arms and took me outside and ran me back and forth, breathing for air.</span> <span id="s1250">And that's how they got me through.</span> <span id="s1251">That's how I came out of that.</span> <span id="s1252">I already had enough gas in me so if, if those two boys weren't there I wouldn't be alive.</span> <span id="s1253">I would have died right there.</span> <span id="s1254">So we picked up our clothing, we put our clothing on, were taken back to the barracks, back to our own blocks.</span> <span id="s1255">The other thing I remember about Mengele very vividly is when the transports were coming in.</span> <span id="s1256">He was the one who would be in charge at the railroad, at the siding, at, at what they, the Nazis called it the Rampe, the ramp.</span> <span id="s1257">When he came to the ramp, the first thing he would do when he, when he, he had the people lined up, the able-bodied ones, he would get rid of those first.</span> <span id="s1258">He would ask them, how old are you, what is your profession, what is your name, , what is your profession and how old are you.</span> <span id="s1259">And left, right, left, right and so on.</span> <span id="s1260">After he got rid of all these, of course, another thing he was looking, pregnant women and twins.</span> <span id="s1261">We really didn't know what he was doing with them at the time.</span> <span id="s1262">But he would, he called them "Schlingen" (ph) [Zwillingen?]</span> <span id="s1263">, the twins.</span> <span id="s1264">He would take the twins into his area.</span> <span id="s1265">I would see Mengele every transport and especially in early May 1944 when the Hungarian Jews were brought in.</span> <span id="s1266">When the Hungarian Jews came, Mengele was there constantly.</span> <span id="s1267">He had a motorcycle, and he would ride in the camp, up and down the camp, just looking, on the motorcycle, looking for anything that he wanted to look at.</span> <span id="s1268">Of course, we didn't know what he was looking at.</span> <span id="s1269">Always afraid of this man.</span> <span id="s1270">I can still remember his, his piercing eyes and he'll, he'll, Mengele had dark hair and when he, when he, there were two people that we were deathly afraid of.</span> <span id="s1271">Actually three.</span> <span id="s1272">Palich (ph) was one.</span> <span id="s1273">Palich was another one who was.</span> <span id="s1274">He, Palich actually did this.</span> <span id="s1275">Palici's favorite thing was to do to line people up in Auschwitz--Auschwitz I-- against the wall to see how many he could kill with one bullet.</span> <span id="s1276">A friend of mine, close friend of mine, knew of Palish quite well.</span> <span id="s1277">I didn't know much about Palish except I knew who he was, that he was a murderer, and he also ride, rode a motorcycle.</span> <span id="s1278">He would line up people, two three people in a row, see how many he could kill with one bullet.</span> <span id="s1279">Lined them up together.</span> <span id="s1280">And the third person, who also came in '43, actually end of '43 I think, whose name was Hauptsturmführer Moll, M - O - L -</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">L.</span> <span id="s1282">He became in charge of the crematorias.</span> <span id="s1283">And also, he also was the mentor of the pits, the pits that they were digging because the crematorias couldn't, couldn't hold enough people, burn and gas enough people fast enough.</span> <span id="s1284">So he used the pits to burn the people.</span> <span id="s1285">But the pits didn't work well.</span> <span id="s1286">Because I remember the Greek transports that came and and he, he took some of the Greek boys working the pits and with bare feet they were, they were stomping the hot ashes for after the people, the hot coals after the people were, were burned in there.</span> <span id="s1287">And the bodies just kept, kept coming back up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: To come back to, you were talking before about twins.</span> <span id="s1289">You had mentioned a particular set of twins.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: There was a French set of twins, French boys.</span> <span id="s1291">One was already there already, Mengele already had him.</span> <span id="s1292">And, I remember when they came for the second set...second guy, second person, the second twin, this poor boy yelled and screamed.</span> <span id="s1293">Oh yeah, I still...I can still just about hear his screaming, screeching, as they were taking him.</span> <span id="s1294">The Nazis came, the SS came to take this guy to Mengele.</span> <span id="s1295">And they took him.</span> <span id="s1296">That's the last time we've seen him.</span> <span id="s1297">He was castrating the boys, lot of boys, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: Did you actually see any of the experiments?</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: No, I didn't.</span> <span id="s1300">No.</span> <span id="s1301">None of us have.</span> <span id="s1302">There, oh, I shouldn't say none of us have.</span> <span id="s1303">There was some doctors, prison doctors that worked with Mengele, but of course, we didn't, we didn't have anything to do with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: What happened with the pregnant women?</span> <span id="s1305">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: Only what I heard from, from people that were connected, that he was, uh, trying to, uh, uh, force the labor out, to pull the babies out of...out of their wombs.</span> <span id="s1307">I heard that from from other people.</span> <span id="s1308">And we knew girls that that worked...worked in Canada that also knew some girls that worked closer to the, to the Krankenbau area so a lot of times when Mengele worked in some of the sick, sick bay - he had a room, he had rooms there where he did the experimentation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: You talked about one other person, um, and that is the man whom you identified for OSI.</span> <span id="s1310">Can you talk about him and give us his full name and what did he do?</span> <span id="s1311">What did you testify?</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: His full name is Hans Lipsky (ph).</span> <span id="s1313">He's a Latvian.</span> <span id="s1314">Latvian national.</span> <span id="s1315">He was an SS guard in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1316">He worked the railroad sidings where transports came.</span> <span id="s1317">He was a murderer.</span> <span id="s1318">He was a killer.</span> <span id="s1319">To him, I..</span> <span id="s1320">.</span> <span id="s1321">I remember, not only him but people like him, when transports came, transports came, we would sometimes unload the children.</span> <span id="s1322">And take them off the train, off the cattle car.</span> <span id="s1323">I remember one of the boys holding a little child, a little baby, and he takes out his pistol and shoots the baby in the, in the prisoner's hand.</span> <span id="s1324">There was another one, Untersturmführer Otto.</span> <span id="s1325">There was a Graff and another one whose name was Hans.</span> <span id="s1326">Hans would whistle, uh...uh, operas, and at the same time would murder these poor people coming off the train.</span> <span id="s1327">Just right on the tracks.</span> <span id="s1328">Right on the railroad siding.</span> <span id="s1329">This guy would sing and, and murder.</span> <span id="s1330">I seen him once kick a kid like a soccer ball, when the kid was crying.</span> <span id="s1331">Kicked him from his mother's arms.</span> <span id="s1332">And Hans Lipsky was a guard.</span> <span id="s1333">He was not an officer, he was just a guard.</span> <span id="s1334">A murderer, like most of them were.</span> <span id="s1335">And most of these people when they, those who guarded the the tracks and railroad siding, would be drinking before they got there so that they were fortified, so that they could do, do this job better.</span> <span id="s1336">That was their ration, this booze.</span> <span id="s1337">And and I remember they they all had flasks with whiskey in it and they would just drink enough so they could be practically immune to anything that was going on.</span> <span id="s1338">So I identified Hans Lipsky.</span> <span id="s1339">It's been five years now.</span> <span id="s1340">Uh, from the OSI came a person who was at the time the Assistant Director; because then there was Ryan, who was the main person, and Neal Sher was in command.</span> <span id="s1341">He got my name from some, some other Auschwitz survivors, and he asked me if I could come to Washington to identify this person.</span> <span id="s1342">I said, well I don't think I can get away you know, so fast, so he said I must travel to see some people, could I come to Indianapolis.</span> <span id="s1343">This is where I live.</span> <span id="s1344">Could you meet me at the airport.</span> <span id="s1345">So he came on a Saturday afternoon, and I met him at the airport, and he identified themselves.</span> <span id="s1346">He checked in, and then we went to his room, and in his room, he started to investigate.</span> <span id="s1347">Started to actually interrogate me like I was one of the prisoners, one of the Nazis, the way he was going about it.</span> <span id="s1348">And, uh, after, he wrote everything, whatever I told him, he, he had it down, he had a tape, and one of the last things that he did, in his briefcase, he had eight mug shots of people.</span> <span id="s1349">And he told me, I want you to study these mug shot, mug shots, and if you can identify anyone, I want you to put your finger on it and hold it there and I'll let you know what to do next.</span> <span id="s1350">I looked at this mug shots, photo of eight, eight mug shots, and they were marked from one to eight.</span> <span id="s1351">And I looked, and I put my finger on number three.</span> <span id="s1352">And I said, here is your man.</span> <span id="s1353">And if I remember what I said to him, I said, and this is, this guy's name is Hans.</span> <span id="s1354">And he said to me, Mr. Vogel, I want you to sign your full name under this photo, and date it.</span> <span id="s1355">And all the other ones I want you to initial and date.</span> <span id="s1356">And after I completed the, the paper work, he says to me, you have identified Hans Lipsky who's going to be tried in Chicago on such and such and such a time and so on.</span> <span id="s1357">And the trial was due to be the day after Christmas.</span> <span id="s1358">And on my way to work I was listening to NPR, National Public Radio, and they mentioned that Hans Lipsky elected to be deported instead of going to trial.</span> <span id="s1359">He was deported to West Germany.</span> <span id="s1360">When I got to work I got a call from Neal Sher's office.</span> <span id="s1361">This Eli Rosenbaum was working for Sher and he gave me the call.</span> <span id="s1362">He says, there is no trial.</span> <span id="s1363">Hans Lipsky elected to be deported.</span> <span id="s1364">He is being deported to West Germany.</span> <span id="s1365">He's been by himself to West Germany but we do want you to know that if in case there is going to be a trial, would you be willing to go to West Germany.</span> <span id="s1366">And that is the last, last thing I heard about Hans Lipsky.</span> <span id="s1367">He is probably living, ah, a life of Riley in West Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q: Anything you want to add to the tape, recollections...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A: Well, I give you a Sunday life in Auschwitz, for instance.</span> <span id="s1370">Sunday was the day of rest for the Nazis, of course.</span> <span id="s1371">But the damn day of rest was sport, sport with us.</span> <span id="s1372">For us, it was shaving each other, trying to get clean; which was almost impossible because water was nonexistent in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1373">We shaved each other; and in summer time we tried to air our uniforms off, delouse ourselves with our hands, but that was not allowed by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1374">They would come and do calisthenics with us.</span> <span id="s1375">They would make us go on our down below and do frog jumps, frog leaps.</span> <span id="s1376">And then they would make us roll on the ground.</span> <span id="s1377">Then roll back and forward.</span> <span id="s1378">Do push-ups.</span> <span id="s1379">Run.</span> <span id="s1380">Get into the ditches into mud.</span> <span id="s1381">Roll in the mud in the ditches.</span> <span id="s1382">And if you didn't do it fast enough, you got beaten.</span> <span id="s1383">And then they would beat us up because we were dirty.</span> <span id="s1384">Or muddy.</span> <span id="s1385">Everyday in Auschwitz, you never knew when your number came up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Another thing was to see when you went to work, when you went to slave labor, who was no longer there.</span> <span id="s1387">Who was, who's left.</span> <span id="s1388">And it became, it became like, like, like an animal.</span> <span id="s1389">Oh, I'm, I'm living another day, or he's, he's no longer, and and you know, the worst part, that you couldn't cry for it.</span> <span id="s1390">You couldn't cry.</span> <span id="s1391">You couldn't cry in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1392">You cried, you died.</span> <span id="s1393">If you, if you, if you show even more weakness than you already had, you didn't survive the day.</span> <span id="s1394">You know, I remember once, here's another one.</span> <span id="s1395">I got caught in Canada Kommando picking up sardines and giving it to a girl.</span> <span id="s1396">Gave this sardines as I was carrying the bundle, Nazi picks me up.</span> <span id="s1397">And a Kapo came there and the Kapo starts slapping me around, starts beating me.</span> <span id="s1398">So, for punishment I was put into a Strafkommando [NB: punishment brigade].</span> <span id="s1399">And how do I translate Strafkommando?</span> <span id="s1400">Straf is a..</span> <span id="s1401">.</span> <span id="s1402">is you being punished, "sin kommando."</span> <span id="s1403">I don't know if it translates well in English.</span> <span id="s1404">Always the Strafkommando consisted of, first of all, the Kapo of the Strafkommando was a murderer, a former German prisoner who was a murderer.</span> <span id="s1405">He was our Kapo, our leader.</span> <span id="s1406">And the job was cutting seaweeds in water, with two of us.</span> <span id="s1407">It was, was a chain saw, it was a saw on a chain, like a, like a, how would you call it, like , OK, that had sharp thing and you cut it.</span> <span id="s1408">And what the Nazi would do behind us, they would send a Kapo, a Unterkapo...an Unterkapo, his assistant, and they would dunk our heads in the water to see how long we can stay in, under the water.</span> <span id="s1409">I was there for two weeks, and one of my friends paid off with a kind of riches, he paid off the proper people.</span> <span id="s1410">And I was taken back into Canada Kommando.</span> <span id="s1411">And when I came back the SS man who caught me, the greeting would be such: .</span> <span id="s1412">Till next time, you old bandit, you still alive.</span> <span id="s1413">And they, in a way, they say, oh, this guy survived.</span> <span id="s1414">They, they were, you know, say, look, what else I can do with him.</span> <span id="s1415">Another thing that you learned as you became an older prisoner, to be at the right place at the right time, which was not easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">They, Nazis, SS would say, .</span> <span id="s1417">They would yell out, three men.</span> <span id="s1418">You went, most cases one of you didn't return.</span> <span id="s1419">They would kill you as you were doing some sort of work.</span> <span id="s1420">And as you got an older, became an older prisoner, when an SS man called for three men, you would say, , cause they always meant three plus you.</span> <span id="s1421">You stayed behind, because if you went again, your first time.</span> <span id="s1422">I've got a mark on my neck here.</span> <span id="s1423">I was hit by a shovel, on my neck.</span> <span id="s1424">I thought I was going to be killed.</span> <span id="s1425">That mark is still there.</span> <span id="s1426">Also, when they called drei man, it was digging and wasn't digging fast enough, and the SS just hit me full force on my neck.</span> <span id="s1427">And they indented my neck, and its been there ever since Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: Did you ever think of escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: No, no, I didn't.</span> <span id="s1430">When these two boys escaped, and when anyone escaped, we were in a way not happy about, about it.</span> <span id="s1431">And again I must explain, we didn't know what was going on on the outside world.</span> <span id="s1432">But the reason we were not happy because we suffered.</span> <span id="s1433">We had to stand and on roll call until this poor soul was either caught, murdered, and then we were all beaten anyway.</span> <span id="s1434">Because the Kapos and Blockältesters who were also out standing there at the roll call with us, they would be the ones who beat us because the Jew escaped, see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: You had said before about the misconceptions about Canada Kommando.</span> <span id="s1436">Did some people believe you?</span> <span id="s1437">Could you talk about that and talk about the woman that you mentioned?</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A: Well, uh, now, uh, you know, after thirty years not speaking about my experiences, finally, our youngest daughter Elaine, who practically made me do what I'm doing today, speaking on Holocaust, and the most important reason is because I want to bear witness because very soon there will not be an Auschwitz survivor or Dachau survivor and then Auschwitz will only be a legend.</span> <span id="s1439">But I must be very blunt.</span> <span id="s1440">I survived because of Canada Kommando.</span> <span id="s1441">Good, bad or indifferent, I survived because I was assigned to work in Canada Kommando.</span> <span id="s1442">But I must say that Canada Kommando was not just a group that worked unloading people.</span> <span id="s1443">We were told before we went to the transport what is expected of us.</span> <span id="s1444">If any one of us will ever dare to tell the people what is going on, will not live the day through.</span> <span id="s1445">So now that I talk about it and I tell them that I survived and the reason, everyone survived for a reason, because in Auschwitz the Nazi law said that was no one can survive longer than three months on the food, the hygiene, and the work and and the torturing that he gets longer than three months.</span> <span id="s1446">If you live longer than three months, you are doing something that is not according to the camp's rules.</span> <span id="s1447">You either get more food someplace.</span> <span id="s1448">You do get more food someplace, or you have someone else helping you to to survive, see.</span> <span id="s1449">So when I tell some people about Canada, I told, I was Bloomington at the Indiana University a couple of years ago, and I'm speaking to graduate students, a class of graduate students.</span> <span id="s1450">They were learning Holocaust, teaching Holocaust there, and I told the group about Canada Kommando, and of course questions and answers are usually very strong, and I really am quite immune to the questions because I answer them exactly, right from the shoulders.</span> <span id="s1451">This young woman told me that her mother told her than the Canada Kommandos in her mind were murderers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Murderers, because when she arrived to Auschwitz, it was the Canada Kommando who lined them up in rows of five and one of the Canada Kommando slapped her.</span> <span id="s1453">And I said, "It is possible, but a Canada Kommando person was only doing what he had to do.</span> <span id="s1454">If he didn't do it he was shot right on the spot.</span> <span id="s1455">He was murdered right on the spot.</span> <span id="s1456">And I give you another example, another little story.</span> <span id="s1457">I remember a transport came from Theresienstadt, 1943.</span> <span id="s1458">Early spring of 1943.</span> <span id="s1459">And we were unloading this transport, busy, this was the busiest night I ever seen at the railroad, uh, siding.</span> <span id="s1460">There was a young woman with a child with her.</span> <span id="s1461">And the child was restless and and crying, and the mother was trying to calm the baby, calm the child--six, seven-year-old child.</span> <span id="s1462">All of a sudden, the mother looks; and a Red Cross truck is moving towards us.</span> <span id="s1463">And she's telling the little girl, "Oh, Red Cross is already here.</span> <span id="s1464">Pretty soon we will be in our place."</span> <span id="s1465">And a young Jewish Slovakian boy ran by there; and he told them, "Lady, that's not Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1466">Take a look behind.</span> <span id="s1467">You see the chimney.</span> <span id="s1468">In one hour's time, you're going to be gassed.</span> <span id="s1469">You're going to be burned."</span> <span id="s1470">And she went and sees an SS officer and tells him that, this woman.</span> <span id="s1471">She tells the SS officer about this man: "This man told us you're going to gas us, you're going to burn us."</span> <span id="s1472">He said, "Look, Lady, he's a criminal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Don't...he's going to be dealt with."</span> <span id="s1474">And he dealt with he was; because after we had loaded everybody, we all went behind the cattle cars and slowly they murdered him.</span> <span id="s1475">Everyone of them just murdered the young boy slowly, just murdered the young boy slowly.</span> <span id="s1476">Carried him back to Auschwitz on our shoulders.</span> <span id="s1477">And the Red Cross truck.</span> <span id="s1478">You know what the Red Cross truck brought?</span> <span id="s1479">The Zyklon B gas cans.</span> <span id="s1480">That's how it was carried into Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1481">So that was the Red Cross truck.</span> <span id="s1482">And there are so many things, you know, that...the...as I'm talking to you, there's just, you know, for a survivor, every survivor has a story.</span> <span id="s1483">Is a story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">The end is always, always the same.</span> <span id="s1485">And every survivor survived because of something.</span> <span id="s1486">Not because he was strong; because the strong ones were falling just as easy as, as the weak ones.</span> <span id="s1487">And really, none of us believed you're going to survive that.</span> <span id="s1488">It...it was...I'd been in Auschwitz two and a half years; and I was in--between Sachsenhausen, Auschwitz, Dachau, I was over three years just in concentration camp, plus so many months in, in, in Arbeitlagers (ph), work camps.</span> <span id="s1489">So from 1939 to 1945, we all suffered and, uh, uh, because of the Nazi regime and you know, every survivor, we didn't believe that we're going to make it.</span> <span id="s1490">There is no survivor that will tell you I'm going to survive Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1491">They never talked about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">You know what the main, the most important thing was, to go to sleep at night with a full stomach, so if you die, you don't die hungry.</span> <span id="s1493">Another thing was in Auschwitz, "Organizierung"-- organizing.</span> <span id="s1494">We all had to organize.</span> <span id="s1495">We all knew how to barter.</span> <span id="s1496">And of course, the resistance group, see.</span> <span id="s1497">People say the Jews, we the Jews walked into the gas chambers like lambs, like sheep.</span> <span id="s1498">Believe me, those of us who were there a long time, we had an underground organization, without radios, without anything.</span> <span id="s1499">Communications such as we all knew how to communicate from the other camps, somehow or other.</span> <span id="s1500">For instance, there was a Leichen (ph) Kommando, which was the people that picked up the dead.</span> <span id="s1501">This man, he built a wagon, he had a wagon, and he built a false bottom.</span> <span id="s1502">This guy's name is Joe Newman (ph) and he lives in Skokie.</span> <span id="s1503">And he would carry things to the girls' camp, information.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">Information to person...you had him here not long ago, Erich Kulka.</span> <span id="s1505">And Erich Kulka would carry it from camp to camp to camp, and to the resisters.</span> <span id="s1506">To the girls that worked in munitions factory.</span> <span id="s1507">Which was Kulka's job.</span> <span id="s1508">Kulka did that.</span> <span id="s1509">Kulka was the one who, uh, got the girls from the munition factory.</span> <span id="s1510">And they got enough gun powder so the Sonderkommando blew up one of the crematorias.</span> <span id="s1511">Of course, they were murdered unfortunately, they were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">Q: Did you watch that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1514">I did not.</span> <span id="s1515">We knew about it but I did not.</span> <span id="s1516">So you see, when, when people tell you that, uh, uh, surviving, those that survived, they are, they are a story, that's a different breed, and especially those who were in Auschwitz as long as I have been, as long as, you know, myself and the others, Kulka, Vrba.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: Did you help to smuggle information and material?</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1519">From, we used to bring...for the escapees, we used, we used to smuggle stuff in ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">Q: Talk about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">A: Uh, clothing for them, so they have civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s1522">And that would be given to group such as Kraus and Kulka, that type of stuff.</span> <span id="s1523">Shoes.</span> <span id="s1524">And we didn't know why.</span> <span id="s1525">OK.</span> <span id="s1526">They didn't tell us these tomorrow, you know, you never knew who would - there was a Hebrew word, a Yiddish word "moser."</span> <span id="s1527">A "moser" is a guy who tells on someone, who goes and snitches on someone.</span> <span id="s1528">There was snitches among us.</span> <span id="s1529">And the reason there was snitches, again, selfish, trying to survive that way.</span> <span id="s1530">The Nazis, they didn't let them survive.</span> <span id="s1531">They get their information, then they kill them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">Q: Would you tell me the story, an incident where you smuggled things?</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">A: I was very small, and my pants were kind of big.</span> <span id="s1534">I would be lined with clothing, civilian clothing inside, after examining us, the clothing would be in an area as they put us in line, some of us snuck in and you put the clothing in your pants.</span> <span id="s1535">And we snuck it in and someone in the camp already knew that I had it.</span> <span id="s1536">But you see, it was a dangerous thing to do.</span> <span id="s1537">Because the Canada Kommando was not only searched on the Canada grounds, we would also be searched sometimes at the gate.</span> <span id="s1538">See.</span> <span id="s1539">And if you got caught you got killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">Q: Who did you get the clothing for?</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">A: The clothing would be picked up by a courier like, like, not a prisoner, who couldn't wore them anyway because he had to have a striped clothes like me.</span> <span id="s1542">And he would take it to the person that would be doing the escaping.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: You helped on the black market too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: Oh, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1545">There was a big black market there.</span> <span id="s1546">Constantly.</span> <span id="s1547">Q: Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">A: Uh, that was down with the civilians actually.</span> <span id="s1549">Cause you couldn't black market much with, barter with another prisoner.</span> <span id="s1550">What could he give you?</span> <span id="s1551">We would buy chicken sometimes.</span> <span id="s1552">Cooked chickens.</span> <span id="s1553">From the Polish civilians.</span> <span id="s1554">The ones that worked in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1555">Vodka was brought into the camp.</span> <span id="s1556">Cigarettes.</span> <span id="s1557">For gold, for diamonds, watches, which we, which we took from the Canada Kommando.</span> <span id="s1558">You know, American dollars was a very common thing in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1559">Thousand dollar bills, hundred dollar bills, there was nothing to it.</span> <span id="s1560">Twenty dollar gold pieces you would find in the clothing.</span> <span id="s1561">And this was all survival of the fittest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">Survival of the people that thought maybe, maybe, maybe.</span> <span id="s1563">Never believe you're going to make it, but there was always a slight, slight glimmer of hope.</span> <span id="s1564">What are you buying the food for, so you give it to your girlfriend, your sister, your brother, your mother, and throw it over the fence.</span> <span id="s1565">Auschwitz was a constant organizeering, organizing, constantly going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Between the Kapos who you had to pay off, the Blockältester who you had to pay off.</span> <span id="s1567">The Blockältester who was in charge of Block 29, the Canada Kommando, he lived like a king in Auschwitz because he was our god.</span> <span id="s1568">And to him we brought the riches.</span> <span id="s1569">For better treatment, for taking care of our friends who got typhus.</span> <span id="s1570">See I had typhus, I, I, I had, I acquire typhus, I got typhus in 1943 in Canada, and at the time I was already in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1571">And two my friends, Fisher and Buchler, I don't know if I, I mentioned these two boys prior.</span> <span id="s1572">Here I have typhus.</span> <span id="s1573">The first thing that happens to you in typhus, you lose your hearing, and you echo, your equilibrium, am I saying it wrong.</span> <span id="s1574">You loose that, you lose your balance.</span> <span id="s1575">These two boys would hold me under their arm with my cap off and march me through the gate, take me to Canada Platz where we worked the Canada warehouse.</span> <span id="s1576">When transport didn't come, we all worked at the warehouse.</span> <span id="s1577">Sorting the clothing.</span> <span id="s1578">They marched me through there, take me to the girls' section without the Nazis see it and the girls would cover me with bundles of clothing and make hot water for me with lemons.</span> <span id="s1579">We had lemons, you could, what people brought with them.</span> <span id="s1580">And that's how they got me well.</span> <span id="s1581">Not quite well, because I ended up in, in the block which was called the Krankenbau, and again, here was a Polish couple in charge of the block.</span> <span id="s1582">And this friend of my named Fisher would pay them off to take care of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">Because Mengele came every day to make a selection to, to go to gas chamber.</span> <span id="s1584">Now they got too hot, that he knew that I was on my last leg, that's when he brought me back and he said to Fisher, I can't keep him no more.</span> <span id="s1585">You got to take him back to the barrack.</span> <span id="s1586">So I survived Krankenbau with typhus.</span> <span id="s1587">And that Canada Kommando, and again the girls took care of me until I got well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">End of Tape #3 Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
