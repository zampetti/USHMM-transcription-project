family?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: My immediate family consisted of my father, Fred Reisner, my mother Stella Reisner, and my sister, Rene Reisner.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: And was your

id="s15">Were they there for previous generations?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s17">I think both my mother’s and my father’s family, I can trace them back to the grandparents and maybe even the great grandparents.</span> <span id="s18">I’m not sure about the great grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Do you know where those previous generations then came from?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s22">What kind of work did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: My father was the head of a factory.</span> <span id="s24">He was awa -- thint -- the -- the actual title was Centrale Directore, which means main manager, or main director of the factory.</span> <span id="s25">It was a factory of enamel, but it was a conglomerate and there were factories all over Europe by the same conglom -- owned by the same conglomerate.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: And you said he was the central director?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Did your mother work?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: No, my mother never worked.</span> <span id="s30">She -- we had a lot of servants and we -- she was active, she went to the university for some courses, she played a lot tennis, she belonged to several societies and she didn’t work.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: What kind of education did your father have?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: My father had a business education.</span> <span id="s33">I think it -- it could be -- it -- it wouldn’t be a university degree, but it was probably equated to a business background and business kind of schooling.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Did you have many extended family in the area?</span> <span id="s35">Aunts, uncles, cousins?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s37">My mother had two sisters and a brother.</span> <span id="s38">One of the sisters at the time lived in Czechoslovakia, and the other sister did live in Vienna.</span> <span id="s39">In fact, we were very close with that sister -- with that sister’s children.</span> <span id="s40">She had two daughters and my two cousins were -- one was three years older than my sister and the other one was another three years older.</span> <span id="s41">And one of the sisters always -- the younger one, Susie, who now lives in Israel, went every year with us to a vacation.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: So you had close relationships with your cousins.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Yes, with that -- with only that cousin.</span> <span id="s44">My mother’s brother had no children, my mother’s other sister had no children, so these were our only cousins.</span> <span id="s45">From what I recollect, I had two grandmothers, both grandfathers had been dead, and I think one of them died when I was probably about four years old.</span> <span id="s46">My other grandmother, which was my maternal grandmother was very -- she was with us a lot.</span> <span id="s47">She went away with us every single summer, and I saw quite a bit of her.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Tell me about the neighborhood that you lived in in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: I lived in a -- it was called the fourth district.</span> <span id="s50">We -- we had -- we rented -- I don’t think we owned it.</span> <span id="s51">We rented an apartment which was huge.</span> <span id="s52">It -- it went the whole length of the building.</span> <span id="s53">I was lucky enough to get a picture of the building, I forgot to bring it.</span> <span id="s54">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Remember what street it was on?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Yes, the name of the street was Winnersal strasse.</span> <span id="s57">I forgot the number now, but I was able to relocate the number through some of the documents that I found in my mother’s portfolio, where my mu -- where my mother kept all her documents.</span> <span id="s58">It -- it looked out on a little plaza.</span> <span id="s59">So when I went back to Vienna, I -- I tried to find it and I -- actually I couldn’t recognize the house because the bottom of the house had been changed.</span> <span id="s60">It -- it became more commercial now, they have like shops and shops’ windows on the bottom, but the top floor seems to be the same that we lived on.</span> <span id="s61">And we probably had approximately, I don’t know, about 15 - 20 rooms.</span> <span id="s62">It was a very extens -- because our -- some of our staff lived with us and the rest of the staff used to come in, like the laundress and the seamstress and the tutors, they just came in and left.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: And what other kind of staff did your parents have?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Okay, we had a cook and we had a maid and we had a governess and they lived with us.</span> <span id="s65">The chauffeur did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: So you also had a car.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Yes, we had a car.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Sounds like it was an upper class family that you were born into.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: I guess so.</span> <span id="s70">I would say so, yeah.</span> <span id="s71">Actually, the real upper class was my -- my grandmother’s brother, who had -- who was the president of the southern railroad at the time, and he was really what we call, almost like an aristocrat.</span> <span id="s72">He had an incredible apartment that he used to have guided tours in because it was full of beautiful, very precious paintings and furniture and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: His name was Gustav Fall, and he had a monument erected in his honor in front of a hotel that the railroad owned, which was on the bu -- mountain outside of Vienna, it was called Zemmering.</span> <span id="s75">I don’t think the monument exists any more, I know the hotel does not and I know that they have some kind of vaca -- rec -- recreational facilities there now.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: How religious was your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Not very religious.</span> <span id="s78">We did -- we -- we -- we were part of the Jewish community and we did go to temple, but only on high holidays.</span> <span id="s79">On the other hand, we did have a Christmas tree, supposedly for the staff, to honor them.</span> <span id="s80">I remember going to temple.</span> <span id="s81">I tried to find the temple when I was in Vienna, but the only temple that we located was one that was closed.</span> <span id="s82">And later on when I talked to one of my distant relatives, I was told that there were several temples and that probably was not the one that I attended as a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s84">Did you celebrate any Jewish holidays at home?</span> <span id="s85">A: No, we did not have Friday night candle lights or anything like that.</span> <span id="s86">The only -- we did in a sense, Yom Kippur, because he -- my father always fasted on Yom Kippur, this was one thing that he did.</span> <span id="s87">And so did my mother and I guess so did we as children.</span> <span id="s88">Later on, of course, that was no longer done.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Did they come from religious families, your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: I don’t think so -- I think the Austrian -- I -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s91">I -- I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s92">I don’t remember my grandmother being -- bringing up religion in any way.</span> <span id="s93">We did have religious training though, but the religious training came because in Vienna at the time religion was part of the curriculum, and since we were Jewish, that was not given in the schools.</span> <span id="s94">So I remember we had a Hebrew teacher coming to the house, teaching us Hebrew and religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Did you exchange Christmas presents among yourselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s97">I think the presents were mostly for the staff.</span> <span id="s98">But I also don’t remember any Hanukah big gifts.</span> <span id="s99">Frankly, I don’t remember presents as such as part of a traditional festivity.</span> <span id="s100">I know I got my first gold ring because I ate some meat, which I refused to eat previously.</span> <span id="s101">And I remember that whenever my parents went to Paris, because my mother bought most of her wardrobe there, they would bring us back -- and clothes were always uppermind -- in my mind, even as a little girl, and I remember that.</span> <span id="s102">But I -- I -- I don’t remember any presents as such that were particularly meaningful to me.</span> <span id="s103">I remember as a little girl I had little dolls that I liked.</span> <span id="s104">And I think when Hitler came I could take a few with me, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s105">But somehow they disappeared.</span> <span id="s106">But I don’t remember like having had a specific toy that I was attached to, like my little granddaughter now is with -- with Minnie Mouse.</span> <span id="s107">I -- I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s108">Maybe I blacked it out.</span> <span id="s109">I -- I can’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Did you have a Passover Seder?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: No.</span> <span id="s112">And if we did, I don’t remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Let’s talk about your schooling.</span> <span id="s114">What kind of school did you go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Okay, we went -- we did not attend private school, we attended the public school, and I remember the greatest embarrassment was that we were brought there with the car and the chauffeur and I was very embarrassed about not being able to walk to school like the other children.</span> <span id="s116">I was never allowed to even cross the street by myself or walk any place by myself.</span> <span id="s117">My biggest pleasure was that my mother once took me on the bus.</span> <span id="s118">That was a big excitement for me because the car I -- I kind of disliked riding in the car, because I used to get carsick a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Would you say that your parents were overly protective, or was this the usual way?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: That -- that was the usual way that the governesses and in the circle of friends that we grew up with.</span> <span id="s121">But y -- then most of the -- I -- I can’t remember why we did not go to private school, but most of the children of my fr -- of my father’s and mother’s friends did attend private school.</span> <span id="s122">We did go to a private dancing school, and we did have piano lessons in the house with a piano teacher.</span> <span id="s123">But I -- and I also remember coming to the house, we had the governesses that were supposed to instruct us in French and English, but we also had some kind of a tutor come to the house for the languages.</span> <span id="s124">But nothing much came of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: What kind of relationship did you have with your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: My sister was very domineering, very bossy, and my father clearly always favored my sister, which was a big problem for me as a child because I felt he was very unjust.</span> <span id="s127">And in Vienna the oldest child had a lot of privileges that the younger child didn’t have.</span> <span id="s128">So I was very annoyed at that.</span> <span id="s129">She was allowed to go at night to the opera, I was not.</span> <span id="s130">She was allowed to go to bed later, I was not.</span> <span id="s131">She was allowed a lot of fe -- also, I had a lot of hand-me-down dresses from her, which I terribly resented.</span> <span id="s132">And I always wanted to have the same clothes as she did, I was dreaming of her being left back in school so we could be in the same grade.</span> <span id="s133">Things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: What -- how would you describe yourself?</span> <span id="s135">What kind of a child were you?</span> <span id="s136">Were you quiet, or more outgoing?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: I was a very, very noisy child.</span> <span id="s138">The way we were brought up, we were not allowed to speak at the dinner table.</span> <span id="s139">I was not allowed to come to the big dinner table ovi -- until I knew how to cut my own meat, or -- an-and use the fork properly.</span> <span id="s140">I -- my father even got a record once because we were not allowed to talk unless talked to, and he once made a record on the phonograph saying, Dorrit eat, Dorrit eat, Dorrit don’t talk, Dorrit don’t talk.</span> <span id="s141">And that’s how it was.</span> <span id="s142">And I had endless hours as a child that I remember of eating in my room.</span> <span id="s143">I hated to eat and I would push the food from one cheek to the other.</span> <span id="s144">And I had an uncle who always touched me at the cheek and said for me to eat.</span> <span id="s145">And I would forever sit and eat, from morning to night, because I was underweight, I had asthma -- I was an asthmatic child, and the governesses were told that we had to eat, that I particularly had to eat.</span> <span id="s146">So they kept me at the table s -- what seems to me still hours and hours.</span> <span id="s147">Like breakfast went into the snack, the snack went into the -- the midday meal, and the midday meal went into the afternoon meal and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: What -- be-because of your asthma were you on medication or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Yes, I was on medication.</span> <span id="s150">I had what they call an inhaler and I wasn’t allowed to run, and I wasn’t allowed to exercise too much.</span> <span id="s151">As a privilege therefore, in the summers my mother just took me to the baths, the spas and I had all kinds of -- of these mineral water baths and mud baths that were supposed to help me.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Who were your friends?</span> <span id="s153">Did you have friends in the neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: No, there was no such things as friends.</span> <span id="s155">We had friends that were my mother’s and father’s friends who had children.</span> <span id="s156">We had -- the only set of friends that I remember were two boys, and I absolutely detested the younger one, because he was my age, and adored the older one, who was supposedly my sister’s friend.</span> <span id="s157">But the only friends we really had was my sister had my cousin as a friend.</span> <span id="s158">But I was always relegated to my grandmother and to the governess and I don’t remember any play dates or playing with any friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Did you know you were Jewish, and if so, what did that mean to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: I definitely knew I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s161">It meant to me that I went to the temple, it meant to me that I had to have the private instruction.</span> <span id="s162">It meant to be -- to be excluded while the -- while the other children in the elementary school had their Catholic instruction.</span> <span id="s163">And I knew I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s164">It didn’t mean a great deal, I think, as far as tradition.</span> <span id="s165">And as a child, until the Hitler came to Vienna, I was totally unaware of the antis -- anti-Semitism that must have existed at that time already.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: What did you do in school when the other children went to their Christian education?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: I don’t remember what they made us do.</span> <span id="s168">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s169">All I know is that we did not participate, and therefore we had to study Hebrew at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Did you sense anything among the teachers or the other students about your being different?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: No, No.</span> <span id="s172">I -- I remember -- a-as I said, I was not -- I was a very vivacious child, I was a very talkative child, and I remember being reprimanded for that.</span> <span id="s173">And I remember that I -- I had friends in the class.</span> <span id="s174">I don’t remember them as such, but I remember sitting with them and wanting to be with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Were your parents Zionists?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: No, neither my father nor my s -- my -- my mother were Zionists.</span> <span id="s177">The closest I came to the Zionist exposure was that I knew that my older cousin, not my younger cousin, started being in that group just before we left Vienna.</span> <span id="s178">I’m not totally sure that I knew of it while I was in Vienna, or whether it was told to me later.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Were your parents a-active politically?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: No, no, not at all.</span> <span id="s181">Not at all.</span> <span id="s182">Not that I know of, anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Had you heard ab -- preceding 1938, had you heard of a man named Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Before that?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s187">I must have, but I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s188">I know we -- in the group of friends that my father had, we identified ourselves as Austrians.</span> <span id="s189">My father was very proud to have fought in the first World War as an Austrian -- I think he was a captain or a lieutenant or something like that, and he had many decorations.</span> <span id="s190">And he was very proud of being Austrian, much more so, I think, than being Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: And that infiltrated to you?</span> <span id="s192">You felt more Austrian than Jewish, a-as a young child?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: I think as a young child I didn’t feel either way.</span> <span id="s194">I really didn’t.</span> <span id="s195">I was much more preoccupied of what was happening at home with my sister, with my cousin, with -- with the governesses, who really f -- always favored my sister because she was quiet and I was very noisy.</span> <span id="s196">I still remember my father saying, we can only hear one child in this whole house and that’s me.</span> <span id="s197">And I -- I remember I was very grega -- gregarious.</span> <span id="s198">I know we were re -- presented when -- whenever my father and my mother had big social affairs in the house in the evening, we were all dressed up and presented, and I loved that, because everybody made a fuss over me.</span> <span id="s199">And then of course, my sister hated to go and she was forced to go.</span> <span id="s200">And I also remember that my sister was allowed to have long curls and I was not because my mother felt all the attention went to me and not to my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: What was your relationship with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Very close.</span> <span id="s203">I’m -- since my father favored so much my sister, my mother favored me.</span> <span id="s204">But truthfully, while we were in Vienna, we were very little involved with either parent.</span> <span id="s205">We were strictly with the governess and there were maybe not -- just maybe at the mealtime, the main mealtime at noon, that we sometimes ate with them, not always.</span> <span id="s206">And on Saturday and Sunday, I remember a little bit of my father playing with us, maybe.</span> <span id="s207">A very little, very little interplay.</span> <span id="s208">And then the summer we hardly ever saw them because they went on trips from the place where we always went to for the summer, which was a small estate where we rented a villa.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Where was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: That was near Salzburg.</span> <span id="s211">It was in Unter achem artazay.</span> <span id="s212">It was a lake.</span> <span id="s213">And it was a beautiful, what I recollect as big estate.</span> <span id="s214">My sister later -- later told me it was a small one.</span> <span id="s215">And we had a boat house and my father had a cousin that owned a house further down the lake, whom we saw also, socially.</span> <span id="s216">But my parents were there not that much.</span> <span id="s217">They usually took off on their own vacation, and we were left with my grandmother, my cousin and the governess.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Did you have any favorite songs as a young child?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: As a young child, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s220">I don’t -- oh yes, I -- I remember my uncle singing to me, but it wasn't necessarily my favorite song.</span> <span id="s221">He used to sing to us one of -- of the -- of the Schiller poems, the -- it’s called the earl -- the Earl Kernik, it’s -- it’s about a man that rides on a horse with a small child who’s -- who is dying, but he always changed the ending and we always knew this wasn’t the ending, because the ending goes that he has his son, he holds his son, who is dead in his arms, and my uncle used to sing and they ate together a bread of -- of butter and bread.</span> <span id="s222">And I hated that, because I knew it was fake.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Can you sing a few lines?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: I know the poem, I can’t sing [recites poem in German] Something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: What language did you di -- speak at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: We spoke exclusively German, and the only other language my -- the governesses were supposed to teach us French and English and we knew -- we learned absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s227">I don’t remember anything.</span> <span id="s228">Oh, in English I knew there was a little girl that had curl right in her fi -- forehead, and if she was bad, she was very, very bad.</span> <span id="s229">That’s about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s231">Now, you said you don’t know if you remembered hearing about a man named Hitler before he came into Austria.</span> <span id="s232">Let’s move up to that time.</span> <span id="s233">What is the first memory you have of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: My first recollection is of terror, actually.</span> <span id="s235">We all went with that family that -- where I hated the two boys.</span> <span id="s236">We went in a -- on an afternoon -- actually no, the very first recollection is a radio when Hitler first entered Vienna, and the -- the reception that he got and the -- the ovation that he got entering Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Did your family go to see him?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Did you know anybody who went to see him come in?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s241">The second recollection was that we went to the pratta, which is the big amusement park and it’s also a park where you can walk, and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s242">And it was that the f -- the four of us, our family and the other family, we were just walking.</span> <span id="s243">And then we were suddenly brought into a -- into a line, we were lined up.</span> <span id="s244">I don’t remember how they identified us as Jews, we -- it could be that we already wore the yellow sign naming us as Jews, but I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s245">But somehow we were put in that line, and my father somehow had his decorations from first world -- from the first world one with him, and I don’t know by what miracle he convinced one of the men to let us go, our family and the other family.</span> <span id="s246">And we then heard that that -- that that whole procession had to go to a monument and clean the monument on their knees and then they were just deported.</span> <span id="s247">So it was a very frightening experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: How did your parents explain it to you, you were eight years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: I don’t think they explained anything.</span> <span id="s250">They explain -- my father then disappeared, he went we -- he -- he had to leave immediately, it’s actually the chauffeur that was hiding him because they were looking for him, since he was a -- an important figure in the factory, and he went to Paris.</span> <span id="s251">And then my next recollection is that we were packing and we had these big trunks and my sister and I were playing hide and seek, and my uncle drew me out, stood me up and he said, you children, can’t you help your mother, instead you’re playing these stupid games, and she’s -- there’s a lot of trouble, and you really have to behave now.</span> <span id="s252">So that’s what I remember, and the excitement of leaving, yet I was totally aware that when we left Vienna, which was maybe a month or two later, we got an exit visa to go to Paris --</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: This was a month or two after Hitler came in?</span> <span id="s254">A: I guess maybe if -- I’m not s -- exactly sure of the time, maybe two months, I don’t know, as a child you --</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: But -- but co -- soon after?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Soon after.</span> <span id="s257">I remember on the train --</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Okay, le-let’s back up for a little bit --</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: -- before -- before you leave Vienna.</span> <span id="s261">You said you had to wear something, a sign, a yellow sign saying that you were Jewish.</span> <span id="s262">Do you have any recollection what it felt like to wear that and what your first reaction was?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: No, must be blocked out.</span> <span id="s264">I remember it -- again having to wear it, I think, in Yugoslavia when Hitler came to Zagreb where we were.</span> <span id="s265">So I think we had to wear it twice.</span> <span id="s266">I remember then being shocked that I saw it on baby carriages.</span> <span id="s267">I don’t remember any reaction, we just wore it.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Did you talk things over with your sister -- no, I’m talking about early on, when you’re still in Vienna and Hitler had come in.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s270">I remember as a chil -- the only real recollection I had was that I really didn’t want to be different, that I know.</span> <span id="s271">And I was -- I was very unhappy having to be different.</span> <span id="s272">I was very unhappy to leave my room.</span> <span id="s273">I remember leaving the room, I went out on the balcony and I told myself, remember exactly what this place looks like because you may not remember it.</span> <span id="s274">And for years afterwards I would recall that picture in my mind, that’s why I was so sure I would recollect my house, but I didn't.</span> <span id="s275">And I would recollect the exact position my bed was in -- in the room that my sister and I shared, and that was somehow comforting to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Were there any other changes in your life while you were still in Vienna, after Hitler came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Yes, we no longer went to school, we had to be -- be to -- we were taken out from school.</span> <span id="s278">We were taking of -- taken out of all the tutoring and all those schools, and I guess we just prepared [indecipherable] departure.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: What were your thoughts when they told you you couldn’t go to school any more?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: I ge -- probably I was pleased.</span> <span id="s281">Hitler’s a big holiday.</span> <span id="s282">And then when we went to Paris we didn’t go to school at all.</span> <span id="s283">We again had some French lessons, but it -- it was just a total holiday.</span> <span id="s284">And we loved France because that was the first time my mother was in charge of us and we drove her nuts, my sister and I.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Were there any other restrictions in Vienna besides no schooling?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: I’m sure there were and I’m sure that we were very careful where we went and what we -- what streets we went to or if we went out at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Dorrit Ostberg.</span> <span id="s289">This is tape number one, side B. And you were talking about your recollections of restrictions in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Unfortunately I don’t remember too many restrictions, but there are certain events that I recollect vividly.</span> <span id="s291">One of them was that we could use my great-uncle’s box at the opera, he had his own box, and we went out to an afternoon performance, while my sister was allowed to go to the evening performance.</span> <span id="s292">And I -- I remember ce-cer -- certain music li -- I remember a party that was given for my sister with -- where a whole slew of people came in with marionettes and they gave a whole -- a marionette performance, was a big party for her birthday.</span> <span id="s293">We must have had at least 50 children or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Was this after Hitler came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: No, all before, all before Hitler.</span> <span id="s296">But I -- I don’t remember any specific restrictions.</span> <span id="s297">Maybe I blocked that kind of thing out.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Then you said, soon after Hitler came in your father made arrangements to leave.</span> <span id="s299">What did he say to you that he would have to leave, why he would have to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: He never spoke to us about it, never explained anything to us.</span> <span id="s301">I don’t re -- the -- there were never such discussions, neither with my mother, nor with my father.</span> <span id="s302">We were just told we had to leave, we had to behave because they were very difficult times and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Were you upset when your father left?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: No, didn’t bother me at all because he was very often gone.</span> <span id="s305">We were really not taken care of by either my father, nor my mother.</span> <span id="s306">They were like visitors, I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s308">Yo-You described before that very moving scene of going -- of trying to remember your room.</span> <span id="s309">That was a very mature response for a young child, to realize that she may never see her room again.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: I guess so, but I was a very dramatic child.</span> <span id="s311">I -- I remember we were exposed to theater and many of the plays when we were up in the country, and I -- I remember the excitement of these -- in -- in the performances in Vienna, at any of the theater performances or operas, they had several curtains before they went up.</span> <span id="s312">And I vividly remember the excitement between the curtains and I couldn’t wait for them to go up and -- and I even, as a child, had dreams of performances.</span> <span id="s313">Dreams of -- of theater performances, music performances.</span> <span id="s314">Of course, I was exposed mainly to classical music, but I loved, actually, the music that -- that -- Viennese music -- now I recollect, because you asked me before.</span> <span id="s315">An-And we used to go on -- in the afternoon we used to go on many of the walks where there was music played in the background and I guess little coffee shops or things like that.</span> <span id="s316">And I loved that, I -- I was very impressed with that, much more so than with the classical music.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: You said you were a dramatic child, what did the German uniforms look like to you when you were in Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Not frightening, they were just uniforms, and I had seen pictures of my father in the uniform for the World War One, and th-the -- and I was exposed to many uniforms that -- that people wore, I guess.</span> <span id="s319">Passing by, or things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: When it was time to leave and you were packing the trunks and so forth, did you take anything special with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: I just remember those little dolls.</span> <span id="s322">That’s about all that I remember, if I took them.</span> <span id="s323">As I said, we had no, that I recollect, I was not attached to a specific blanket, to a specific toy.</span> <span id="s324">It’s unusual because I see my son carried his blanket for years.</span> <span id="s325">It’s -- it’s strange.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: And when it was time to go, what kind of arrangements were made?</span> <span id="s327">This was you, your mother and your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s329">The three of us went on a train, and I remember I -- at the time I already wrote a diary.</span> <span id="s330">And I wrote -- I -- I was looking -- I -- I stayed up as long -- we had sleeping cars, and I remember going through Switzerland, which I had never been, and I was very interested in how Switzerland looked through the train windows and I wrote in my diary that I was going through that.</span> <span id="s331">But I was terrified of being taken off the train, and somebody coming and not letting us leave.</span> <span id="s332">I knew that we had to leave, and I knew it was dangerous if we couldn’t st -- to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: How did you know it was dangerous?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s335">Probably through listening to the reports, hearing the adults speak, hearing -- probably, I would assume now that most of our staff was let go before we left.</span> <span id="s336">I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Now, what about your extended family?</span> <span id="s338">They stayed in Vienna when you three left?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: My grandmother stayed, and my cousins were sent on a child transport to England.</span> <span id="s340">My two cousins.</span> <span id="s341">And my mother’s sister, with her husband went to America.</span> <span id="s342">My uncle had a brother in America who sponsored him and gave him a visa and they went there.</span> <span id="s343">And that was my immediate family.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: So your immediate family seemed to get aw -- have gotten out of Vienna early.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Yes, yes, except for my grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: She stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: She stayed.</span> <span id="s348">She had to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Why did she have to stay?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Well, she couldn’t come with us, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: I guess my father couldn’t get a visa for her.</span> <span id="s353">And I -- I know later on, when we were in Yugoslavia and my father had an opportunity to go to America, my mother refused, because she said she wouldn’t leave Europe, because of her mother was still in Europe.</span> <span id="s354">And I do remember that I always wanted to go to America as a kind of savior.</span> <span id="s355">So I -- I was very much aware of the danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Did -- did -- did it manifest itself, your awareness, in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: I guess so.</span> <span id="s358">I mean, when we went to Yugoslavia, first we went to Slavonski Brod, where my father took over another factory, and there we lived again in -- in great luxury, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Well, okay, let’s talk a little about -- you were on the train, and you were going to Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Correct.</span> <span id="s361">I’m skipping.</span> <span id="s362">And then in Paris -- my father was no longer in Paris, my father already had left for Yugoslavia to take over the factory, and they left my mother and my sister and I in an apartment and later on a distant cousin of my father’s, who was much younger, she was at the time a young woman, lived with us for a little while.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: And what did you do and how long were you in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: I think we were about six or seven months in Paris, and we did a lot.</span> <span id="s365">We went to the opera in Paris, we went to the museums, we went to the stamp market.</span> <span id="s366">My sister had an extensive, beautiful stamp collection, and -- which later was sold, and we lived off that stamp collection for a little while, it -- it -- but we also didn’t go to school, we had private instruction in French.</span> <span id="s367">And we had a holiday, we didn’t have to go to school, we didn’t have to be tutored all day long, we had a very structured life in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: In -- in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: No, in Vienna, which was totally free, in a sense in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Oh, I see, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s371">And your mother obviously had enough money to live in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Oh yeah, because my father took over the factory in -- in Yugoslavia and we must have had plenty of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Did your relationship with your mother change once you didn’t have a governess?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Yes, as I said, we drove my mother crazy.</span> <span id="s375">We invented all kinds of languages she wouldn’t understand, we were fighting who would have the last word in bed.</span> <span id="s376">We -- we -- we were just children, trying to -- feeling our oats the first time really that we didn’t have the strict control, and the strict schedule that we were used to.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Had you heard any more about Hitler while you were in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Definitely, yes.</span> <span id="s379">There were neighbors of ours that I remember, the neighbors were also Jewish and I -- from Austria and I remember the man saying, the only way I ever return to Vienna is with a big knife.</span> <span id="s380">And we certainly knew about all the advances of Hitler, but we left Paris before Hitler conquered France.</span> <span id="s381">We then went to stay in th -- with my father in Yugoslavia.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: So you said you were in Paris for approximately six months, which means when you left it was early winter ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: That’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: That’s about correct.</span> <span id="s386">Either early winter or spring.</span> <span id="s387">We -- we could have stayed about four months maybe, in Paris because we were waiting to get the entrance visa to Yugoslavia.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: What kind of contact did you have with your father while you were in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: None that I remember.</span> <span id="s390">None whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: What did you think of Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Oh, I loved Paris, I loved Paris.</span> <span id="s393">The first thing, of course, I got the beautiful hat, that outfit in Paris that -- I loved going to the Louvre, I loved going to the opera, I loved going to the markets, the -- when we left Paris, we both -- we came to Yugoslavia with two birds, with a big birdcage that we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: So birds that you had had in your apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: No, we bought them, I think, just shortly before we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: So now you are going to join your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: How did you feel about leaving F-France?</span> <span id="s399">You had already left Vienna, this is the second leave-taking.</span> <span id="s400">Did that bother you?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s402">I was just ready for a new adventure, a new scene.</span> <span id="s403">I -- I don’t even remember being very excited about seeing my father.</span> <span id="s404">All I remember vividly is when the chauffeur picked us up in Yugoslavia in this little village, my mother said that she wasn’t going straight to where we were living, but she wanted to see all the sights.</span> <span id="s405">And that poor man didn't know where to took u -- take us, so he took us to some little forest that was nothing, just a couple of trees, and those were the sights of the little village.</span> <span id="s406">But we then, before we had a house, we lived in the vineyards.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: But what -- what was the train ride like from Paris to Yugoslavia, was there any difficulty?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: None whatsoever, because I don’t remember it, and I don’t remember being frightened at all.</span> <span id="s409">All I remember is taking care of those silly birds.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: So then you arrived in Yugoslavia.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Correct.</span> <span id="s412">We lived for a short time in the vineyards, and it was great because in the winter -- so it probably was early fall when we got there -- in the winter it snowed so hard that we couldn’t go to school, and th -- my sister and I used to ski on the slopes, and have a good time.</span> <span id="s413">And then after that my father either bought or rented a huge house in the village itself, where we lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: What was the name of the village?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Slavonski Brod.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: And what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: I went to school there and I went to Jewish religion there also.</span> <span id="s418">And we -- my father had several friends -- a lot of White Russians were there, aristocracy that lived there.</span> <span id="s419">I don’t know why, maybe they were connected with my father’s factory or not, I don’t recollect that.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Now this factory was this enamel factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s422">In Yugoslavia it was a factory that manufactured railroads.</span> <span id="s423">And my father was successful in selling it to the government of Yugoslavia and for that we all received Yugoslav citizenship.</span> <span id="s424">And I learned Serbo-Croatian very quickly and my sister and I made it a point to only speak that, because my mother and my father were quite slower.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: At -- at what point had your father sold the company to the government?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Okay, he sold it -- he was a very clever man in retrospect, even though I hated him as a child.</span> <span id="s427">He sold it shortly before Hitler occupied Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s428">So it was to great advantage of the conglomerate.</span> <span id="s429">And the conglomerate really had in mind to bring my father to the United States and have him take over a huge factory here, which never materialized because my mother didn’t want to leave, which was pointless, because my poor grandmother died anyway after being taken for interrogations and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s430">And she died at home, but she died very unhappily.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: You are in this village, and you said you learned the language.</span> <span id="s432">Did you have a lot of freedom?</span> <span id="s433">Were you out on the street with other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: No, we were never out on the street with other children, but I had more freedom.</span> <span id="s435">It was a little bit less structured than my life in Vienna.</span> <span id="s436">And since the teacher that I had in Yugoslavia, her husband worked in the factory of my father’s, I got a glowing report how good I was, which my father knew wasn’t so because I -- I always acted up in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: What -- were the non-Jewish children friendly to you?</span> <span id="s438">A: They must have been, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s439">We had -- we had a good time, we used to go swimming in the river that separated the two villages.</span> <span id="s440">There was an identical village which was called Bostian Brod, and it was like entering another world.</span> <span id="s441">And that was like the minarets, and the woman in Wales, and it was just the bridge that separated it, but it was like two totally separate worlds.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: It was a mu -- Muslim city?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Yes, it was mostly Muslim.</span> <span id="s444">Flies, men sitting and drinking coffee, women working in the field.</span> <span id="s445">Very Muslim.</span> <span id="s446">Minarets.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Were you still celebrating Christmas?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s449">I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: So you lived as Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: We lived as -- as Jews, yes, definitely.</span> <span id="s452">Before Hitler came we -- we went to the capital of Croatia, which was Zagreb.</span> <span id="s453">My father and mother took an apartment, and my sister and I were put into a boarding school.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: This was your parents’ decision?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Was my parents foresight, because Hitler was already close to the border of Yugoslavia and my father was the only one who knew that Yugoslavia would very quickly fall into the hands of the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: N-Now that things were changing, were your parents -- and you were a little bit older, were your parents just telling you more about the situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Never.</span> <span id="s458">My parents never discussed the situation, this was what -- what was done.</span> <span id="s459">But we knew.</span> <span id="s460">I mean, I used to --</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: How did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Because I still remember a conversation.</span> <span id="s463">See, my father’s friends, these -- this one couple who was ar-aristocratic, because I remember the woman had a maid wash her feet, which impressed me very much at the time.</span> <span id="s464">And she never in her life had even washed her own feet.</span> <span id="s465">And they were all sitting around and they were saying oh, the Yugoslav army is going to defeat the German army, and we are very strong and we are very powerful and nothing is ever going to happen to Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s466">I remember my father saying this is ridiculous and they’re going to invade, and they’ll conquer Yugoslavia like every other country in a few days.</span> <span id="s467">So I -- I remember that, and I remember listening to that, and being frightening and really wanting to go to America.</span> <span id="s468">I -- i-it -- in my mind at that time that was the only salvation for us, and the only salvation to remain alive was America.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: Ho-How did you know that America was the salvation?</span> <span id="s470">What did you know about America at that young age?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Not much, obviously, but that -- that -- that was always in my mind.</span> <span id="s472">I remember being devastated in a sense that my father didn’t take that position.</span> <span id="s473">So I must have been frightened.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: And again, did you s -- talk it over with your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: What was the boarding school like?</span> <span id="s477">What kind of school was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: I hated it, absolutely hate.</span> <span id="s479">I hated the discipline.</span> <span id="s480">We had to mar -- of -- we has to wash with cold water, which to me was a nightmare.</span> <span id="s481">My sister bribed the maid, but then I didn't wash ma -- to give me and her some -- my sister was very inventive -- to give us hot water, which we had for a little while until I didn't wash my neck properly and the people in charge saw that the water was hot, and we were both punished.</span> <span id="s482">And we had to go on endless walks in the winter, and we had to wear brown stockings, which I hated and refused to wear, and I got million of demerits.</span> <span id="s483">If we had 15 demerits we couldn’t go to visit the parents on the weekends.</span> <span id="s484">Every week I had maybe 40 or 50 demerits.</span> <span id="s485">Also, I hated the food.</span> <span id="s486">We were supposed to eat all the food that was presented to us, and they had blood sausage and polenta, and those two things I hated with a passion and I wouldn't eat them, and I got demerits.</span> <span id="s487">My sister never got a demerit.</span> <span id="s488">I don’t know whether she ate it or spit it out or -- or what she did, but she was the good one, so she always could visit my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: So there were times when she would visit and you could not?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: That’s correct, I had to stay there.</span> <span id="s491">But I still -- I was very, very stubborn child.</span> <span id="s492">I would not wear those brown stockings.</span> <span id="s493">I pretended to be sick not to go on the walks.</span> <span id="s494">I -- I really did not like being in that -- in that boarding school.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Was it a re -- was it a religiously oriented school?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Not at all, no.</span> <span id="s497">Just a boarding school.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: So you lived as j -- they knew you were Jews --</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: -- and you lived as Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Yes, that was my father’s purpose.</span> <span id="s502">They were hiding us because when Germany invaded Zagreb they had the -- I think they had to give over some of the quarters to German officers, and they were hiding us, they were hiding the fact that we were Jewish children.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Did you sense any anti-Semitism on the part of any of the teachers or students?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: No, not that I recollect at all, no.</span> <span id="s505">Actually I liked wearing the uniforms.</span> <span id="s506">I liked the uniforms, they were pretty.</span> <span id="s507">At least, I thought they were pretty.</span> <span id="s508">And what I really liked is that my sister had to wear the same thing that I had to wear.</span> <span id="s509">That was a big plus in my life at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: And how long were you at the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: I guess several months.</span> <span id="s512">My father was arrested during that time.</span> <span id="s513">He was arrested by the uth -- by the Croatians, which were then in control, and they were like the Nazis, they -- the concentration camps in Yugoslavia were much more horrible, even than the ones in Germany.</span> <span id="s514">And he -- he then pretended not to be Yugoslav.</span> <span id="s515">He was very, very smart man -- and that he was a German and that they had not right to arrest him, and somehow he got out.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Did he have false papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: Well, he -- he never lost his Austrian citizenship, we were just given a second citizenship as -- as a big honor.</span> <span id="s518">And I -- I think that was the story, I’m not a hundred percent sure, but he got out of it.</span> <span id="s519">And then he got us out of the boarding school and the four of us went to the coast of Yugoslavia, which was occupied by Italy, and we lived there what they called in liberal confino, which means you are free, but you are not allowed to leave the premise -- the -- the -- the locality.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: Were -- I take it you were not upset about leaving the school, obviously.</span> <span id="s521">Were you upset about leaving the area?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s523">I loved it where we went, because we lived in a villa, and it -- I think that’s where my father sold my sister’s stamp collection and we had some money because of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: This is a villa on the coast?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: Yes, we were on the coast of Yugoslavia, we were quite high up.</span> <span id="s526">It was called Sekwenitsa.</span> <span id="s527">It was near the -- near Fiume, what used to be Fiume, and we went swimming the whole time and I remember my father gave me lessons in German composition and I had to write compositions for him, which I hated, but I had to do it.</span> <span id="s528">And I -- the first time that I had a friendship with a boy, who was my age that time and I guess I had maybe a crush on him, only I didn’t know it.</span> <span id="s529">And we used to play endlessly in the water, go swimming.</span> <span id="s530">And my great uncle lived also there, he came down there with his daughter-in-law, who was a physician, who supposedly later poisoned him, which I don’t know.</span> <span id="s531">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: This is Gustav Fall?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: This is Gustav Fall.</span> <span id="s534">And I remember visiting him and enjoying him.</span> <span id="s535">He told me that -- I never forgot, he to -- I used to tell him that I was bored and he told me, intelligent people never get bored.</span> <span id="s536">And I liked him a lot, we used to go visit him, my friend and I.</span> <span id="s537">The -- th-the -- the young boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: What else did you do, did you go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: No, we didn’t go to school, but I was elected, I had to go with my father up to the mountains or something that we could walk up and trade -- I don’t know what he traded to get some eggs and get food supplies for us.</span> <span id="s540">Food was scarce, but we had potatoes, we had enough food, but let’s say an egg was a luxury.</span> <span id="s541">And -- but -- and I hated going with him, but I was elected to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Did you feel that your life was in danger in any way there?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s544">Not at all there.</span> <span id="s545">I felt very secure there.</span> <span id="s546">I didn’t think we were in danger there at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: And you -- what did you hear about a man named Tito?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Nothing at that time, nothing.</span> <span id="s549">We heard later, when we were in the concentration camp, we -- when we were liberated, that was the first time that we heard about Tito and the partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: And so then how long were you staying in this house in the mountains?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Not in the mountains, we were on the coast.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Oh, on the coast.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: How long did we stay there?</span> <span id="s554">Several months.</span> <span id="s555">It was summertime, because we all went swimming a lot.</span> <span id="s556">And then suddenly one -- one day, we were just picked up, put in a truck and deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: And where were you taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Then we were taken to the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: And where was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: That was on an island in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: In the Adriatic?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: In the Adriatic.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Which island was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Rab.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: And what was your reaction when you had to just leave suddenly?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: Was a mixture.</span> <span id="s567">I -- I don’t think I was too frightened.</span> <span id="s568">I tol -- I always told myself, this is an adventure.</span> <span id="s569">And I had no clue where we were going, so I played a game that this was an adventure and I had no idea where I was going and I was interested where I was going to end up.</span> <span id="s570">Of course where I ended up I wasn’t too, too thrilled, because my father was separated from my mother at the time, and he was in a barracks with men and we were in a barracks with my mother and all the women and all the children.</span> <span id="s571">But later on, we had our own unit.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: Later on your father moved back with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: I think so, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: Did you go -- you said you were frightened, did you question your mother, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: About what?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Well, about what was happening and why.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: I knew what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: And why?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: And I knew why it was happening.</span> <span id="s580">I know I was I Jewish and I knew that -- that that was the fright -- that we were deported.</span> <span id="s581">I knew about the fascists, and I knew about the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Were you angry that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Yes, for a -- I wasn’t angry.</span> <span id="s584">I wished that -- well, I was blonde and blue eyed, so I couldn’t wish for that.</span> <span id="s585">But I did wish that I could -- even in Vienna I remember I wanted to be part of the Nazi children, or something like that, just in order to blend in.</span> <span id="s586">But it -- it wasn’t really a -- a si -- a thing that I desired tremendously.</span> <span id="s587">It was more like thinking it wouldn’t be bad if I could be that.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: Wha -- what was the living conditions when you got to Rab?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: They were pretty bad, I remember.</span> <span id="s590">The food was very scarce.</span> <span id="s591">When we moved into -- at first we were separated, which was, I guess, frightening.</span> <span id="s592">I do remember sneaking to visit my father and him being extremely angry that I did that, because it seems to me -- later on I understood that some of the men were sneaking women in there, their own wives, just to be close to them, and my father was very strict and didn’t want me exposed to any of that, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Why -- why did you -- if you weren't close to your father, why did you go visit him?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s595">I don’t know, maybe partially curiosity to see what he was li -- where he was staying and what his barrack was like, and it -- whether it was any different from mine.</span> <span id="s596">But that was one episode that I recollect.</span> <span id="s597">I also then recollect going into an own -- little house or barrack or something, where the family as a unit stayed.</span> <span id="s598">I remember both my mother and father had to work.</span> <span id="s599">They had to do manual labor.</span> <span id="s600">And I recollect that the -- the people in the camp organized some kind of a school where my sister and I attended.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Dorrit Ostberg.</span> <span id="s603">This is tape number two, side A, and we were talking about your experience on Rab Island.</span> <span id="s604">And you said your parents went to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: Yeah, definitely my parents --</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: What kind of work did they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: Manual work.</span> <span id="s608">Probably my mother had to work in a kitchen.</span> <span id="s609">I don’t -- I don’t recollect what my father had to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: Was that difficult for your mother, who had led a completely different life?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: My mother was a very, very unusual, remarkable woman.</span> <span id="s612">She made the best of every situation where she was.</span> <span id="s613">And even later on, when we were in Fort Ontario, she -- she loved to work, she volunteered to work, and sh-she -- she was very remarkable that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: What kind of work did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s616">Don’t recollect.</span> <span id="s617">I’m sure he hated it and found it very demeaning.</span> <span id="s618">That was very much in his character.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: And what did you do during the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: We went to school, we were s -- and then I f -- I met my friend, a girl, and I -- I formed my first really close friendship wi-with another girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Leah.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: And what did you do with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: Well, we -- she probably attended the school, but where I really got close to her is because we both were put in an army hospital, because we were both -- she had a heart condition and I must have had hepatitis.</span> <span id="s625">And we were put in an army hospital together where we -- where they kept us for a very long ha -- time.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: How was your asthma during all of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: Strangely enough, better.</span> <span id="s628">And strangely enough, probably because of the terrain, which was mostly like a desert, the island was not full of vegetation.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: And how long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: As I recollect, at least four months.</span> <span id="s631">And we got better food there.</span> <span id="s632">And we -- there was a little Italian orderly who called us sisters, and told us Italian and was very, very nice to us and even the doctors were very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: And what was the living arrangement?</span> <span id="s634">You said your father joined -- came back and joined you.</span> <span id="s635">Were there other families in the barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: You mean in the -- in the camp itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: Yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: Yeah, I think the families then had like little units within barracks, or little huts or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Did you have any privacy?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: As a family, I guess.</span> <span id="s641">I guess.</span> <span id="s642">I don’t know because I was hardly there because very shortly when we got there, I was put in the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: So were you in the hospital for most of the time there?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Most of the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: And what was your state of mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: I was very happy in the hospital.</span> <span id="s647">I know, sounds weird.</span> <span id="s648">I don’t ever remember missing my sister or my mother.</span> <span id="s649">Well, at the time I was angry at my sister anyway, because the last couple of weeks that we were in -- before we were put in a concentration camp, she kind of stole my friend, and he was very, very impressed that an older girl was interested in him and he totally started ignoring me and I was not only jealous, but angry, hurt, and really wanted to have nothing to do with my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Did your parents talk about the future with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: Never.</span> <span id="s652">Never discussed the future, never discussed the present.</span> <span id="s653">I don’t recall a single conversation.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Did you talk about your grandmother at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s656">My mother was very sad.</span> <span id="s657">I remember that we were notified that my grandmother died and I remember my mother being extremely s -- she was very close to her mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: And -- and how did you feel when you heard your grandmother died?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: Very sad, because I lo -- I liked her a lot.</span> <span id="s660">She taught me how to play cards, she told me -- she told me stories, she read to me a lot.</span> <span id="s661">She -- I -- I liked her a lot.</span> <span id="s662">And then the summers I was mainly in her care, plus the governess, because my sister and my cousin took off, never wanted any part of me, except to -- to tease me and torture me.</span> <span id="s663">And my grandmother used to walk -- walk with me.</span> <span id="s664">We had a dog at the time, I remember having to count all the dogs with her and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: What kind of clothes were you wearing now?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: Strangely, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s667">In the camp, you mean?</span> <span id="s668">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s669">I remember being very well dressed, or I thought I was well dressed when we were be -- before we got to camp.</span> <span id="s670">Camp i -- well, m-mainly I don’t recollect I think because in the hospital I had hospital clothes on.</span> <span id="s671">That’s all I wore.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: Were you bedridden in the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: A -- a length -- a great length of time because as I said, I proba -- I -- I know I had yellow jaundice, I probably had hepatitis, I may also have had bronchitis and asthma, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s674">But I -- I was quite sick, otherwise they would have never had the permission to put me there.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: And had your eating habits changed as you got older?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s677">Not really, I -- I don’t remember having bad food in the hospital at all.</span> <span id="s678">I -- I don’t remember being hungry at all in the hospital, that came much later, I was very hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: And then -- so you were -- you were in this camp for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: I don’t recollect how long.</span> <span id="s681">I think it was over a year.</span> <span id="s682">It was up to when Italy capitulated.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: Were there many other children your age there?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: There must have been, because they organized a school, so there must have been.</span> <span id="s685">That was really the only real education that I got after Yugoslavia, after the public school in Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s686">So I really, as far as schooling is concerned have -- had a very sketchy schooling background.</span> <span id="s687">And later on actually, the -- the lessons that my father gave me in composition, in writing German, in reading German was probably a blessing, even though I hated every minute of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: What did -- what k -- how was the school set up in this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: Well, just probably another hut where -- where we all sat together and got some -- must have gotten some kind of instructions from some -- some of the Jewish people that -- that were very well versed in history and languages and -- and mathematics or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Were -- were the people in the camp all Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: No, but a great number of them were Jewish, and a great number of them were politically against the Yugoslav regime.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: So the --</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: But I think we were separated.</span> <span id="s694">I -- I see -- at least I seem to recollect that the people we were with were all Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: Did they celebrate any holidays?</span> <span id="s696">Did you do anything in a Jewish sense?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: I was sitting in the hospital.</span> <span id="s698">We were not doing anything in th -- in a sense of holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: So were you in the hospital for a good part of that year?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: Yes, for a good part of that year, at least four or five or six months.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: And did your folks come to visit you often?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: Never.</span> <span id="s703">They couldn’t visit.</span> <span id="s704">They couldn’t get out of the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: Oh, the hospital was not in the camp, it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: Not at all, it was like miles away.</span> <span id="s707">The -- the -- the camp only had infir-infirmary, where my father was for some length of time.</span> <span id="s708">He was also ill.</span> <span id="s709">He had eczema and all kinds of complications.</span> <span id="s710">But the hospital itself was a veterans kind of hospital, a military hospital on the island, away from the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s712">So you did not see your family for months.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: For months.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: What -- what is that like for a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s716">Never missed it, not that I recollect.</span> <span id="s717">Maybe --</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: Could they -- could they write to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: Maybe.</span> <span id="s720">Maybe there was correspondence.</span> <span id="s721">I don’t recollect it.</span> <span id="s722">Probably not, it was a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: And do you remember getting out of the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: Yes, I remember returning, but very shortly after that the armi -- the armistice came.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: And what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: Suddenly all of the Italian army disappeared and we were free.</span> <span id="s727">And I remember not having shoes and running out of the camp just for the drama of being outside and no longer inside.</span> <span id="s728">And then we had two choices.</span> <span id="s729">The first choice was to return to the coast of Yugoslavia, whi -- which was still partially occupied by Germany.</span> <span id="s730">And many of the young men, including the boyfriend that my sister had at the time returned to fight, to join the -- the partisan and to fight against the Germans and against the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s731">Many of the people chose to return anyway, even those that couldn’t fight and my father organized a very, very small group of people and we hopped from island to island renting small fisher boats, and -- with very little money and no food at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: Did you know why he decided to do this rather than st-staying in Yugoslavia?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: Yes, yes, I did know.</span> <span id="s734">I know that he wanted to reach the island that was sco -- occupied by the allies, which we finally did.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: So you went, you said, from -- you -- you were in these little fishing boats?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Little fishing boats.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: Oh, I loved that.</span> <span id="s739">I loved it.</span> <span id="s740">It’s very adventurous.</span> <span id="s741">It’s very rough.</span> <span id="s742">I remember everybody getting seasick but me, because I stood outside.</span> <span id="s743">I -- I could never be down in the cabin because I would get very seasick.</span> <span id="s744">But outside in the -- I love the ocean, I always liked the ocean.</span> <span id="s745">And I remember climbing with my friend all the mountains [indecipherable] that were there.</span> <span id="s746">I remember there were no -- no -- no facilities to go to the toilet.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: On these different islands?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: On the different islands, we made in the fields with the goats around.</span> <span id="s749">I remember being starved to death and swearing to God that never in my life will I be picky again about eating, which I must say I did not adhere to.</span> <span id="s750">Being so hungry that I never thought of anything else but food.</span> <span id="s751">Being hungry to that degree.</span> <span id="s752">Eating the fruit of some trees which looked like a banana but it’s dried.</span> <span id="s753">It’s very sweet, but it’s extremely constipating, I don’t know, and having problems with that.</span> <span id="s754">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: But your health remained okay on these different -- on this boat trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: I guess so.</span> <span id="s757">I guess so.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: What about your parents, how are they managing?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: They were managing.</span> <span id="s760">My mother was wonderful, my father -- we had to sleep sometimes in -- in a room and we would relieve ourselves in a bucket, and I remember once my father spilling the bucket because the men had to bring the buckets down.</span> <span id="s761">And I remember that that was the funniest thing I ever saw, and laughing and my father giving me a good slap and he was furious with me, but I’m still laughing about it, which is not [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s762">But they always managed, we -- it was very -- actually it was an extremely dangerous expedition.</span> <span id="s763">The --</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: Did you know how dangerous it was while you were doing it?</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: Yes, definitely yes.</span> <span id="s766">We knew that after we left the island, one hour later the Germans were there.</span> <span id="s767">We --</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: So you hopped from one island to --</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: -- we hopped -- that’s the right expression, we hopped from one island to the next.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: And who took you?</span> <span id="s771">Who was the captain of these boats?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Fishermen.</span> <span id="s773">Small fishermen that somehow my father had -- I don’t know what he bribed them with, I don’t know where the money came from, whether it was a ring that he was hiding and he had, I don’t know how they did it, but the -- it was more than just us.</span> <span id="s774">It was probably a group of 20 or 30, maybe even 40, I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: Now it -- but you said your father was the organizer and the leader of this group?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: Part of the -- part of the organizer, the men were.</span> <span id="s777">The men got together and did it, and we just followed, the women and the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: And by that time what possessions were you bringing with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: Hardly any.</span> <span id="s780">Hardly any.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: And then you e-ended up where?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: We ended up on an island that finally brought us to -- to the i -- to the main island that was occupied by the allies.</span> <span id="s783">From that island they th --</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: What was the name of that island, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: Yes, I did know.</span> <span id="s786">I think I -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s788">And then from there --</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: It was way down, almost near Greece.</span> <span id="s790">I did know it, but I can’t -- I can’t think of it right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: And then from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: From there we were transported to the coast of Italy, and from there we were supposed to go to a camp in Africa, a holding camp.</span> <span id="s793">And the -- it was called Brindisi, the port.</span> <span id="s794">And again my father, I don’t know how, but he convinced some -- an Italian guy to vouch for us and we got out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: How long were you in Brindisi?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: Probably not even a day or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: And where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: From there we went to Bari and I don’t even recollect how we got there.</span> <span id="s799">Probably by bus or by train or by something like that.</span> <span id="s800">And I don’t have no -- I have no clue how my father managed to get there.</span> <span id="s801">But we got to Bari, and I know that we were walking in the streets and we were picked up by two Italian women who brought us to their home, saw that we got food rations, organized us, got us in a -- put us up til we got an apartment, and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: Wer -- were these women that your father had known about?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: No.</span> <span id="s804">We never knew them, the-they just literally saw us marching in the streets and picked us up.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: The four of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: The four of us.</span> <span id="s807">And my mother for years afterwards was sending them packages and gifts and -- until they died.</span> <span id="s808">They were older women, they were quite old.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: So you -- you moved in with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: We move -- first moved in with them, and then they got us some kind of an apartment.</span> <span id="s811">My father -- my mother went to work.</span> <span id="s812">She -- she and my sister, I think, worked in a canteen, n -- in a ma -- in an allied canteen.</span> <span id="s813">And th-that’s when I told my mother, how could you ever get a job?</span> <span id="s814">You don’t know what to do and she told me, she -- you will see what I can do, and she slapped me.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: And what did you and your sister do?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: My sister I think worked there too.</span> <span id="s817">I think she -- my mother and my sister worked there to get a little bit of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: And you?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: And I was just home, I guess, and my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: Why is it your father didn’t work?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: I don’t think he could get a job.</span> <span id="s822">You know, they wanted women in the -- in there.</span> <span id="s823">I mean, we had no permit or anything like that.</span> <span id="s824">We -- we must have got -- my father must have gotten us probably a -- a provisional visa or something.</span> <span id="s825">And very shortly we a -- oh no, I went to school, that’s where I went.</span> <span id="s826">And my sister, too.</span> <span id="s827">No, my sister didn’t work.</span> <span id="s828">My sister and I went to a school, a convent school.</span> <span id="s829">This is where I learned all my Italian.</span> <span id="s830">That’s where we went, we went to school.</span> <span id="s831">We went to convent school, we learned it -- Italian, we learned Latin.</span> <span id="s832">That was the first four month schooling that I got again.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: And you went to school openly, as Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: Yes, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: And you were still going by your name, Dorrit?</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: Yes, yes, we went openly.</span> <span id="s837">But they did -- I remember they did, we did have to attend mass and we did because it was a convent school.</span> <span id="s838">And -- and they did si -- I think they hoped to convert us.</span> <span id="s839">Actually, we had changed religion twice, just to get out, but we never -- to us it was just a piece of paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: So you had papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: We had kind of papers that my sister, much later in life retri-trieved from Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s842">I think we -- we changed religion twice, to -- to some kind of a Protestant religion, then some kind of a Catholic religion, just in order to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: But did you keep your same names?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s845">Nothing else.</span> <span id="s846">I do -- we -- we -- I -- I don’t even think that we ourselves went to be converted.</span> <span id="s847">I think it was all done with falsified papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: How was it sitting during a mass for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: Oh, I didn’t -- I didn’t mind at all.</span> <span id="s850">I -- it was just learning it the lat -- and learning.</span> <span id="s851">I love the singing, the singing is always beautiful.</span> <span id="s852">I love the church singing actually.</span> <span id="s853">I do.</span> <span id="s854">Just like I love the -- the -- to me the -- the best thing about a Jewish ceremony is the cantor, and I -- I just -- I adore the singing.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: And there was a camp on Bari.</span> <span id="s856">Did you ever go over there, did you ever meet anybody at the camp, the refugee camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: I didn’t even know it existed.</span> <span id="s858">We -- we had no --</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: There are other refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: We had no recollection of a camp in Bari.</span> <span id="s861">I don’t -- I’m not sure that my father even knew it existed.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: And what were your living conditions when you moved out of the women’s apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: Pretty good.</span> <span id="s864">I mean, not bad, but we had enough food, we had pasta, we had -- I guess my mother cooked.</span> <span id="s865">I don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: Was this a bo -- was this a boarding school or a day school?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: That we went?</span> <span id="s868">Day school.</span> <span id="s869">Day school.</span> <span id="s870">Day school.</span> <span id="s871">And my sister even had a very close friend that was Yugoslav that also -- I guess maybe he was on -- on a transport with us, or just arrived in Bari, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s872">But I remember we had a pretty nice life for the few months, and then we applied -- then we heard that President Roosevelt was taking 1,000 refugees to America, and we applied for it, as a family.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: How did your family hear about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: My father heard about it.</span> <span id="s875">I don’t know how, but all I remember is praying that we would be accepted and being terrified because we had to have a physical exam, that something would be wrong in -- in -- in especially me, you know, having been ill, that they wouldn’t accept us.</span> <span id="s876">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: Now we’re talking June ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: Right.</span> <span id="s879">So -- and we were accepted, and I was as happy as -- as can be, finally to come to America.</span> <span id="s880">Was a big thing for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: It sounds like your father was very tuned in to what was going on all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: My father was a very, very astute businessman, and he was a very clever man, because he really saved us in all these positions.</span> <span id="s883">But he -- he was -- he was very, very strict, very Germanic, not at all interested in the things my mother and I were interested in.</span> <span id="s884">He had had very little training in -- even though he had a good voice as -- he used to sing, he used to like classical music.</span> <span id="s885">But literature didn’t really interest him and many of the things that were very essential to my mother and I. I and all -- all throughout this I was reading, constantly reading.</span> <span id="s886">I don’t know how my mother got me books, but I was reading in -- in -- in Serbo-Croatian, I was reading in German, I was later reading in Italian.</span> <span id="s887">I was an avid reader, I loved reading.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: So you appli -- did you yourself as a child have to fill out any forms for this United States journey?</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: I don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: Or was it just your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: I think just my parents.</span> <span id="s892">I -- I don’t think I had to fill out anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: And did you go through a medical check-up?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: Yes, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: So you’re in Bari and then you get accepted.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: And how much longer did you stay in Bari after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: Several months, not much longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: For several months, yeah.</span> <span id="s900">You left Bari to go to where?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: I think we were transpond -- transported in -- in -- in trucks to a holding camp in Aversa, Italy.</span> <span id="s902">I still recollect lice going over us in that camp.</span> <span id="s903">We stayed, I think, only overnight</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: Did you know anybody else at that point who was accepted for this journey?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: You were -- so as far as you knew from Bari, you were the only people you knew in Bari who were accepted?</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: No, we didn’t know anyone [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: You were the only.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: The only ones that we know -- knew of.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: Knew of.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: Right.</span> <span id="s912">No, none of our friends or anybody that we knew of.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: Were people jealous back in Bari?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: We didn't have that many friends for people to be jealous.</span> <span id="s915">I think that one friend of my sisters had planned to go back to Yugoslavia anyway.</span> <span id="s916">He was older, he wanted to fight or do something.</span> <span id="s917">And I don’t -- and I had lost my -- my friend Leah that had went to Africa, which I never heard from her again.</span> <span id="s918">So I had just -- I didn’t form any friendships with any of the children in the convent school.</span> <span id="s919">So we had no friends there that we would say goodbye, except for the two women that were so kind to us.</span> <span id="s920">But they were older women there, they were not really part of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: Just as a side, when you were in the convent school, were there other Jewish children, or were you the only two?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s923">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s924">Probably not, at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s926">Okay, back to where you were, a little farther forward.</span> <span id="s927">And so you stayed overnight, and then?</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: Then I think we were -- we were transported by train to -- to where the boat left.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: And was it confusion, con -- or controlled, or -- what was it like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: Very controlled, very controlled, but they -- we already started -- in Aversa already I -- I met several people my age, and several boys my age.</span> <span id="s931">One of them I loathed of course.</span> <span id="s932">And -- and I met Corky who was -- seemed very impressive to me.</span> <span id="s933">That is the -- the man that married my best friend.</span> <span id="s934">And he talked, of course, exclusively with my sister, but I remember being -- not going to sleep on purpose all during that -- that long trip to where the boat was, just in order to impress him how I could stay up.</span> <span id="s935">But that was about all.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: Now you are almost 15 years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: Not quite.</span> <span id="s938">I would say about 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Yeah, it was the summer before you were 15.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: And you were very excited obviously, about going to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: Extremely excited, extremely excited and happy about going.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: How did you all feel and your family feel about President Roosevelt?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: I guess very positively.</span> <span id="s945">Very positive.</span> <span id="s946">He -- because he was our savior at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: And then you get to the boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: We got to the boat, we got on the boat and of course the food was fabulous there, for the first night.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: What -- what did the boat look like to you, the Henry Gibbons boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: No specific impressions.</span> <span id="s951">I -- I wasn’t even aware at the time that it was part of a convoy.</span> <span id="s952">I was not aware, unlike my friend [indecipherable] my friend Elfie says she was very much aware when the Germans attacked it or -- or -- or so -- I was not aware of that.</span> <span id="s953">I don’t recollect it at all.</span> <span id="s954">I was just concentrating on making friends with -- with -- with my age group, not my sister’s age group.</span> <span id="s955">And my sister then found friends in her age group.</span> <span id="s956">And I just liked being on the boat.</span> <span id="s957">It was exciting.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: Were you aware that some of the other people from Europe were in very poor condition, malnourished and not enough clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: I guess we were all in the same condition.</span> <span id="s960">We all didn’t look terrific.</span> <span id="s961">I don’t think I was aware that I looked particularly bad or particularly good.</span> <span id="s962">And strangely enough, I don’t remember -- I guess we had almost nothing to wear, so I wasn’t really conscious of -- of what I was wearing, because I recollect the things I wore in Paris and things that I wore in Vienna and then a lot of my clothes at that time, and definitely the brown stockings and the -- and the -- and the other -- in the school, but I don’t recollect my attire at all at that time.</span> <span id="s963">I guess I looked like everybody else, pretty -- pretty bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: Did you know that there were wounded American soldiers on board also?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: N -- I wasn’t aware of it.</span> <span id="s966">I also never saw Ruth Gruber on the boat.</span> <span id="s967">Never did.</span> <span id="s968">At least, I wasn’t aware of seeing her.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: What were th-the sleeping conditions for you and your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: Probably just bunks.</span> <span id="s971">Probably nothing exceptional except that there were no lice to -- to -- to -- to crawl on us.</span> <span id="s972">I’m sure they weren't really plush, but I wasn’t used to that anyway, so I don’t remember being pleased or displeased about it.</span> <span id="s973">The only thing I do remember is being as much on the deck as possible, because I did -- the roll of the boat makes me seasick.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: What kind of activities did you take part in on the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: They had very few activities, not that I recollect at all.</span> <span id="s976">Just really talking to people, sitting on the deck and that’s all I remember.</span> <span id="s977">And eating well.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: We -- did you speak with the other young people your age about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: Never about the experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s982">Maybe -- not experiences.</span> <span id="s983">Geographically we did speak where we came from, which other camps.</span> <span id="s984">Some of my friends -- my friend Jeanette for instance, was sitting in a convent, and a lot of the others came from another camp on another island, Verramonte, I think it was called.</span> <span id="s985">And we did speak about where we came from, just in order to kind of identify ourselves.</span> <span id="s986">Never about the past, and at that time we spoke, I s -- I was exclusively with the Yugoslav group and I exclusively spoke Serbo-Croatian rather than the German.</span> <span id="s987">And our international language in the camp was really Italian, because my friend Jeanette was fr-from Paris and French and she -- I did -- I spoke very little French, even though I had been -- lived in Paris.</span> <span id="s988">So we spoke Italian.</span> <span id="s989">So that was kind of our common language, either Italian or Serbo-Croatian.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Dorrit Ostberg.</span> <span id="s992">This is tape number two, side B. Were there other -- did you notice any of the other young people had been from Vienna?</span> <span id="s993">Did you find anybody on --</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: The only other person that was from Vienna was Elfie, sh -- that I knew, that was in our in -- intermediate circle.</span> <span id="s995">She came from a very, very different background than I did, in the sense that her parents were quite religious and she came from a much lower middle class background than I did.</span> <span id="s996">And at the time, of course, I wanted nothing to do with her.</span> <span id="s997">We became friends much, much later at one of the reunions.</span> <span id="s998">She was -- to me she was the most beautiful little thing ever.</span> <span id="s999">She was much younger, so I figured she was very stupid.</span> <span id="s1000">And the boy that I liked, liked her a lot and that made her of course, not very friendly, you know, very happy.</span> <span id="s1001">So I had very little to do with her.</span> <span id="s1002">But my main friend was Jeanette and then I had my o-other main friend was Paul.</span> <span id="s1003">We were -- we -- we saw each other daily and we -- we went as groups and we did everything in groups.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: Did you have contact with any of the staff people on the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: American sailor, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: None.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: -- navy personnel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: None whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1010">None whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: What was the lack of privacy in living quar -- in living quarters like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: I guess none, because I -- I guess this is what I was used to, so I don’t remember being pro -- that it was a problem to me, let’s put it that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: It was such a tremendous change in your life, after leaving Vienna where you had so much space, then to be in such small quarters with your family.</span> <span id="s1014">Was that hard for you to adjust to?</span> <span id="s1015">For the first eight and a half years of your life it was a different situation, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: Yes and no.</span> <span id="s1017">You have to understand that as children, even though we had maybe 14 rooms, they were not our rooms.</span> <span id="s1018">You know, like when I observe my little granddaughter, she runs through the house, it’s her house, it’s her car, it’s her everything.</span> <span id="s1019">She’s only three.</span> <span id="s1020">It’s definitely her car, her house, her everything.</span> <span id="s1021">We never had that sense.</span> <span id="s1022">We -- our life was our room, my sister’s and my room where the governess stayed with us.</span> <span id="s1023">We were then escorted to the -- to the music room where we played the piano.</span> <span id="s1024">We then went to the dining room to eat.</span> <span id="s1025">We n -- we hardly ever entered my mother’s and father’s bedroom.</span> <span id="s1026">And the -- the big salon, we were only there to be presented to the -- to -- to -- to people when they came.</span> <span id="s1027">The servants’ quarters we were never allowed to.</span> <span id="s1028">The kitchen certainly we were never in.</span> <span id="s1029">The bathrooms we were in, but we-we -- in that sense, we didn’t lose the space.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s1031">When you were on the Henry Gibbons, on the trip to the United States, were there any times when you remember where there were alarm bells, or you had to put on lifejackets?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: Yes, I think so.</span> <span id="s1033">I think we had alarm bells and we had life jackets, but I don’t remember them as being frightened or that I -- that -- that it bothered me or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1034">I’m sure they -- they had that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: Is there anything else you wanted to talk about the -- the boat ride?</span> <span id="s1036">[tape break] On the ship there was -- there were some rabbis.</span> <span id="s1037">Were you aware of that?</span> <span id="s1038">Were there any religious services?</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: There probably were, they probably brought us -- I don’t know, don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: If there were, they weren’t that significant to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1043">And then you arrive in the United States.</span> <span id="s1044">What was your first view of the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: I guess the Statue of Liberty and ge-getting into New York harbor was very, very exciting, and seeing my cousin who -- who c -- who came on the -- board.</span> <span id="s1046">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: Did -- did people cheer as the boat was coming in, do you remember?</span> <span id="s1048">Were you all lining the railings?</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: Yes, I do remember that.</span> <span id="s1050">We were all on deck and we were all very, very excited.</span> <span id="s1051">And he really was my cousin.</span> <span id="s1052">He was -- he was the son of my father’s s -- first or second cousin that had the same house where we used to spend our summers, and he used to come and visit.</span> <span id="s1053">And my cousin Susie had a tremendous crush on him.</span> <span id="s1054">At the time I met him, he was married to the daughter of a very, very close friend of my mother’s.</span> <span id="s1055">And I remember her vividly because she was a beautiful, beautiful woman and I remember her in the evening gown that was totally fru -- her back was totally exposed, and she was so elegant.</span> <span id="s1056">I remember her at functions from my house and I was very impressed with the mother.</span> <span id="s1057">The daughter I had very little contact with at that time.</span> <span id="s1058">She later became a very close friend of mine, because she was much older.</span> <span id="s1059">She was like, at least three years older than my cousin even.</span> <span id="s1060">So that was f -- three, five -- about eight or 10 years older than me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: When you got off the boat and you put your foot on American land, is -- was that a momentous thing for you, or did you just went off the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: We just went off the boat.</span> <span id="s1063">I think the -- the -- just the idea that I was in America was fabulous, but I don’t remember, you know, I’m touching American soil as being something significant to me at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: And your parents reaction, do you -- did they do anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: No, I think they were very pleased to have arrived.</span> <span id="s1066">I think that probably my mother shared the same idea about America.</span> <span id="s1067">I think my father, well, he was really never happy here.</span> <span id="s1068">He wasn't happy in the camp and he wasn’t happy later on when we lived in New York, simply because he never regained what he was, and he had very difficult time adjusting to being just an ordinary man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: Did you feel bad about leaving the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: No.</span> <span id="s1071">No, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: And then, when you got off the boat, where did they take you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: I guess we went on a train again to go up to Oswego, or I think we went straight up to Oswego, we didn’t stay anyplace in between.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: Had they prepared you on the boat for where they were going to be taking you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: No.</span> <span id="s1076">Not -- not that I knew, probably my parents knew, but I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1077">They probably didn’t, because I know a lot of people were very, very disappointed with the -- with the fence, and not being able to -- to -- to leave Oswego itself, the -- I-I mean, Fort Ontario itself.</span> <span id="s1078">Not me.</span> <span id="s1079">I was happy in that camp.</span> <span id="s1080">So I -- and then we as children went to school, so we -- we did go to Oswego.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: Now, when you first got up there, there was a quarantine, cause they didn’t know what kind of condition people were in and -- and you couldn’t leave.</span> <span id="s1082">Was that hard for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: We couldn’t leave where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: Th-The confines in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1085">There was a quarantine.</span> <span id="s1086">I guess they wanted to check peoples’ health --</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: First.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: -- first, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: No, didn’t bother me one bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: And you lived with your parents in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1092">We had two rooms.</span> <span id="s1093">We had a barrack, in the barrack we had two rooms.</span> <span id="s1094">One that -- room for me and my sister and one for my parents.</span> <span id="s1095">They were connected.</span> <span id="s1096">And then we had common mess halls, or eating places and we had common recreational pro -- facilities and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: And were -- were you near your friends from Yugoslavia, and -- living?</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: Yes, we were all very near there, ye -- you know.</span> <span id="s1099">Later on the boys devised some intercom systems or some kind -- that we could call each other.</span> <span id="s1100">I don’t know what they -- they were also -- were very inventive and they did these things and we could call each other on some kind of -- I don’t know, telephone thing that they constructed, or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: And then you se -- yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: But mostly we just ran from one barrack to the other if we wanted to see somebody that we wanted to see, and then we all always met in that common recreational hall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: And what about school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: We -- we were then assigned to school.</span> <span id="s1105">My sister went to -- to high school and I went -- was delegated to junior high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: Now this is a school in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: In the town of Oswego.</span> <span id="s1108">And of course, I hated we -- go -- having to go to junior high school because Paul’s sister, who was my age was telling if she could go to the high school, but I think they didn’t do it age-wise, they just did it knowledge-wise, and obviously I didn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s1109">But of course, I didn’t know that I didn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s1110">But anyway, Jeanette came with me to junior high school, even though she was older, so I think the choice was mainly a choice of knowledge, rather than exactly age.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: What was your impression of the American teenagers in your class?</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: We had almost nothing to do with them.</span> <span id="s1113">We despised the girls because our boys later on fabricated all kinds of -- of stories about what the American girls would do that we didn’t do, and we -- we were totally not knowledgeable about lipstick and -- and nail polish or any of the -- or any kind of cosmetics at all, or any kind of grooming, so we thought they were overdone and overdressed and over-silly, and we had absolutely no contact whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1114">We really disliked them intensely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: And the teachers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: I personally had no -- no recollection or no impression of any teacher that was especially nice to me or especially interested in me, so -- but there were very variant experiences throughout the camp, because many of the people in high school adored their teachers.</span> <span id="s1117">I know my friend Paul loved his -- his shop teacher and he -- he used to make me all kinds of wooden animals after -- because of the shop teachers, and he -- he loved that one.</span> <span id="s1118">And I know that my -- Elfie’s sister, who went to elementary school -- in fact, we saw a letter that she wrote to her and she loved her.</span> <span id="s1119">So it -- it was variant experience.</span> <span id="s1120">But I think mainly I was so embittered of having to sit in junior high school, that was so much below my dignity that I really didn’t take to anybody there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: Did you notice a change in the appearance of the other people that came with you?</span> <span id="s1122">In other words you all were -- had been under such difficult conditions before you got on the boat, and I think you had said that you didn’t realize it, it was because you yourself were not in good condition.</span> <span id="s1123">Did you notice a -- a gradual physical improvement in the people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: Absolutely yes, because I was always very conscious of clothes and appearances and so on.</span> <span id="s1125">The first thing I knew is that my friend Jeanette got a whole wardrobe shipped to her by some relatives or some distant friends or something that was absolutely, to me the most beautiful, most fabulous clothes ever, and I was jealous as ca -- not really jealous, I just was very much taken by that.</span> <span id="s1126">But we also had, I think, we got some money from some -- from my -- and my cou -- my distant cousin that then picked us up when we were released, and then we also had some visitors and I think some -- somehow my father got money, so when it was permissible, I remember going to Oswego and my mother and -- with my mother and sister and we bought dresses and we bought clothes and we bought some stuff.</span> <span id="s1127">I mean, as far as I’m concerned now, they -- I’m sure Oswego was not a high fashion place for me.</span> <span id="s1128">But to -- at me -- to me at that time, I’m sure it was fine, because as I see from the pictures now, we had nice shorts, we had nice blouses and stuff and we certainly didn’t look like bad -- like -- like we u -- disheveled like when we arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: Were there many visitors?</span> <span id="s1130">I know Eleanor Roosevelt came.</span> <span id="s1131">Did you see her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: Yes, I did, and she made a great impression on me.</span> <span id="s1133">We also had this lovely, lovely young women from Israel, who organized us as the Zionist group, and who -- she was very -- I loved her a lot and she was very impressed with me and she liked me a lot, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: So you became a member of this group?</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: Oh definitely I was.</span> <span id="s1136">Not my sister, she didn't want to have anything to do with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: And what did the Zionist group do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: Oh we -- we danced, we -- we learned all the dances, which I loved.</span> <span id="s1139">We sang songs, we -- I guess what a youth group like that does, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: So this woman came and stayed with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: Yes, she stayed in the camp for many, many months and she -- she -- she did all these things with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: Why do you think your sister was not interested?</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: Oh, because she refused being a Jew.</span> <span id="s1144">She refused being a Jew later on in life.</span> <span id="s1145">She only accepted that she was Catholic, and she pretended to be the ca -- a Catholic the rest of her life and died as a Catholic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: Was that because you had been in that school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1148">I think it had to do with her other lessons, that she was older when all this happened to her and I think she turned the other way.</span> <span id="s1149">Just as like my cousin, who was two years older than she was turned an extreme Zionist, went back to Israel and lived in the -- in -- on a kibbutz and raised her children there and became an adamant supporter of Israel.</span> <span id="s1150">My sister just went the other way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1152">Because these things happened to her because she was Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1154">But she -- she -- she spend the rest of her life hiding the fact that she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1155">And she and I had numerous fights about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: And she married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: Yeah, she married my brother-in-law.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: And he was on the boat with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: He was on the boat with her, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: And he was Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: Well, he also had converted.</span> <span id="s1162">He never recognized the Jewish faith.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: So they both officially converted?</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: Well, no, because they both had ba -- they -- see, so many of us Jews converted in Europe, as a matter of total -- of -- of -- of paperwork.</span> <span id="s1165">Some people recognized it.</span> <span id="s1166">The majority, I would say, in -- 99 percent threw it in the garbage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: But your sister and brother-in-law just continued to live that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: Describe Eleanor Roosevelt’s visit, what you remember about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: Oh, I remember her as a marvelous lady, I loved her.</span> <span id="s1171">I also saw her later at Queens College once.</span> <span id="s1172">I -- I -- I was just crazy about that woman, I think she was the na -- one of the few people in politics that I loved, adored and liked everything she ever did.</span> <span id="s1173">And the amazing thing to me was, because I’m -- always was very conscious of physical appearances, and she was not an attractive woman, but she was beautiful to me.</span> <span id="s1174">In my eyes, she was a beautiful woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: Did she speak to you directly when you -- she came up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: No, I think she -- she addressed the whole group or something like that.</span> <span id="s1177">She didn’t speak to me directly on Queens College either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: Now, did the group in Oswego get together as -- the thousand of you as one frequently, or was that unusual?</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: That was never.</span> <span id="s1180">We stayed in groups.</span> <span id="s1181">There was the Yugoslav group, there was the -- the other groups and -- and most of us were Jewish anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: Then di -- what was it like the day that F.D.R. died, April 12th, 1945?</span> <span id="s1183">Do you have any memory of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: Not much, not much.</span> <span id="s1185">Did he appr -- did he approve that we could enter?</span> <span id="s1186">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: Did he approve that you could stay --</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: Yeah, th --</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: -- after the war?</span> <span id="s1190">No, he did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: No, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: He wanted you to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: He wanted us to go back, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: Okay, now, what were your thoughts?</span> <span id="s1195">Did you think you’d be going back to Europe when the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: I think I blanked it out.</span> <span id="s1197">I totally blanked it out.</span> <span id="s1198">I think I had this faith that once I was on American soil I was going to stay here.</span> <span id="s1199">I just never, ever -- as much as I was frightened in Europe of -- of what was happening and that I could be captured and that I could be killed and that I wouldn’t be living, I think the moment I got on American -- the moment we were accepted to go to America, to me this was an act of faith and I never, ever believed that we were going back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: Apparently that first winter was a very hard winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: Very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: And some of the adults stopped working, you know, kind of revolted.</span> <span id="s1203">Any -- any remembrance of that time -- of that winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: Well, I know that my father certainly didn’t work, and he was very unhappy, but my mother wasn’t, she was -- she worked -- oh, she had like 10 jobs there, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1205">She worked in the hospital, she worked in the kitchen, she worked -- she was a member of every committee, she -- she loved it there.</span> <span id="s1206">And -- I’m sorry f -- Gail.</span> <span id="s1207">And no I don’t remember particularly.</span> <span id="s1208">We were so happy with each other, we -- we did so many things.</span> <span id="s1209">We had theater performances, we had relay races, we had sports, we had -- we -- we really had amusement from -- all the time, and we went to school, and we had a wonderful time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: Now, did you take part in these -- any of these specific performances?</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: Every single one of them, you could be sure I was in that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: What were some of them?</span> <span id="s1213">Were they original performances, or did you do performances of well known plays and so forth?</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: They were all original performances.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: Who wrote them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: I have no idea, no clue, but they were written by them, the music was written by them.</span> <span id="s1217">I -- I was in -- in -- we -- we were singing, I was a part of a choral society too, that Leon Leevich organized and directed and conducted.</span> <span id="s1218">And we -- we -- we -- we had rehearsals, we -- we made our own costumes, we -- we did everything, and I -- and I really didn’t care whether I had a major part or a minor part or whether I was -- I was clumsy or not.</span> <span id="s1219">We danced, we did a lot of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: So for you morale was not a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: None whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1222">None whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1223">But not everybody was like that.</span> <span id="s1224">I remember my friend Jeanette, who was much more reserved, and by the ti -- she was the most beautiful girl there.</span> <span id="s1225">She was abso -- oh, every boy there was j -- was just crazy about her.</span> <span id="s1226">And I remember going to her ho -- to her va -- barrack an-and she was ironing her dress she wa -- she was going to wear that evening.</span> <span id="s1227">And I said, how can you just stand there an iron?</span> <span id="s1228">Why aren’t you excited?</span> <span id="s1229">You’re going to dance every single dance.</span> <span id="s1230">And -- and she said, well it’s -- it’s just a dance.</span> <span id="s1231">And I was hopping around, and I-I don’t know why because nobody ever asked me to dance.</span> <span id="s1232">The only time I danced was because they wanted to dance with Jeanette, so they took me, you know what, to get a dance with her.</span> <span id="s1233">But I was so excited about the dances, I was just -- I guess I was very optimistic, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: Now, considering all the difficult physical things you went through as a young child, did you physically mature on time?</span> <span id="s1235">Did you menstruate on time?</span> <span id="s1236">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s1237">Not at all.</span> <span id="s1238">I had great ri -- I -- my menstruation didn’t start til I was 18, even past 18.</span> <span id="s1239">When I got married at 19, I didn’t menstruate for six months after that, and my mother-in-law was -- was dancing around that I was pregnant, but I was not.</span> <span id="s1240">And th -- it -- it was never okay, it -- the only time it got regulated is after I had my son.</span> <span id="s1241">After that I had no more problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: So do you credit that to your difficult situation that you went through as a young teenager?</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: Definitely.</span> <span id="s1244">Malnourishment and all that stuff, definitely.</span> <span id="s1245">My salvation, I always called it, was America, because I finally here got the correct food, and thank God, you know, I didn’t remain short and disformed and all that stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: Did you feel much older as a 15 - 16 year old at the time because you had been through such difficult conditions previously, or did you feel very f -- teenage-y, tee -- you know, 15 - 16 year old?</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: I didn’t feel older, but I remember when I first got to New York, I remember distinctly thinking, I stood still while the rest of the world went on, and I have to catch up to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: Now, this is when you got to New York after Oswego or before Oswego?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: After Oswego, after Oswego.</span> <span id="s1250">I have to make up for all this tremendous time that I lost.</span> <span id="s1251">And I did.</span> <span id="s1252">I finished high school in two years and went to college and so on and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">Q: When you were in Oswego, were you looking forward to leaving, or were you just happy staying there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: Very happy staying, but I was not very disturbed leaving, because we all left.</span> <span id="s1255">Now, I lost -- a little bit I lost my friend Paul because he went to Philadelphia, but at the time he wrote me every single day a letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: Well now -- was this a boyfriend or just a friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: Just a friend, I was ver -- we -- we -- I didn’t date anyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: So you were in the camp for about a year and a half?</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1260">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: And so you were about 16 and a half when you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: And everybody left at the same time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: Yes, everybody left at the same time.</span> <span id="s1265">A lot of people stayed in New York area, like my friend Jeanette, and Elfie stayed and David stayed, and a lot of people.</span> <span id="s1266">And we used to meet as ga -- as -- as a group that stayed here, and we used to do things together, for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: Were there any farewell ceremonies when people -- when it was time to leave Oswego?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: I don’t remember them.</span> <span id="s1269">I don’t remember them, if there were, I don’t know, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1270">I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: And you came to New York City --</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: We came t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: -- and what di -- where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: Okay, my -- my father’s second cousin picked us up, took us to their apartment in the Bronx.</span> <span id="s1275">We stayed with her.</span> <span id="s1276">I only stayed with her a we -- a week or so and then my cousin picked me up and brought me to the Hashara where she was preparing to go to Israel, and I stayed with her about two or three weeks.</span> <span id="s1277">And by the time I was -- I returned, my father already had found an apartment on the east side and we had two rooms, I think, and a kitchen, something like that.</span> <span id="s1278">A furnished apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: Had you thought about going to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A: Well, I was too young, I mean I -- I coul -- not in those terms.</span> <span id="s1281">I didn’t do so well on the Hashara.</span> <span id="s1282">They put me in charge of eggs, I broke all the eggs, they pr -- polishing eggs.</span> <span id="s1283">They put me in charge of polishing the horses, the horse kicked me.</span> <span id="s1284">They finally told my cousin, we love your cousin, but let her be a visitor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: What -- where was this located?</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: In Jersey.</span> <span id="s1287">Was a farm on Jersey.</span> <span id="s1288">My cousin was terrific.</span> <span id="s1289">She was -- she was plowing the field, she was doing everything, and I -- I -- I lov -- I mean, I loved it.</span> <span id="s1290">I danced all night with them, I -- we sang all the songs, that I was good at, but not -- not the cleaning of the eggs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: And you came back to your parents’ apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: Yes, yes, and then I went to Julia Richmond high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: And you said that you needed to make up time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1295">I felt that, you know, the rest of the world went on and I lost a lot of knowledge, and I was an avid reader.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: I assume your English was quite good by then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: No, it wasn’t terrific, because you know, we spoke exclusively Serbo-Croatian and Italian and at home I spoke German.</span> <span id="s1298">So I -- my English was rather poor, I would say, and I learned not very much in -- in the junior high school, because I really didn’t want to learn.</span> <span id="s1299">I mean, I -- I helped my friend -- some of my friends pass some of the tests, but I don’t know -- but I must have not learned too much.</span> <span id="s1300">My English was rather poor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: Were the teachers at Julia Richmond a help to you, being a refugee child?</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: I think they were wonderful.</span> <span id="s1303">First of all they had classes for s -- for people that didn’t know English, special classes, that’s where I met another one of my very close friends.</span> <span id="s1304">And in fact, as an educator later on, I remember going to the guidance department and saying that they should make such classes, but they just refused.</span> <span id="s1305">They weren’t interested, which I thought was terrible.</span> <span id="s1306">But it was a great help to me, and I had special speech classes and they made it possible for me to finish high school in two years.</span> <span id="s1307">I doubled up in English and history and I got all my credits in languages.</span> <span id="s1308">I had three years of German, three years of Italian, three years of French, three years of Latin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: Did you become friendly with many of the American students?</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: One or two, not many, one or two.</span> <span id="s1311">Not many.</span> <span id="s1312">My --</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: What did you -- what did you do in your spare time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: Well, I didn’t have that much.</span> <span id="s1315">Oh, didn’t have that man -- much spare time, and then one year later, I was already 16, I guess, or seven -- and my father insisted that I had to get a job.</span> <span id="s1316">So I worked at Woolworth’s, which I didn’t like, but I had to.</span> <span id="s1317">I mean, he made me work.</span> <span id="s1318">Not that he took the money, I spent all the money on foolishness, but I -- I had to work, that was part of his requi -- requirement.</span> <span id="s1319">E -- and my sister was married already, she was living in Boston with Alex and I used to very often go up weekends and visit with him.</span> <span id="s1320">But my close friend was a French wa -- girl that had lost both her par -- parents in the Holocaust and her uncle, who was Russian, and a multi-millionaire searched all over Europe for her and her sister and brought them over.</span> <span id="s1321">And she was a very close friend of mine and I saw a lot -- and of course I had Jeanette and I saw all my friends from Fort Ontario, and that -- that was my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: Did you tell people at Julia Richmond about your previous experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: I never mentioned my past to anyone.</span> <span id="s1324">I never talked to it -- to my son about it, never to my first husband, never to my second husband.</span> <span id="s1325">The only time that I admitted my past was the first reunion that I attended in -- in New York, and through my friend Elfie, who believed that the Holocaust should be heard, and I reconnected with her there and she’s -- she’s very -- she was interviewed by Spielberg and she’s -- she is very much a believer of -- of admitting the past, talking about the past and so on and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Dorrit Ostberg.</span> <span id="s1328">This is tape number three, side A. And you were saying how you hadn’t talked about your --</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">A: Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Q: -- experiences before.</span> <span id="s1331">And so when you were in high school you -- obviously you -- wha-what did people -- what did you say to -- to the other students?</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">A: Simply that I came from Europe and I was born in Vienna and that I was Jewish, but that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Q: And did you experience any anti-Semitism at Julia Richmond?</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A: Yes, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: Such as?</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: The only time that I even came close to it was that I made friends with this one little Italian girl, and my father had informed me that I was much too stupid to go to college.</span> <span id="s1337">So I applied for the job at a bank, and I went with her for the interview, and I -- I was very enthusiastic at that time and I told them all about my language experiences and so on, and I thought I was a fantastic candidate for them, and I didn’t get the job, and she did.</span> <span id="s1338">And I thought I was -- there was no question she -- she -- sh -- that, you know, I was brighter and had more -- much more experience and so on for the job.</span> <span id="s1339">And the guidance counselor at the time told me, well you simply didn’t get the job because they probably realized you were Jewish, and there’s -- the banks are very anti-Semitic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: And what was your reaction, especially after what you had gone through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: Frankly, I was happy about it, because I really didn’t want the job.</span> <span id="s1342">I wasn’t happy about the anti-Semitism, but I kind of ru -- shugged it off, because New York is not the place where you feel too much of the anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s1343">And I just didn’t really want to face it at all, so I was very happy to go to college.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: And where did you go to college?</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: Queens College.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: And what did you study?</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: Well, my father insisted that [tape break] my father insisted that I know what I was going to study, well I had no clue what I was going to study.</span> <span id="s1348">So I ran in, and my -- my brother-in-law was there visiting and he was always my best friend and I said, Alex, you got to help me, you got to convince Father what I’m -- I -- you have to tell me what to study.</span> <span id="s1349">He said, a wonderful thing for you study is biochemistry.</span> <span id="s1350">I marched into my father’s room and I said, I’m going to study biochemistry.</span> <span id="s1351">He said, okay, you are allowed to go.</span> <span id="s1352">I flunked my chemistry, because I never learned how to -- how to light the lighter.</span> <span id="s1353">I didn’t do so well in my biology either, but I was put in an advanced literature course in German and I then majored in comparative literature, changed my major, my father didn’t know about it and that’s what I studied and majored in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q: And for how long did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: Four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: And what happened after -- soon after y -- you got married though, didn’t you, in between?</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: Very quickly.</span> <span id="s1358">I got married th -- when I was 19 because my sister was 19 when she got married and I had to get married at 19, so I did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: How did you meet your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: I met him because I was tutoring him in the German, he was flunking German and he was very bad at it.</span> <span id="s1361">So I -- and he was much older than I was and I was very impressed.</span> <span id="s1362">I had never been on dates, I had never gone out.</span> <span id="s1363">And we had a couple of dates, and then he had to leave and so we got engaged in a month or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: And ha -- what did your parents think of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: They were v -- th-they weren’t there f -- at -- at that time I was alone in -- in New York at the time.</span> <span id="s1366">My father provided me with a -- with a -- an old -- not old, I guess it was a young woman of 30 years old, who was desperate to get married, who was supposed to cook for me, she never cooked for me.</span> <span id="s1367">But she told me that the first man that asked me to marry, I had to get married because, I don’t know, I shouldn’t miss out the opportunity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q: Where were your parents living?</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A: They were living with me, but they had gone to Europe.</span> <span id="s1370">My father went back to Europe to reinstate his pension and to do some business in Europe with his firm.</span> <span id="s1371">They went for a month or so in the summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">Q: Oh, I see, and then you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A: And that’s when I got engaged to my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: And was your husband Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">Q: And w-what was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">A: Harold -- at this time, Wochstoch, that we changed to Wesley.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q: And why did you change it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: I hated the name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: And he was amenable to this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">A: He was amenable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: And so then did you come back to -- did you live in New York the whole time after you got married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: After we got married, I lived in Oklahoma City for about four months or so because he --</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A: My husband went to school there because he couldn’t fill the requirements at Queens, so he transferred to Oklahoma City College or something, a small college.</span> <span id="s1386">The only one in th -- I think in all of United States that didn’t need a da -- a language requirement.</span> <span id="s1387">And we got married in New York when my father came back in October, and they all rushed me to get married because he wasn’t going to be here in the summer.</span> <span id="s1388">And I got married.</span> <span id="s1389">I -- I loved having a big wedding ring, I loved telling everybody I was married, that they had to address me as -- as Mrs. and not as Miss.</span> <span id="s1390">And then I came back to wi -- to New York and I went back to Queens College.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: And you got your degree?</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">A: And I got my degree.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: I started -- well, I was accepted at Columbia, because they were one of the -- Columbia graduate school, that they were one of the few schools that had a course in comparative literature at the time.</span> <span id="s1395">But we had no money whatsoever and I ug -- so I didn’t go, and I went to work as a weights engineer, where my -- my husband worked as a technical writer at Republic Aviation in Farmingdale.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">Q: And then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">A: And then I had my son and I stopped working for awhile.</span> <span id="s1398">And then afterwards I started working for an optical company because I met one of the wives that the [indecipherable] husband worked there as a partner, at an ORT meeting that I was very into, I was on the board of the ORT.</span> <span id="s1399">And I took a part time job and I got my divorce, and I went back to school to become a -- a schoolteacher and I was -- I taught mathematics for about 20 years.</span> <span id="s1400">And I chose mathematics because at the time languages they weren’t interested in, but they were very interested in math.</span> <span id="s1401">They had a -- they didn’t have enough math teachers.</span> <span id="s1402">And I used to be good at math in college when I first started, but I had a lot of study to do for that, and that’s -- that -- that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: And where did you teach?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: I taught at North Shore High School, which was right near my home for the first year -- two years, and then I transferred to Kennedy High School in Bellmore.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q: And did you ever remarry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">A: I remarried twice since then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: An-And to whom did you marry -- remarry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A: I married an 11 year -- 11 year younger man for the second time, who was not Jewish and I divorced him 11 years later.</span> <span id="s1409">And then I was alone for about nine years or so, and then I married my present husband, who is Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: And your parents?</span> <span id="s1411">What -- what happened with them?</span> <span id="s1412">They -- they came -- they stayed in the New York area?</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">A: My parents stayed in the New York ar-area.</span> <span id="s1414">My father died when my son was about eight or nine years old, and my mother lived to be 92.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: What about the other extended family that you haven’t mentioned, in Vienna, much more extended than just the cousins.</span> <span id="s1416">Did you ever hear what happened to them, or -- you -- you talked about some of them [indecipherable] some going to Israel and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">A: Oh, you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">Q: Did you get any -- after the war, did you hear any more about what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">A: Well, my mother’s brother.</span> <span id="s1420">My mother’s brother was put in a concentration camp in France.</span> <span id="s1421">He was able to escape.</span> <span id="s1422">He -- he had an -- a non-Jewish w-wife who was partially aristocratic I think, who went into exil -- she went to Belgium and she hid him during the war, the whole during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: What -- what was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A: His name was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: That’s all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">A: This is terrible that I can’t remem -- can’t thi -- his wife’s name was Marianne Hugo -- Hugo -- Hugostern.</span> <span id="s1427">His name was Hugostern.</span> <span id="s1428">And he went back to Vienna with his wife after the war.</span> <span id="s1429">They never had any children, and they -- he died there and she lived long afterwards and she also died in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: Can we talk now a little bit about some of your thoughts about the experience that you went through?</span> <span id="s1431">Do you feel, because of what -- what you went through as a young child that you would have been a different person if you hadn’t gone through these -- did this affect you in the way you are today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1433">There’s no question about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: In many, many ways.</span> <span id="s1436">I mean, I -- I don’t think that psychologically I’m totally there where I should be.</span> <span id="s1437">I definitely think all my divorces stemmed from that.</span> <span id="s1438">I’m sure I have a lot of insecurities.</span> <span id="s1439">I -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Q: Wh-Wh-Why do you think your divorces stemmed from what you went through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">A: Simply from the experience of my other friends from col -- from Fort Ontario.</span> <span id="s1442">My friend David is on his fourth wife, my friend Elfie is divorced, my friend Jeanette is divorced, my fr -- her ex-husband had two or three wives.</span> <span id="s1443">Very few of us were able to really -- one of the exception is my friend Paul.</span> <span id="s1444">He -- he married and stayed married for -- for 50 years or 40 years or whatever.</span> <span id="s1445">He is an exce -- there’s some exceptions, but many, many of us have had --</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: But why is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: I would -- I would think because of the -- of the insecurities, expectations, really interrupted lives, really -- I mean, a million -- millions of reasons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: Is there anything today that, anything that you see sometimes, or you hear or you smell that remind you of the difficult times during the war, that bring it back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A: Yes, many times.</span> <span id="s1450">Movies bring it back.</span> <span id="s1451">I -- I remember vividly one movie with Jane Fonda and the ride on the train, where she was smuggling some anti-Nazi material or something, and all of a sudden I felt what I felt on the train when I was seven years old.</span> <span id="s1452">And there are other movies.</span> <span id="s1453">I -- I -- I saw a movie with my friend Jeanette there th -- see, we -- there are certain va -- basic things.</span> <span id="s1454">You asked me previously, did we ever talk about our past experience.</span> <span id="s1455">And we rarely did.</span> <span id="s1456">It was much more of that we knew and we felt the same thing.</span> <span id="s1457">It’s very hard to explain.</span> <span id="s1458">I saw the movie east w -- East West with her.</span> <span id="s1459">And frankly it’s not really related to the Holocaust, but all because it’s -- it’s -- it’s Russia and it’s France, but the oppression and the fear and all that, and -- and we both said we were so happy that we didn’t see it with anybody else but each other, because we both knew exactly how we felt and what disturbed us and what -- you can never get rid of that fear.</span> <span id="s1460">Even today I am petrified when I see a policeman in a car when I am driving.</span> <span id="s1461">I totally always do a big sigh of relief when he passes me and doesn’t stop me.</span> <span id="s1462">Even though I know I’m not speeding, I’m not doing anything, I’m just plain riding a car.</span> <span id="s1463">It’s unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1464">Never ceases.</span> <span id="s1465">And that’s probably partially the reason that I hate, detest guns, detest any sort of violence, cannot stand violence in any form and really do not read a newspaper.</span> <span id="s1466">And even when I listen to the news, I automatically shut them off.</span> <span id="s1467">I listen to the weather, I know what the weather is, I know -- and half the news, unless I make a conscious effort to listen, I do not hear.</span> <span id="s1468">And I’m -- I’m sure this is all related.</span> <span id="s1469">There’s no question it’s all related.</span> <span id="s1470">I have been in therapy, many of my friends have been in therapy, I mean it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: Has it been of help?</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: I guess so, because I mean, I -- I -- I -- I don’t think I’m a very disturbed or very horrible person, but I -- you know, especi -- this is also, you know, one of those questions, how do you know therapy helps?</span> <span id="s1473">You don’t know because you don’t know how you would have done without it.</span> <span id="s1474">So it’s -- it’s not really an easy question to answer and -- and when we have absolutely no proof unless you’ve had -- you were committed and had a mental breakdown, then you know if you got better.</span> <span id="s1475">But -- I mean, my friend Mimi has been in therapy for many years, and is no longer, but that’s the one who lost her two friends in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1476">We all -- we -- I feel we are all marked.</span> <span id="s1477">There is no question on that.</span> <span id="s1478">I even sometimes feel my son is marked, because I raised him, and some of my reactions to raising him.</span> <span id="s1479">Either that or it’s inherited, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1480">He is -- he -- he has a lot of sense of insecurity, which I don’t like to see, and which I -- I don’t remember him having as a child.</span> <span id="s1481">So, us old Jewish mothers, I’m sure it’s my fault.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">Q: What -- wh-when your son was the -- the eight -- and speaking of your son, when he was, let’s say, eight and a half, when things started to get difficult for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">A: I was six when I divorced my son -- my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Q: No, no, no, no, that’s not what I meant, I meant when your son was the age that you were -- you were when Hitler came in and things started to get bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">Q: When he turned that age, did that mean anything special to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">A: No.</span> <span id="s1488">Absolutely --</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">Q: Do you know what I’m saying?</span> <span id="s1490">When he became the age you were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: Yes, no, absolutely not.</span> <span id="s1492">No, no, never even thought of it in those terms, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">Q: When he was the age of you at different times of your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">A: No.</span> <span id="s1495">I mean, he was -- it was still a difficult age for him because I was divorced when he was six years old.</span> <span id="s1496">So, it took him -- and then my husband remarried when he was about eight and a half, I think.</span> <span id="s1497">So he did go through difficult times --</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">A: -- but I don’t think that was related to my experience when I was in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q: Are you angry that you had to go through such a terrible time in your life and others didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s1502">No.</span> <span id="s1503">No.</span> <span id="s1504">A -- s-sa -- I-I was very lucky.</span> <span id="s1505">For -- people that really went through bad times, the people that were killed, that saw their family killed, that were in horrible concentration camps, that were tortured.</span> <span id="s1506">I had none of that.</span> <span id="s1507">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: But there were also people your age who were living here and didn’t go through any of what you went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A: Well, they were living in a different country.</span> <span id="s1510">No, I never felt that way.</span> <span id="s1511">I felt, in the way I always felt, that I wished that my father had accepted the position when he was offered it, e -- and -- and left Europe when he wa -- when -- when his first opportunity came to go to America, because I think we would have -- I would have had a different lifestyle.</span> <span id="s1512">Now, whether that would have made me happier, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1513">I think yes, in a sense, because I -- a-another thing that I feel is a total sense of displacement.</span> <span id="s1514">I never really feel as an American, and I never feel as a European.</span> <span id="s1515">When I’m in Europe I feel American, when I’m in America, I feel European.</span> <span id="s1516">And I -- there is no way that I really belong.</span> <span id="s1517">And -- and there are many, many signs.</span> <span id="s1518">For instance, my house, I -- I never, ever rearrange anything in my house.</span> <span id="s1519">It’s -- it’s very weird.</span> <span id="s1520">I furnish it, and if I just put an ashtray in another place, it bothers me.</span> <span id="s1521">I mean sometimes things have to be thrown out or replaced, not talking about that.</span> <span id="s1522">But I know that many of my friends, the husbands used to say, I -- I always come home to a different home, every day there is a different way of -- of arranging and rearranging.</span> <span id="s1523">I have never rearranged a room.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1526">Must be that I want things as it is, and there’s a certain security.</span> <span id="s1527">And I hang onto things that I don’t -- I haven’t sold my house that I used to live in.</span> <span id="s1528">I -- there’s no question I don’t wi -- you know, I -- I have a lot of my mother’s stuff that is sitting in the basement.</span> <span id="s1529">I haven’t gone through it, I haven’t touched it and I will not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">Q: Are your friends mostly people from Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">A: No.</span> <span id="s1532">My friends are American.</span> <span id="s1533">Judy is American, Laurel is American, I have many American friends, and I have merry -- ma -- I have a few European friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">Q: When you get together with these European friends now, do you talk about the past?</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">A: We never talked about the past.</span> <span id="s1536">I don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">Q: I mean -- I mean now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">A: A little bit with Jeanette.</span> <span id="s1539">Only in relationship to that I -- she did come with me to the n -- to the second reunion.</span> <span id="s1540">She was like me, we never talked -- she and I never talked about anything.</span> <span id="s1541">And she just now also is ready to talk a little bit about it.</span> <span id="s1542">And in fact, we’ve -- we’ve -- just talking about this movie that they’re doing and I have -- I -- half of me says yes I’m going, the other half says no I’m not going.</span> <span id="s1543">I know -- I refused sp -- Spielberg, I refused an interview with Spielberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">A: I just didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s1546">I -- I felt my story wasn’t important enough, interesting enough.</span> <span id="s1547">I -- I -- I hate to dramatize what has happened to me, because I think it’s nothing in relationship to what has happened to other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">Q: But your life was definitely in danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A: Was very much in danger.</span> <span id="s1550">But I survived.</span> <span id="s1551">I was lucky enough to survive.</span> <span id="s1552">I wasn’t tortured.</span> <span id="s1553">I was hungry, so what.</span> <span id="s1554">They have millions of American children that don’t have enough to eat, and they’re hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">Q: Did it affect how you -- your thoughts about your students, your teaching, your attitude towards your students?</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1557">Which way do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q: Well, a simp -- a connection with them, a sympathy with them, because you’re a child -- your -- that time in your life was so difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A: Maybe yes, maybe ye -- yes and no.</span> <span id="s1560">I -- part of me is still very Austrian and I guess Germanic, and I -- now I’m laughing about it because I am retired and everything.</span> <span id="s1561">I was absolutely much too strict about a certain concept.</span> <span id="s1562">I still remember being with my brother-in-law and one of the anecdotes were that they had a radiologist who was teaching the internist and he would say -- he would show them slides, and he would say, what is this on the slide?</span> <span id="s1563">And the man would say, it’s a kidney.</span> <span id="s1564">And he would say it’s excellent, excellent answer.</span> <span id="s1565">Wonderful answer.</span> <span id="s1566">It would be better if you had said it was the liver.</span> <span id="s1567">So, I never forgot that because I used to get sick when they didn’t remember a formula.</span> <span id="s1568">And I used to be angry and they had to memorize the formula.</span> <span id="s1569">It was stupid.</span> <span id="s1570">I mean, what does a formula do?</span> <span id="s1571">Absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s1572">A kidney and a liver, if he takes it out, that means a lot.</span> <span id="s1573">So I -- that was the bad part.</span> <span id="s1574">The good part was that I had -- since I went back to mathematics at such a late age and I had such a gap to do, I -- I-I prepared wonderfully.</span> <span id="s1575">I never assigned a problem I didn’t work through first, and I knew exactly where they were going to be hung up.</span> <span id="s1576">And I understood of them blacking out and being afraid and -- and not being able to achieve.</span> <span id="s1577">That I was good at.</span> <span id="s1578">I was also very gullible.</span> <span id="s1579">I had a kid that told me his father -- he couldn’t do his homework because his father was dying of cancer, I was in tears, I -- I told him how my sister died and everything.</span> <span id="s1580">I ran down to -- oh, he got in trouble with me, he almost hit me.</span> <span id="s1581">So he was -- he was -- w-w-we -- I was in front of the assistant principal and he said, you know, this kid, he lies a lot.</span> <span id="s1582">You see what position you put me?</span> <span id="s1583">I have to call the father now and see whether the mother or whatever -- th-the mother now and see whether the father is really dying.</span> <span id="s1584">You know something?</span> <span id="s1585">He made it all up, this kid.</span> <span id="s1586">Made the whole story up.</span> <span id="s1587">So there are things that were good and things that were bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Q: How often do you think about your past now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: Now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">A: I guess it comes in spurts.</span> <span id="s1592">Right now I think a lot because of the interview, because of -- of having to relive it, which is not so easy for me.</span> <span id="s1593">Most of the time I don’t like to think about it.</span> <span id="s1594">I’m still the same way.</span> <span id="s1595">But I’m convinced now that it has to be addressed, that it has to be done and I’m so grateful to you for doing this because now it’s for my re -- granddaughter, because she’s only three and by the time she’s grown up, I’m going to be real old.</span> <span id="s1596">And she has a place that if she wants to know what her grandmother’s life was like, she can listen to it.</span> <span id="s1597">And that I’m internally grateful to you, because of course, I’m nuts about my granddaughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Q: What are your thoughts about being Jewish now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">A: I’ve always liked being Jewish, but I was never a religious Jew.</span> <span id="s1600">I did go and I always go -- I used to go every year -- it’s very funny, I -- I do observe Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s1601">I used to fast, I no longer fast because of age, difficulty with medication and so on.</span> <span id="s1602">I -- I used to go and -- and -- and pr -- to the Prayer for the Dead for my father.</span> <span id="s1603">I never joined a temple, my son never had a Bar Mitzvah, simply because my first husband didn’t want to pay for it, I couldn’t pay for it, and I was very angry because I wanted to just send him to religious school just for the training and they wouldn’t do that.</span> <span id="s1604">I would have had to join the congregation, and I couldn’t afford it.</span> <span id="s1605">I f -- simply could not afford it.</span> <span id="s1606">And I would have given him the Bar Mitzvah on those terms.</span> <span id="s1607">And then, I’m very rebellious, I -- I -- I don’t -- I didn’t want to be forced in doing something I don’t want to do, and I really didn’t want to join a congregation.</span> <span id="s1608">I don’t -- as I said, I love -- I love being in a temple for the singing, and I like the ceremony, I like the feeling, I like feeling I’m Jewish, but I’m not religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">Q: Even though negative things happened to you because you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">A: Yes, definitely.</span> <span id="s1611">I -- I -- I don’t think that’s the fault of being Jewish.</span> <span id="s1612">I think that happens all over the world to a lot of people.</span> <span id="s1613">A lot of people are persecuted because of their race, religion and -- and beliefs, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: Why did you go back to the first reunion, the Oswego reunion?</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">A: I didn’t go to the first first Oswego reunion.</span> <span id="s1616">I went to the first meeting in New York, because -- why did I go?</span> <span id="s1617">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1618">I just decided that I would like to go.</span> <span id="s1619">Maybe to see some old friends, to make connection.</span> <span id="s1620">Almost walked out of there, but I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">A: Because at first I didn’t recognize anyone.</span> <span id="s1623">And I did go alone.</span> <span id="s1624">I don’t remember whether my son went with me or not.</span> <span id="s1625">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1626">Anyway, but then I met Elfie and we became fast friends.</span> <span id="s1627">I was divorced at the time, she was divorced and we liked each other.</span> <span id="s1628">And -- and then of course I was very much into it.</span> <span id="s1629">I -- I liked going back to the reunions and I met my friend Irene from -- from California and many friends.</span> <span id="s1630">And my friend from Chicago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">Q: What was it like to go up to Oswego?</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A: Strange.</span> <span id="s1633">Very strange.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">A: Well, because things have just changed so much, you know, the whole fort has changed.</span> <span id="s1636">People have changed.</span> <span id="s1637">I didn’t recognize many of the people.</span> <span id="s1638">You know, we are all old, and -- and what -- what bothers me now is that there’s so few of us that are still alive.</span> <span id="s1639">So many of us have died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">Q: Even the people that were your age?</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">A: Even my contemporaries, yeah.</span> <span id="s1642">My friend Evol just died.</span> <span id="s1643">I -- many, many from my immediate group.</span> <span id="s1644">Forget my sister’s group and forget the real old ones.</span> <span id="s1645">In fact, at the last reunion, which was just the 55th reunion, I was amazed, there was somebody there that was a baby in the camp, that was two or three months old when -- when -- when he was in camp.</span> <span id="s1646">So there are very few of us left.</span> <span id="s1647">Especially the last one, there was maybe 20 survivors that came to the camp or something, or 30.</span> <span id="s1648">It’s amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: Did you walk around your old barrack and walk around?</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">A: Yeah, we went to [indecipherable] th-those are the pictures I showed you of -- of the old -- old fort and stuff like that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">Q: When you do that are you transported back in time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">A: Yes, we are, because to me it was a good experience, yeah, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Dorrit Ostberg.</span> <span id="s1655">This is tape three, side B.</span> <span id="s1656">What are your thoughts on the state of Israel now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">A: I f -- well, I have my cousin there, I’m very, very fond of.</span> <span id="s1658">In fact, her -- her granddaughter is here now that I am just nuts about it, Racheli, she’s 21 years old.</span> <span id="s1659">She’s here on a visitor’s visa.</span> <span id="s1660">But I -- I’m a little confused.</span> <span id="s1661">I’m -- I’m disappointed that the peace treaty has not been ratified.</span> <span id="s1662">On the other hand, I was walking with Racheli on the street, and -- and a strange man, he must have -- she’s gorgeous -- stopped us and said, don’t let your government give away any more land.</span> <span id="s1663">Don’t let that happen.</span> <span id="s1664">So I’m torn between that they worked so hard to attain what they have, and now they have to give up some.</span> <span id="s1665">On the other hand, I really abhor fighting and I abhor the terror that they live through, so I would like to see peace come.</span> <span id="s1666">So I -- I don’t know, you know, I’m not very political.</span> <span id="s1667">But I am -- I am extremely happy that Israel exists.</span> <span id="s1668">I’m extremely supportive of Israel, and I -- I -- I -- in the politics, I don’t know where the compromise should lie.</span> <span id="s1669">Neither do many others, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">Q: What are your thoughts about Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">A: Well, I -- I don’t hate Germany.</span> <span id="s1672">I -- I don’t like Germany, but I -- when I went back to Vienna it was very anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s1673">Now -- now my fren -- my cousin Susie will not step into Austria, will not step into Germany, you know, doesn’t want to have anything to do with it, and doesn’t -- never wants to go back.</span> <span id="s1674">I was glad to go back.</span> <span id="s1675">I still have a sentimentality towards Vienna that has nothing to do with really -- it has more to do with the opera, with the music, with the life, with the -- with the arts and all that.</span> <span id="s1676">Has nothing to do with the anti-Semitism that is really rampant there, there’s no question about it.</span> <span id="s1677">It’s a mixed feeling.</span> <span id="s1678">On one had I want all the re -- I applied for that -- for this new thing about the settlement of bi -- as far as I’m concerned, I can’t get enough money out of Austria for me, personally, if I could.</span> <span id="s1679">I do get a pension and I just now applied for this thing with the bank settlements, but it seems that my father only had a box there and not a bankbook and I guess nothing will come of that claim.</span> <span id="s1680">But that way I f -- I don’t -- you know, I feel v-venge -- vengenful of -- a vengeance kind of thing, but not really.</span> <span id="s1681">But I -- I will listen to Wagner, I will listen to -- to German music, that doesn’t bother me.</span> <span id="s1682">I -- I like the music per se, I think it transgresses what people are and what their political beliefs are.</span> <span id="s1683">I don’t think it translate -- I will -- I would drive -- well, maybe I wouldn’t drive a German car, because of the economy, ba -- I -- I -- I don’t really know.</span> <span id="s1684">I -- I have very mixed emotions about that.</span> <span id="s1685">I would go back to Vienna again, even though there is such anti-Semitism, simply for seeing some more, because I only was one or two days in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1686">I really didn’t see enough of what was.</span> <span id="s1687">Maybe it’s not even there any more, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">Q: Did you have any particular thoughts during the Eichmann trial?</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">A: I -- no.</span> <span id="s1690">I -- my thought was killing him doesn’t do any good at all, doesn’t bring back the thousands and thousands of Jews.</span> <span id="s1691">I think killing anybody -- I -- I am against capital punishment, I am.</span> <span id="s1692">Very strongly.</span> <span id="s1693">I -- I -- I don’t -- I don’t see -- killing makes killing, I believe.</span> <span id="s1694">Not that I wanted even [indecipherable] I’m not going that far.</span> <span id="s1695">But in prison and for life would be good enough for me.</span> <span id="s1696">I don’t know, I -- I guess I -- I’m not too v -- vengeance means nothing to me.</span> <span id="s1697">Doesn’t bring back anyone, doesn’t do any good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">Q: When things were going on in the former Yugoslavia, did you feel any kind of connection?</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">A: A great connection, because I understood what was going on, and I -- I fai -- I mean, these atrocities ar-are -- are just horrendous.</span> <span id="s1700">I can’t fathom -- I always say we made such advances in technology, in -- in science and everything.</span> <span id="s1701">We -- we -- we have made no advances in humanity.</span> <span id="s1702">That today, in this age, this killing, this raping, these atrocities can happen, simply means that we -- we’ve concentrated in the wrong interests.</span> <span id="s1703">We’ve -- we vai -- we should -- we should make advances in humanity, not in -- not in science any more, and technology.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q: The fact that you had lived there, did you feel any kind of connection?</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">A: Big connection, because I know of the hatred, I know of the differences.</span> <span id="s1706">And in one way it was only a strong man like Tito that could bri -- that could hold it together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">Q: Since your family and you and many others were deprived of their civil rights when Hitler came into power, did the Civil Rights movement here in the United States reverberate with you in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">A: Why sure, I was, you know, I’m quite liberal in -- in -- in my beliefs and certainly believe that everybody has a right t -- to be ai -- but they -- you know, there -- there’s so many different issues and so many different things and as much as I believe that the gays have every right, that this one has every right to be human, I -- I have mixed emotions.</span> <span id="s1709">For instance, I-I’m not so sure that I totally approve of this thing that went on in Italy right now, during they -- their centennial, their big -- their big thing with the gay parade, or whatever that they [indecipherable] I -- I -- I think it was inappropriate in -- in the timing, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1710">All this -- I don’t like any extreme groups anyway, and I don’t like any extremists in their movements and what they do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">Q: Do you feel that you, as some people have said, that you are two people, one person on the outside and one person on the inside, because of what you went through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">A: No.</span> <span id="s1713">I think I’m two people inside and two people outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">Q: What do you mean by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">A: I have very mixed emotion internally.</span> <span id="s1716">I -- I don’t think that I’m -- I’m -- I’m -- I -- I’m not as -- as -- even though I refused to talk about my past, it -- it wasn't because I wasn’t open, or communicative, or that I couldn’t relate to other people, or that I had a secret life inside of me.</span> <span id="s1717">I -- I -- I don’t believe that.</span> <span id="s1718">I don’t believe that I put on a different front outside.</span> <span id="s1719">I am what I am.</span> <span id="s1720">I may look different on the outside because I’m very conditioned by fashion, by tradition, by -- by so -- by money that can buy things and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s1721">But I -- I don’t think that I’m so much di -- I think I’m very conflicted inside too, of -- of -- of how -- how things should be, or I -- e-e -- about strong beliefs, about -- about a lot of things.</span> <span id="s1722">About where I belong and what I am and what -- what contributions we have made and so on and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">Q: Do you feel you tru -- you belong here?</span> <span id="s1724">You did say when you were here you feel European and when you’re in Europe you feel American, but do you feel that you belong here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">A: I don’t f -- no, I don’t feel I belong anyplace.</span> <span id="s1726">I don’t.</span> <span id="s1727">I mean, you try to feel that this is your home, I’m always happy to go back to the home, or the house that I live in when I go away on vacation.</span> <span id="s1728">But I, truthfully, no.</span> <span id="s1729">I -- I -- I don’t feel the stability, I don’t feel these are my roots, okay?</span> <span id="s1730">I don’t feel roots with anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">Q: When you became an American citizen, what thoughts did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">A: Oh, I was thrilled.</span> <span id="s1733">I -- I -- I’m extremely grateful to America.</span> <span id="s1734">I was thrilled to become an American citizen.</span> <span id="s1735">The nicest experience I had, when my granddaughter became an American citizen.</span> <span id="s1736">She had to after she was adopted.</span> <span id="s1737">She was two years old when she -- when they went through the ceremony, I mean, what ceremony, she -- she -- she -- she had a flag in her hand.</span> <span id="s1738">I mean, what can she do at two, she couldn't talk.</span> <span id="s1739">But I -- you know, I was extremely happy about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">Q: Did you feel a connection with her then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">A: I guess so.</span> <span id="s1742">I guess so.</span> <span id="s1743">I guess so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">Q: You said that you think about your childhood more as you’ve gotten older, and -- and obviously with your granddaughter.</span> <span id="s1745">Any other reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">A: Well, I guess must -- must be grow old -- you know, I deplore the fact that I’m very much alone, that I don’t have any family left, that my sister died, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">Q: Did she have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">A: No.</span> <span id="s1749">She had no children.</span> <span id="s1750">I -- I mean, you know, the closest to my age in family is my cousin in Israel, and -- and I have an older cousin in Detroit, but I don’t feel that close to her.</span> <span id="s1751">And I really, you know, it’s -- it’s -- I love -- you know, I love what she’s done with her life.</span> <span id="s1752">She has -- she has three children and 10 grandchildren sitting on the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1753">Almost everywhere -- eight of them live on the kibbutz, I mean, it’s wonderful.</span> <span id="s1754">And I miss that and I’m very concerned about even having this one, only one grandchild that is all alone and my son being all
