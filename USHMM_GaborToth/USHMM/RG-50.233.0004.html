date of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s4">My name is Irving Balsam.</span> <span id="s5">I am 67 years old and presently reside in the Bronx.</span> <span id="s6">I was born in Poland.</span> <span id="s7">The name of the town was Praszka.</span> <span id="s8">A small little town on the border of Germany and Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">What was your birth date?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">My birth date is 1924, October 17, 1924.</span> <span id="s11">I experienced all the strain and the horror inflicted on the Jews by the Germans.</span> <span id="s12">Since the day they invaded my hometown the first day of September, 1939.</span> <span id="s13">My survival, and I'm speaking to you today as a survivor, is simply a miracle.</span> <span id="s14">It came about because of the unusual coincidences beyond the grasp of human understanding.</span> <span id="s15">I cannot understand myself how this happened, how I survived, or was I chosen to survive by destiny in order to be able to tell the story?</span> <span id="s16">The story to the world that such things should never happen again to the Jewish people or to any people.</span> <span id="s17">My entire family, father, mother, my two older brothers their name was Moishe and Razar (18) and my younger sister, Judy, all were annihilated by the Germans.</span> <span id="s18">At the outbreak of the second World War, September 1, 1939, I was a boy not quite 15 years old.</span> <span id="s19">The severe persecution, the brutality and suffering inflicted on the Jews of our town by the Germans did not fail to reach all the inhabitants of Praszka, my home.</span> <span id="s20">My family, of course, was not exempted.</span> <span id="s21">I as a teenager suddenly encountered a completely new and aryan world, a world full of grief, cruelty and annihilation; a world bent on the destruction of our people.</span> <span id="s22">Why do I say the destruction of our people, the whole world.</span> <span id="s23">I just found out, after the liberation, that the whole world stood idly by and watched the annihilation of the Jewish people, men, women and child, concentration camps, gas chambers, wagons with gas and no one lifted a finger or a warning, even, to the Germans, to stop the killing.</span> <span id="s24">So in 1940, I believe it was, my entire family along with the rest of the town Jewry were corralled into a ghetto.</span> <span id="s25">In 1941, I believe it was in the summer, I, together with many other young Jews were taken out of the ghetto and deported to the slave labor camp near Poznan.</span> <span id="s26">The name of the camp was Buchvardelfost (ph)(c.56).</span> <span id="s27">In the interim, my entire family along with the rest of the Praszka Jewish ghetto were driven to their execution.</span> <span id="s28">All of them perished at the hand of the German tormentors in the death camps of Hamunull (ph)(53).</span> <span id="s29">After working in B_____, preparing the Reichousband (c.55), we called at that time, it mean the super-highway for the Germans, working there almost two years.</span> <span id="s30">Then I was transferred to different labor-torture camps in Germany.</span> <span id="s31">Finally it was now 1943, I was brought to the frightening extermination camp of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s32">There I was robbed of my name, my existence as a Jew and a human being ceased.</span> <span id="s33">I became number 141938 which was brutally burned into my arm and is still visible today.</span> <span id="s34">I became one of the damned and stampeded Jews whose only path led to the crematorium and gas chamber.</span> <span id="s35">I can still see and feel the many chimneys of the camp belching forth the heavy dark smoke.</span> <span id="s36">A stink so old and permeating that it pursues me to this very day and is still too agonizing to recall.</span> <span id="s37">After a few months in confinement, in Auschwitz with the threat of death hanging over my head every day, whether it was by the cruel beatings, hard labor, I was suddenly transferred to another slave-labor in the concentration camp of Lagisza.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Where is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Lagisza was six kilometers before Benjun (c.82) where we built for the Germans, electricity station.</span> <span id="s40">As was the case with most of the Jews and under this circumstances, we experienced unbearable pain because of hunger, suffering, and degredation and hard work.</span> <span id="s41">Just to describe to you one day of food in a camp where we worked from six in the morning to six in the evening.</span> <span id="s42">When you received going out to work in the morning, a black coffee, so-called coffee and with this you had to go out to work.</span> <span id="s43">In the afternoon, during lunch, we supposed to have gotten a soup and it was many days where it did not reach us.</span> <span id="s44">Whether it was spilled during the way by other prisoners carrying it or it was available.</span> <span id="s45">We came home from work, we received one piece of bread.</span> <span id="s46">I would say in the size of the--today two slices of bread and again a soup.</span> <span id="s47">It was the hardest decision of my life, what to eat first.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Why is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">It was, if you will eat up the soup with the bread, you have nothing in the morning--for the morning when you go out to work left over.</span> <span id="s50">So most of us, most of the concentration camp inmates, were trying to ration ourselves.</span> <span id="s51">We ate the little soup at night and we tried, we tried to hold on to this piece of bread until the morning to have it with the coffee.</span> <span id="s52">But hunger, the hunger was stronger than the resistance not to eat.</span> <span id="s53">So you started to nibble a piece now, put it in your pocket, didn't last, the hunger was so great.</span> <span id="s54">I think this is the greatest pain that a human can have, this hunger pain.</span> <span id="s55">So you take another out another piece and you nibble again until you nibble and you nibble till you have nothing left no more.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Were you ever able to --?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">And at night, you feel guilty again that you ate it cause you're not going to have it in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Were you ever able to preserve it until the morning, yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Very seldom, very seldom.</span> <span id="s60">It was only through certain circumstances when I got a little extra that I could preserve a piece for the morning.</span> <span id="s61">This is another story by itself.</span> <span id="s62">When, under what circumstances, sometimes a person got a little extra food, something to eat.</span> <span id="s63">This was, I think, looking back in retrospect, decisions what we making today in life, is nothing compared to the decision when to eat a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s64">It seems I left it like this in this camp till 1944.</span> <span id="s65">In 1945, from 1945 to January, 19--, no from 1944 also, in September till January '45, I was sent to another camp by the name of Yavozna.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Are you able to spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Yeah, V_____, yeah.</span> <span id="s68">The name of the camp, how did they spell it?</span> <span id="s69">Y-a-v-o-z-h-n-a.</span> <span id="s70">Some of the people were working there in the coal mines.</span> <span id="s71">I managed to work again on the outside, again at another electrical company.</span> <span id="s72">Another company that _____(150) for electricity.</span> <span id="s73">Because I had already experience in that work, therefore they choose me to go there.</span> <span id="s74">My second thought was, I was afraid to go down in the coal mines where I never will come up again.</span> <span id="s75">This was always in my mind.</span> <span id="s76">If I go down there, I'll never come up again.</span> <span id="s77">I will starve or be buried alive.</span> <span id="s78">It was till 1945, January, about the 18th, 17th of January where we already knew that the Russian front is approaching closer.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">You could hear bombing?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">We could hear.</span> <span id="s81">We already found those at Cracow was already _____(c.161) and this was only sixty miles away from Cracow.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">This was relatively close to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Yeah, this was close to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s84">Was also affiliated from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s85">Auschwitz by itself had many camps which were affiliated to Auschwitz because they needed slave labor outside of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s86">The day before, I would say one day before the liberation of this camp, they managed, they managed us; thousands were driven out from the camp by our so-called tormentors.</span> <span id="s87">I never ending that much from Poland to the vicinity of Salesea (c.171) to lower Germany, into Germany again.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Lievich?</span> <span id="s89">(c.171) Lievich, that's right.</span> <span id="s90">On the way, many of my friends collapsed and died of hunger, illness, cold weather, simply exhaustion; they couldn't go anymore.</span> <span id="s91">Those who could not continue on this inhuman march, were shot dead by the Germans immediately.</span> <span id="s92">I still cannot understand my endurance, the strength to survive it all where my only food was snow on the ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Had they given you a ration before you left the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Yes.</span> <span id="s95">They give us a ration before we left the camp but it lasted also for this one night.</span> <span id="s96">Then we were sleeping outside on the outer fields and our food was only snow.</span> <span id="s97">Someone found something beneath the snow, grass or something.</span> <span id="s98">One night, in the beginning of February, this was January, 1945, when we reached the area of Lievich, Germany, again we were packed into a huge barn, like cattle ready for slaughter.</span> <span id="s99">It seemed that time that the murderers were about to kill all of us wretched, powerless and defenseless victims.</span> <span id="s100">I was not mistaken in my assumption.</span> <span id="s101">That night, one of those night I, Irving Balsam, decided to risk an escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">No, I did escape with another inmate which we helped together.</span> <span id="s104">In camp, in concentration camp, everyone had a buddy.</span> <span id="s105">You could not survive alone.</span> <span id="s106">You had to have a buddy, a friend, a brother, we call them a brother, a buddy.</span> <span id="s107">I also had a buddy, a young boy who was the same age that I was.</span> <span id="s108">We kept to ourselves since Lagisza together.</span> <span id="s109">I felt that time I couldn't stand the cold weather, the beating on the way, the shooting of those who could not walk any longer.</span> <span id="s110">I felt I had nothing to lose.</span> <span id="s111">On that bitterly cold night, I and my buddy Henry, a young Jew, Henry Margolis was his name, a young Jew from Kalisz, also a little town in Poland, we fled the barn.</span> <span id="s112">We didn't flee the barn at first.</span> <span id="s113">We first hid ourselves underneath the straw.</span> <span id="s114">We hid ourselves in the machine which was made the--from the wheat corns, cleaned the wheat, the corns, from the leaves.</span> <span id="s115">They used to call it a thrash machine.</span> <span id="s116">A thrash machine, you know, you have those machine where they farm.</span> <span id="s117">First we hid ourselves underneath the straw.</span> <span id="s118">It's on?</span> <span id="s119">As we lay there in this machine inside, we found a lot of corn to eat, the little corn.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">From the wheat?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">From the wheat, that's right.</span> <span id="s122">This corn kept us there one day and one night.</span> <span id="s123">But the cold, it was in January, in February and this cold in Germany there is very--the weather is cold, probably below 20 degrees or something.</span> <span id="s124">We couldn't stand no more this bitter cold.</span> <span id="s125">We felt that our feet are freezing.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">How many people were in that barn?</span> <span id="s127">Hundreds or--?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">The people were--by hundreds of people.</span> <span id="s129">A lot of them were hiding but most of them were caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Hiding in various places in this barn?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Various places of this barn.</span> <span id="s132">Most of them were caught.</span> <span id="s133">It seems that our hiding place was the best, was the best.</span> <span id="s134">As we laid there in the barn, the cold permeated our very marrow of our feet.</span> <span id="s135">It was cold, we felt we were going to be frostbitten which is worse, the beginning already of frostbite in our legs.</span> <span id="s136">We--later in the morning, we heard a voice in the barn.</span> <span id="s137">We heard a voice speaking to the chickens.</span> <span id="s138">It was a farmer boy who happened to be Polish- speaking so he spoke in Polish words, we recognized him, to the chickens that they should gather together, he brought them food.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Were the other prisoners still in the barn at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Was no more in the barn?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">The barn had been evacuated?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">The barn had been evacuated and the further marched.</span> <span id="s143">The further marched and we were left alone.</span> <span id="s144">While we met this man, we spoke to him in Polish.</span> <span id="s145">We told him that we are hungry.</span> <span id="s146">We would like also, if it is possible, to bring us some food.</span> <span id="s147">To which he agreed.</span> <span id="s148">You cannot imagine our--not satisfaction--our hope that we thought here we finally find somebody speaks Polish, we are Polish.</span> <span id="s149">He probably recognized that we are Jews and we told him and he agreed to bring us some food.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Was he a boy younger than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">He was about--we the same age--about 17, 18 years old at that time.</span> <span id="s152">When he agreed, I hoped that time we will outlast this nightmare of the war.</span> <span id="s153">It seemed almost at the end.</span> <span id="s154">However, it seems that Jewish survival in those awful days was not easy, not even in the best of shelters.</span> <span id="s155">After a short wait our benefactor, instead of delivering the sorely needed substance, returned with Gestapo men who immediately arrested us and threw us back into the prison of Glewitz (c.288).</span> <span id="s156">While the others marched on, I'm sure to further extermination or to their deaths.</span> <span id="s157">When we came to jail, we found about sixty more completely miserable, ill Jews, all of them captured escaped from the death march.</span> <span id="s158">It seems that a lot of them also ran away from the death march and were hiding in different places.</span> <span id="s159">Before long, the Germans had driven most of us captives into the prison yard, forty of them were shot to death immediately.</span> <span id="s160">Immediately after that, the German assassins ordered us, the remaining 20 Jews to pile the murdered victims--some dead and others still half alive, you can imagine that not everyone was shot to death, some of them were alive--into a huge wagon which they all had prepared.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">This was a train car?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">No, was a horse and a buggy but horse-wagon without horse.</span> <span id="s163">We had to harness ourselves to the wagon and drag the vehicle to an old Jewish cemetery on the outskirt of Gl_____(c.314) Were you amongst those having to pull?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Yes.</span> <span id="s165">I was amongst them having to pull.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">How many of you were pulling, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">All 20 of us went with this.</span> <span id="s168">We were pulling and pushing this wagon with the dead bodies.</span> <span id="s169">The trip to this burial place accompanied by savage blows and curses from the cold-blooded henchmen, was an experience, deeply shattered experience which I--it's agonizing to this day, even to the thought.</span> <span id="s170">Whenever I tell this story, it is--it takes off years of my life because we thought that time will heal but--.</span> <span id="s171">.</span> <span id="s172">When we reached the cemetery, we saw two open mass graves.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Was this a real, an established cemetery?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Yes, was established, old cemetery.</span> <span id="s175">I found it after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Was it a Jewish cemetery or--?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A Jewish cemetery in Germany.</span> <span id="s178">The Germans on the German territory, did not, did not vandalize the cemeteries, the old German cemeteries.</span> <span id="s179">Only in Poland they did it.</span> <span id="s180">But the Germans had Jewish cemeteries.</span> <span id="s181">I went to look up this cemetery in 1979.</span> <span id="s182">I went to Germany on a trial, testifying against the Nazis.</span> <span id="s183">When we came to this cemetery, we saw two mass graves.</span> <span id="s184">It immediately dawned on me, after all I had four years experience with the Germany, I know already their thinking about us.</span> <span id="s185">They treating--the way they were treating us--as sub-humans that in one of the graves was for the other Jews which they were shot before.</span> <span id="s186">The other is for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Was your friend Henry still alive with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Yes, my friend Henry was alive.</span> <span id="s189">It was clear to us and to me and we were talking among ourselves that we would be the next.</span> <span id="s190">I was not at least mistaken in the assumption.</span> <span id="s191">As soon as we---already slowed the Jews where they were disposed into the mass grave, the German criminals resumed the shooting and immediately the dead, dying, half-alive, and heavily wounded began falling into the second grave.</span> <span id="s192">The full cemetery, the area there was saturated with the blood of our victims, with my friends, with my people what we were together in camps.</span> <span id="s193">For the time, we had piercing screams, heart-rendering moans and pained _____(374) for help.</span> <span id="s194">Even my friend Henry fell into the mass grave and he was not shot.</span> <span id="s195">I heard him scream out, out, out.</span> <span id="s196">Suddenly, a dead silence enveloped the entire cemetery.</span> <span id="s197">I was among the unfortunate Jews in the second mass grave.</span> <span id="s198">As the stillness continues, the German henchmen yelled into the grave.</span> <span id="s199">I can tell you in German what they said.</span> <span id="s200">Bist du___(c.387), anybody alive, __________, come out.</span> <span id="s201">Anybody alive, come out.</span> <span id="s202">Anyone still alive, come right out.</span> <span id="s203">I and four more Jews, who escaped the assassin's bullet, crept out and were ordered to cover the horror of the gasping hole containing the dead and the near-dead Jews.</span> <span id="s204">How did we manage to come out without any bullet?</span> <span id="s205">When you dig a grave, you have sand from the grave, right?</span> <span id="s206">The sand creates a mound of other sand.</span> <span id="s207">When they aimed their machine gun and their pistols into the grave, they stood on this mound of sand.</span> <span id="s208">We, five boys who were laying on this side of the grave, this side the bullets did not reach us because they were going over us.</span> <span id="s209">So all of us who were laying on the side of the wall, on this one side of the wall, did not get any bullets.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">So they had forced you into the grave first?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">That's right.</span> <span id="s212">First they started shouting.</span> <span id="s213">Then they said, jump in.</span> <span id="s214">So we all jumped in, we had no choice.</span> <span id="s215">We did that under the threat of the Nazi guns pointing at us, we came out.</span> <span id="s216">When the gristly crime finally, was finally out of sight, the executioner shot two more of our small group and then aimed their guns at me and the remaining two Jews.</span> <span id="s217">Miraculously, their guns did not discharge because there were no more bullets left in them.</span> <span id="s218">Was everything used up, they kept on shooting into the mass grave.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">They aimed the machine guns at you again?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">They didn't have no more bullets in the machine guns.</span> <span id="s221">They only have side pistols.</span> <span id="s222">When we all five came out, they used the rest bullets on the other two.</span> <span id="s223">When they aimed the gun at me, no more bullets.</span> <span id="s224">A man, an older man who had on one hand, one arm, he must have been maybe from the first World War, a veteran or something, he still had his gun in his holster.</span> <span id="s225">When the other Gestapo men ask him, Hans Hans, give me dine browling (444).</span> <span id="s226">That means Hans, give my dine pistol to finish them off.</span> <span id="s227">This older man refused to give the pistol.</span> <span id="s228">He said for dezen younga (449), for these young men, I don't give a pistol.</span> <span id="s229">They left him alone.</span> <span id="s230">I could say that's why, probably I am alive today, to tell the story.</span> <span id="s231">After we were finished, we were commanded to harness ourselves to the wagon which transported its ill-fated load to the cemetery and the hairy guard, again with the--four of them, German, SS men and soldiers together, were driven back to this Gl___ Prison where we were locked in for three more days.</span> <span id="s232">It seemed that time to me, like an eternity.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">How many days total were you in prison?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Maybe, two weeks.</span> <span id="s235">Fate, however, saved us once more from the clutch of death.</span> <span id="s236">After the three days confinement in the Gl___ prison, I was taken out of jail and I was certain I'm being led to the execution again.</span> <span id="s237">Instead we were transferred to the railroad station and transferred on the cattle wagons to another concentration camp in Austria by the name of Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s238">After being in Mauthausen a few days, I was again sent on a commando to Koozen (c.493).</span> <span id="s239">It was a camp, Koozen #2 where we worked on Messerschmidt, airplanes for the German army.</span> <span id="s240">I can't recall how many days, how many times.</span> <span id="s241">It was absolutely, completely no food at all.</span> <span id="s242">One soup with a little green stuff swimming around in the soup, I don't know what it was, was food for a whole day.</span> <span id="s243">For this we worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">You worked in the airplane factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Yeah.</span> <span id="s246">The airplane parts factory was in the mountains, inside, in mountains.</span> <span id="s247">They should not--they were hidden from the attacks of the Allied airplanes.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Did you have a specific job each day?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Yeah, we would tighten the screws.</span> <span id="s250">We mounted screws and we put on wheels.</span> <span id="s251">It seems they didn't have no more motors for the airplanes.</span> <span id="s252">There were tens, twenties, maybe hundreds of airplanes that were ready to be shipped but they didn't get--have the motors for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Everything else was finished on them?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Everything was finished, just the motors they didn't have.</span> <span id="s255">They never arrived because I think the Allies bombarded the factories with motors.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Do you remember them ever threatening you about attempting to sabotage an airplane?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">No.</span> <span id="s258">They didn't threaten us.</span> <span id="s259">It was a known fact because every where you went.</span> <span id="s260">There were signs, sabotage, dein tod, (517), if you sabotage, you'll be killed.</span> <span id="s261">Everybody was very careful to do what you could precisely.</span> <span id="s262">After being in V_____(c.528) for, I would say, some days, this was the last camp, not to exterminate us but to starve us to death.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Not Goozen (c.528)?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Not Goozen, taken out from Goozen, they took us again on a march to another town in Austria what's the name, near Veldts (c.538), in the forest was a camp by the name of Gunkerin ______(c.535) which there were only two barracks and 20,000 people.</span> <span id="s265">How can you fit in 20,000 people in two barracks which can only hold maybe 500?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">I've read that many were crushed to death in the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">That's right.</span> <span id="s268">The people were crushed to death.</span> <span id="s269">In the morning when you got up in the morning, you thought you sleeping with somebody and in the meantime the other guy was already dead.</span> <span id="s270">You slept among bodies, sickness, typhus, dysentery, everything was going on.</span> <span id="s271">And the rain did not stop.</span> <span id="s272">The forest was full of rain, day out and day in for the last ten days, there was nothing but rain.</span> <span id="s273">If we got already, one can of soup for a hundred people, there was specially a camp to starve us.</span> <span id="s274">The soup never reached the people because the hunger was so great--the hunger was so great from the people that they became inhuman.</span> <span id="s275">They attacked the can of soup and spilled it on the floor.</span> <span id="s276">They were eating from the floor with the mud, with every dirty thing in the rain.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Let me switch the tape.</span> <span id="s278">(Side B, Tape 1) Had the war lasted, I mean had the American army not reached us on May 5, 1945, if this would have lasted another week, none of us would have been alive today from that particular camp.</span> <span id="s279">We were liberated May 5 by the American army.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Do you remember when the SS left?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Yes.</span> <span id="s282">Friday evening.</span> <span id="s283">I remember May was on a Saturday and Friday evening, all of a sudden we saw that the watch booth from the watchmen from the SS men from the Germans getting emptied out.</span> <span id="s284">They're running away.</span> <span id="s285">We did not know the reason because we were inside deep in the forest.</span> <span id="s286">However, many boys who had still the strength to go out and investigate what happening had noticed tanks with the star.</span> <span id="s287">We didn't know that time what tanks it was, whether it was Russian tanks, American tanks.</span> <span id="s288">We know only that--tanks.</span> <span id="s289">It seems that the same night, the American army passed--,liberated us.</span> <span id="s290">The night of May 4 and May 5.</span> <span id="s291">All of a sudden, the day of May 5, we were sitting in the forest and the sun started to shine.</span> <span id="s292">Every one of us was full with lice, bitten, wet clothes.</span> <span id="s293">So we started to remove our clothing and shake it out from the lice.</span> <span id="s294">It seems that it didn't help much.</span> <span id="s295">After we found out a few days later, we were all infected t with typhus.</span> <span id="s296">When the American army rounded us up and put us into field hospitals--they created special hospitals for us, the ill survivors.</span> <span id="s297">Many hundreds died after the liberation from the sickness.</span> <span id="s298">Was too late for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Was your friend Henry still alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">I am the lucky one who survived.</span> <span id="s301">My wife too in the same camp.</span> <span id="s302">Who is alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Henry.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">No he was shot that time in the grave.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Oh, he was shot, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">I lost my friend Henry.</span> <span id="s307">He got down among the second batch, He was separate.</span> <span id="s308">After the war--from there we stood--we were liberated=--we were in the hospital for many weeks where I met my wife, at that time a young girl.</span> <span id="s309">weighing maybe sixty pounds, fifty pounds.</span> <span id="s310">We comfort each other since that day.</span> <span id="s311">We remained.</span> <span id="s312">We were in the DP camp, displaced persons camp in Austria until about 1948, until we could reach the shores of the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Which DP camp were you in?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">In Austria, in Links (9).</span> <span id="s315">Vien______.</span> <span id="s316">Ever heard about that?</span> <span id="s317">We reached there because we had family in the United States.</span> <span id="s318">We reached the shores of the United States.</span> <span id="s319">We established our lives again here.</span> <span id="s320">We came to this country, we had a small child, one year old.</span> <span id="s321">That's the best we had.</span> <span id="s322">We kept on going and hoping.</span> <span id="s323">I think that's what sustained us.</span> <span id="s324">We're still hoping up till today, maybe someone is still alive, some other place which we don't know; I didn't believe that my parents are not--no more alive.</span> <span id="s325">I didn't believe that my brothers and sister are not alive no more.</span> <span id="s326">I guess the ____of every survivor.</span> <span id="s327">And this is what sustained us in camp.</span> <span id="s328">Had I known that no one is alive from my family, I probably wouldn't have fought to live.</span> <span id="s329">But this was one thing we were hoping that somebody is alive and that it pays to live to tell the story.</span> <span id="s330">Because my father told me when I was taken to the first camp, that he blessed me.</span> <span id="s331">I was the first one to leave my house to be taken to camp.</span> <span id="s332">He says go ahead my son.</span> <span id="s333">When you come back, you tell me the story.</span> <span id="s334">He told me I should tell him the story and that was in my mind.</span> <span id="s335">To die now, what would I tell my father?</span> <span id="s336">I had nothing to tell him.</span> <span id="s337">Nobody would tell him the story, That's what I'm thinking.</span> <span id="s338">That's why I call myself a survivor.</span> <span id="s339">What else can I tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">When did you come to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">In 1948, December, 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">I see.</span> <span id="s343">You came --.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">I established myself.</span> <span id="s345">I came here to the Bronx.</span> <span id="s346">I came to the Bronx, I remained in the Bronx.</span> <span id="s347">a loyal citizen of the Bronx.</span> <span id="s348">I must say my life was not bad in the United States.</span> <span id="s349">I succeeded in business and have a nice family, three children, grandchildren.</span> <span id="s350">We are close, close-knit family.</span> <span id="s351">If someone is alive, I doubt it.</span> <span id="s352">It's too late already.</span> <span id="s353">It's today, 47 years after the war.</span> <span id="s354">I'm very involved now in the survivors' movement.</span> <span id="s355">I am the president of the Riverdale chapter of the Holocaust Survivors.</span> <span id="s356">You heard of them.</span> <span id="s357">We have two hundred families as members.</span> <span id="s358">We are having meetings practically very month with our aim is to teach, to teach the next generation, to sensitize the community, to transmit to our children and to help others.</span> <span id="s359">We have a very good outreach program.</span> <span id="s360">If a survivor is in need, we do help.</span> <span id="s361">Therefore, I think I have a mission in life.</span> <span id="s362">I am fulfilling this mission, to tell the story.</span> <span id="s363">Anything else you want to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">I'd like to get a little more detail if that's possible.</span> <span id="s365">I like to get some information about your life before the war.</span> <span id="s366">About your family, where you lived, what your father did for a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">As I mentioned before, I was not quite 15 when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s368">I was born in 1924.</span> <span id="s369">The war started in 1939.</span> <span id="s370">A month before my birthday, my 15th birthday.</span> <span id="s371">I came from a family of very--a religious family.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Hasid or--?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">No, my father was not a Hasid.</span> <span id="s374">Observant, religious family.</span> <span id="s375">Wore a hat and a short, short little beard, modern.</span> <span id="s376">Today we would call it modern orthodox, modern orthodox.</span> <span id="s377">We were--we come not from a rich family.</span> <span id="s378">My father was a tailor.</span> <span id="s379">He struggled for a living most of his life.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">He was an independent tailor?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Independent tailor, that's right.</span> <span id="s382">I mean, he worked for others.</span> <span id="s383">They brought him work.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Did he work out of your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Of the home, yeah.</span> <span id="s386">He worked at home.</span> <span id="s387">He had a machine in his house and all ______160) was necessary to do his job.</span> <span id="s388">Our life was not easy because he only had, as I remember, as far as I can remember from home--.</span> <span id="s389">A person can only remember the last few years, right?</span> <span id="s390">between 10 and 15 years.</span> <span id="s391">He can't remember before.</span> <span id="s392">He worked only six months a year.</span> <span id="s393">The last six months we were already bad off.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Why was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Because we lived in a small town.</span> <span id="s396">It was a lot of people, Jewish people, in the same situation.</span> <span id="s397">Were a lot of tailors and carpenters and all, was not steady work.</span> <span id="s398">When he worked six months a year, we had to--the other six months was struggling.</span> <span id="s399">Here and there some work.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">What was the mainstay of--?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Was not easy for us to even have enough for food in the family, sometimes as I can recall.</span> <span id="s402">But in 1938, life started to get a little bit easier already, before the war.</span> <span id="s403">Because I had an older brother who was 18 years old and he was already employed as an electrician in the city of Lodz and he helped out already with some, what do you call it, he sent some money home, helped out the rest of the family.</span> <span id="s404">So it was a little better.</span> <span id="s405">Then I joined in, as a fourteen year old boy, also left for Lodz, to study.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">My intention was to study.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">You went to a gymnasium there?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Yeah, I wanted--my intention was to study in gymnasium and to learn a profession.</span> <span id="s410">But it was not easy because I didn't have the means--</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Financial means?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">the financial means to remain in this big town.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Were you staying with your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">I was staying with my brother as far as he could, he helped me.</span> <span id="s415">We slept together, we ate together.</span> <span id="s416">But I still needed more financial means.</span> <span id="s417">I went to work also as a shipping boy.</span> <span id="s418">Both of us already made sure that we supplied my parents, my father and mother with the other two siblings home with money.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Were you two the oldest?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">We were the oldest.</span> <span id="s421">We used to send them home some money that their life should be a little easier.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">So you worked and you were going to school at the same time?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">No.</span> <span id="s424">I could not.</span> <span id="s425">I was thinking, I was working--.</span> <span id="s426">No, I would intend to go to school because I registered for the next year's semester.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">So you were going to work a year?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">That's right.</span> <span id="s429">The rest of the semester and then the war broke out and it came near the border and it never happened again.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Was this a Jewish gymnasium?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">No, it was not--I don't think it was.</span> <span id="s432">It was a Polish technological school, like you learned a trade.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">What was your goal?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">My goal was to learn a, how you call this in English?</span> <span id="s435">I had two goals.</span> <span id="s436">I couldn't get into one because first I wanted to be a locksmith mechanic, ____ (174) locksmith and if not, I wanted to say--my second choice would be a teeth mechanic.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A dentist or--?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Not a dentist.</span> <span id="s439">Just to make the teeth.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Oh, to produce false teeth or--?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Yeah, how do you call it, yeah a producer of teeth.</span> <span id="s442">You know, something like this.</span> <span id="s443">Teeth mechanic, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">I guess after watching your father struggle, you weren't about to become a tailor?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">No, my father would not let us become a --.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Yeah.</span> <span id="s448">When my mother used to say, you have boys going around already, let them help you something to--let them help you something.</span> <span id="s449">He says get away from here, from the machine.</span> <span id="s450">I will not permit you to be in this trade.</span> <span id="s451">Enough he said.</span> <span id="s452">He took it over from his father, his father took it over--he says enough.</span> <span id="s453">With your generation, this is stopping.</span> <span id="s454">He was right.</span> <span id="s455">He never permit us even--.</span> <span id="s456">You know children sometimes help home, put on a button, right?</span> <span id="s457">Oh, no!</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Nothing.</span> <span id="s460">He never permit us to help him out.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Prior to going to Lodz, you were just attending public school, Polish public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Public school.</span> <span id="s463">Attend public school and I finish public school.</span> <span id="s464">I finish seven years in public school.</span> <span id="s465">This was in _______(197) in Poland, seven year public school.</span> <span id="s466">We were going to school together with Polish, Polish Catholic boys and Jewish boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Did you also go to Cheder after school?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Yes.</span> <span id="s469">We were going to school till one o'clock.</span> <span id="s470">By the time we came home, grabbed something, two o'clock we had to go to the Jewish school.</span> <span id="s471">We stood there till six, seven evening.</span> <span id="s472">Came home with lanterns.</span> <span id="s473">It was already dark, there was no electricity in town.</span> <span id="s474">We had a lantern.</span> <span id="s475">Not everybody had a lantern, but some of us, and we all came home together.</span> <span id="s476">I was never dressed Hasidic, I was dressed more in modern clothes, a boy would dress already in that time.</span> <span id="s477">We were learning, we had to do homework.</span> <span id="s478">We had homework for Hebrew school and for the regular public school.</span> <span id="s479">The hardest time was, for me, I remember for us in school was, because the school was open six days a week including Saturday.</span> <span id="s480">We Jewish boys did not go Saturday to the school.</span> <span id="s481">So we weren't, we missed school every Saturday and Sunday.</span> <span id="s482">We had to get from the other school friends,--</span></p> <p><span id="s483">The Poles?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">From the Polish school friends, we had to get the lessons what we had to prepare for Monday, for school.</span> <span id="s485">If you didn't make your homework, you failed.</span> <span id="s486">You could stay in a class, it's not a kid, you could stay two, three years behind, you would fail.</span> <span id="s487">Luckily, I managed to pass every grade.</span> <span id="s488">I was very good in history and mathematics and how you call, earth science.</span> <span id="s489">Earth science that time so I passed.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Do you remember any episodes of harassment, antisemitism ?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">We had our share.</span> <span id="s492">We had to have.</span> <span id="s493">We were always harassed by the other schoolboys, by the Polish schoolboys during the intermission, during the intermission, we were harassed.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">The intermission was--?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Between every session of school.</span> <span id="s496">We start at 8 o'clock.</span> <span id="s497">Between 8 and 9 was a lesson in Polish, right?</span> <span id="s498">Then you had a five-minute intermission, you went in for math.</span> <span id="s499">Then you have the big intermission between 10 and 11.</span> <span id="s500">We had 20-minute intermission.</span> <span id="s501">We supposed to have, eat your snack, eat your lunch.</span> <span id="s502">There we had the biggest skirmishes and fights with the Polish boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Do you remember ever getting involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">I got very much involved.</span> <span id="s505">I got very much involved in --.</span> <span id="s506">I must say most of the time, we fought back.</span> <span id="s507">We fought back and we prevailed.</span> <span id="s508">Was a time where they were already afraid for us, to touch us because they knew that they will start with the Jewish boys and among my friends, were very strong ones.</span> <span id="s509">They were very strong boys and they knew that they going to get beaten up if they start with us.</span> <span id="s510">We always had skirmishes.</span> <span id="s511">We had antisemitic outbursts from teachers who made antisemitic remarks in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Do you remember any specific--?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Yeah, I remember one specific remark from a schoolteacher who taught us math.</span> <span id="s514">Was it math or history, no, a history teacher.</span> <span id="s515">He said we have in Poland--Poland would be a good country if we could get rid of our five million people.</span> <span id="s516">He didn't mention Jews.</span> <span id="s517">He said five million people too much in Poland.</span> <span id="s518">If we could get rid of them, we would--Poland would be an excellent country.</span> <span id="s519">Would be enough work for all the Polaks, everything was bad at the time.</span> <span id="s520">A Jewish boy stood up and he says to him, why don't you mention the name?</span> <span id="s521">you mean the three million Jews?</span> <span id="s522">the two million what you have there in___(248).</span> <span id="s523">He didn't answer.</span> <span id="s524">He didn't answer but he meant the Jews.</span> <span id="s525">He meant the Jews because their thought was if Poland would get rid of the Jews, they would have a better life--which it proved in history was just the opposite, just the opposite.</span> <span id="s526">Any country that get rid of the Jews is suffering.</span> <span id="s527">They need the Jewish know-how, Jewish businessmen.</span> <span id="s528">They need the Jewish brains, they need the Jewish profession.</span> <span id="s529">They know it.</span> <span id="s530">They thought that they can take out but they cannot.</span> <span id="s531">They could take our apartments, they could take our furniture, they could take our life, they could take away everything.</span> <span id="s532">But they couldn't take away our brain.</span> <span id="s533">Therefore, it was wrong and antisemitism was very great in Poland.</span> <span id="s534">And in the last years, which I remember the last years of my life in Poland, 1938 and '39, I must say therefore the Germans had an easier job with the Jews in Poland than in any other country.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">They had natural collaborators?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Had natural collaborators.</span> <span id="s537">Absolutely right.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Did your family live in an apartment or a house?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">No, we lived in an apartment.</span> <span id="s540">We lived in an apartment.</span> <span id="s541">Had a kitchen smaller than that, called a kitchen and one bedroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">In one bedroom, cold flat as you call it today.</span> <span id="s544">Cold flat, there was no heat; there was no electricity; there was no gas.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Running water?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">No running water, no toilets.</span> <span id="s547">We lived.</span> <span id="s548">We lived a happy life, a happy family home, father and children.</span> <span id="s549">Father went down in the coldest weather.</span> <span id="s550">Brought up coal and wood, made a little fire in the oven.</span> <span id="s551">When I grew up already, me and my brother, we went to the pump to pump water.</span> <span id="s552">To pump the pail water we brought it home.</span> <span id="s553">Mother made a meal the best she could, potatoes naturally.</span> <span id="s554">The main food, potatoes.</span> <span id="s555">Herring, bread--.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">She just worked in the home?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">She was in the home, yeah.</span> <span id="s558">There was no work for a woman.</span> <span id="s559">Took care on us children, sew buttons, see that the shirts are clean to go to school.</span> <span id="s560">Socks should be always--.</span> <span id="s561">It's not like here where you have everyday a pair of socks.</span> <span id="s562">You had a pair of socks, you wear it a week.</span> <span id="s563">Then you make a hole, she sewed them together, stitched them together and she washed them again and we were wearing.</span> <span id="s564">In winter, it was cold, I must admit.</span> <span id="s565">If you didn't have--you were putting on clothes on top of clothes.</span> <span id="s566">Kids, what did we care?</span> <span id="s567">We run down, played with the sled in the snow, came home wet, put on other rags.</span> <span id="s568">You were happy.</span> <span id="s569">Until this vicious storm came in and pulled us all in which we did not expect.</span> <span id="s570">Life was one small _______(283).</span> <span id="s571">Had not the war broken, I think that probably my brother, maybe me, we would--he would emigrate to Palestine that time.</span> <span id="s572">Because it was the dream.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">You were part of the Zionist organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">I am part of the Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s575">It was the dream that for Zionists, not Zionist home, our own home.</span> <span id="s576">At that time we didn't know they were going to get rid of us physically, but they get rid of us tormenting, antisemitism, progroms in other towns and other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Was your father a supporter of Zionism?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Yes, yes, he was a supporter of Zionists, yeah.</span> <span id="s579">He also believe in that the Jews must have their own country.</span> <span id="s580">He was a learned man.</span> <span id="s581">He learned history; he learned the Bible; he was learning the Talmud.</span> <span id="s582">So he knew the history of the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s583">He knew that there is no future for us in Europe, in Poland particularly.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Did he, himself, have the desire to go to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">No, I tell you why he didn't have the desire.</span> <span id="s586">In Poland a 40-year old man was old.</span> <span id="s587">He used to say I'm an old man already.</span> <span id="s588">Now I remind myself when the war broke out, he was 45 years old, forty years was old.</span> <span id="s589">It was a different time.</span> <span id="s590">A mother of 45 years, she looked like a old lady.</span> <span id="s591">It was an exception with my mother, she did not look an old lady but it was already.</span> <span id="s592">Here 50 years, was old man, a long beard, white beard.</span> <span id="s593">So he had no desire.</span> <span id="s594">But he wished for a better life for the children.</span> <span id="s595">Of course, the dream was there.</span> <span id="s596">The Zionist dream was there.</span> <span id="s597">It was promised through the Balfour Declaration to different politicians.</span> <span id="s598">He followed that, we followed that in the Zionist movement and we thought that our life will sometimes he there.</span> <span id="s599">It seems that this was all interrupted and it all took a different turn.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">When the war broke out, were you in Lodz?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">No.</span> <span id="s602">I was already in my hometown.</span> <span id="s603">Because I was in Lodz until July, I was in a camp.</span> <span id="s604">Then we saw--we felt the feeling--you know it was talk about the war.</span> <span id="s605">The feeling was that I left for home.</span> <span id="s606">I left for home; I left for hom.</span> <span id="s607">I didn't want to be in the big city.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Your brother remained?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">My brother remained.</span> <span id="s610">He says to me, you go home.</span> <span id="s611">Mother and father, because I was not done there, the oldest and I had a younger brother from ten.</span> <span id="s612">Now he was, in 1929, he was ten, my younger sister was four years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">What do you remember about that first day the Germans entered your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A very good question.</span> <span id="s615">I remember it a lot.</span> <span id="s616">The night before the Germans entered my town, we were sitting a bunch of boys in the street, on the stoop.</span> <span id="s617">You know, like here you go out, a bunch of boys on the stoop, was very dark.</span> <span id="s618">As I mentioned before, there was no electricity.</span> <span id="s619">We were sitting and talking and fooling around and joking like young boys and girls do.</span> <span id="s620">It was about eleven o'clock--the policeman in town who knew us very well came over to us and he says, go home, go home.</span> <span id="s621">Shut off the lights.</span> <span id="s622">Wherever anybody had a candle or a lamp burning, tell your parents shut off the light.</span> <span id="s623">Must be dark in every window.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">This a Jewish policeman or just a--?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">No, no.</span> <span id="s626">It was a Polish policeman.</span> <span id="s627">Go home.</span> <span id="s628">So we disbursed and went home.</span> <span id="s629">I came home and I said, you know Father.</span> <span id="s630">Policeman, I know his name, R____(357) was his name, told us to go home.</span> <span id="s631">The war is coming.</span> <span id="s632">The war is coming.</span> <span id="s633">My father says, nobody knows.</span> <span id="s634">What does he know?</span> <span id="s635">But he told us, the war is coming, shut off the lights and stay in your house.</span> <span id="s636">Sure enough, we went to sleep.</span> <span id="s637">Four o'clock in the morning, we heard a bang.</span> <span id="s638">There was a little bridge in our town between the border of Germany and Poland which was connecting both countries.</span> <span id="s639">The bridge was what, thirty feet wide.</span> <span id="s640">Yeah, that's all, maybe 30 feet wide.</span> <span id="s641">This bridge was dynamite by the Polish army.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">That was over the Prozna (ph)(371) River?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">That's right.</span> <span id="s644">How do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">I did some research.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">That's right.</span> <span id="s647">Was the Prozna River.</span> <span id="s648">Was a little bridge over the Prozna River and it was dynamited by the Polish army that the Germans should not be able to come in.</span> <span id="s649">In the meantime, when they were dynamiting this little bridge over the Prozna, the Germans were already in town from another side.</span> <span id="s650">This was because there were certain places where the bridge, maybe one kilometer further was as narrow, we used to jump over.</span> <span id="s651">We used to make tricks, we jump to Germany.</span> <span id="s652">So the Polish army came over there with their tanks and with their trucks, was already in town.</span> <span id="s653">Immediately.</span> <span id="s654">So when we looked out, it got light, six o'clock in the morning, Germans are all over.</span> <span id="s655">Bayonets, I remember it today, the bayonets and the tanks and the trucks are coming down to put right away another bridge up.</span> <span id="s656">They were right away looking for Jews to go to work.</span> <span id="s657">So they grabbed, I went down there, a little boy in short pants, never looked Jewish.</span> <span id="s658">Had red hair with a lot of pimple on my face.</span> <span id="s659">I went down and greeted the Germans.</span> <span id="s660">First I went to the bakery before when the Germans were ready to come.</span> <span id="s661">I ran over to the bakery, me and my little brother and the baker ran away from town.</span> <span id="s662">He ran away from town, he was afraid when he heard shooting, he left all the bread on the floor.</span> <span id="s663">So we grabbed as much as I could.</span> <span id="s664">I hand to him and we brought it home.</span> <span id="s665">Fresh bread.</span> <span id="s666">Then other people came and they also had bread.</span> <span id="s667">After this, we already came home, I see already the German marching Jews.</span> <span id="s668">They caught some Jews to work to help them build the bridge.</span> <span id="s669">They marching there and the Jews were right away standing, the first day, the first few hours, up here into the water.</span> <span id="s670">The Prozna wasn't a big water and they were helping to rebuild the bridge what the Polish army exploded.</span> <span id="s671">Naturally, I ran to the house, hid my father.</span> <span id="s672">Took my father and my mother to the basement.</span> <span id="s673">I stood in front of the house.</span> <span id="s674">German soldiers came over with the bayonets like this, says Juda, Juda--.</span> <span id="s675">(397)</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">No, Juda.</span> <span id="s678">No Jew.</span> <span id="s679">Juda here, they want to know where a Jew is living there because in other places they had looked the Polish told them right away where was a Jew.</span> <span id="s680">They didn't know I'm a Jew.</span> <span id="s681">I'm not going to tell on my family.</span> <span id="s682">I say no Juda, no Jew, no Juda and they went further with their bayonets and they made sure that everybody opened the stores.</span> <span id="s683">The stores that everything should be normal.</span> <span id="s684">Most of the people run away from town.</span> <span id="s685">I witnessed the first boots, the German boots.</span> <span id="s686">All of a sudden, the army started marching, the German army.</span> <span id="s687">Army, motorcycles, trucks and tanks.</span> <span id="s688">Motorcycles, trucks and tanks for seven days, night and day, night and day, marching through our town to the city of Lodz.</span> <span id="s689">Seven days later, they were in Lodz and occupied Lodz and everything on the way.</span> <span id="s690">This was Friday.</span> <span id="s691">Sunday, they corralled all the Jews from my town into the synagogue.</span> <span id="s692">I showed you a picture of the synagogue.</span> <span id="s693">Naturally, I didn't let my father go, not my father.</span> <span id="s694">I went with my little brother.</span> <span id="s695">We all looked like little, no Jewish boys.</span> <span id="s696">Here they bringing Jews from all over the town into the synagogue.</span> <span id="s697">We thought--I didn't want to risk my parents.</span> <span id="s698">The idea was, we found out later, that the idea was to explode the synagogue with the people in there.</span> <span id="s699">This was on Sunday, three days later.</span> <span id="s700">Mind your this was before they had an order yet, the Von_____(427) Conference I think, before yet, when they had the plan to exterminate all the Jews.</span> <span id="s701">They were already killing Jews.</span> <span id="s702">This was not SS men, this was the army.</span> <span id="s703">I don't know where they got the orders but it was in their hand.</span> <span id="s704">As we stood there in the synagogue and I listened without a hat, I went in without a hat, I didn't put any.</span> <span id="s705">He was hollering--the general goes up on the bima, on the stage and he said, you should know, the German, you have killed many Germans in this town.</span> <span id="s706">Three German soldiers were killed yesterday by Jews.</span> <span id="s707">You entitled to die, all of you.</span> <span id="s708">But we giving you the last warning.</span> <span id="s709">If ever any German soldier will be killed in this town again, you all will be killed and he disbursed the people.</span> <span id="s710">He did not--we found out later from the Germans sources that they couldn't do it in our town, it was too close to Germany.</span> <span id="s711">It was too close, the army was marching by, you understand.</span> <span id="s712">Matter of fact the synagogue remained, it's still there.</span> <span id="s713">.</span> <span id="s714">This was on Sunday.</span> <span id="s715">Then they start marching and leaving us fairly alone, on our own till they established a headquarters and a Gestapo, They caught to work.</span> <span id="s716">We had to make the roads wider for the German tanks to pass.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">You worked on the roads?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Yeah, we worked on the roads.</span> <span id="s719">Then we eliminated even some houses.</span> <span id="s720">There were some houses standing in the corner, little houses of wood and the German tank would pass say take it down.</span> <span id="s721">We had to clear it up, they should be able to cross.</span> <span id="s722">They took us right to work but we came home in the evening.</span> <span id="s723">They grabbed young people.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Your father--?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">No, no.</span> <span id="s726">Never, we never let them.</span> <span id="s727">I always protected my father.</span> <span id="s728">I never let him go to work.</span> <span id="s729">He was hidden.</span> <span id="s730">I always went because every family had to supply people so I went, my mother went sometimes to sweep the streets.</span> <span id="s731">My father, no.</span> <span id="s732">He had very bad legs, he had broken legs before the war and he couldn't do.</span> <span id="s733">I protected my father.</span> <span id="s734">What else can I remember?</span> <span id="s735">Then, lasted until 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Did they require armbands of you at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Yeah, that's right.</span> <span id="s738">Two months later, a few weeks had been very quiet, we should wear all armbands and the Star of David.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Did you wear a patch or--?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Wear a patch, Star of David and a yellow armband.</span> <span id="s741">This way, they left us still in our homes.</span> <span id="s742">But we were not allowed after five o;'clock out.</span> <span id="s743">In the morning, they let us out.</span> <span id="s744">But in order for us to sustain ourselves, especially my mother was the one who was the supplier of food.</span> <span id="s745">She ran into the village and bought some food from the peasants and brought it home dressed as a Polish woman.</span> <span id="s746">And I took off my band whenever--and I didn't walk in the sidewalk, I walked straight on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s747">Because if I walk in the sidewalk, they knew already I am a Jew.</span> <span id="s748">The only thing I have to watch out for is that a Polak should not see me, he would tell him this is a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">You would walk in the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">In the street, right.</span> <span id="s751">You see what I mean?</span> <span id="s752">I walked--not in the street, I walked on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s753">Took off my band, went over, brought something for somebody else, the other guy had sugar, this one had bread.</span> <span id="s754">You know, we did some exchanging in order to survive.</span> <span id="s755">This was about till 1940, till they made a ghetto.</span> <span id="s756">They took part of the city and they separated.</span> <span id="s757">We all had to leave within two hours our homes that we were living for many years and go into this ghetto.</span> <span id="s758">Two, three families in one room.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">So your apartment wasn't within the established boundaries?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">No, my apartment was not.</span> <span id="s761">We had to leave, we had to leave.</span> <span id="s762">We left and the other boundary was closer to the Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s763">Whatever we took along, we took along.</span> <span id="s764">Everything left.</span> <span id="s765">Furniture, who cares about furniture that time?</span> <span id="s766">We took along some schmattas, (51), to dress, that's all, to sustain yourself.</span> <span id="s767">There in the ghetto, we lived together.</span> <span id="s768">Three families into a room.</span> <span id="s769">Again they took us, the young people had to go to work to build the roads, to clean the snow.</span> <span id="s770">Winter came in and the Germans--you know they're very harsh winters.</span> <span id="s771">.</span> <span id="s772">Snow and the Germans had to travel with their trucks.</span> <span id="s773">We had to make the roads, we had to work for them.</span> <span id="s774">Till little by little, they liquidated the ghetto.</span> <span id="s775">They liquidated us young people, I told you, they took us to camp.</span> <span id="s776">Shipped off to camp, slave-labor camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">So you were the first to go in your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">With the first eighty boys.</span> <span id="s779">Looking back, retrospect, we were 80 boys with four Germans taking us on the transport.</span> <span id="s780">Can you imagine?</span> <span id="s781">No one had to--the strength or the wisdom to attack the four Germans.</span> <span id="s782">Eighty!</span> <span id="s783">Take away their ammunition and run to the forests.</span> <span id="s784">But nobody knew it.</span> <span id="s785">When I went away, I said to my father, I'm going to tell you the story.</span> <span id="s786">I'm going to tell you when I come back.</span> <span id="s787">We all thought that we going to work for three months in labor camp and we'll going to come back.</span> <span id="s788">.</span> <span id="s789">But the whole thing was to trick us in, to trick us in.</span> <span id="s790">So when the young people were already tricked in, there couldn't be no more resistance , right; go in the camp.</span> <span id="s791">The older people with the younger people, my father with my younger two brothers, they went.</span> <span id="s792">The very old people, like the buby, the grandmother and-- grandfather was not alive but I had a grandmother and other people, they took them in the cemetery and shot them.</span> <span id="s793">They all buried in a mass grave there in Praszka.</span> <span id="s794">So that was the lot of my town.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">What happened to your oldest brother?</span> <span id="s796">Did he remain in Lodz?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">No, my oldest brother, I must say he died a hero,.</span> <span id="s798">Why did he die a hero?</span> <span id="s799">Because he had a good trade, he was an electrician.</span> <span id="s800">He came home from Lodz during the war.</span> <span id="s801">He run to Warsaw during the war but he came home from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s802">He came home from Warsaw to his parents.</span> <span id="s803">When I was taken out to camp, he remained home with my parents.</span> <span id="s804">When they had the ghetto, they clean up the ghetto, they ask all the people who had a trade, go to the right, and all the other people, my father and mother with the other children to the left.</span> <span id="s805">I was told, I met a boy who was in the same line, my landsman.</span> <span id="s806">I met him in 1944.</span> <span id="s807">He said your brother Moishe did not want to leave the parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">So he went in their line?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">That's right.</span> <span id="s810">He did not want to leave the parents.</span> <span id="s811">He don't know what they're going to do without him.</span> <span id="s812">That's why I said, he died a hero.</span> <span id="s813">He thought, he didn't know.</span> <span id="s814">He thought they're going to take him with the parents and two little children.</span> <span id="s815">Two younger brothers with a sister, they are going to take them.</span> <span id="s816">Maybe they're going to put them in the Lodz ghetto, he will work a electrician, he will have a trade.</span> <span id="s817">No, but it was the opposite.</span> <span id="s818">They took the other ones to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s819">If he would have gone out from the line and said I am an electrician, they would have grabbed him.</span> <span id="s820">He would have been.</span> <span id="s821">--.</span> <span id="s822">(End of Tape 1) I had to report to the SS man who was watching me.</span> <span id="s823">He say, Hefling (1), I'm under forty, _______________(1).</span> <span id="s824">What do you want, you dog?</span> <span id="s825">Bitte ___(2) ____ means I want to go away, leave him, five minute, two minute.</span> <span id="s826">It was a better one he give you two minutes, it was a bastard, he said one minute back.</span> <span id="s827">I run to the toilet, do what you have to do, come back in a minute, if you manage.</span> <span id="s828">That's what they say.</span> <span id="s829">I always wondered, what will happen if they should give ____(c.7).</span> <span id="s830">They wouldn't have to have the problems.</span> <span id="s831">They always could see this one, this one.</span> <span id="s832">So in everything in life, I think, there is some intervention.</span> <span id="s833">I am, most important thing of it, I remained a believer after the war, I still remained.</span> <span id="s834">I am a believer.</span> <span id="s835">I believe in divine destiny.</span> <span id="s836">Why me, not others?</span> <span id="s837">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">What about luck?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">I believe.</span> <span id="s840">I believe that it was destiny, divine destiny that certain people should remain alive, continue their life, contribute to the society, contribute to the Jewish people and transmit the story.</span> <span id="s841">So today, I belong to the synagogue, I am observant and I am very dedicated, very much dedicated to the survival of the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s842">Not only with words, but with deeds too.</span> <span id="s843">I guess, it is the story of my life.</span> <span id="s844">There are different episodes in the middle which we could sit here for five, six hours more and I could tell you.</span> <span id="s845">I could tell you a story where the SS in Praszka.</span> <span id="s846">I was once in--thought my survival would be easier if I joined the Hitlerjugend, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">This when someone believed that you were not a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">That's right.</span> <span id="s849">I was joining them for three days I belonged to the Hitlerjugend.</span> <span id="s850">I thought that this would be the way.</span> <span id="s851">I went there and they took me in, the German youngsters, they didn't recognize me.</span> <span id="s852">I was in the kitchen in the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">This was in your town, they had a Hitlerjugend?</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s855">I worked there for three days till I was again given up by a Polish.</span> <span id="s856">The first Polish came in and he tell this is Juda.</span> <span id="s857">I took off my jacket and run.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Had they given you a uniform to wear?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">If I would be there a few months, I would have gotten a uniform.</span> <span id="s860">Therefore, people saw the movie now, Europa, Europa, they say, I said, don't take it so easy.</span> <span id="s861">They said it couldn't happen.</span> <span id="s862">It could happen because I --and they stand up there, they don't believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Somebody, one of the German soldiers or an SS man noticed you or--?</span></p> <p><span id="s864">No, no.</span> <span id="s865">It was not a German soldier.</span> <span id="s866">I was again given up by a Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">I mean in terms of recruiting you to the--?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Recruiting you, no.</span> <span id="s869">I went in myself, I went in myself.</span> <span id="s870">I knew that--no, it was not like that.</span> <span id="s871">I was sent to work there.</span> <span id="s872">I was sent there to work.</span> <span id="s873">When I came in, they ask me what are you doing here?</span> <span id="s874">I didn't tell them I was sent by the Jewish community to work but I said I came in to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">So the Judenrat had given out some assignments?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Yeah, Judenrat gave us some assignments.</span> <span id="s877">So I said I came to work in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s878">They young boys, 18 years old.</span> <span id="s879">Arbeit (49), --- here in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s880">Gave me an apron.</span> <span id="s881">Then I start to think, if I can continue staying here, I have a future.</span> <span id="s882">But was not easy.</span> <span id="s883">Was not easy because in my face you couldn't recognize me as Jewish.</span> <span id="s884">When people tell me the story about Europa, Europa when the Jewish boy was Hitlerjugend, and he did survive and certain things, I said everything is possible.</span> <span id="s885">It almost happened to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">So you stayed there three days working?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Three days, I came every morning with my hand like this, Heil Hitler, you know.</span> <span id="s888">They believe me.</span> <span id="s889">The Germans was easy to get away than the Polaks.</span> <span id="s890">They smell you, that you're Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">They could hear your accent?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Accent, accent.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Right.</span> <span id="s894">How long did you work in that forest?</span> <span id="s895">In that first labor camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">In the forest?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">I don't know.</span> <span id="s899">1941--.</span> <span id="s900">It must have been--.</span> <span id="s901">When I came to camp, I came in short pants so it must have been summer.</span> <span id="s902">I came in short camps and a little jacket.</span> <span id="s903">I show it to you.</span> <span id="s904">My father and mother gave me something there in a little package.</span> <span id="s905">So I must have been there in summer, autumn, winter.</span> <span id="s906">Then I was sent to this German camp.</span> <span id="s907">There it was called Kustrin.</span> <span id="s908">A factory where they produced a powder for bullets.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">That was before Auschwitz then too?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Yeah, this before Auschwitz, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Do you know how to spell the name of that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Yeah, Kustrin.</span> <span id="s913">K-u-s-t-r-i-n.</span> <span id="s914">But on the u is two dots on top, Kustrin.</span> <span id="s915">Kustrin, they used to call it, Kustrin __________(75) So after you left your town, you never went back?</span></p> <p><span id="s916">No, in 1979, I was ridden down to visit my own grave.</span> <span id="s917">I call it to visit my own grave.</span> <span id="s918">To find my friend Henry Margolis.</span> <span id="s919">When I went to Germany, the story like this.</span> <span id="s920">I went to Germany to testify against two Nazis from my camp near Roznow______(80).</span> <span id="s921">I went to a _____ in Germany.</span> <span id="s922">When I was there already, I prepared myself here home here, I got a visa for Poland.</span> <span id="s923">I said when I am already in Germany and I go through the agonizing, grueling of witnessing, I probably will--let's go to Poland, I said to her, my wife.</span> <span id="s924">She agreed with me.</span> <span id="s925">We never went home back.</span> <span id="s926">Let's go to Poland and see how it is.</span> <span id="s927">So this is the first time I went.</span> <span id="s928">After Germany, I went for five, six days to Poland in 1979.</span> <span id="s929">Went to visit my hometown, went to visit the cemetery.</span> <span id="s930">It was an agonizing experience.</span> <span id="s931">I lost 15 pounds at that time.</span> <span id="s932">Being before in Germany, take care of us two weeks.</span> <span id="s933">It was very tragic.</span> <span id="s934">I came in to my town, I was looking for the boy, I was looking for the boy who was 15.</span> <span id="s935">You know what I mean.</span> <span id="s936">I was going in the streets and my feet were sinking in like--they were so rubbery--I didn't know why your feet got so rubbery.</span> <span id="s937">I was looking for a young boy.</span> <span id="s938">I came into the home where I left.</span> <span id="s939">I thought I find some pictures, photographs.</span> <span id="s940">I was lucky, the home was there.</span> <span id="s941">Was occupied by a Polish drunk.</span> <span id="s942">He had a padlock on the door.</span> <span id="s943">Lucky and I didn't go in.</span> <span id="s944">Then I said to Helen and to the Polish guide who led me there, that I think that it was luck or Providence that the door wasn't open because I might have fainted or got a heart attack coming in the house I was glad it was closed.</span> <span id="s945">I went up the stair and they told me there's a Polish drunk living there.</span> <span id="s946">Closed and I didn't bother to go the next day.</span> <span id="s947">Because I came back the next day again.</span> <span id="s948">I didn't bother no more.</span> <span id="s949">I went to the cemetery, did my--did the prayers.</span> <span id="s950">_____(107), a Jew come to my town, nobody.</span> <span id="s951">I did my prayers in the cemetery.</span> <span id="s952">I went to the synagogue, looked just in through the window.</span> <span id="s953">It was also closed.</span> <span id="s954">They told me if you want to wait till five o'clock, we open for you.</span> <span id="s955">I said no, no.</span> <span id="s956">____(110) I figured enough as a boy what I remember.</span> <span id="s957">I went on the steps from my Cheder.</span> <span id="s958">I said please ________.</span> <span id="s959">Looked around town.</span> <span id="s960">I saw who is living in Jewish homes, in Jewish houses and what's happening.</span> <span id="s961">I left, very agonizing experience.</span> <span id="s962">Then I went with my wife to her town.</span> <span id="s963">The same thing.</span> <span id="s964">She couldn't walk into the school, she was ____(118).</span> <span id="s965">She went only to the house, she will tell you where she was living.</span> <span id="s966">She couldn't do any more.</span> <span id="s967">This is the time I went over to the cemetery because was under Poland.</span> <span id="s968">Y____(120) is under Poland now.</span> <span id="s969">So I had to go into Poland.</span> <span id="s970">It took me nine hours to find the cemetery.</span> <span id="s971">Because I asked people where is the Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s972">Nobody knew.</span> <span id="s973">They all were newcomers because the original populations was no more there.</span> <span id="s974">Until I finally got a hold of an old German woman.</span> <span id="s975">I gave her two dollars and she led me to the cemetery.</span> <span id="s976">I found the graves, I found it.</span> <span id="s977">Therefore when I came back, I wrote the story in the Jewish paper here.</span> <span id="s978">It was translated to English but this is only part of it.</span> <span id="s979">I came back from my own grave.</span> <span id="s980">Germany--I testified for three days.</span> <span id="s981">Was very lonely, it was not right.</span> <span id="s982">It's not right they sending a survivor.</span> <span id="s983">They are sending a survivor to testify by himself without any lawyers, without any support group without anything.</span> <span id="s984">Because I came in through the courtroom.</span> <span id="s985">They were sitting 50 people.</span> <span id="s986">They brought down all the secretaries and all the words in the courtroom.</span> <span id="s987">In the front was sitting seven judges.</span> <span id="s988">They told me to recognize two murderers.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">This was from that sub-camp of Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s990">No, from Y____(c.141).</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Oh, from Y ______.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">From Y_________.</span> <span id="s993">How can you recognize after 40 years?</span> <span id="s994">They old, they changed, they've no hair.</span> <span id="s995">You see what I mean?</span> <span id="s996">Instead of saying they taking four people, do you recognize two?</span> <span id="s997">No, they took 50 people to look at.</span> <span id="s998">What a _____(144).</span> <span id="s999">I recognized one on the picture.</span> <span id="s1000">They show me then a picture in his uniform, then I recognize him so I said this is him.</span> <span id="s1001">In the uniform, otherwise, I couldn't recognize him.</span> <span id="s1002">I testified for two days, all by myself.</span> <span id="s1003">I felt that I'm the accused.</span> <span id="s1004">Can you imagine, seven judges!</span> <span id="s1005">Here I have no attorney, have no defense, nobody on my side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">So they were busy asking you questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Yeah, they was asking me questions.</span> <span id="s1008">You have to tell the story.</span> <span id="s1009">How did you see?</span> <span id="s1010">How do you know it's him?</span> <span id="s1011">How do you it's him and how come you're--?</span> <span id="s1012">How close were you from him?</span> <span id="s1013">Were you two feet, three feet?</span> <span id="s1014">I said ten feet away.</span> <span id="s1015">They said how can you recognize it's him.</span> <span id="s1016">I said because I saw him everyday in camp.</span> <span id="s1017">I know it was him.</span> <span id="s1018">If I would be closer, I wouldn't be here to testify, he would shoot me.</span> <span id="s1019">He would kill me.</span> <span id="s1020">The last day, I had an argument with them, not an argument, I had a statement.</span> <span id="s1021">A very positive statement.</span> <span id="s1022">I just spoke to their conscience.</span> <span id="s1023">To the German judges and to them.</span> <span id="s1024">I said one word.</span> <span id="s1025">Through my testimony, I implicated another two SS men which were later tried.</span> <span id="s1026">One got prison sentence.</span> <span id="s1027">They want me to come for the other trial but I didn't want to come no more.</span> <span id="s1028">They want me to come for the trial for the SS men from Lagisza where I was, near Benjum (162) where I told you.</span> <span id="s1029">I didn't want to go no more.</span> <span id="s1030">They came here.</span> <span id="s1031">I testified in the German consulate.</span> <span id="s1032">I didn't want to go no more.</span> <span id="s1033">But he got, he got through my testimony, this one guy--.</span> <span id="s1034">As a matter of fact, i have here a paper, I had it the other day.</span> <span id="s1035">He got sentenced one Smith.</span> <span id="s1036">He was in the camp Lagisza--I know I just saw it.</span> <span id="s1037">Now when I'm looking, I want to show you this piece of paper.</span> <span id="s1038">Where do I have it?</span> <span id="s1039">I cut it out from paper.</span> <span id="s1040">This Smith was sentenced so many years because of--the camp from Lagisza-- because I implicated him.</span> <span id="s1041">I wouldn't find it because I didn't prepare it.</span> <span id="s1042">I don't know where it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Let me ask you one other question about when you went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1044">You were transported by train, by cattle car?</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">When I went to Auschwitz from K_____(179)--.</span> <span id="s1046">You know I don't remember, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1047">I'm sure it wasn't a sitting train.</span> <span id="s1048">There was no sitting train but I actually don't remember.</span> <span id="s1049">I remember getting off in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1050">You know where Mengele was there and everybody else.</span> <span id="s1051">They took people to the right and to the left.</span> <span id="s1052">I remember that.</span> <span id="s1053">It was cattle cars, yes, but we were not packed like cattles from that because the Germans who put us there were a little different.</span> <span id="s1054">I mean from this camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">You put through the quarantine at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">I was put--yeah.</span> <span id="s1057">Taken away my clothes.</span> <span id="s1058">Taken away the clothing, taken away I had pictures from home, everything gave away.</span> <span id="s1059">Went into shower one side, came out other side naked, give me other clothes and a different man, a different person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Did they give you a striped uniform too or just ___?</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s1062">Striped uniform, striped shirts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Up to then you'd been in civilian clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Up to then, I was in civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s1065">My own clothes from home.</span> <span id="s1066">We exchanged, you know, from home, this and that, civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s1067">Then I got the striped uniform with the striped hat, with the shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Wooden shoes or--?</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">No, I happened to grab a pair of other shoes but they were too tight.</span> <span id="s1070">But after wearing them a few days, you don't feel no more, the tightness.</span> <span id="s1071">No, wooden shoes, I didn't get.</span> <span id="s1072">Some of them got wooden shoes.</span> <span id="s1073">I happened to be lucky and got other shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Did you work within Auschwitz-Birkenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">How long were you there before being--?</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">I volunteered on a commandant, on outside work.</span> <span id="s1078">They came into the camp and they said we need 50 people today, 50 ____________(204).</span> <span id="s1079">Who wants to go?</span> <span id="s1080">One day I wanted to go, there was a camp Y_______205).</span> <span id="s1081">but they--.</span> <span id="s1082">I heard it's coal____, it's for _____ movement, coal mines.</span> <span id="s1083">I stepped back from the line.</span> <span id="s1084">The next one I have we go to another camp, Lagisza-Ar____(207), they need ______ and I give myself another time, locksmith.</span> <span id="s1085">I figure I'm not going _______(209) I wanted to get away from Auschwitz as fast as possible on account of the selection.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">That was Lagisza?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">They were sent to Lagisza, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Okay.</span> <span id="s1089">Let's see.</span> <span id="s1090">Y____(215) was when?</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">1944.</span> <span id="s1092">1944 in the middle, there was no________ camp at Lagisza.</span> <span id="s1093">August.</span> <span id="s1094">I came to Auschwitz in August, 1943.</span> <span id="s1095">I came to Lagisza, must be in September.</span> <span id="s1096">I was there September, October, November, December.</span> <span id="s1097">I was there the winter.</span> <span id="s1098">Then I went to _______(222).</span> <span id="s1099">When it was already, wasn't cold already.</span> <span id="s1100">Maybe I was a year in Lagisza.</span> <span id="s1101">I don't remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">So luckily your time at Auschwitz-Birkenau was relatively short?</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Yeah, very short.</span> <span id="s1104">I was just waiting there.</span> <span id="s1105">I didn't work there, didn't go to work.</span> <span id="s1106">Auschwitz, maybe, I don't know, a week, yeah.</span> <span id="s1107">By the time they ___us back and forth every day.</span> <span id="s1108">Maybe even less than a week.</span> <span id="s1109">They took us right out to the A__________.</span> <span id="s1110">(232).</span> <span id="s1111">That's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">That's a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">It's enough for a book.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">MENDEL ROZENBLIT</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">AUGUST 6, 1992</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">SILVER SPRING,MD The date is August 6, 1992 and we're speaking with Dr. Marsha Rozenblit in Silver Spring, Maryland.</span> <span id="s1118">Dr. Rosenblit is going to tell us about her father and his family, and any family members that she can recall.</span> <span id="s1119">So please, could you tell me your father's name, his date of birth, his place of birth and then anything you can about his childhood and his family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Okay, my father whose name was Mendel Rozenblit was born on November 13, 1907 in a town called Lukow in Poland.</span> <span id="s1121">Anyway this town was in the area of Lublin, I don't know exactly in which direction or.....Okay, so my father was born in Lukow which was near Lublin in 1907.</span> <span id="s1122">He was born into a pretty religious family.</span> <span id="s1123">I think that parts of the family were associated with the Hasidim.</span> <span id="s1124">But he did not grow up technically as a Hasidic child.</span> <span id="s1125">He was just an ordinary traditionally religious Polish Jewish boy.</span> <span id="s1126">His father died when he was very young, well not very young I guess.</span> <span id="s1127">Well, let me go backwards a little bit.</span> <span id="s1128">My father was one of about six or seven children and he was in the middle.</span> <span id="s1129">He was not the oldest or the youngest; he was one of the middle children.</span> <span id="s1130">His father died when he was a young boy.</span> <span id="s1131">I think, if my memory serves me correctly, he was about twelve when his father died, which means his father died just after World War I of asthma.</span> <span id="s1132">But I think he was sickly for most of his life.</span> <span id="s1133">But my grandmother, that is my father's mother whose name was - well I should say that my father's father's name was Avraham Rozenblit - and his mother Masha Markusfeld Rozenblit, after whom I'm named, Marsha - Masha, his mother managed quite well to have six children and run the family.</span> <span id="s1134">She owned a, well my mother used to say she owned a general store, but my cousin in Israel who was seventeen when he left Poland and really knew her, said that she basically owned a shoe store.</span> <span id="s1135">That is, she sold other things too, but it was mostly shoes and what she would do is, she would take trips to Warsaw or Lublin and see what was in the fancy shoe stores there and then copy them and arranged to have the shoes made.</span> <span id="s1136">She didn't make them herself.</span> <span id="s1137">She wasn't a shoemaker but she would get them made and then sell them, both in the store and also in a kind of...She would send her children out to sell them also, when they were grown, to sell them to the peasants in the villages.</span> <span id="s1138">That I learned from my cousin in Israel.</span> <span id="s1139">But let me just try to say something about my father's family background in general before I talk more specifically.</span> <span id="s1140">They were a very religious family and pictures of my father show him wearing the sort of traditional cap of the Polish Jews, you know that sort of squarish cap.</span> <span id="s1141">I can't tell from the pictures whether he has pais or not, it's hard to tell, but maybe he did.</span> <span id="s1142">I should say before I go on that my father died, Mendel Rozenblit, the survivor that we're talking about, died in 1961 when I was ten years old so that most of my recollections come from either things I actually remember him saying, or things that my mother told me that he had said, or things that my cousin in Israel, that is his nephew, Mordecai Rozenblit, who came to Palestine in 1938 has told me.</span> <span id="s1143">So it's a sort of conglomerate of those things.</span> <span id="s1144">So, in any case it was a traditional religious family in the Lublin area.</span> <span id="s1145">His mother owned this shoe store.</span> <span id="s1146">I don't think she was rich but she was reasonably prosperous and my father had all of these brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s1147">His oldest, I don't even know the age order, I think Nehama the sister, he had one sister and five brothers I believe, and the sister, Nehama, was I think the oldest and then there were other brothers.</span> <span id="s1148">There was Simcha, there was Haim Yakov, there was Meir who was the baby, there was Yehoshua and I know how most of them died actually and I'll get back to that later when we talk about it.</span> <span id="s1149">But Haim Yakov was a very ardent Zionist and he left Poland before the war.</span> <span id="s1150">He went to Palestine in 1937 and then his son Mordecai joined him in 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Were the rest of the family involved in Zionism, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">You know, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1153">My cousin, Mutti, Mordecai, in Israel has many times told me that you know, he had said to me, [Marsha, at yahdat ha abba shelach lo haya Zioni] which means Marsha, your father wasn't a Zionist.</span> <span id="s1154">But I think that's not true.</span> <span id="s1155">I think that Mutti means by that, that my father didn't move to Palestine after the war.</span> <span id="s1156">And Mutti is still mad at him forty years later for not having done that.</span> <span id="s1157">I do have his Zionist membership card from after the war.</span> <span id="s1158">But, of course, everybody was a zionist after the war.</span> <span id="s1159">So the question is was he an active Zionist before the war.</span> <span id="s1160">Judging from the schools he sent his children to I don't think so.</span> <span id="s1161">That is an active Zionist.</span> <span id="s1162">I don't think he was active in the Zionist movement, no.</span> <span id="s1163">But he was probably sympathetic to Zionism.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">I was going to ask you about the town.</span> <span id="s1165">Have you researched or found out anything about that town, was it a shtetl or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Well all towns are shtetls, shtetl just means little town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">What was the nature of this town?</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">It was a small town.</span> <span id="s1169">I don't know how big it was.</span> <span id="s1170">It certainly wasn't a large place.</span> <span id="s1171">Lublin was in central Poland so it was central Poland.</span> <span id="s1172">I think my image of it as a child was that it was like any small American town with white picket fences and neat little houses on neat little streets.</span> <span id="s1173">And I was shocked in 1972 or '03, I was talking to Lucin Dovarshitsky[ph67] who teaches Polish-Jewish history at YIBO and who is a member of whatever the staff at the YIBO Institute and Lucin Dovarshitsky[ph69] at the time was busy collecting lots and lots and lots of pictures for the Image Before My Eyes volume and I said my father was from Lukow and he said, well I've got a picture of Lukow, come and see it.</span> <span id="s1174">So I went upstairs to his office and I looked at this picture of Lukow and it was not my image.</span> <span id="s1175">I mean it was a muddy little street.</span> <span id="s1176">This was a picture taken in 1926 and it was this dreary little muddy town.</span> <span id="s1177">So it was a tiny little nothing of a town, I think.</span> <span id="s1178">Although my cousin Mutti in Israel who was seventeen when he left Lukow has nice memories of it so it couldn't have been that horrendous.</span> <span id="s1179">I mean maybe this picture doesn't do it justice.</span> <span id="s1180">He has nice memories.</span> <span id="s1181">My father left Lukow when he married and lived near Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1182">I'll get to that in a minute.</span> <span id="s1183">So his adult life was not in Lukow, it was in a Warsaw suburb.</span> <span id="s1184">The stories of his childhood that he told me when I was little were certainly not negative.</span> <span id="s1185">If his family was prosperous, even if they weren't rich they wouldn't have suffered much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Do you know about his education, where he went to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">He went to Chaida.</span> <span id="s1188">He was born in 1907.</span> <span id="s1189">He was born when that part of Poland was part of the Russian Empire.</span> <span id="s1190">I know he just went to traditional Chaida.</span> <span id="s1191">He did not have a formal secular education as far as I know.</span> <span id="s1192">I do know that he could read Polish easily and that means that he must have had some secular education.</span> <span id="s1193">All the schooling he ever spoke of was Chaida.</span> <span id="s1194">On the other hand since he could read Polish novels he must have also gone to something else.</span> <span id="s1195">He didn't have a gymnasium education, that I know.</span> <span id="s1196">He didn't go to University.</span> <span id="s1197">But he must have gone to some Polish school as well as Chaida because you can't read Polish easily if you hadn't.</span> <span id="s1198">Speaking it is one thing but knowing it is another.</span> <span id="s1199">So I think that he and virtually all his siblings just went to Chaida and maybe also some kind of Polish elementary school.</span> <span id="s1200">There is one thing that is important and that is his younger brother, Meir, wanted very much to have a real secular education and he did go to Polish school and gymnasium in their town, or maybe not in their town, it's hard to say since I was only ten when my father died, he may have just said gymnasium and maybe Meir went off to Lublin to go to gymnasium, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1201">In any case my grandmother who was a religious woman, who wore a sheitel and so forth, nevertheless was willing to let her youngest son go to gymnasium.</span> <span id="s1202">This must have been already, since Meir is younger than my father, this must have been after World War I.</span> <span id="s1203">It must have been in the twenties.</span> <span id="s1204">And the town was very mad at her for doing this.</span> <span id="s1205">So she was something of a progressive because she was, although very religious, was willing to let her son go to gymnasium, and of course going to gymnasium meant going to school on Saturday.</span> <span id="s1206">And theoretically Jews were exempt from writing.</span> <span id="s1207">And in fact they were.</span> <span id="s1208">But obviously it spoke of abandoning traditional Jewish life and entering the larger world.</span> <span id="s1209">She was certainly willing to do this and was willing to defy the town to let this happen.</span> <span id="s1210">I remember my father telling a story about how there was a library in town, like a secular library.</span> <span id="s1211">Now maybe it was a Zionist library, may it was Pol...I don't know what and a lot of the "frumies"[ph104], a lot of the very religious people in town marched against it and they tried to burn it down.</span> <span id="s1212">And my grandmother, who was herself religious and not secular, nevertheless sort of defied them and insisted that her son Meir go to gymnasium.</span> <span id="s1213">Actually Meir had a very different experience from all the rest of them.</span> <span id="s1214">Meir not only went to Polish gymnasium but after he graduated from gymnasium, and this must have been into the '30s at some point, he went to University to study to be a doctor.</span> <span id="s1215">He didn't go in Poland because it was very difficult for Jews to do that in Poland.</span> <span id="s1216">He went first in Italy and then in Paris.</span> <span id="s1217">He was presumably deported from Paris to Auschwitz because he was dead too.</span> <span id="s1218">So his experience was different from everybody else's.</span> <span id="s1219">One brother went to Palestine where he died a natural death in 1943 of a heart attack.</span> <span id="s1220">Haim Yakov is the one who went to Palestine and Meir was in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Do you have pictures of either of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">I have pictures of Meir as a baby.</span> <span id="s1223">No, actually as an adult, too.</span> <span id="s1224">Come to think of it, yes, there is a picture of Meir as an adult, two pictures of Meir as adults.</span> <span id="s1225">One from Italy and one I'm not sure where from.</span> <span id="s1226">He went to Pisa and studied medicine and then he was in Paris.</span> <span id="s1227">I think he married in Paris but I don't think he had children.</span> <span id="s1228">And I don't know what happened to his wife.</span> <span id="s1229">I don't know if she was deported or not deported.</span> <span id="s1230">My father never tried to look her up after the war.</span> <span id="s1231">And my mother, after my father's death, was suspicious that perhaps Meir's wife wasn't Jewish and that's why my father hadn't bothered to look her up after the war because he was in Munich for two and a half years after the war, he could have.</span> <span id="s1232">And he knew his brother was in Paris.</span> <span id="s1233">And he found out that his brother had been deported so he could have presumably investigated his brother's wife but he didn't.</span> <span id="s1234">That may mean that the family was angry that he had married a non-Jewish woman or something like that.</span> <span id="s1235">Anyway Meir's experience as an educated Jew, as an educated person and the fact that Haim Yakov was a devout Zionist, I think indicates that this family, while very religious, clearly had its arms out to the modern world, either through Jewish nationalism or through secular education.</span> <span id="s1236">And it's also true that my father, although raised as a very religious little boy, as an adult was not religious.</span> <span id="s1237">As an adult in Poland, I don't mean in America after the war, that's something else.</span> <span id="s1238">But as an adult in Poland was not as religious as he had been growing up.</span> <span id="s1239">He had a kosher home, he sent his kids to Jewish schools, he was very Jewish, but that was normal in Poland.</span> <span id="s1240">People did that.</span> <span id="s1241">But he was not that observant a Jew as an adult in the thirties as he had been growing up although his mother remained religious.</span> <span id="s1242">And I assume some of his siblings were and some weren't.</span> <span id="s1243">I really don't know.</span> <span id="s1244">That would be a nice question to ask.</span> <span id="s1245">My cousin in Israel would know all these answers because he was seventeen when he left and he would have a better sense of who was religious and who was not.</span> <span id="s1246">Anyway what else can I say about just his family background.</span> <span id="s1247">His mother had this store.</span> <span id="s1248">I think several of his brothers were involved in running the store or in, as I said, selling to the peasants.</span> <span id="s1249">But some of the brothers moved.</span> <span id="s1250">He himself moved to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1251">I think another brother, Simcha moved to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1252">I'm not sure where his sister Nehama lived when she grew up.</span> <span id="s1253">I mean they were all adults by the '30s and they were all married and had children and so forth.</span> <span id="s1254">The only thing I could say I suppose - my grandmother, Masha Markusfeld Rozenblit, I mean "Markusfeld" is very important.</span> <span id="s1255">She was a Markusfeld.</span> <span id="s1256">Rozenblit was something that accrued to her but she was a Markusfeld.</span> <span id="s1257">She must have been a very feisty lady, she sounds like it.</span> <span id="s1258">She ran this store, she had her six kids which she raised by herself, or at least partly.</span> <span id="s1259">We have a picture of her.</span> <span id="s1260">She looks like a Jewish woman from Poland but she was kind of a neat lady, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Do you know when she was born?</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">No, but she was in her sixties when she was killed.</span> <span id="s1263">So that would make her born in the 1880's.</span> <span id="s1264">Right and if my father was born in 1907 that's about right.</span> <span id="s1265">So she would have been born in the 1880's or 1870's, probably in the 1870's if he was born in 1907 and he was not her first child, he was her third or fourth child.</span> <span id="s1266">And I think my father's father, Avraham Rozenblit, he was probably in his forties when he died, in around 1919 say, so that means he was born also in the 1870's.</span> <span id="s1267">My father, by the way, even though he did not have formal higher education or even secondary education, knew a lot of languages like many Jews of that part of the world.</span> <span id="s1268">Yiddish was of course his native language like it was for virtually all the Jews of Poland except a small group of hyper-assimilated Jews.</span> <span id="s1269">But he was fluent in Polish and that was common for his generation, that is people who came of age in the twenties and thirties knew increasingly also, unless they were just Hasidim, increasingly really knew Polish.</span> <span id="s1270">And certainly my cousin, Mutti, the one who moved to Palestine in 1937, '38, Mutti went to Polish public school in the thirties and has very fond memories of his teachers in the Polish elementary school in Lukow, that they were not anti-semitic.</span> <span id="s1271">I don't know if he's telling the whole truth when he says that, it may be nostalgia.</span> <span id="s1272">I mean he has unkind words about Poles in general but his teachers were very loving and very nice and he has very fond memories of going to elementary school in Polish although how deep his Polish language knowledge is, is hard to say, because at this point in the 1990's after living in Israel for fifty odd years he really can speak only Hebrew and Yiddish and English which he learned in the British army during World War II but his Polish, I think, is so rusty that he didn't use it.</span> <span id="s1273">But anyway my father knew Yiddish of course which was his mother tongue, Polish which he spoke totally fluently.</span> <span id="s1274">He knew Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1275">Now that's unusual.</span> <span id="s1276">That would indicate also a Zionist whatever.</span> <span id="s1277">Again I don't know.</span> <span id="s1278">My mother says he knew Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1279">Now what does that mean.</span> <span id="s1280">She says, she insisted that he spoke modern Israeli Hebrew, that he could easily speak Hebrew to an Israeli.</span> <span id="s1281">I don't remember that although we did have an Israeli neighbor in the fifties and my mother says he spoke to her in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1282">Now maybe he said three words and my mother thought that meant he......Certainly he had a traditional Chaida education and he was well versed.</span> <span id="s1283">He wasn't a Talmudist but he knew Hebrew in the way a traditionally educated Jew knew Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1284">It wasn't rote.</span> <span id="s1285">He could look at the prayer book or at a bible and understand what it said.</span> <span id="s1286">He knew Russian.</span> <span id="s1287">I don't know if he could read or write Russian but he certainly could speak Russian and he knew German.</span> <span id="s1288">So he knew his languages.</span> <span id="s1289">Okay what else can I say about just childhood.</span> <span id="s1290">My father was clearly a very mischievous little boy because there are several stories that I remember of him directly telling me for example about how they tormented the Malamed at Chaida, how they tormented the teacher at the traditional Jewish school in the Chaida.</span> <span id="s1291">In fact I remember when I was in Hebrew school as a child he would say to me, Marsha you must never do the things to your teachers that we did, that I did to our teachers.</span> <span id="s1292">And he did all the things you read about in all the Haskala, I mean putting tacks on the chair and putting honey on the chair and they just bedeviled the life of the poor teacher, which was standard, standard childhood high-jinx.</span> <span id="s1293">And the other thing is that his sister, Nehama, who was older than he, probably three or four years older even though she was three children older, his sister Nehama wanted a date.</span> <span id="s1294">World War I was a kind of liberating experience, not the war itself, that was just a horrible experience.</span> <span id="s1295">In the aftermath of the war things really opened up and social life really changed.</span> <span id="s1296">And she wanted to go out on dates but her mother didn't want her to because her mother was still very traditional.</span> <span id="s1297">And so my father and another one of his brothers would conspire with her to sneak her out of the house.</span> <span id="s1298">And they did this through some kind of closet, some armoire, in Europe they have these closets and apparently they would move it against the window and open the window and open the back of the closet.</span> <span id="s1299">I don't remember the exact details but I have vivid memories of riding in our family car in the 1950's with my father telling me stories about how they would trick his mother so that Nehama could go out on a date with probably the man she ended up marrying.</span> <span id="s1300">But, you know, nothing serious.</span> <span id="s1301">She didn't cover her hair, actually.</span> <span id="s1302">Pictures we have of her or that I've seen of her as an adult, she didn't cover her hair.</span> <span id="s1303">So clearly this was a family on its way out of religious tradition although still very deeply connected to things Jewish.</span> <span id="s1304">So my father, I think, was a very mischievous child.</span> <span id="s1305">He always had a twinkle in his eyes as an adult, too, so he clearly was the kind....and survivors, of course, were often the kind of people who were mischievous sorts.</span> <span id="s1306">Okay, I think I don't know very much more about my father's real childhood, that is when he was a baby.</span> <span id="s1307">If I think of anything I'll come back to it.</span> <span id="s1308">My father got married pretty young.</span> <span id="s1309">He got married when he was about twenty or twenty-one to a cousin of his whom he loved very deeply.</span> <span id="s1310">So this was also non-traditional in a way, that is it was a love marriage, not an arranged one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Was it a first cousin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">You know I think it was a first cousin.</span> <span id="s1313">I think she was his first cousin.</span> <span id="s1314">I'm not a hundred percent positive that she was his first cousin but she was definitely his cousin.</span> <span id="s1315">Her father owned a lumber yard in the Warsaw area in a town called Wolomin, which I think is spelled W-O-L-0-M-I-N, I'm not a hundred percent sure but I think so.</span> <span id="s1316">It's in the Warsaw area.</span> <span id="s1317">So he moved to Warsaw, or to Wolomin, and he ran his father-in-law's business or worked with his father-in-law in running the business.</span> <span id="s1318">His wife though, whose name was either Mira or Perella[224] I don't remember which, his wife though died about a week after their first child was born because she had a rheumatic heart and she was warned by doctors not to have any children and she then didn't listen.</span> <span id="s1319">She wanted a child, it wasn't accidental.</span> <span id="s1320">They weren't that religious and she died very shortly after he was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">So you think she was probably about twenty years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">She was probably twenty, twenty-one.</span> <span id="s1323">I think my father was twenty-one and she was probably the same age or a year younger.</span> <span id="s1324">She was very young.</span> <span id="s1325">Their son's name was Avraham.</span> <span id="s1326">He was named after my father's father.</span> <span id="s1327">Avraham was born therefore, let's see in 1943 when he was killed, he was twelve.</span> <span id="s1328">So he was born in 1931.</span> <span id="s1329">So my father wasn't twenty-one he was twenty-four.</span> <span id="s1330">Well, whatever.</span> <span id="s1331">These stories have gotten passed from my mother who was not especially good at dates but I think Avraham was born either in 1930 or '31.</span> <span id="s1332">And his wife died and he was very, very miserable, naturally.</span> <span id="s1333">And the family talked him into marrying her sister whose name was either Mira or Perella[236].</span> <span id="s1334">In other words Mira and Perella[ph] were his wives.</span> <span id="s1335">I just don't remember which was the first and which was the second.</span> <span id="s1336">I think Perella[ph] was the second.</span> <span id="s1337">I think Mira was the first.</span> <span id="s1338">Again I'm really not a hundred percent sure.</span> <span id="s1339">Again my cousin in Israel would know the answer.</span> <span id="s1340">And they had another child.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">The family talked him into it.</span> <span id="s1342">Was this under duress then that he did this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">No, I think they talked him into it in the sense that this is the smartest and best thing to do.</span> <span id="s1344">The child needs a mother, what better mother than her sister.</span> <span id="s1345">She needs a husband, she's a nice lady, why don't you just marry her.</span> <span id="s1346">You know, I think it was that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1347">And he was very depressed and he needed a mother for his child and maybe she was already taking care of the kid.</span> <span id="s1348">I don't know exactly but he definitely married her.</span> <span id="s1349">And it was all right.</span> <span id="s1350">Obviously it was sad.</span> <span id="s1351">I didn't know this when I was a child.</span> <span id="s1352">When I was a child my father was very open and talked a huge amount about his holocaust experience and about his life before the war.</span> <span id="s1353">But for whatever reason, maybe because it was ordinary tragedy rather than the special Jewish tragedy of the holocaust, he didn't tell me about the fact that his first wife had died.</span> <span id="s1354">He thought that would be too sad for me.</span> <span id="s1355">Here he was telling me about his son and daughter who had been slaughtered by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1356">And that he could tell me about.</span> <span id="s1357">But the specific tragedy of his own personal life with his wife's death he didn't tell me.</span> <span id="s1358">I found out when I was twenty or something.</span> <span id="s1359">A cousin of his in America was visiting us and she just mentioned it casually.</span> <span id="s1360">I said, what are you talking about?</span> <span id="s1361">And she told me the whole story and I just bawled.</span> <span id="s1362">It was very sad that this love of his life died in childbirth.</span> <span id="s1363">But anyway, he did have a daughter with the second wife.</span> <span id="s1364">Her name was Toby.</span> <span id="s1365">That's what my mother called her.</span> <span id="s1366">It's probably Tova, which again sounds both modern and Hebraic, Gittel is the Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1367">Tova is already a sign of modernity in its modern Jewish form.</span> <span id="s1368">She was four years younger than Avraham.</span> <span id="s1369">So she would have been born in 1934 or '35, something like that, or '33 depending on exactly when Avraham was born.</span> <span id="s1370">And my father continued to live in Wolomin with his wife and running this lumber yard.</span> <span id="s1371">He sent his kids to - there were several Jewish school systems in Poland as you know.</span> <span id="s1372">There was the Zionist school system and the Bundist school system and the "frumie", the religious school system and so forth.</span> <span id="s1373">He sent his children to a school system that was very much like American Jewish Day schools, that is Jewish subjects were taught in Hebrew and secular subjects were taught in Polish which was not the case in the Zionist or Bundist schools where everything was taught either in Hebrew or Yiddish with only a minimal amount of Polish.</span> <span id="s1374">So his children went to this kind of modern Jewish school which means, of course, that it was a little bit more religious than both the Zionist or the Bundist schools which would indicate a kind of moderate religious position.</span> <span id="s1375">So that's the kind of school he sent his kids to.</span> <span id="s1376">As I said he kept a kosher home.</span> <span id="s1377">I don't think he was Sabbath observing.</span> <span id="s1378">So he was kind of a little traditional but not...</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">And they spoke Yiddish at home, I assume.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">You know I don't know what language.</span> <span id="s1381">Certainly growing up he spoke Yiddish at home, that goes without saying.</span> <span id="s1382">What language did he speak as an adult in his family in Wolomin?</span> <span id="s1383">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1384">I really don't know if he spoke Yiddish or Polish or both.</span> <span id="s1385">You know if you're utterly fluent it probably depends on your mood.</span> <span id="s1386">Yiddish was definitely his mother tongue, what he dreamed in, what he counted in was definitely Yiddish, but I don't know.</span> <span id="s1387">I bet they spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1388">I think most Jews spoke Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">That would be my guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">My guess would be Yiddish although maybe sometimes Polish depending if the kids came back from school and spoke Polish, then you answered them in Polish and then all of a sudden for an hour you were talking Polish.</span> <span id="s1391">But then if you stopped talking for a minute and then started talking again you probably would speak Yiddish because Yiddish was the natural thing to speak.</span> <span id="s1392">After the war in America my father was utterly fluent in English.</span> <span id="s1393">He learned English very quickly and spoke English with my mother who was American born.</span> <span id="s1394">But with his friends from Lukow who had survived the war, and some of them had as partisans and so on, these friends who were in America, their natural language that they spoke was Yiddish although all of them were modern.</span> <span id="s1395">None of them were Orthodox and so forth.</span> <span id="s1396">The natural language they would speak was Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1397">But sometimes they would just speak Polish and it would drive my mother crazy because as an American Jew she did know Yiddish but she didn't know Polish.</span> <span id="s1398">And she would get very angry with them when they spoke Polish and the angrier she got the more they would speak Polish to make her angrier because they were very jealous of her because she had parents because she was American and they didn't.</span> <span id="s1399">The thing they had on her was that they could speak more languages and so they would speak Polish.</span> <span id="s1400">But my guess is that Yiddish would be the language of his home.</span> <span id="s1401">I don't know what kind of home he lived in.</span> <span id="s1402">He was certainly reasonably prosperous, certainly middle class and definitely in contact with his family in Lukow.</span> <span id="s1403">He still had brothers and I think his sister was there.</span> <span id="s1404">His mother certainly was there.</span> <span id="s1405">Of course he had aunts and uncles and cousins and nieces and nephews.</span> <span id="s1406">All of his brothers and sisters had married.</span> <span id="s1407">They all had children.</span> <span id="s1408">He was the closest with his sister.</span> <span id="s1409">The sibling he talked the very most about was his sister.</span> <span id="s1410">They were named for the same person.</span> <span id="s1411">Mendel is a Yiddish nickname for Menachem and so technically his name was Menachem Mendel Tzidik[ph312].</span> <span id="s1412">I should tell you my father's formal name was Menachem Mendel Tzidik[ph] Rozenblit which would translate - Tzidik is Tzadok, just a Yiddish way of saying Tzadok and Nehama, his sister, who was called Nechuma[ph314], ??</span> <span id="s1413">raised eyes that she was called Nechuma.</span> <span id="s1414">Nechuma was obviously named for the same person.</span> <span id="s1415">She was born first and they named her Nehama to be after whatever relative, Menachem.</span> <span id="s1416">When my father was born they named him after the same relative.</span> <span id="s1417">So he was very close with his sister and he talked about Meir because Meir was unusual because he was the one who had the secular education and had gone off to study medicine.</span> <span id="s1418">That was all he talked about with any specificity except in terms of how each of them died in the holocaust and I can tell you about that when we talk about the war years.</span> <span id="s1419">I don't know what his wife did.</span> <span id="s1420">I don't know if his wife worked or not.</span> <span id="s1421">Probably not given the 1930's in Poland and middle class family.</span> <span id="s1422">I doubt that she worked.</span> <span id="s1423">They were definitely middle class.</span> <span id="s1424">This is not somebody making - with nostalgia, hindsight, looking back because well maybe this isn't a good historical - forget this.</span> <span id="s1425">I was going to say I've seen the list of property that he presented to the United Restitution Organization as part of his reparations claim.</span> <span id="s1426">It's the kind of things middle class people have, you know silver and whatever, fur coats and so forth.</span> <span id="s1427">But you know people could lie on those so that's not necessarily a good source.</span> <span id="s1428">I think that despite the very terrible situation for Jews in Poland in the 1930's, you know very high anti-semitism and very terrible economy and so forth, that my father did reasonably well.</span> <span id="s1429">He certainly didn't give any thought as far as I know to migrating although there was no place to migrate to except for Palestine.</span> <span id="s1430">And he wasn't enough of a Zionist to want to go to Palestine although his brother Haim Yakov did.</span> <span id="s1431">They had relatives in America like probably every Jew in Poland but America was out of the question by the twenties so I think he was perfectly content to be in Poland.</span> <span id="s1432">In terms of his attitude to Poland as a country, actually when he was born, he was born in Russia, and of course the Polish Jews hated Russia because they were discriminated against so severely, I think he thought of himself as a Polish national.</span> <span id="s1433">I think he was a typical Jew in Poland in the sense that his primary identity was as a Jew.</span> <span id="s1434">If you asked him, who are you, what are you, he would say I am a Jew.</span> <span id="s1435">But he was Polish, he spoke Polish, he identified with the Polish state.</span> <span id="s1436">He thought of himself as a Polish subject.</span> <span id="s1437">He used that word actually.</span> <span id="s1438">He called himself a Polish subject which is a funny archaic word which is usually used for kingdoms.</span> <span id="s1439">But that's how Jews were in Poland.</span> <span id="s1440">They were members of the Polish state but they weren't Poles so he would never have said that he was a Pole because he wasn't a Pole, he was a Jew.</span> <span id="s1441">I suppose he was hoping that the Polish Republic would get to be a nicer place than it was.</span> <span id="s1442">As I said I was ten when he died and at ten I didn't ask him such nice interesting political questions as what you thought about Poland and how you related to Poland and so on.</span> <span id="s1443">What else could I tell you about right before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">This is good.</span> <span id="s1445">This is all good and it's what we need.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">hat's what you need.</span> <span id="s1447">So basically, before the war, on the eve of the war, in 1939, on September 1, 1939, my father had a business that was reasonably prosperous He lived in a town near Warsaw called Wolomin.</span> <span id="s1448">He had a wife; he had two children, a boy and a girl.</span> <span id="s1449">He had a huge extended family.</span> <span id="s1450">He had a very large family, he had a mother and sisters and brothers, nieces and nephews, aunts and uncles, cousins.</span> <span id="s1451">He had a large and intact and functioning family.</span> <span id="s1452">And then the war started.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">So what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">What happened, okay.</span> <span id="s1455">You know I'm used to telling the story to my six year old son and of course to my six year old son I have to include what happened during the war.</span> <span id="s1456">I have to sketch out the war and what the Nazis did to the Jews and I don't have to do that here.</span> <span id="s1457">In the first months of the war there was just chaos and all kinds of restrictions against the Jews.</span> <span id="s1458">I assume that his business was Aryanized because that's what the Germans did as soon as they came in.</span> <span id="s1459">They Aryanized businesses giving them to ethnic Germans.</span> <span id="s1460">I assume my father was not compensated for it.</span> <span id="s1461">He was a clever man.</span> <span id="s1462">He probably managed to get stuff out of it before it was technically Aryanized.</span> <span id="s1463">In all the stories he talked about the years before he was deported to Auschwitz he never mentioned that he was starving to death and he was living in the street or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1464">Of course he was starving but he wasn't......He must have managed to get something out of his business even though he wasn't compensated for it.</span> <span id="s1465">You read about this in the memoirs people who with Polish friends manage to make arrangements and deals and so forth.</span> <span id="s1466">But anyway his business was confiscated, his bank accounts frozen, all of those things taken from him.</span> <span id="s1467">But then, of course, he was in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1468">Now when my father was alive and he talked about his experiences in the war he always simply said the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1469">He didn't specify which one.</span> <span id="s1470">When my mother, who is not a historian and who is not at all good with details and in fact was terrible with details, when my mother talked about it for him, after he died, or when I would ask her as I got a little older, well which ghetto, she said the Warsaw ghetto, that he was in the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s1471">Some of the details of his story very much match the Warsaw ghetto in terms of....well the fact is he escaped from the ghetto when it was burning in April 1943.</span> <span id="s1472">That's the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s1473">What other ghetto was burning in April '43 that you could escape from in some way.</span> <span id="s1474">But on the other hand, he didn't live in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1475">He lived in Wolomin which was close to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1476">There could have been a ghetto in Wolomin.</span> <span id="s1477">On the other hand it was so close to Warsaw that all the people may have been moved to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1478">But usually people who had to move into a place did very, very badly.</span> <span id="s1479">And my father obviously didn't fare badly.</span> <span id="s1480">I think that he probably was in the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s1481">He probably did just simply get moved from Wolomin into Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1482">Let's say for the purposes of this record that he was in the Warsaw ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Have you looked up any of the records about Wolomin if they did transfer them at some point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">No, I have never done that.</span> <span id="s1485">It's funny, I'm a historian and not a genealogist and so I'm interested in what happened to the Jews and I've never bothered to look up the specifics of my father's experience in any systematic way.</span> <span id="s1486">A lot of his experiences that he described are very, very similar to what you read in the memoirs.</span> <span id="s1487">So it fits in very well.</span> <span id="s1488">But I never at all tried to ....when I was reading Itzhak Arrad's[ph415] book about ????</span> <span id="s1489">[415]Treblinka which is about the operation ???</span> <span id="s1490">[416] death camps which basically gassed all of the Jews of Poland and certainly the region he was living in because the section of Poland that both he and his family was in was the general government.</span> <span id="s1491">The Germans came in and annexed the Bartoland[ph420] and created the general government and the Soviets took the eastern part of Poland.</span> <span id="s1492">So my father was in the general government.</span> <span id="s1493">Anyway when I read that I did pay attention to see if there was any word about Wolomin.</span> <span id="s1494">There was description of deportations from Wolomin but I don't know.</span> <span id="s1495">There probably are no records of the Wolomin ghetto.</span> <span id="s1496">In any case, for the sake of argument I say that my father was in the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s1497">I think he may have worked for the Jewish Council.</span> <span id="s1498">He never said that.</span> <span id="s1499">This is not a memory I have from him or from my mother or from my cousin Mutti who wouldn't have know because my cousin Mutti could only give me information about the pre-war period because he left in 1938.</span> <span id="s1500">I have a memory from when I was a child of a friend of my father's from Wolomin, a man who had been a worker of his in his lumber yard who he was in Auschwitz with and who had also survived and who remained a friend after the war.</span> <span id="s1501">He's still alive, a man named Shaya May[ph436].</span> <span id="s1502">I think he's still alive.</span> <span id="s1503">He was alive five years ago when my mother died because I called him but I assume he's still alive.</span> <span id="s1504">Shaya[ph] once I remember when I was a child, it was right after my father died, too, actually, he was talking to my mother about my father during the war.</span> <span id="s1505">He mentioned something about my father working for that traitorous Council or something like that.</span> <span id="s1506">A lot of the Jews hated the Council.</span> <span id="s1507">He was certainly not a member of the Council, of the 24 hot shots on the Council because I certainly would have come across his name if he were.</span> <span id="s1508">The Warsaw ghetto Judenhad had seven hundred employees so he may have known someone who knew somebody who got him a job on the Council.</span> <span id="s1509">So he may have worked on the Council.</span> <span id="s1510">From my memories of all the stories of the ghetto years I don't have any sense that he was in terrible shape.</span> <span id="s1511">Obviously all the Jews had very little food and fuel and so forth.</span> <span id="s1512">Things were very difficult in the ghettoes.</span> <span id="s1513">But his family was in tact.</span> <span id="s1514">He had a son and his daughter.</span> <span id="s1515">His son and daughter attended school.</span> <span id="s1516">I think his wife taught school in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1517">My mother said that.</span> <span id="s1518">Either she taught school or she taught piano.</span> <span id="s1519">I think both stories, I remember.</span> <span id="s1520">So she was involved in this kind of moral resistance that took place, the organization of clandestine schools, and sort of doing normal and cultural and so forth things.</span> <span id="s1521">I don't think I know very much more about the specific ghetto experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">So you don't know if they lived with other families or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">That I just don't know.</span> <span id="s1524">The only person who might know is Shaya May[ph462] but Shaya never wanted to talk about his experiences very much whereas my father talked about it all the time.</span> <span id="s1525">I should add I have another source about my father's experiences and that is that when he went to school in America, when he came to America, the equivalent of "What I Did on My Summer Vacation," he had to write an essay about his experiences.</span> <span id="s1526">He had to write an essay that described his experiences during the war, I guess, so he wrote.</span> <span id="s1527">I have part of that essay, part of it is missing.</span> <span id="s1528">But he just says I suffered terribly and goes on.</span> <span id="s1529">He doesn't provide specific details about what it was like in the ghetto or in the camps.</span> <span id="s1530">There was also, of course, the testimony that he provided to B..</span> <span id="s1531">Goodmachen[ph474] for the reparations claim which my mother typed and of which there is no copy although she swears she made one.</span> <span id="s1532">She doesn't know what happened to it and she suspects that my father actually destroyed the copy.</span> <span id="s1533">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s1534">But the copy just doesn't exist.</span> <span id="s1535">Most of her memories I suppose come from that formal document that she typed for him.</span> <span id="s1536">So I don't know if he lived with others or what the situation was.</span> <span id="s1537">Probably he did, most Jews did, it was a very crowded situation.</span> <span id="s1538">Most of his family, of course, was in Lukow, in the Lukow ghetto although he had a brother in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1539">Simcha was in Warsaw and Simcha was shot for playing cards after curfew.</span> <span id="s1540">He was shot during the time of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1541">I mean not for playing cards but after playing cards going out in the street.</span> <span id="s1542">So Simcha died before the deportations.</span> <span id="s1543">And he had been in Warsaw because he had moved to Warsaw already in the thirties or twenties or something and I don't know why he had moved or what he did at all.</span> <span id="s1544">Again my cousin Mutti would probably know although he may not because since he was in Lukow he didn't really know the War.....he actually knew my father the least well because my father was already in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1545">He remembers my father coming home to visit twice or three times and giving him a ball or something like that.</span> <span id="s1546">His stories are really best.</span> <span id="s1547">From my cousin Mutti in Israel I mostly learned about my grandmother, about Masha Rozenblit, because that was his grandmother, too.</span> <span id="s1548">Anyway so I really don't know much about the ghetto years except that things were okay.</span> <span id="s1549">His brother was shot but things were reasonably okay.</span> <span id="s1550">Of course then came the deportations.</span> <span id="s1551">During the deportations from the Lukow ghetto, his mother was shot.</span> <span id="s1552">She was in her sixties and rather than take her to Treblinka or Sobibor or wherever they were taking the Jews from Lukow, they shot her.</span> <span id="s1553">Somebody must have witnessed that because how else would he have known, he wasn't in Lukow.</span> <span id="s1554">She was shot.</span> <span id="s1555">I assume the rest of his relatives in Lukow, aunts, uncles, cousins, Shia and his family were probably just deported to wherever Jews from Lukow were deported to and gassed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Do you know what year this was, was it '43?</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">No, well all of Polish Jewry, it's '42.</span> <span id="s1558">The operation Rhinehart which just simply went methodically and liquidated all the ghettoes began something like March of '42 and was over by October '42 with some pockets left.</span> <span id="s1559">That is there were Jews left in the Warsaw ghetto and in the ....was it the Lublin?</span> <span id="s1560">Yeah the Lublin ghetto was made into a labor camp and a couple of other places.</span> <span id="s1561">There were pockets where they allowed Jews to still continue.</span> <span id="s1562">Those were destroyed in '43.</span> <span id="s1563">I assume that probably all of those relatives were killed in '42 unless by some chance Shia or another one of his brothers was in the labor camp, in the Jeneska Road[ph502] labor camp or Poniyet Tovah[ph504], I forget there were a whole bunch of labor camps in the Lublin area which maybe his brother or one of his nephews because if my father's son was already twelve by that time then his older brothers' kids could have been teenagers.</span> <span id="s1564">So maybe they were in.....But I just don't know.</span> <span id="s1565">I assume that everybody was just killed in '42.</span> <span id="s1566">His sister, Nehama, though, who lived in Lukow with her family, you know I wrote down that her name was Pearlman but maybe her name was Bernstein.</span> <span id="s1567">Yes, her name was Bernstein.</span> <span id="s1568">Pearlman was my father's wife's maiden name.</span> <span id="s1569">She and her husband who was much shorter than her, that was the joke of the family, that Nehama who was very tall, I presumably look like Nehama, - when I was a kid we would go to the Lukow Young Men's Benevolent Association and all the people who had come from my father's town - and people would go, Nehama, Nehama.</span> <span id="s1570">They looked at me.</span> <span id="s1571">I don't look like her in the pictures but they thought I looked like her.</span> <span id="s1572">But anyway she and her family, her husband and her children (she probably had teen-age children) hid in the woods.</span> <span id="s1573">They somehow escaped the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1574">I don't know if they escaped in '42 or if they escaped earlier but they were hiding in the woods near there in the Lublin region.</span> <span id="s1575">And they were only killed in '44, about three months before the end of the war in that part of Poland.</span> <span id="s1576">They were handed over by some Poles to the Nazis at that point.</span> <span id="s1577">So I don't know what happened to them if they were then sent to Auschwitz or if they were shot right away or whatever.</span> <span id="s1578">But they did succeed in hiding.</span> <span id="s1579">Nechuma, I should be fair, her name was not Nehama, her name was Nechuma.</span> <span id="s1580">Actually she used a Polish name too, Helenie, she used the name Helenie.</span> <span id="s1581">There are pictures on the back that say Helenie.</span> <span id="s1582">I think she was the only one that used a Polish name.</span> <span id="s1583">My father didn't.</span> <span id="s1584">He used Mendel, his Yiddish name and all the others, Shia, Meir, they all used their Hebrew names.</span> <span id="s1585">But she used both, Nechuma and Helenie.</span> <span id="s1586">But anyway, Nechuma and her family, that had been hiding for years, at least for two, maybe even more than two, were handed over to the Nazis by some Poles for (as my mother used to say, for a bottle of Vodka).</span> <span id="s1587">The Poles were given booty for handing over Jews.</span> <span id="s1588">Now I don't know if these people had just happened upon them and turned them over or if these were people who had been helping them all along and then turned them over, because often people were hiding with the assistance of Poles.</span> <span id="s1589">Maybe it was neighbors, good Poles who were helping them who turned them over, who knows.</span> <span id="s1590">I think that most of his family, the Lukow branch of the family, his mother and brothers and sisters, well whatever, there's not that many brothers by that time because Simcha and his family were in Warsaw and presumably they were deported in 1942.</span> <span id="s1591">Simcha had been shot earlier for curfew violations but presumably his family was deported in '42 when most of the Jews in Warsaw were deported.</span> <span id="s1592">In Lukow Haim, his brother Haim Yakov had already gone to Palestine although his family hadn't.</span> <span id="s1593">My father's brother Haim Yakov had gone to Palestine in 1937 alone.</span> <span id="s1594">His son, Mutti, followed him in 1938 leaving the wife and the other children.</span> <span id="s1595">So they were all presumably killed also in '42.</span> <span id="s1596">Shia was there and his family presumably were all killed and Nehama was there but she was in hiding until '44 when she was handed over to the Nazis, she and her family were handed over to the Nazis and killed and of course Meir was in Paris and he was deported, I assume, again I don't know this, but I assume he was deported in July of 1942 when the big raid in Paris took place, July 16 I believe, 1942, when most Polish Jews in Paris were deported.</span> <span id="s1597">Now this is not necessarily true.</span> <span id="s1598">He could have escaped to the south and have been picked up at some other time.</span> <span id="s1599">He definitely was deported to Auschwitz because after the war my cousin Mutti in Israel, he was too upset to deal with the issue but his wife, Zeporah, spent months dealing with the Red Cross and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Agency to track down all the Rozenblit relatives, also her own relatives from her own family.</span> <span id="s1600">But her own family was mostly in Palestine because they were all Zionist who'd come mostly in the '20s.</span> <span id="s1601">So she tracked them down and she found my father and she found nobody else.</span> <span id="s1602">So in fact the first time I saw those letters I wanted to cry because the first letter had to be in English, the Red Cross would only deal in English.</span> <span id="s1603">So the first letter to my father that my cousin Mutti wrote to his uncle was in English so I could read it easily and my father didn't know English yet but Mutti knew English and then of course all subsequent correspondence was just real letters because my father had a real address and that was all in Yiddish which I could read too but with much more difficulty so I didn't read it quite as easily.</span> <span id="s1604">But she found nobody else.</span> <span id="s1605">So I assume obviously she would have found - there were all these organizations after the war, all these Jewish and non-Jewish organizations tracking down people.</span> <span id="s1606">So he was presumably killed either in '42 or '43 or '44, everybody else.</span> <span id="s1607">And Nehama definitely in '44.</span> <span id="s1608">Simcha at some point before '42, everybody else in '42 except for my father and his family.</span> <span id="s1609">In any case assuming that my father was in the Warsaw ghetto, his family was able to stay there after that initial depletion of the Warsaw ghetto in August/September of 1942.</span> <span id="s1610">That confirms that he worked for the Jewish Council actually because the people who stayed in Warsaw, the 70,000 or so that remained after the major liquidation either worked for the Jewish Council or were involved in SS industry, or whatever industry that was working for the German war economy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">Maybe that lent itself also to them having slightly better food conditions or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">That's right.</span> <span id="s1613">Also I think the Wolomin ghetto was simply, I read that in Orad[ph33] the Wolomin was totally destroyed in 1942.</span> <span id="s1614">So my father I know was in the ghetto until April of 1943.</span> <span id="s1615">That's Warsaw, that April '43 date is so fundamentally Warsaw that he had to have been in the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s1616">In fact he always lit a Yartzeit candle for his children at Pesach because that's around, I mean the Warsaw ghetto was finally liquidated on the second night of Pesach.</span> <span id="s1617">And they didn't die that night, I'll tell that story in a minute but it was just a few weeks later.</span> <span id="s1618">So Pesach of 1943, so Pesach is when he lit a Yartzeit candle for them.</span> <span id="s1619">Actually he always lit a Yartzeit candle for everybody then.</span> <span id="s1620">I don't know, maybe because he was in Warsaw and that had such an impact on his conscience.</span> <span id="s1621">His mother was probably shot at some point in 1942 not necessarily at Pesach.</span> <span id="s1622">My father, therefore, and his wife and his children and his wife's sister who was crippled, not totally crippled but she schlepped a leg for whatever reason, they were together in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1623">So he was in the ghetto after that liquidation of August/September 1942 when most of the people in the ghetto were liquidated.</span> <span id="s1624">So he was one of the 70,000 that stayed in the ghetto until April of '43 when the Nazis decided on the final liquidation of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1625">Now my father in 1943, he was born in 1907, so in 1943 he was 36.</span> <span id="s1626">Well he wasn't yet because his birthday is November, so he was 35 years old.</span> <span id="s1627">And he had a twelve year old son and an eight year old daughter and a wife and a sister-in-law.</span> <span id="s1628">And they decided to escape from the burning ghetto.</span> <span id="s1629">Because of the uprising the Nazis sort of bombed the ghetto and sent in fire bombs and so forth and basically burned the ghetto down.</span> <span id="s1630">And my father and his family decided to escape from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1631">I don't know if that means they went through the sewers or not.</span> <span id="s1632">In Warsaw that's how people escaped from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1633">This is where he really told.</span> <span id="s1634">My father told the stories from the escape from the Warsaw ghetto until liberation.</span> <span id="s1635">That's what he told.</span> <span id="s1636">The ghetto experience didn't interest him.</span> <span id="s1637">That must mean that it was not too terrible.</span> <span id="s1638">My image of hearing the story as a child was that they escaped into the woods.</span> <span id="s1639">But there are no woods around the Warsaw ghetto or around Warsaw even for that matter.</span> <span id="s1640">So I don't know how they escaped, presumably they did it through the sewers.</span> <span id="s1641">But in any case they escaped.</span> <span id="s1642">Oh, I do know, my mother I think told me this that he did make attempts through Polish, non-Jewish friends to get his children to be taken by non-Jews.</span> <span id="s1643">You know pretend to be non_Jews.</span> <span id="s1644">And nobody would do it.</span> <span id="s1645">He was unable to get anybody to agree to do that.</span> <span id="s1646">So anyway there he was with his twelve year old, his eight year, his wife and his sister-in-law and they escaped and somehow they made it to some woods, or maybe not to some woods, they were just out.</span> <span id="s1647">They had a kind of pact that if one of them should get lost, they would not look for that person because that could be problematic and instead if one of them should get lost, they should go to a farm house that they knew which was some distance away, my memory is 90 kilometers but I was a little kid when I heard this so I don't know where it was.</span> <span id="s1648">Somehow Avraham, my father's son, who by the way was not called Avraham, that's my way of Hebraisizing it again, it's Avremy, the Yiddish nickname for Abraham.</span> <span id="s1649">Avremy who was twelve somehow got lost, he wasn't there.</span> <span id="s1650">My father's wife said that she had to go look for Avremy and my father said, no.</span> <span id="s1651">We'll lose you if you do that.</span> <span id="s1652">We have to stick together and go to the farm house.</span> <span id="s1653">We'll find Avremy at the farm house.</span> <span id="s1654">And she just was mad with concern for her son who's not even technically her son but she had raised him his whole life so he was her son.</span> <span id="s1655">And she went to look for him and they never saw her again.</span> <span id="s1656">I assume that means she was picked up by SS soldiers and by the SS and taken directly to Auschwitz which at that point was the only, by 1943 -- oh maybe not Auschwitz, maybe she was taken to Treblinka , I don't know where she was taken to but she was presumably killed.</span> <span id="s1657">But my father and his daughter and his sister-in-law did go to this farm house and they found Avremy there without his shoes, a Polish farmer had taken them, probably he needed them, probably he thought that Avremy would be killed soon anyway, what did he need shoes for.</span> <span id="s1658">Who knows why he took them, but he took them.</span> <span id="s1659">This is April of '43, my father, Avremy, Toby, and Tova whatever, and his sister-in-law whose name I don't know and then they were arrested, they were found.</span> <span id="s1660">I mean it was very hard to really escape especially since the Poles were so hostile and the Nazis were so eager to find them.</span> <span id="s1661">And he was taken to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1662">They were taken to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1663">Of course my father was 35, and the rest of them were not 35, they were twelve, eight, and I don't know how old his sister-in-law was, presumably in her thirties too but she was crippled.</span> <span id="s1664">And she was as if the mother of these children.</span> <span id="s1665">She was an adult female with two children.</span> <span id="s1666">And so when they got to Auschwitz, he was sent to the left or the right, whichever way.</span> <span id="s1667">He was sent to do slave labor and they were sent the other way which means that they were gassed.</span> <span id="s1668">So in April of 1943 his son and daughter and sister-in-law were killed by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1669">But he was in Auschwitz and he was a slave laborer in Auschwitz for a long time.</span> <span id="s1670">He worked in Auschwitz and he would talk about his experiences quite a lot.</span> <span id="s1671">He talked about how awful it was although I must say that he did not dwell on how awful it was.</span> <span id="s1672">My father talked about his experience in the camps a lot.</span> <span id="s1673">Saturday nights when we would have company, in the 1950s if you were a Jewish family in Brooklyn you would have bagels and lox for dinner, and we would have bagels and lox and herring and so on and company and he would talk.</span> <span id="s1674">People would say Mark what was it like.</span> <span id="s1675">And he would talk.</span> <span id="s1676">And I just remember Saturday nights in my childhood hearing my father talk about this.</span> <span id="s1677">And when he talked about it he did not talk about the horrors so much.</span> <span id="s1678">He certainly made it very clear that it was so horrific that you could not even imagine it.</span> <span id="s1679">And in fact when people would be nasty, nasty is the wrong word, but you know how Americans could be presumptuous and they would say, how could you have done such a thing?</span> <span id="s1680">Like my father would say we found a rat and we ate it or something.</span> <span id="s1681">And they'd say, ooh how could you eat a rat?</span> <span id="s1682">It's not really nasty.</span> <span id="s1683">And he would say, you shouldn't talk, you don't know what it's like to be in a fire.</span> <span id="s1684">I remember that expression, you don't know what it's like to be in a fire.</span> <span id="s1685">But he wouldn't dwell on how awful it was except to indicate that it was unbearably awful and constant beatings and starvation and filth and dirt and crowded and disgusting.</span> <span id="s1686">He indicated that but that's not what he dwelled on.</span> <span id="s1687">What he dwelled on instead in his talking about it was the things that people did to survive and the things that people did to help each other survive.</span> <span id="s1688">The image that I had as a child of what it was like in the camps was unbearable sadism and cruelty on the part of the Nazis but the inmates being human, working to do things that would make themselves survive and things that human beings do.</span> <span id="s1689">I don't mean that human beings are pigs and do horrible things, but in the good sense of being human, that is of helping each other and working together to try to survive, and so forth.</span> <span id="s1690">For example he always spoke about what the memoirs all talked about, that is the whole business of organization, the whole network through which people bargained and traded and bartered and traded their bread for other things.</span> <span id="s1691">He talked all the time of it how it was crucial to trade your bread for soap, or to trade your bread for an onion or for garlic or something and soap so you could clean yourself.</span> <span id="s1692">Onions or garlic so you could get vitamins.</span> <span id="s1693">All of that which I've read in umpteen memoirs but he talked about that all the time, about the need to trade.</span> <span id="s1694">Of course the whole network depended on pilfering from Nazi stewards and from the suitcases of people who came in to be gassed.</span> <span id="s1695">So he talked about that a lot.</span> <span id="s1696">He didn't use the word organization as far as I remember but maybe he did and I just don't remember.</span> <span id="s1697">But he talked about that you really needed to do that.</span> <span id="s1698">He also talked, in fact more importantly than this whole organization business, he talked about holding on to the will to live.</span> <span id="s1699">My most vivid memory I have from childhood, the most single vivid memory of my own childhood is my father talking about holding on to the will to live.</span> <span id="s1700">And that the only way you could survive such a horrible place was to hold on to the will to live and that's how you did it, you just held on to the will to live.</span> <span id="s1701">Like literally held on to it.</span> <span id="s1702">And every second said, I'm going to live, I'm going to live, I'm going to live.</span> <span id="s1703">I just remember that vividly.</span> <span id="s1704">I don't remember what he said how you did it, how you held on to the will to live or what strategies he used to hold on to the will to live, which I read about in memoirs, thinking about the past, thinking about the future, thinking about this, whatever.</span> <span id="s1705">There are different strategies that people used.</span> <span id="s1706">That I don't remember, his own personal strategies.</span> <span id="s1707">But I do remember him talking about that - holding on to the will to live.</span> <span id="s1708">I also remember that of course it made him lose all faith in God.</span> <span id="s1709">Actually I don't remember that, I take that back.</span> <span id="s1710">He did lose all faith in God.</span> <span id="s1711">But that he didn't tell me about.</span> <span id="s1712">My mother told me about that when I was older.</span> <span id="s1713">He didn't want me to know that because he didn't think that was fair to me.</span> <span id="s1714">He thought that I was a child and not know that he didn't believe in God as a result of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1715">And he didn't believe in God because his children had been killed and everybody's children had been killed not just his.</span> <span id="s1716">That didn't stop him from wanting to have a kosher home or from going to shool all the time.</span> <span id="s1717">He didn't stop being a Jew, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1718">Well actually he did stop going to shool until I was born.</span> <span id="s1719">From the time the war ended until I was born he would not go into a shool, he would not do anything religious.</span> <span id="s1720">He would not go to a Passover seder, he would not do anything religious.</span> <span id="s1721">No that's not true.</span> <span id="s1722">He would go to a Passover seder.</span> <span id="s1723">I think that was the only religious thing he would do but he would not go to shool.</span> <span id="s1724">When I was born he didn't even think about it.</span> <span id="s1725">He went to shool to name me.</span> <span id="s1726">He was a Jew.</span> <span id="s1727">That's what eastern European Jewry was like.</span> <span id="s1728">You were a Jew.</span> <span id="s1729">You did things because you were a Jew.</span> <span id="s1730">Jews named their daughters in shool.</span> <span id="s1731">The angel of death might kill your daughter if you didn't do that.</span> <span id="s1732">You know, you had to.</span> <span id="s1733">Just because you didn't believe in God didn't mean that you didn't name your daughter in shool.</span> <span id="s1734">And that broke the ice and he went to shool all the time.</span> <span id="s1735">He loved to go to shool.</span> <span id="s1736">He absolutely loved to go to shool.</span> <span id="s1737">He didn't go every week, he wasn't religious.</span> <span id="s1738">But he went at least once a month.</span> <span id="s1739">He really loved to go to shool.</span> <span id="s1740">In fact he even wanted me to go to a Jewish day school but my mother didn't want me to go because we weren't that religious and in those days it was just orthodox schools.</span> <span id="s1741">Getting back to his experiences, I don't remember that he talked about how he lost his faith in God but that was a central experience that he had in the camps, the loss of faith.</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">Do you remember any discussion of any specific episodes or incidents that he might have told you or other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">No, I don't remember anything specific from the camps except the business of trading bread for soap which is not a specific incident; I'm sure he did it more than once and the business of holding on to the will to live and the sense of how unbearable it was.</span> <span id="s1744">I think in his testimony for reparations he did provide some specific instances.</span> <span id="s1745">But my mother, who unfortunately was terrible at details didn't remember them and had lost the carbon copy.</span> <span id="s1746">I'm sure he was beaten mercilessly many times as was everybody, I mean he wasn't singled out.</span> <span id="s1747">I'm sure there were but I really don't unfortunately know any very specific thing.</span> <span id="s1748">In terms of what he actually did in the camp, I assume he did a variety of labor things.</span> <span id="s1749">He could be a carpenter so presumably when they asked him what do you do, he said I'm a carpenter and they did have him building.</span> <span id="s1750">My mother used to say that he built crematoria.</span> <span id="s1751">But they were already built by the time he got there so I don't - see my mother was really bad at detail.</span> <span id="s1752">It was a shame.</span> <span id="s1753">I'm a historian concerned with detail and she wasn't.</span> <span id="s1754">And my father died when I was young.</span> <span id="s1755">So I'm bringing all these memories of sitting around our table listening so I can think of something very specific.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">If you don't have it that's okay too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">I remember that he would be annoyed with people who presumed - like if he would discuss - in the Warsaw ghetto for example he would say how it was wonderful when a horse would die and they would just eat the horse meat and people would say, horse, how could you eat horse, and he would say, lady, you haven't been through a fire, you don't know.</span> <span id="s1758">People were in awe of my father.</span> <span id="s1759">He was a very intelligent man and they would sit there sort of enthralled with his stories.</span> <span id="s1760">I don't remember a specific incident unless as I keep on talking I'll come to something.</span> <span id="s1761">I don't remember anything specific.</span> <span id="s1762">I do know that he was in Auschwitz from April of '43 until January of '45 when the Russians - so in terms of your dates through 1944 he was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1763">In January of 1945 as you know the Russians came very close to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1764">Knowing that the Russians were going to be there any minute the Nazis evacuated the camp and in the famous death march that Elie Wiesel and millions of other - Isabella Leitner - millions of other people described - marched off people to Germany.</span> <span id="s1765">And my father was part of that death march.</span> <span id="s1766">I remember him describing that a little bit in more detail than the camps.</span> <span id="s1767">I remember him saying that it was very cold.</span> <span id="s1768">It was January, it was winter, and they didn't have boots and they didn't have coats.</span> <span id="s1769">Two-thirds of the people died.</span> <span id="s1770">And I remember him saying that you couldn't fall asleep because if you let yourself fall asleep you would die.</span> <span id="s1771">The snow was deceptive.</span> <span id="s1772">You think that it's warm when you're in it and so you could fall asleep.</span> <span id="s1773">And then of course you freeze to death because in fact it's not warm it's cold.</span> <span id="s1774">So you never should go to sleep in the snow.</span> <span id="s1775">And I remember him saying that that they would force each other to stay awake.</span> <span id="s1776">In some of the memoirs I've read about how they were put in barns, my father never talked about that.</span> <span id="s1777">He just talked about the snow and how people straggled, they would be shot of course and the Nazis would beat people up.</span> <span id="s1778">The Nazis were very nervous of course at this point.</span> <span id="s1779">He was taken to Dachau.</span> <span id="s1780">Other people went other places.</span> <span id="s1781">They were in Bergen-Belsen, Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1782">They were all taken to concentration camps in Germany.</span> <span id="s1783">He personally was taken to Dachau where he spent the next few months.</span> <span id="s1784">I don't know how long it actually took him to get from Auschwitz to Dachau.</span> <span id="s1785">In some of the memoirs you read how that part of the way they were on trains and trucks and so forth.</span> <span id="s1786">My father never said that.</span> <span id="s1787">He just said the death march.</span> <span id="s1788">He called it the death march and he said they took us to Dachau.</span> <span id="s1789">So he was in Dachau for a few months and he was liberated by the Americans in April of 1945.</span> <span id="s1790">And I have a couple of little stories that I remember of the actual liberation.</span> <span id="s1791">Not of the moment of liberation although I have a wonderful story from somebody else of the actual moment but I won't put this in my father's record.</span> <span id="s1792">It's one of those classic stories, the other story of how this person got out of Dachau.</span> <span id="s1793">The Nazis left the camp before the Americans got there and he was wandering around the streets and was almost shot by some American soldiers but he spoke Yiddish to them and one of them happened to be Jewish and so forth.</span> <span id="s1794">That's not my father's story.</span> <span id="s1795">Right after liberation he and Shia, this person who had been his employee in Wolomin before the war and had been in Auschwitz with him, and had been in the orchestra in Auschwitz actually, my father was just a laborer in Auschwitz but Shia was in the orchestra and they were in the death march together and so forth.</span> <span id="s1796">And after the war they were walking around and Shia picked up a rotten potato from the street that he saw and my father said what are you doing that for because now we have food.</span> <span id="s1797">And Shia was still too scared that there would be no food.</span> <span id="s1798">But that again is not my father's story because that's not what he did.</span> <span id="s1799">He of course was nothing at the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1800">He was utterly emaciated and utterly depleted.</span> <span id="s1801">My mother used to say he weighed fifty pounds at the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1802">I can't believe that.</span> <span id="s1803">But he must have weighed seventy or eighty.</span> <span id="s1804">My mother was also an exaggerator a little bit.</span> <span id="s1805">But I bet he weighed seventy pounds at the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1806">He was not a huge man anyway, he was probably about five nine.</span> <span id="s1807">He was broad but thin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">He must have been strong to have survived all the labor and all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1810">He was actually old to survive.</span> <span id="s1811">Most of the survivors were teenagers, which is why they're still alive.</span> <span id="s1812">My father if he were alive would be in his eighties.</span> <span id="s1813">I mean he happened to die when he was young.</span> <span id="s1814">He happened to die when he was fifty-three but even if he hadn't died and if he were still alive the man would be eighty-four years old.</span> <span id="s1815">No, that's not right.</span> <span id="s1816">Yes, he would be eighty-five on his next birthday.</span> <span id="s1817">Whereas most of the survivors that you talk to I'm sure are in their seventies because they were teen-agers or in their early twenties during the war.</span> <span id="s1818">My father was a very old survivor, very unusual, he must have been extraordinarily strong.</span> <span id="s1819">It's funny to say that somebody in their mid-thirties would already no longer be at the height of their physical strength but it's true.</span> <span id="s1820">So it's just amazing that he lived.</span> <span id="s1821">But anyway he was liberated by the Americans.</span> <span id="s1822">He did not go to a DP camp which was the standard experience but rather he went to work for the United Nations Relief and Restitution Agency and his job for them was to help people find housing.</span> <span id="s1823">He must have learned English working for them or before but he lived in an apartment in Munich.</span> <span id="s1824">He had a real apartment and had a real job and sort of went about his business.</span> <span id="s1825">I assume for a few months, I mean I assume that immediately after the war he was, it took months to recuperate.</span> <span id="s1826">In fact he said that it was months before he felt like a human being again.</span> <span id="s1827">I do know that most of his teeth had rotted during the war and that one of the first things he did when he had some modicum of strength was he just walked around the streets of Munich and looked for a dentist.</span> <span id="s1828">He found a dentist, walked in, asked the dentist to pull whatever was left and to give him false teeth.</span> <span id="s1829">The dentist wanted to give him anesthesia for the pulling and he said, no need.</span> <span id="s1830">He was so into pain that it didn't matter.</span> <span id="s1831">And the German dentist didn't charge him because my father had a number, he had been in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1832">He just showed his number.</span> <span id="s1833">In fact in those days you just showed your number and you got anything.</span> <span id="s1834">He didn't pay for too much after the war.</span> <span id="s1835">The apartment I think was also free.</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">I was wondering about that because I talked to a number of people and they said well we just lived there.</span> <span id="s1837">And I said how did you get food.</span> <span id="s1838">Well, we got food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">Well if they were in a DP camp they got food from the UN.</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">No, I mean in cities.</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">But if they lived in cities - well my father worked, I mean my father had a real job, but before that he didn't have the job from the first minute, I think it was not a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">There was guilt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">Yeah, although the Germans didn't have any food.</span> <span id="s1844">They must have been given food by the American army of occupation.</span> <span id="s1845">He must have just been given it.</span> <span id="s1846">I don't know that.</span> <span id="s1847">I know somebody who studies the DP camps, she might know.</span> <span id="s1848">Anyway, so he wasn't in a DP camp.</span> <span id="s1849">I assume he stayed in Dachau because that's what they did.</span> <span id="s1850">They set up barracks and gave people food and medicine and let them come to themselves.</span> <span id="s1851">We have pictures of my father right after the war, not right, right after the war but in '46 where he looks fine.</span> <span id="s1852">He had obviously regained his strength and so forth.</span> <span id="s1853">But so he lived and worked for UNRRA and he did have housing and he had a German, non-Jewish girlfriend who he lived with which is very weird.</span> <span id="s1854">And she knew Yiddish which is very weird.</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">I heard of some southern Germans who know Yiddish actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">Well, yeah, she was a Bavarian.</span> <span id="s1857">She was a beautiful woman.</span> <span id="s1858">Her name was Lisa, well probably Elizabeth, but Lisa was her nickname.</span> <span id="s1859">Just a beautiful woman.</span> <span id="s1860">Her husband had been a soldier probably and he probably had been killed and she was probably lonely and my father had access to food and people were starving.</span> <span id="s1861">She wanted to marry him actually and he couldn't do that.</span> <span id="s1862">To live with her is one thing, to sleep with a shiksa is one thing; to marry a shiksa after you just.....I remember him saying he used to have dreams.</span> <span id="s1863">His mother would come and beat him up in his dreams.</span> <span id="s1864">The very idea that he would even think of marrying a shiksa was - a German shiksa no else.</span> <span id="s1865">Well, I mean from my grandmother's point of view a shiksa is a shiksa, it doesn't matter what kind.</span> <span id="s1866">But the fact that she was also a German shiksa didn't really help.</span> <span id="s1867">I'll show you her picture.</span> <span id="s1868">She was gorgeous, just beautiful.</span> <span id="s1869">I have this huge urge to look her up although she's probably eighty-five years old, too.</span> <span id="s1870">I mean at the end of the war how old was my father?</span> <span id="s1871">In 1947 he was forty right.</span> <span id="s1872">And she may have been ten years younger so she would only be in her mid-seventies at this time.</span> <span id="s1873">I don't know her name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">I think it would be interesting to learn something about her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">I don't know her name.</span> <span id="s1876">Her name is Lisa.</span> <span id="s1877">I don't know her last name.</span> <span id="s1878">Although actually some of my father's Lukower friends, that is the friends from the town that he met again in America, they might know her name because she lived with him.</span> <span id="s1879">All these pictures of my father and his other survivor friends in Germany after the war.</span> <span id="s1880">There she is, she's with them.</span> <span id="s1881">My father did know German though, he probably did speak to her in German.</span> <span id="s1882">Anyway, so he lived in Germany and had this job, joined the Zionist organization and stuff and then in December of 1947 he came to the United States.</span> <span id="s1883">That was right after Congress passed that emergency legislation allowing in 100,000 victims of Nazi persecution.</span> <span id="s1884">I guess because he worked for UNRRA he was able more easily than others to get an early seat in that.</span> <span id="s1885">And he came to the United States in December of 1947 leaving Lisa behind in Munich.</span> <span id="s1886">I don't think he ever had any contact with her again.</span> <span id="s1887">Maybe initially he did but not for very long.</span> <span id="s1888">He got himself a job very quickly.</span> <span id="s1889">It was the only job he ever had in America.</span> <span id="s1890">He actually lived with a Lukower.</span> <span id="s1891">He lived with Mrs. Feldman who had moved to America God knows when.</span> <span id="s1892">But her son, Muttel, who was my father's friend in Europe and had survived the war also, and was my father's friend in Germany, he lived with his mother, Mrs. Feldman.</span> <span id="s1893">Muttel came later to America, too.</span> <span id="s1894">But he lived with Mrs. Feldman.</span> <span id="s1895">He wandered around lower Manhattan looking for a job, got a job right away for a company called Civikoppen Minor[ph304] which did store fixtures, you know the furniture that's inside stores.</span> <span id="s1896">And he worked both as a carpenter - he knew how to work with wood, he owned a lumber yard, and he also was very handy, actually more than handy.</span> <span id="s1897">He was talented with his hands.</span> <span id="s1898">He could build beautiful things and so on.</span> <span id="s1899">So he got a job there, initially I guess just as a carpenter since he didn't - I don't know, whatever - but he also worked for them supervising job installations.</span> <span id="s1900">When they did Bambergers in New Jersey, he went out to Bambergers and made sure the job was done right.</span> <span id="s1901">And what he wanted more than anything was to save up enough money to open some kind of business.</span> <span id="s1902">He was an entrepreneur by nature and that's what he wanted to do.</span> <span id="s1903">He died before he could do that.</span> <span id="s1904">But that's what he wanted to do.</span> <span id="s1905">So he got a job right away, I mean he probably got a job three days - oh actually I have a funny story to tell.</span> <span id="s1906">I know you're mostly interested in the holocaust but I love this story.</span> <span id="s1907">When he came to America he was met at the boat by his aunt, Judith Marcus, Marcusfeld shortened to Marcus.</span> <span id="s1908">Actually she was an aunt-in-law.</span> <span id="s1909">She was his mother's brother's wife.</span> <span id="s1910">His mother's brother had died.</span> <span id="s1911">They had come to America probably before World War I and had shortened the name to Marcus to make it more American.</span> <span id="s1912">Anyway his uncle was dead but Judith Marcus met him at the boat and she said to him, today I'll speak to you in Yiddish, tomorrow only English.</span> <span id="s1913">You're now in America, you have to speak English.</span> <span id="s1914">Presumably he knew some English because he worked for UNRRA.</span> <span id="s1915">Today I will call you Mendel, but from now on you have to have an American name and your name is Mark.</span> <span id="s1916">She gave him a name that was common in America.</span> <span id="s1917">In 1947 Mark was a common name.</span> <span id="s1918">So in fact, when he became a citizen in 1951 he changed his name to Mark.</span> <span id="s1919">So in America he was Mark Rozenblit, although my mother called him alternate....she called him Mark most of the time, but she called him Mendel when she was being affectionate because that was his name.</span> <span id="s1920">Mendel was his name.</span> <span id="s1921">He was forty-four years old when he changed his name to Mark.</span> <span id="s1922">Although he used it, it was his American name.</span> <span id="s1923">My cousins called him Uncle Mark and my uncle called him - I mean everybody called him Mark.</span> <span id="s1924">Anyway, he came to America, was met by his aunt, he got a job, and he met my mother a year and a half later in June of 1949 and they got married in November of 1949 and they had me in October of 1950.</span> <span id="s1925">The rest is history.</span> <span id="s1926">He adjusted extremely well to America.</span> <span id="s1927">He loved America.</span> <span id="s1928">He felt utterly happy to be American.</span> <span id="s1929">He had an American wife which is unusual for survivors.</span> <span id="s1930">He didn't feel the need to be --- of course he was friends with all the people who survived from his town.</span> <span id="s1931">My mother hated them.</span> <span id="s1932">They were a bunch of people who survived from this town.</span> <span id="s1933">Actually a very large number considering how tiny the town was.</span> <span id="s1934">Virtually all of them had been in the Partisans, except for Muttel.</span> <span id="s1935">I think Muttel had been in the camps.</span> <span id="s1936">Everybody else, I forget all their names now, Frimmet.</span> <span id="s1937">God, Frimmet, Frimmet and Dave Rosen.</span> <span id="s1938">They're so unlikely to have been in the Partisans, it's amazing.</span> <span id="s1939">And Chayetta whose son looked like somebody else, not her husband.</span> <span id="s1940">There's this whole sort of crew of people that I grew up with.</span> <span id="s1941">Those people, I haven't seen them in a hundred years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">But they all ended up in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">They all ended up in New York, all the survivors.</span> <span id="s1944">There were probably eight of them; it's not like there were hundreds of them.</span> <span id="s1945">But there were some of them.</span> <span id="s1946">Some of them actually subsequently moved to Israel.</span> <span id="s1947">In the 50's and 60's they lived in America and 70's and some of them retired to Israel.</span> <span id="s1948">Well Frimmet and her husband and the Feldmans, Muttel and Fanny moved to Israel.</span> <span id="s1949">But I think Lola and her husband, I forget his name, they still live in America, in New York.</span> <span id="s1950">I mean, unless they're dead, I haven't spoken to these people in a hundred years, a hundred years, but a long time.</span> <span id="s1951">So my father adjusted very, very well to life in America.</span> <span id="s1952">He really did.</span> <span id="s1953">He didn't want to have children because he lost two.</span> <span id="s1954">He had one because he thought it wasn't fair to my mother to impose that on her but he wouldn't have any others because it was too much of a risk that you could lose your children.</span> <span id="s1955">In a way I replaced his daughter; his son he mourned for continuously.</span> <span id="s1956">He had nightmares all the time, all the time my mother said.</span> <span id="s1957">I don't remember that.</span> <span id="s1958">That was from my mother.</span> <span id="s1959">He was in his daily life in America, fine.</span> <span id="s1960">He joked and laughed and was successful.</span> <span id="s1961">I mean not successful in the huge sense but he had a job and worked and made a living and he was saving money for a business and he had an American family.</span> <span id="s1962">I remember my father being loving and warm and it was fine in his waking consciousness but of course he was racked by nightmares.</span> <span id="s1963">He missed his son profoundly.</span> <span id="s1964">He was in excruciating pain at a bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1965">He had a very hard time at bar mitzvahs because his son died just before his own.</span> <span id="s1966">The loss of his children was really unbearable to him.</span> <span id="s1967">The loss of everyone else he could handle but the loss of his children was unbearable to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">That must have been a big responsibility for you really to have that position.</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">I felt it an honor.</span> <span id="s1970">I felt very privileged.</span> <span id="s1971">I felt very special as a child.</span> <span id="s1972">I felt that I was privy, very close to this horrible thing that had happened to the Jewish people and therefore that I understood it better than others.</span> <span id="s1973">I felt honored.</span> <span id="s1974">I felt terrible for my father and the family and so forth.</span> <span id="s1975">But I felt very special.</span> <span id="s1976">I felt responsible, yes, but not in the negative sense of wishing that I didn't have a burden but in the positive sense of feeling that I had a special responsibility to bear the information and the pain of it.</span> <span id="s1977">I knew lots of other people in the same situation though because although my mother was American and therefore all the family that I had was American, that is her family, we knew a lot of survivors.</span> <span id="s1978">Both because of the Lukower, all of these people who had survived, but also because in Brooklyn in the fifties when I was growing up there were survivors.</span> <span id="s1979">There were lots of survivors.</span> <span id="s1980">I had friends whose parents were survivors.</span> <span id="s1981">Not all my friends, certainly.</span> <span id="s1982">In fact probably most of my friends didn't have survivor parents but Elaine and Esther Rosenberg's parents were survivors and whatever, I don't have to name all the names.</span> <span id="s1983">But there were plenty of other survivors around so it was not an unusual or weird thing at all.</span> <span id="s1984">But yes I did feel a responsibility, a very great responsibility, probably magnified by the fact that he died when I was ten years old.</span> <span id="s1985">I remember, my father always talked about it, I do not remember a time in my life when I did not know about the holocaust.</span> <span id="s1986">We didn't call it the holocaust, of course, we called it the war, or the camps, or the Nazis, whatever.</span> <span id="s1987">So I don't remember not knowing about it.</span> <span id="s1988">I always knew about it.</span> <span id="s1989">But I do remember the first time I saw pictures.</span> <span id="s1990">There was a series of pictures prepared by the American army for Germans so they would know how horrible the camps were.</span> <span id="s1991">And my father had a set.</span> <span id="s1992">In the back it said "Zo vais in Dachau"[ph418].</span> <span id="s1993">So it was in Dachau.</span> <span id="s1994">It was horrific pictures.</span> <span id="s1995">You know those really gross concentration camp pictures from the end of the war when things were even worse, because there were bodies lying all over the place and so forth.</span> <span id="s1996">And I remember I was eleven years old when I came across those pictures and I vomited.</span> <span id="s1997">I remember that very vividly.</span> <span id="s1998">I mean this wasn't a picture of my father, of course, my father was alive.</span> <span id="s1999">Not then, he was already dead.</span> <span id="s2000">Yeah, I felt this great responsibility because of it, absolutely.</span> <span id="s2001">Anyway what else would you like to know about the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">I think that should probably cover it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">As much as you guys need, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">Yeah.</span> <span id="s2005">If there's anything else that you feel you want to include for the sake of this interview and have it in the museum we can turn off the tape and if you think about it, you can tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">Yeah, I'm just trying to think.</span> <span id="s2007">You know of course I'm not the survivor so I can't give you the details that your survivors are giving you.</span> <span id="s2008">My father also did die when I was ten which means that I didn't get a chance to question him and whatever.</span> <span id="s2009">My cousin in Israel could only provide information about Poland before the war.</span> <span id="s2010">My mother was bad at detail.</span> <span id="s2011">So it's a hard thing.</span> <span id="s2012">Let me just think of a few other things randomly.</span> <span id="s2013">My father taught me not to hate all Germans because of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s2014">He thought the Nazis were evil but he didn't hate all Germans.</span> <span id="s2015">I mean I think the fact that he had a non_Jewish German girlfriend is a sign of that.</span> <span id="s2016">He taught me that.</span> <span id="s2017">He taught me that I had to distinguish between people.</span> <span id="s2018">Nazis were evil but not all Germans were evil.</span> <span id="s2019">I probably did get the sense that all Poles were anti-semitic in my childhood.</span> <span id="s2020">That is, I think Polish Jewry in general thought that although no, no although.</span> <span id="s2021">That was the sense I probably got.</span> <span id="s2022">I got the sense that obviously most people were killed but that those who survived did so not because they were awful people.</span> <span id="s2023">I mean there was this notion in certain circles especially in the fifties that the people who survived had been vicious and horrible and mean and had killed each other and been dog eat dog.</span> <span id="s2024">From my father I learned that you survived because you were clever.</span> <span id="s2025">You held on to the will to live so you were strong psychologically.</span> <span id="s2026">You were clever.</span> <span id="s2027">You figured things out.</span> <span id="s2028">You were lucky, gutsy.</span> <span id="s2029">That's what made you live, not being underhanded and mean but being tough and strong.</span> <span id="s2030">In fact I had a wonderful experience.</span> <span id="s2031">I went to the first international gathering of holocaust survivors in Israel in 1981 and I in fact gave a paper on it.</span> <span id="s2032">I gave a paper on teaching the holocaust at the university level.</span> <span id="s2033">But I went to not all the sessions but many of the sessions.</span> <span id="s2034">I went to the final session which was held at the kotel, at the wall, when there were speeches.</span> <span id="s2035">Menachem Begin spoke and Teddy Kollack spoke, everybody spoke, millions of speakers, all in English, really weird.</span> <span id="s2036">But anyway English was the common language because there were French survivors and whatever.</span> <span id="s2037">Anyway so I went to it and it got real cold.</span> <span id="s2038">It was at night in Jerusalem in the summer and I was wearing a jacket and I was feeling very cold.</span> <span id="s2039">Begin, maybe he wasn't the very last speaker, but he was one of the last speakers and he was going on and on endlessly.</span> <span id="s2040">Everybody else had spoken for two minutes because there were hundreds of speakers.</span> <span id="s2041">He was going on.</span> <span id="s2042">He was already prime minister.</span> <span id="s2043">He was going on and on and he was really being nasty.</span> <span id="s2044">He was exhorting the crowd that if they didn't live in Israel they were traitors to the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s2045">It was a really not nice, disgusting speech.</span> <span id="s2046">Half the crowd started to leave.</span> <span id="s2047">They just started to leave.</span> <span id="s2048">They picked themselves up and they walked.</span> <span id="s2049">My American side, that is my Protestant side, I mean I'm not a Protestant but you know what I mean, the American side that you just stand on line whatever, was appalled that they would do that.</span> <span id="s2050">Because, after all, even you hate him, even if you think he's saying awful things, and I certainly don't agree with Menachem Begin politically and I thought what he was saying was awful.</span> <span id="s2051">But still he's the Prime Minister of a country.</span> <span id="s2052">You don't get up and leave in the middle of his speech.</span> <span id="s2053">It's just not nice even if you're cold and even if you're unhappy you don't do it.</span> <span id="s2054">And so I was really annoyed.</span> <span id="s2055">My sort of American side that hates when people cheat on line was getting very angry.</span> <span id="s2056">And then all of a sudden like I had this revelation, wait a second, that's why they survived.</span> <span id="s2057">They just do what seems to them the right thing to do.</span> <span id="s2058">And then I loved them because I remembered all these survivors from my childhood.</span> <span id="s2059">My father's dead for a long time and I've moved away from that world and I just loved them and I wanted to kiss all of them.</span> <span id="s2060">I didn't leave because I'm not them.</span> <span id="s2061">But they left because that's why they not only survived but they also succeeded after the war in returning to normal life.</span> <span id="s2062">The vast majority of the survivors are normal, functioning human beings.</span> <span id="s2063">Even if they're a bit neurotic, even if they scream a little too much, even if they have more fears than your average person, even if they are way more over-protective of their children than your average person, even all of those things and even if their children say oh my parents were such crazy people, they are functioning human beings, they are not lunatics.</span> <span id="s2064">And the ones who are were lunatics anyway.</span> <span id="s2065">The ones who are were lunatics before the war.</span> <span id="s2066">This had a searing and traumatic and devastating effect on them but they function as human beings, successful ones for the most part.</span> <span id="s2067">There are lots of successful business people, successful professionals.</span> <span id="s2068">All the survivors I know as children all of them made it.</span> <span id="s2069">Even if they were just laborers, they still went to work in the morning and they still provided for their families.</span> <span id="s2070">They were fine, they were really fine; crazy but crazy in a way that's understandable.</span> <span id="s2071">But anyway so I love them all because they are what they are.</span> <span id="s2072">They survived because they have the courage to do what feels right at the moment instinctively.</span> <span id="s2073">I don't know if there's anything else I can say at all.</span> <span id="s2074">This is not about my father's American experience and that's of course what I'm most familiar with.</span> <span id="s2075">He had a good one.</span> <span id="s2076">He spoke English all the time to my mother.</span> <span id="s2077">They spoke Yiddish when they didn't want me to understand which was enough so that I did understand Yiddish.</span> <span id="s2078">He was fiercely proud of being Jewish even if he wouldn't fast on Yom Kippur because he didn't believe in God anymore and he'd gone hungry long enough.</span> <span id="s2079">But I didn't know he didn't fast on Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s2080">He didn't want me to know that because....I mean I'm sure he would have told me if I was older, but I was little.</span> <span id="s2081">I think that's all I have to say, at least now.</span> <span id="s2082">If I think of something in the next ten minutes we can always add it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">Okay.</span> <span id="s2084">I want to thank you very much for your time and for this interesting story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">You're welcome, you're welcome.</span> <span id="s2086">Let me add just one last thing.</span> <span id="s2087">I know this is not going to go into the cards that you're doing but somehow the transcripts of these will be saved.</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">Yes they will.</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">So I'll just say it.</span> <span id="s2090">My son is named for my father.</span> <span id="s2091">I'm named for my father's mother and he's named for my father.</span> <span id="s2092">And so therefore we have Masha and a Mark and a Marsha and a Mark and it's very nice.</span> <span id="s2093">And he really feels connected to my father and to the holocaust.</span> <span id="s2094">He has also always known about it and you asked me if I feel a sense of responsibility and I do.</span> <span id="s2095">I feel it both in my professional life and in my personal life.</span> <span id="s2096">And I'm very pleased that I was able to tell my son about the holocaust in a way like I learned about it, in a very personal way, in a way that emphasizes the goodness in all human beings but it also emphasizes that we should be careful about the evil that human beings are capable of and I feel that as a child of a holocaust survivor that I have a moral obligation to purvey they meaning of the holocaust to the next generation and I'm glad I was able to do it with my own son.</span> <span id="s2097">A lot of children of holocaust survivors are worried how they will do it and I think it can be done easily, so thank you for interviewing me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">I have one more thing to add, I just remembered.</span> <span id="s2100">When the Nazis occupied Poland in 1939, my father's wife said to him, escape to the Russian zone, you can do that for a couple of months in September, October, November of 1939; you go escape.</span> <span id="s2101">After all the Germans won't hurt women and children but they might hurt men.</span> <span id="s2102">And my father said well it's true the Germans certainly won't hurt women and children because after all his memories, like most Polish Jews, his memories of World War I, were that the Russians were the horrible creeps but when the German army came and occupied Poland the situation of the Jews improved.</span> <span id="s2103">The Germans were civilized and nice and so forth.</span> <span id="s2104">So he had a sense that the Germans wouldn't be so bad but he didn't want to go to the east because he thought that the Russians would be very barbaric and he didn't want to go to the east.</span> <span id="s2105">He said the Germans are more civilized than the Russians.</span> <span id="s2106">I will take my chances with the Germans and I don't want to leave my family alone and so forth.</span> <span id="s2107">So the image of the German was this positive one which of course worked to the detriment of lots of Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s2108">That's all I wanted to add.</span> <span id="s2109">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">Thanks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">You're welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">My father understood that Hitler was a maniac and that the Nazis were evil and that they were doing terrible things to the Jews.</span> <span id="s2113">He understood that.</span> <span id="s2114">He just thought that ultimately German decency would prevail whereas the Russians were absolutely repulsive and that it was at best to stay at home with family and take one's chances with these Germans than go off to Russia.</span> <span id="s2115">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">whole world.</span> <span id="s2117">I just found out, after the liberation, that the whole world stood idly by and watched the annihilation of the Jewish people, men, women and child, concentration camps, gas chambers, wagons with gas and no one lifted a finger or a warning, even, to the Germans, to stop the killing.</span> <span id="s2118">So in 1940, I believe it was, my entire family along with the rest of the town Jewry were corralled into a ghetto.</span> <span id="s2119">In 1941, I believe it was in the summer, I, together with many other young Jews were taken out of the ghetto and deported to the slave labor camp near Poznan.</span> <span id="s2120">The name of the camp was Buchvardelfost (ph)(c.56).</span> <span id="s2121">In the interim, my entire family along with the rest of the Praszka Jewish ghetto were driven to their execution.</span> <span id="s2122">All of them perished at the hand of the German tormentors in the death camps of Hamunull (ph)(53).</span> <span id="s2123">After working in B_____, preparing the Reichousband (c.55), we called at that time, it mean the super-highway for the Germans, working there almost two years.</span> <span id="s2124">Then I was transferred to different labor-torture camps in Germany.</span> <span id="s2125">Finally it was now 1943, I was brought to the frightening extermination camp of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2126">There I was robbed of my name, my existence as a Jew and a human being ceased.</span> <span id="s2127">I became number 141938 which was brutally burned into my arm and is still visible today.</span> <span id="s2128">I became one of the damned and stampeded Jews whose only path led to the crematorium and gas chamber.</span> <span id="s2129">I can still see and feel the many chimneys of the camp belching forth the heavy dark smoke.</span> <span id="s2130">A stink so old and permeating that it pursues me to this very day and is still too agonizing to recall.</span> <span id="s2131">After a few months in confinement, in Auschwitz with the threat of death hanging over my head every day, whether it was by the cruel beatings, hard labor, I was suddenly transferred to another slave-labor in the concentration camp of Lagisza.</span></p> <p><span id="s2132">Where is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">Lagisza was six kilometers before Benjun (c.82) where we built for the Germans, electricity station.</span> <span id="s2134">As was the case with most of the Jews and under this circumstances, we experienced unbearable pain because of hunger, suffering, and degredation and hard work.</span> <span id="s2135">Just to describe to you one day of food in a camp where we worked from six in the morning to six in the evening.</span> <span id="s2136">When you received going out to work in the morning, a black coffee, so-called coffee and with this you had to go out to work.</span> <span id="s2137">In the afternoon, during lunch, we supposed to have gotten a soup and it was many days where it did not reach us.</span> <span id="s2138">Whether it was spilled during the way by other prisoners carrying it or it was available.</span> <span id="s2139">We came home from work, we received one piece of bread.</span> <span id="s2140">I would say in the size of the--today two slices of bread and again a soup.</span> <span id="s2141">It was the hardest decision of my life, what to eat first.</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">Why is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">It was, if you will eat up the soup with the bread, you have nothing in the morning--for the morning when you go out to work left over.</span> <span id="s2144">So most of us, most of the concentration camp inmates, were trying to ration ourselves.</span> <span id="s2145">We ate the little soup at night and we tried, we tried to hold on to this piece of bread until the morning to have it with the coffee.</span> <span id="s2146">But hunger, the hunger was stronger than the resistance not to eat.</span> <span id="s2147">So you started to nibble a piece now, put it in your pocket, didn't last, the hunger was so great.</span> <span id="s2148">I think this is the greatest pain that a human can have, this hunger pain.</span> <span id="s2149">So you take another out another piece and you nibble again until you nibble and you nibble till you have nothing left no more.</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">Were you ever able to --?</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">And at night, you feel guilty again that you ate it cause you're not going to have it in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">Were you ever able to preserve it until the morning, yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">Very seldom, very seldom.</span> <span id="s2154">It was only through certain circumstances when I got a little extra that I could preserve a piece for the morning.</span> <span id="s2155">This is another story by itself.</span> <span id="s2156">When, under what circumstances, sometimes a person got a little extra food, something to eat.</span> <span id="s2157">This was, I think, looking back in retrospect, decisions what we making today in life, is nothing compared to the decision when to eat a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s2158">It seems I left it like this in this camp till 1944.</span> <span id="s2159">In 1945, from 1945 to January, 19--, no from 1944 also, in September till January '45, I was sent to another camp by the name of Yavozna.</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">Are you able to spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">Yeah, V_____, yeah.</span> <span id="s2162">The name of the camp, how did they spell it?</span> <span id="s2163">Y-a-v-o-z-h-n-a.</span> <span id="s2164">Some of the people were working there in the coal mines.</span> <span id="s2165">I managed to work again on the outside, again at another electrical company.</span> <span id="s2166">Another company that _____(150) for electricity.</span> <span id="s2167">Because I had already experience in that work, therefore they choose me to go there.</span> <span id="s2168">My second thought was, I was afraid to go down in the coal mines where I never will come up again.</span> <span id="s2169">This was always in my mind.</span> <span id="s2170">If I go down there, I'll never come up again.</span> <span id="s2171">I will starve or be buried alive.</span> <span id="s2172">It was till 1945, January, about the 18th, 17th of January where we already knew that the Russian front is approaching closer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">You could hear bombing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">We could hear.</span> <span id="s2175">We already found those at Cracow was already _____(c.161) and this was only sixty miles away from Cracow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">This was relatively close to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">Yeah, this was close to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2178">Was also affiliated from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2179">Auschwitz by itself had many camps which were affiliated to Auschwitz because they needed slave labor outside of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2180">The day before, I would say one day before the liberation of this camp, they managed, they managed us; thousands were driven out from the camp by our so-called tormentors.</span> <span id="s2181">I never ending that much from Poland to the vicinity of Salesea (c.171) to lower Germany, into Germany again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">Lievich?</span> <span id="s2183">(c.171) Lievich, that's right.</span> <span id="s2184">On the way, many of my friends collapsed and died of hunger, illness, cold weather, simply exhaustion; they couldn't go anymore.</span> <span id="s2185">Those who could not continue on this inhuman march, were shot dead by the Germans immediately.</span> <span id="s2186">I still cannot understand my endurance, the strength to survive it all where my only food was snow on the ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">Had they given you a ration before you left the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s2188">Yes.</span> <span id="s2189">They give us a ration before we left the camp but it lasted also for this one night.</span> <span id="s2190">Then we were sleeping outside on the outer fields and our food was only snow.</span> <span id="s2191">Someone found something beneath the snow, grass or something.</span> <span id="s2192">One night, in the beginning of February, this was January, 1945, when we reached the area of Lievich, Germany, again we were packed into a huge barn, like cattle ready for slaughter.</span> <span id="s2193">It seemed that time that the murderers were about to kill all of us wretched, powerless and defenseless victims.</span> <span id="s2194">I was not mistaken in my assumption.</span> <span id="s2195">That night, one of those night I, Irving Balsam, decided to risk an escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">Alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">No, I did escape with another inmate which we helped together.</span> <span id="s2198">In camp, in concentration camp, everyone had a buddy.</span> <span id="s2199">You could not survive alone.</span> <span id="s2200">You had to have a buddy, a friend, a brother, we call them a brother, a buddy.</span> <span id="s2201">I also had a buddy, a young boy who was the same age that I was.</span> <span id="s2202">We kept to ourselves since Lagisza together.</span> <span id="s2203">I felt that time I couldn't stand the cold weather, the beating on the way, the shooting of those who could not walk any longer.</span> <span id="s2204">I felt I had nothing to lose.</span> <span id="s2205">On that bitterly cold night, I and my buddy Henry, a young Jew, Henry Margolis was his name, a young Jew from Kalisz, also a little town in Poland, we fled the barn.</span> <span id="s2206">We didn't flee the barn at first.</span> <span id="s2207">We first hid ourselves underneath the straw.</span> <span id="s2208">We hid ourselves in the machine which was made the--from the wheat corns, cleaned the wheat, the corns, from the leaves.</span> <span id="s2209">They used to call it a thrash machine.</span> <span id="s2210">A thrash machine, you know, you have those machine where they farm.</span> <span id="s2211">First we hid ourselves underneath the straw.</span> <span id="s2212">It's on?</span> <span id="s2213">As we lay there in this machine inside, we found a lot of corn to eat, the little corn.</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">From the wheat?</span></p> <p><span id="s2215">From the wheat, that's right.</span> <span id="s2216">This corn kept us there one day and one night.</span> <span id="s2217">But the cold, it was in January, in February and this cold in Germany there is very--the weather is cold, probably below 20 degrees or something.</span> <span id="s2218">We couldn't stand no more this bitter cold.</span> <span id="s2219">We felt that our feet are freezing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2220">How many people were in that barn?</span> <span id="s2221">Hundreds or--?</span></p> <p><span id="s2222">The people were--by hundreds of people.</span> <span id="s2223">A lot of them were hiding but most of them were caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s2224">Hiding in various places in this barn?</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">Various places of this barn.</span> <span id="s2226">Most of them were caught.</span> <span id="s2227">It seems that our hiding place was the best, was the best.</span> <span id="s2228">As we laid there in the barn, the cold permeated our very marrow of our feet.</span> <span id="s2229">It was cold, we felt we were going to be frostbitten which is worse, the beginning already of frostbite in our legs.</span> <span id="s2230">We--later in the morning, we heard a voice in the barn.</span> <span id="s2231">We heard a voice speaking to the chickens.</span> <span id="s2232">It was a farmer boy who happened to be Polish- speaking so he spoke in Polish words, we recognized him, to the chickens that they should gather together, he brought them food.</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">Were the other prisoners still in the barn at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">Was no more in the barn?</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">The barn had been evacuated?</span></p> <p><span id="s2236">The barn had been evacuated and the further marched.</span> <span id="s2237">The further marched and we were left alone.</span> <span id="s2238">While we met this man, we spoke to him in Polish.</span> <span id="s2239">We told him that we are hungry.</span> <span id="s2240">We would like also, if it is possible, to bring us some food.</span> <span id="s2241">To which he agreed.</span> <span id="s2242">You cannot imagine our--not satisfaction--our hope that we thought here we finally find somebody speaks Polish, we are Polish.</span> <span id="s2243">He probably recognized that we are Jews and we told him and he agreed to bring us some food.</span></p> <p><span id="s2244">Was he a boy younger than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">He was about--we the same age--about 17, 18 years old at that time.</span> <span id="s2246">When he agreed, I hoped that time we will outlast this nightmare of the war.</span> <span id="s2247">It seemed almost at the end.</span> <span id="s2248">However, it seems that Jewish survival in those awful days was not easy, not even in the best of shelters.</span> <span id="s2249">After a short wait our benefactor, instead of delivering the sorely needed substance, returned with Gestapo men who immediately arrested us and threw us back into the prison of Glewitz (c.288).</span> <span id="s2250">While the others marched on, I'm sure to further extermination or to their deaths.</span> <span id="s2251">When we came to jail, we found about sixty more completely miserable, ill Jews, all of them captured escaped from the death march.</span> <span id="s2252">It seems that a lot of them also ran away from the death march and were hiding in different places.</span> <span id="s2253">Before long, the Germans had driven most of us captives into the prison yard, forty of them were shot to death immediately.</span> <span id="s2254">Immediately after that, the German assassins ordered us, the remaining 20 Jews to pile the murdered victims--some dead and others still half alive, you can imagine that not everyone was shot to death, some of them were alive--into a huge wagon which they all had prepared.</span></p> <p><span id="s2255">This was a train car?</span></p> <p><span id="s2256">No, was a horse and a buggy but horse-wagon without horse.</span> <span id="s2257">We had to harness ourselves to the wagon and drag the vehicle to an old Jewish cemetery on the outskirt of Gl_____(c.314) Were you amongst those having to pull?</span></p> <p><span id="s2258">Yes.</span> <span id="s2259">I was amongst them having to pull.</span></p> <p><span id="s2260">How many of you were pulling, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s2261">All 20 of us went with this.</span> <span id="s2262">We were pulling and pushing this wagon with the dead bodies.</span> <span id="s2263">The trip to this burial place accompanied by savage blows and curses from the cold-blooded henchmen, was an experience, deeply shattered experience which I--it's agonizing to this day, even to the thought.</span> <span id="s2264">Whenever I tell this story, it is--it takes off years of my life because we thought that time will heal but--.</span> <span id="s2265">.</span> <span id="s2266">When we reached the cemetery, we saw two open mass graves.</span></p> <p><span id="s2267">Was this a real, an established cemetery?</span></p> <p><span id="s2268">Yes, was established, old cemetery.</span> <span id="s2269">I found it after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2270">Was it a Jewish cemetery or--?</span></p> <p><span id="s2271">A Jewish cemetery in Germany.</span> <span id="s2272">The Germans on the German territory, did not, did not vandalize the cemeteries, the old German cemeteries.</span> <span id="s2273">Only in Poland they did it.</span> <span id="s2274">But the Germans had Jewish cemeteries.</span> <span id="s2275">I went to look up this cemetery in 1979.</span> <span id="s2276">I went to Germany on a trial, testifying against the Nazis.</span> <span id="s2277">When we came to this cemetery, we saw two mass graves.</span> <span id="s2278">It immediately dawned on me, after all I had four years experience with the Germany, I know already their thinking about us.</span> <span id="s2279">They treating--the way they were treating us--as sub-humans that in one of the graves was for the other Jews which they were shot before.</span> <span id="s2280">The other is for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">Was your friend Henry still alive with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">Yes, my friend Henry was alive.</span> <span id="s2283">It was clear to us and to me and we were talking among ourselves that we would be the next.</span> <span id="s2284">I was not at least mistaken in the assumption.</span> <span id="s2285">As soon as we---already slowed the Jews where they were disposed into the mass grave, the German criminals resumed the shooting and immediately the dead, dying, half-alive, and heavily wounded began falling into the second grave.</span> <span id="s2286">The full cemetery, the area there was saturated with the blood of our victims, with my friends, with my people what we were together in camps.</span> <span id="s2287">For the time, we had piercing screams, heart-rendering moans and pained _____(374) for help.</span> <span id="s2288">Even my friend Henry fell into the mass grave and he was not shot.</span> <span id="s2289">I heard him scream out, out, out.</span> <span id="s2290">Suddenly, a dead silence enveloped the entire cemetery.</span> <span id="s2291">I was among the unfortunate Jews in the second mass grave.</span> <span id="s2292">As the stillness continues, the German henchmen yelled into the grave.</span> <span id="s2293">I can tell you in German what they said.</span> <span id="s2294">Bist du___(c.387), anybody alive, __________, come out.</span> <span id="s2295">Anybody alive, come out.</span> <span id="s2296">Anyone still alive, come right out.</span> <span id="s2297">I and four more Jews, who escaped the assassin's bullet, crept out and were ordered to cover the horror of the gasping hole containing the dead and the near-dead Jews.</span> <span id="s2298">How did we manage to come out without any bullet?</span> <span id="s2299">When you dig a grave, you have sand from the grave, right?</span> <span id="s2300">The sand creates a mound of other sand.</span> <span id="s2301">When they aimed their machine gun and their pistols into the grave, they stood on this mound of sand.</span> <span id="s2302">We, five boys who were laying on this side of the grave, this side the bullets did not reach us because they were going over us.</span> <span id="s2303">So all of us who were laying on the side of the wall, on this one side of the wall, did not get any bullets.</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">So they had forced you into the grave first?</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">That's right.</span> <span id="s2306">First they started shouting.</span> <span id="s2307">Then they said, jump in.</span> <span id="s2308">So we all jumped in, we had no choice.</span> <span id="s2309">We did that under the threat of the Nazi guns pointing at us, we came out.</span> <span id="s2310">When the gristly crime finally, was finally out of sight, the executioner shot two more of our small group and then aimed their guns at me and the remaining two Jews.</span> <span id="s2311">Miraculously, their guns did not discharge because there were no more bullets left in them.</span> <span id="s2312">Was everything used up, they kept on shooting into the mass grave.</span></p> <p><span id="s2313">They aimed the machine guns at you again?</span></p> <p><span id="s2314">They didn't have no more bullets in the machine guns.</span> <span id="s2315">They only have side pistols.</span> <span id="s2316">When we all five came out, they used the rest bullets on the other two.</span> <span id="s2317">When they aimed the gun at me, no more bullets.</span> <span id="s2318">A man, an older man who had on one hand, one arm, he must have been maybe from the first World War, a veteran or something, he still had his gun in his holster.</span> <span id="s2319">When the other Gestapo men ask him, Hans Hans, give me dine browling (444).</span> <span id="s2320">That means Hans, give my dine pistol to finish them off.</span> <span id="s2321">This older man refused to give the pistol.</span> <span id="s2322">He said for dezen younga (449), for these young men, I don't give a pistol.</span> <span id="s2323">They left him alone.</span> <span id="s2324">I could say that's why, probably I am alive today, to tell the story.</span> <span id="s2325">After we were finished, we were commanded to harness ourselves to the wagon which transported its ill-fated load to the cemetery and the hairy guard, again with the--four of them, German, SS men and soldiers together, were driven back to this Gl___ Prison where we were locked in for three more days.</span> <span id="s2326">It seemed that time to me, like an eternity.</span></p> <p><span id="s2327">How many days total were you in prison?</span></p> <p><span id="s2328">Maybe, two weeks.</span> <span id="s2329">Fate, however, saved us once more from the clutch of death.</span> <span id="s2330">After the three days confinement in the Gl___ prison, I was taken out of jail and I was certain I'm being led to the execution again.</span> <span id="s2331">Instead we were transferred to the railroad station and transferred on the cattle wagons to another concentration camp in Austria by the name of Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s2332">After being in Mauthausen a few days, I was again sent on a commando to Koozen (c.493).</span> <span id="s2333">It was a camp, Koozen #2 where we worked on Messerschmidt, airplanes for the German army.</span> <span id="s2334">I can't recall how many days, how many times.</span> <span id="s2335">It was absolutely, completely no food at all.</span> <span id="s2336">One soup with a little green stuff swimming around in the soup, I don't know what it was, was food for a whole day.</span> <span id="s2337">For this we worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s2338">You worked in the airplane factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s2339">Yeah.</span> <span id="s2340">The airplane parts factory was in the mountains, inside, in mountains.</span> <span id="s2341">They should not--they were hidden from the attacks of the Allied airplanes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2342">Did you have a specific job each day?</span></p> <p><span id="s2343">Yeah, we would tighten the screws.</span> <span id="s2344">We mounted screws and we put on wheels.</span> <span id="s2345">It seems they didn't have no more motors for the airplanes.</span> <span id="s2346">There were tens, twenties, maybe hundreds of airplanes that were ready to be shipped but they didn't get--have the motors for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2347">Everything else was finished on them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2348">Everything was finished, just the motors they didn't have.</span> <span id="s2349">They never arrived because I think the Allies bombarded the factories with motors.</span></p> <p><span id="s2350">Do you remember them ever threatening you about attempting to sabotage an airplane?</span></p> <p><span id="s2351">No.</span> <span id="s2352">They didn't threaten us.</span> <span id="s2353">It was a known fact because every where you went.</span> <span id="s2354">There were signs, sabotage, dein tod, (517), if you sabotage, you'll be killed.</span> <span id="s2355">Everybody was very careful to do what you could precisely.</span> <span id="s2356">After being in V_____(c.528) for, I would say, some days, this was the last camp, not to exterminate us but to starve us to death.</span></p> <p><span id="s2357">Not Goozen (c.528)?</span></p> <p><span id="s2358">Not Goozen, taken out from Goozen, they took us again on a march to another town in Austria what's the name, near Veldts (c.538), in the forest was a camp by the name of Gunkerin ______(c.535) which there were only two barracks and 20,000 people.</span> <span id="s2359">How can you fit in 20,000 people in two barracks which can only hold maybe 500?</span></p> <p><span id="s2360">I've read that many were crushed to death in the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2361">That's right.</span> <span id="s2362">The people were crushed to death.</span> <span id="s2363">In the morning when you got up in the morning, you thought you sleeping with somebody and in the meantime the other guy was already dead.</span> <span id="s2364">You slept among bodies, sickness, typhus, dysentery, everything was going on.</span> <span id="s2365">And the rain did not stop.</span> <span id="s2366">The forest was full of rain, day out and day in for the last ten days, there was nothing but rain.</span> <span id="s2367">If we got already, one can of soup for a hundred people, there was specially a camp to starve us.</span> <span id="s2368">The soup never reached the people because the hunger was so great--the hunger was so great from the people that they became inhuman.</span> <span id="s2369">They attacked the can of soup and spilled it on the floor.</span> <span id="s2370">They were eating from the floor with the mud, with every dirty thing in the rain.</span></p> <p><span id="s2371">Let me switch the tape.</span> <span id="s2372">(Side B, Tape 1) Had the war lasted, I mean had the American army not reached us on May 5, 1945, if this would have lasted another week, none of us would have been alive today from that particular camp.</span> <span id="s2373">We were liberated May 5 by the American army.</span></p> <p><span id="s2374">Do you remember when the SS left?</span></p> <p><span id="s2375">Yes.</span> <span id="s2376">Friday evening.</span> <span id="s2377">I remember May was on a Saturday and Friday evening, all of a sudden we saw that the watch booth from the watchmen from the SS men from the Germans getting emptied out.</span> <span id="s2378">They're running away.</span> <span id="s2379">We did not know the reason because we were inside deep in the forest.</span> <span id="s2380">However, many boys who had still the strength to go out and investigate what happening had noticed tanks with the star.</span> <span id="s2381">We didn't know that time what tanks it was, whether it was Russian tanks, American tanks.</span> <span id="s2382">We know only that--tanks.</span> <span id="s2383">It seems that the same night, the American army passed--,liberated us.</span> <span id="s2384">The night of May 4 and May 5.</span> <span id="s2385">All of a sudden, the day of May 5, we were sitting in the forest and the sun started to shine.</span> <span id="s2386">Every one of us was full with lice, bitten, wet clothes.</span> <span id="s2387">So we started to remove our clothing and shake it out from the lice.</span> <span id="s2388">It seems that it didn't help much.</span> <span id="s2389">After we found out a few days later, we were all infected t with typhus.</span> <span id="s2390">When the American army rounded us up and put us into field hospitals--they created special hospitals for us, the ill survivors.</span> <span id="s2391">Many hundreds died after the liberation from the sickness.</span> <span id="s2392">Was too late for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">Was your friend Henry still alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s2394">I am the lucky one who survived.</span> <span id="s2395">My wife too in the same camp.</span> <span id="s2396">Who is alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s2397">Henry.</span></p> <p><span id="s2398">No he was shot that time in the grave.</span></p> <p><span id="s2399">Oh, he was shot, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2400">I lost my friend Henry.</span> <span id="s2401">He got down among the second batch, He was separate.</span> <span id="s2402">After the war--from there we stood--we were liberated=--we were in the hospital for many weeks where I met my wife, at that time a young girl.</span> <span id="s2403">weighing maybe sixty pounds, fifty pounds.</span> <span id="s2404">We comfort each other since that day.</span> <span id="s2405">We remained.</span> <span id="s2406">We were in the DP camp, displaced persons camp in Austria until about 1948, until we could reach the shores of the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s2407">Which DP camp were you in?</span></p> <p><span id="s2408">In Austria, in Links (9).</span> <span id="s2409">Vien______.</span> <span id="s2410">Ever heard about that?</span> <span id="s2411">We reached there because we had family in the United States.</span> <span id="s2412">We reached the shores of the United States.</span> <span id="s2413">We established our lives again here.</span> <span id="s2414">We came to this country, we had a small child, one year old.</span> <span id="s2415">That's the best we had.</span> <span id="s2416">We kept on going and hoping.</span> <span id="s2417">I think that's what sustained us.</span> <span id="s2418">We're still hoping up till today, maybe someone is still alive, some other place which we don't know; I didn't believe that my parents are not--no more alive.</span> <span id="s2419">I didn't believe that my brothers and sister are not alive no more.</span> <span id="s2420">I guess the ____of every survivor.</span> <span id="s2421">And this is what sustained us in camp.</span> <span id="s2422">Had I known that no one is alive from my family, I probably wouldn't have fought to live.</span> <span id="s2423">But this was one thing we were hoping that somebody is alive and that it pays to live to tell the story.</span> <span id="s2424">Because my father told me when I was taken to the first camp, that he blessed me.</span> <span id="s2425">I was the first one to leave my house to be taken to camp.</span> <span id="s2426">He says go ahead my son.</span> <span id="s2427">When you come back, you tell me the story.</span> <span id="s2428">He told me I should tell him the story and that was in my mind.</span> <span id="s2429">To die now, what would I tell my father?</span> <span id="s2430">I had nothing to tell him.</span> <span id="s2431">Nobody would tell him the story, That's what I'm thinking.</span> <span id="s2432">That's why I call myself a survivor.</span> <span id="s2433">What else can I tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2434">When did you come to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s2435">In 1948, December, 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s2436">I see.</span> <span id="s2437">You came --.</span></p> <p><span id="s2438">I established myself.</span> <span id="s2439">I came here to the Bronx.</span> <span id="s2440">I came to the Bronx, I remained in the Bronx.</span> <span id="s2441">a loyal citizen of the Bronx.</span> <span id="s2442">I must say my life was not bad in the United States.</span> <span id="s2443">I succeeded in business and have a nice family, three children, grandchildren.</span> <span id="s2444">We are close, close-knit family.</span> <span id="s2445">If someone is alive, I doubt it.</span> <span id="s2446">It's too late already.</span> <span id="s2447">It's today, 47 years after the war.</span> <span id="s2448">I'm very involved now in the survivors' movement.</span> <span id="s2449">I am the president of the Riverdale chapter of the Holocaust Survivors.</span> <span id="s2450">You heard of them.</span> <span id="s2451">We have two hundred families as members.</span> <span id="s2452">We are having meetings practically very month with our aim is to teach, to teach the next generation, to sensitize the community, to transmit to our children and to help others.</span> <span id="s2453">We have a very good outreach program.</span> <span id="s2454">If a survivor is in need, we do help.</span> <span id="s2455">Therefore, I think I have a mission in life.</span> <span id="s2456">I am fulfilling this mission, to tell the story.</span> <span id="s2457">Anything else you want to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2458">I'd like to get a little more detail if that's possible.</span> <span id="s2459">I like to get some information about your life before the war.</span> <span id="s2460">About your family, where you lived, what your father did for a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s2461">As I mentioned before, I was not quite 15 when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s2462">I was born in 1924.</span> <span id="s2463">The war started in 1939.</span> <span id="s2464">A month before my birthday, my 15th birthday.</span> <span id="s2465">I came from a family of very--a religious family.</span></p> <p><span id="s2466">Hasid or--?</span></p> <p><span id="s2467">No, my father was not a Hasid.</span> <span id="s2468">Observant, religious family.</span> <span id="s2469">Wore a hat and a short, short little beard, modern.</span> <span id="s2470">Today we would call it modern orthodox, modern orthodox.</span> <span id="s2471">We were--we come not from a rich family.</span> <span id="s2472">My father was a tailor.</span> <span id="s2473">He struggled for a living most of his life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2474">He was an independent tailor?</span></p> <p><span id="s2475">Independent tailor, that's right.</span> <span id="s2476">I mean, he worked for others.</span> <span id="s2477">They brought him work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2478">Did he work out of your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s2479">Of the home, yeah.</span> <span id="s2480">He worked at home.</span> <span id="s2481">He had a machine in his house and all ______160) was necessary to do his job.</span> <span id="s2482">Our life was not easy because he only had, as I remember, as far as I can remember from home--.</span> <span id="s2483">A person can only remember the last few years, right?</span> <span id="s2484">between 10 and 15 years.</span> <span id="s2485">He can't remember before.</span> <span id="s2486">He worked only six months a year.</span> <span id="s2487">The last six months we were already bad off.</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">Why was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2489">Because we lived in a small town.</span> <span id="s2490">It was a lot of people, Jewish people, in the same situation.</span> <span id="s2491">Were a lot of tailors and carpenters and all, was not steady work.</span> <span id="s2492">When he worked six months a year, we had to--the other six months was struggling.</span> <span id="s2493">Here and there some work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2494">What was the mainstay of--?</span></p> <p><span id="s2495">Was not easy for us to even have enough for food in the family, sometimes as I can recall.</span> <span id="s2496">But in 1938, life started to get a little bit easier already, before the war.</span> <span id="s2497">Because I had an older brother who was 18 years old and he was already employed as an electrician in the city of Lodz and he helped out already with some, what do you call it, he sent some money home, helped out the rest of the family.</span> <span id="s2498">So it was a little better.</span> <span id="s2499">Then I joined in, as a fourteen year old boy, also left for Lodz, to study.</span></p> <p><span id="s2500">What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s2501">My intention was to study.</span></p> <p><span id="s2502">You went to a gymnasium there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2503">Yeah, I wanted--my intention was to study in gymnasium and to learn a profession.</span> <span id="s2504">But it was not easy because I didn't have the means--</span></p> <p><span id="s2505">Financial means?</span></p> <p><span id="s2506">the financial means to remain in this big town.</span></p> <p><span id="s2507">Were you staying with your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s2508">I was staying with my brother as far as he could, he helped me.</span> <span id="s2509">We slept together, we ate together.</span> <span id="s2510">But I still needed more financial means.</span> <span id="s2511">I went to work also as a shipping boy.</span> <span id="s2512">Both of us already made sure that we supplied my parents, my father and mother with the other two siblings home with money.</span></p> <p><span id="s2513">Were you two the oldest?</span></p> <p><span id="s2514">We were the oldest.</span> <span id="s2515">We used to send them home some money that their life should be a little easier.</span></p> <p><span id="s2516">So you worked and you were going to school at the same time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2517">No.</span> <span id="s2518">I could not.</span> <span id="s2519">I was thinking, I was working--.</span> <span id="s2520">No, I would intend to go to school because I registered for the next year's semester.</span></p> <p><span id="s2521">So you were going to work a year?</span></p> <p><span id="s2522">That's right.</span> <span id="s2523">The rest of the semester and then the war broke out and it came near the border and it never happened again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2524">Was this a Jewish gymnasium?</span></p> <p><span id="s2525">No, it was not--I don't think it was.</span> <span id="s2526">It was a Polish technological school, like you learned a trade.</span></p> <p><span id="s2527">What was your goal?</span></p> <p><span id="s2528">My goal was to learn a, how you call this in English?</span> <span id="s2529">I had two goals.</span> <span id="s2530">I couldn't get into one because first I wanted to be a locksmith mechanic, ____ (174) locksmith and if not, I wanted to say--my second choice would be a teeth mechanic.</span></p> <p><span id="s2531">A dentist or--?</span></p> <p><span id="s2532">Not a dentist.</span> <span id="s2533">Just to make the teeth.</span></p> <p><span id="s2534">Oh, to produce false teeth or--?</span></p> <p><span id="s2535">Yeah, how do you call it, yeah a producer of teeth.</span> <span id="s2536">You know, something like this.</span> <span id="s2537">Teeth mechanic, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2538">I guess after watching your father struggle, you weren't about to become a tailor?</span></p> <p><span id="s2539">No, my father would not let us become a --.</span></p> <p><span id="s2540">Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2541">Yeah.</span> <span id="s2542">When my mother used to say, you have boys going around already, let them help you something to--let them help you something.</span> <span id="s2543">He says get away from here, from the machine.</span> <span id="s2544">I will not permit you to be in this trade.</span> <span id="s2545">Enough he said.</span> <span id="s2546">He took it over from his father, his father took it over--he says enough.</span> <span id="s2547">With your generation, this is stopping.</span> <span id="s2548">He was right.</span> <span id="s2549">He never permit us even--.</span> <span id="s2550">You know children sometimes help home, put on a button, right?</span> <span id="s2551">Oh, no!</span></p> <p><span id="s2552">Nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2553">Nothing.</span> <span id="s2554">He never permit us to help him out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2555">Prior to going to Lodz, you were just attending public school, Polish public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s2556">Public school.</span> <span id="s2557">Attend public school and I finish public school.</span> <span id="s2558">I finish seven years in public school.</span> <span id="s2559">This was in _______(197) in Poland, seven year public school.</span> <span id="s2560">We were going to school together with Polish, Polish Catholic boys and Jewish boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s2561">Did you also go to Cheder after school?</span></p> <p><span id="s2562">Yes.</span> <span id="s2563">We were going to school till one o'clock.</span> <span id="s2564">By the time we came home, grabbed something, two o'clock we had to go to the Jewish school.</span> <span id="s2565">We stood there till six, seven evening.</span> <span id="s2566">Came home with lanterns.</span> <span id="s2567">It was already dark, there was no electricity in town.</span> <span id="s2568">We had a lantern.</span> <span id="s2569">Not everybody had a lantern, but some of us, and we all came home together.</span> <span id="s2570">I was never dressed Hasidic, I was dressed more in modern clothes, a boy would dress already in that time.</span> <span id="s2571">We were learning, we had to do homework.</span> <span id="s2572">We had homework for Hebrew school and for the regular public school.</span> <span id="s2573">The hardest time was, for me, I remember for us in school was, because the school was open six days a week including Saturday.</span> <span id="s2574">We Jewish boys did not go Saturday to the school.</span> <span id="s2575">So we weren't, we missed school every Saturday and Sunday.</span> <span id="s2576">We had to get from the other school friends,--</span></p> <p><span id="s2577">The Poles?</span></p> <p><span id="s2578">From the Polish school friends, we had to get the lessons what we had to prepare for Monday, for school.</span> <span id="s2579">If you didn't make your homework, you failed.</span> <span id="s2580">You could stay in a class, it's not a kid, you could stay two, three years behind, you would fail.</span> <span id="s2581">Luckily, I managed to pass every grade.</span> <span id="s2582">I was very good in history and mathematics and how you call, earth science.</span> <span id="s2583">Earth science that time so I passed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2584">Do you remember any episodes of harassment, antisemitism ?</span></p> <p><span id="s2585">We had our share.</span> <span id="s2586">We had to have.</span> <span id="s2587">We were always harassed by the other schoolboys, by the Polish schoolboys during the intermission, during the intermission, we were harassed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2588">The intermission was--?</span></p> <p><span id="s2589">Between every session of school.</span> <span id="s2590">We start at 8 o'clock.</span> <span id="s2591">Between 8 and 9 was a lesson in Polish, right?</span> <span id="s2592">Then you had a five-minute intermission, you went in for math.</span> <span id="s2593">Then you have the big intermission between 10 and 11.</span> <span id="s2594">We had 20-minute intermission.</span> <span id="s2595">We supposed to have, eat your snack, eat your lunch.</span> <span id="s2596">There we had the biggest skirmishes and fights with the Polish boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s2597">Do you remember ever getting involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s2598">I got very much involved.</span> <span id="s2599">I got very much involved in --.</span> <span id="s2600">I must say most of the time, we fought back.</span> <span id="s2601">We fought back and we prevailed.</span> <span id="s2602">Was a time where they were already afraid for us, to touch us because they knew that they will start with the Jewish boys and among my friends, were very strong ones.</span> <span id="s2603">They were very strong boys and they knew that they going to get beaten up if they start with us.</span> <span id="s2604">We always had skirmishes.</span> <span id="s2605">We had antisemitic outbursts from teachers who made antisemitic remarks in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2606">Do you remember any specific--?</span></p> <p><span id="s2607">Yeah, I remember one specific remark from a schoolteacher who taught us math.</span> <span id="s2608">Was it math or history, no, a history teacher.</span> <span id="s2609">He said we have in Poland--Poland would be a good country if we could get rid of our five million people.</span> <span id="s2610">He didn't mention Jews.</span> <span id="s2611">He said five million people too much in Poland.</span> <span id="s2612">If we could get rid of them, we would--Poland would be an excellent country.</span> <span id="s2613">Would be enough work for all the Polaks, everything was bad at the time.</span> <span id="s2614">A Jewish boy stood up and he says to him, why don't you mention the name?</span> <span id="s2615">you mean the three million Jews?</span> <span id="s2616">the two million what you have there in___(248).</span> <span id="s2617">He didn't answer.</span> <span id="s2618">He didn't answer but he meant the Jews.</span> <span id="s2619">He meant the Jews because their thought was if Poland would get rid of the Jews, they would have a better life--which it proved in history was just the opposite, just the opposite.</span> <span id="s2620">Any country that get rid of the Jews is suffering.</span> <span id="s2621">They need the Jewish know-how, Jewish businessmen.</span> <span id="s2622">They need the Jewish brains, they need the Jewish profession.</span> <span id="s2623">They know it.</span> <span id="s2624">They thought that they can take out but they cannot.</span> <span id="s2625">They could take our apartments, they could take our furniture, they could take our life, they could take away everything.</span> <span id="s2626">But they couldn't take away our brain.</span> <span id="s2627">Therefore, it was wrong and antisemitism was very great in Poland.</span> <span id="s2628">And in the last years, which I remember the last years of my life in Poland, 1938 and '39, I must say therefore the Germans had an easier job with the Jews in Poland than in any other country.</span></p> <p><span id="s2629">They had natural collaborators?</span></p> <p><span id="s2630">Had natural collaborators.</span> <span id="s2631">Absolutely right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2632">Did your family live in an apartment or a house?</span></p> <p><span id="s2633">No, we lived in an apartment.</span> <span id="s2634">We lived in an apartment.</span> <span id="s2635">Had a kitchen smaller than that, called a kitchen and one bedroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s2636">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2637">In one bedroom, cold flat as you call it today.</span> <span id="s2638">Cold flat, there was no heat; there was no electricity; there was no gas.</span></p> <p><span id="s2639">Running water?</span></p> <p><span id="s2640">No running water, no toilets.</span> <span id="s2641">We lived.</span> <span id="s2642">We lived a happy life, a happy family home, father and children.</span> <span id="s2643">Father went down in the coldest weather.</span> <span id="s2644">Brought up coal and wood, made a little fire in the oven.</span> <span id="s2645">When I grew up already, me and my brother, we went to the pump to pump water.</span> <span id="s2646">To pump the pail water we brought it home.</span> <span id="s2647">Mother made a meal the best she could, potatoes naturally.</span> <span id="s2648">The main food, potatoes.</span> <span id="s2649">Herring, bread--.</span></p> <p><span id="s2650">She just worked in the home?</span></p> <p><span id="s2651">She was in the home, yeah.</span> <span id="s2652">There was no work for a woman.</span> <span id="s2653">Took care on us children, sew buttons, see that the shirts are clean to go to school.</span> <span id="s2654">Socks should be always--.</span> <span id="s2655">It's not like here where you have everyday a pair of socks.</span> <span id="s2656">You had a pair of socks, you wear it a week.</span> <span id="s2657">Then you make a hole, she sewed them together, stitched them together and she washed them again and we were wearing.</span> <span id="s2658">In winter, it was cold, I must admit.</span> <span id="s2659">If you didn't have--you were putting on clothes on top of clothes.</span> <span id="s2660">Kids, what did we care?</span> <span id="s2661">We run down, played with the sled in the snow, came home wet, put on other rags.</span> <span id="s2662">You were happy.</span> <span id="s2663">Until this vicious storm came in and pulled us all in which we did not expect.</span> <span id="s2664">Life was one small _______(283).</span> <span id="s2665">Had not the war broken, I think that probably my brother, maybe me, we would--he would emigrate to Palestine that time.</span> <span id="s2666">Because it was the dream.</span></p> <p><span id="s2667">You were part of the Zionist organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s2668">I am part of the Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s2669">It was the dream that for Zionists, not Zionist home, our own home.</span> <span id="s2670">At that time we didn't know they were going to get rid of us physically, but they get rid of us tormenting, antisemitism, progroms in other towns and other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2671">Was your father a supporter of Zionism?</span></p> <p><span id="s2672">Yes, yes, he was a supporter of Zionists, yeah.</span> <span id="s2673">He also believe in that the Jews must have their own country.</span> <span id="s2674">He was a learned man.</span> <span id="s2675">He learned history; he learned the Bible; he was learning the Talmud.</span> <span id="s2676">So he knew the history of the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s2677">He knew that there is no future for us in Europe, in Poland particularly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2678">Did he, himself, have the desire to go to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s2679">No, I tell you why he didn't have the desire.</span> <span id="s2680">In Poland a 40-year old man was old.</span> <span id="s2681">He used to say I'm an old man already.</span> <span id="s2682">Now I remind myself when the war broke out, he was 45 years old, forty years was old.</span> <span id="s2683">It was a different time.</span> <span id="s2684">A mother of 45 years, she looked like a old lady.</span> <span id="s2685">It was an exception with my mother, she did not look an old lady but it was already.</span> <span id="s2686">Here 50 years, was old man, a long beard, white beard.</span> <span id="s2687">So he had no desire.</span> <span id="s2688">But he wished for a better life for the children.</span> <span id="s2689">Of course, the dream was there.</span> <span id="s2690">The Zionist dream was there.</span> <span id="s2691">It was promised through the Balfour Declaration to different politicians.</span> <span id="s2692">He followed that, we followed that in the Zionist movement and we thought that our life will sometimes he there.</span> <span id="s2693">It seems that this was all interrupted and it all took a different turn.</span></p> <p><span id="s2694">When the war broke out, were you in Lodz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2695">No.</span> <span id="s2696">I was already in my hometown.</span> <span id="s2697">Because I was in Lodz until July, I was in a camp.</span> <span id="s2698">Then we saw--we felt the feeling--you know it was talk about the war.</span> <span id="s2699">The feeling was that I left for home.</span> <span id="s2700">I left for home; I left for hom.</span> <span id="s2701">I didn't want to be in the big city.</span></p> <p><span id="s2702">Your brother remained?</span></p> <p><span id="s2703">My brother remained.</span> <span id="s2704">He says to me, you go home.</span> <span id="s2705">Mother and father, because I was not done there, the oldest and I had a younger brother from ten.</span> <span id="s2706">Now he was, in 1929, he was ten, my younger sister was four years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s2707">What do you remember about that first day the Germans entered your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s2708">A very good question.</span> <span id="s2709">I remember it a lot.</span> <span id="s2710">The night before the Germans entered my town, we were sitting a bunch of boys in the street, on the stoop.</span> <span id="s2711">You know, like here you go out, a bunch of boys on the stoop, was very dark.</span> <span id="s2712">As I mentioned before, there was no electricity.</span> <span id="s2713">We were sitting and talking and fooling around and joking like young boys and girls do.</span> <span id="s2714">It was about eleven o'clock--the policeman in town who knew us very well came over to us and he says, go home, go home.</span> <span id="s2715">Shut off the lights.</span> <span id="s2716">Wherever anybody had a candle or a lamp burning, tell your parents shut off the light.</span> <span id="s2717">Must be dark in every window.</span></p> <p><span id="s2718">This a Jewish policeman or just a--?</span></p> <p><span id="s2719">No, no.</span> <span id="s2720">It was a Polish policeman.</span> <span id="s2721">Go home.</span> <span id="s2722">So we disbursed and went home.</span> <span id="s2723">I came home and I said, you know Father.</span> <span id="s2724">Policeman, I know his name, R____(357) was his name, told us to go home.</span> <span id="s2725">The war is coming.</span> <span id="s2726">The war is coming.</span> <span id="s2727">My father says, nobody knows.</span> <span id="s2728">What does he know?</span> <span id="s2729">But he told us, the war is coming, shut off the lights and stay in your house.</span> <span id="s2730">Sure enough, we went to sleep.</span> <span id="s2731">Four o'clock in the morning, we heard a bang.</span> <span id="s2732">There was a little bridge in our town between the border of Germany and Poland which was connecting both countries.</span> <span id="s2733">The bridge was what, thirty feet wide.</span> <span id="s2734">Yeah, that's all, maybe 30 feet wide.</span> <span id="s2735">This bridge was dynamite by the Polish army.</span></p> <p><span id="s2736">That was over the Prozna (ph)(371) River?</span></p> <p><span id="s2737">That's right.</span> <span id="s2738">How do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2739">I did some research.</span></p> <p><span id="s2740">That's right.</span> <span id="s2741">Was the Prozna River.</span> <span id="s2742">Was a little bridge over the Prozna River and it was dynamited by the Polish army that the Germans should not be able to come in.</span> <span id="s2743">In the meantime, when they were dynamiting this little bridge over the Prozna, the Germans were already in town from another side.</span> <span id="s2744">This was because there were certain places where the bridge, maybe one kilometer further was as narrow, we used to jump over.</span> <span id="s2745">We used to make tricks, we jump to Germany.</span> <span id="s2746">So the Polish army came over there with their tanks and with their trucks, was already in town.</span> <span id="s2747">Immediately.</span> <span id="s2748">So when we looked out, it got light, six o'clock in the morning, Germans are all over.</span> <span id="s2749">Bayonets, I remember it today, the bayonets and the tanks and the trucks are coming down to put right away another bridge up.</span> <span id="s2750">They were right away looking for Jews to go to work.</span> <span id="s2751">So they grabbed, I went down there, a little boy in short pants, never looked Jewish.</span> <span id="s2752">Had red hair with a lot of pimple on my face.</span> <span id="s2753">I went down and greeted the Germans.</span> <span id="s2754">First I went to the bakery before when the Germans were ready to come.</span> <span id="s2755">I ran over to the bakery, me and my little brother and the baker ran away from town.</span> <span id="s2756">He ran away from town, he was afraid when he heard shooting, he left all the bread on the floor.</span> <span id="s2757">So we grabbed as much as I could.</span> <span id="s2758">I hand to him and we brought it home.</span> <span id="s2759">Fresh bread.</span> <span id="s2760">Then other people came and they also had bread.</span> <span id="s2761">After this, we already came home, I see already the German marching Jews.</span> <span id="s2762">They caught some Jews to work to help them build the bridge.</span> <span id="s2763">They marching there and the Jews were right away standing, the first day, the first few hours, up here into the water.</span> <span id="s2764">The Prozna wasn't a big water and they were helping to rebuild the bridge what the Polish army exploded.</span> <span id="s2765">Naturally, I ran to the house, hid my father.</span> <span id="s2766">Took my father and my mother to the basement.</span> <span id="s2767">I stood in front of the house.</span> <span id="s2768">German soldiers came over with the bayonets like this, says Juda, Juda--.</span> <span id="s2769">(397)</span></p> <p><span id="s2770">Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s2771">No, Juda.</span> <span id="s2772">No Jew.</span> <span id="s2773">Juda here, they want to know where a Jew is living there because in other places they had looked the Polish told them right away where was a Jew.</span> <span id="s2774">They didn't know I'm a Jew.</span> <span id="s2775">I'm not going to tell on my family.</span> <span id="s2776">I say no Juda, no Jew, no Juda and they went further with their bayonets and they made sure that everybody opened the stores.</span> <span id="s2777">The stores that everything should be normal.</span> <span id="s2778">Most of the people run away from town.</span> <span id="s2779">I witnessed the first boots, the German boots.</span> <span id="s2780">All of a sudden, the army started marching, the German army.</span> <span id="s2781">Army, motorcycles, trucks and tanks.</span> <span id="s2782">Motorcycles, trucks and tanks for seven days, night and day, night and day, marching through our town to the city of Lodz.</span> <span id="s2783">Seven days later, they were in Lodz and occupied Lodz and everything on the way.</span> <span id="s2784">This was Friday.</span> <span id="s2785">Sunday, they corralled all the Jews from my town into the synagogue.</span> <span id="s2786">I showed you a picture of the synagogue.</span> <span id="s2787">Naturally, I didn't let my father go, not my father.</span> <span id="s2788">I went with my little brother.</span> <span id="s2789">We all looked like little, no Jewish boys.</span> <span id="s2790">Here they bringing Jews from all over the town into the synagogue.</span> <span id="s2791">We thought--I didn't want to risk my parents.</span> <span id="s2792">The idea was, we found out later, that the idea was to explode the synagogue with the people in there.</span> <span id="s2793">This was on Sunday, three days later.</span> <span id="s2794">Mind your this was before they had an order yet, the Von_____(427) Conference I think, before yet, when they had the plan to exterminate all the Jews.</span> <span id="s2795">They were already killing Jews.</span> <span id="s2796">This was not SS men, this was the army.</span> <span id="s2797">I don't know where they got the orders but it was in their hand.</span> <span id="s2798">As we stood there in the synagogue and I listened without a hat, I went in without a hat, I didn't put any.</span> <span id="s2799">He was hollering--the general goes up on the bima, on the stage and he said, you should know, the German, you have killed many Germans in this town.</span> <span id="s2800">Three German soldiers were killed yesterday by Jews.</span> <span id="s2801">You entitled to die, all of you.</span> <span id="s2802">But we giving you the last warning.</span> <span id="s2803">If ever any German soldier will be killed in this town again, you all will be killed and he disbursed the people.</span> <span id="s2804">He did not--we found out later from the Germans sources that they couldn't do it in our town, it was too close to Germany.</span> <span id="s2805">It was too close, the army was marching by, you understand.</span> <span id="s2806">Matter of fact the synagogue remained, it's still there.</span> <span id="s2807">.</span> <span id="s2808">This was on Sunday.</span> <span id="s2809">Then they start marching and leaving us fairly alone, on our own till they established a headquarters and a Gestapo, They caught to work.</span> <span id="s2810">We had to make the roads wider for the German tanks to pass.</span></p> <p><span id="s2811">You worked on the roads?</span></p> <p><span id="s2812">Yeah, we worked on the roads.</span> <span id="s2813">Then we eliminated even some houses.</span> <span id="s2814">There were some houses standing in the corner, little houses of wood and the German tank would pass say take it down.</span> <span id="s2815">We had to clear it up, they should be able to cross.</span> <span id="s2816">They took us right to work but we came home in the evening.</span> <span id="s2817">They grabbed young people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2818">Your father--?</span></p> <p><span id="s2819">No, no.</span> <span id="s2820">Never, we never let them.</span> <span id="s2821">I always protected my father.</span> <span id="s2822">I never let him go to work.</span> <span id="s2823">He was hidden.</span> <span id="s2824">I always went because every family had to supply people so I went, my mother went sometimes to sweep the streets.</span> <span id="s2825">My father, no.</span> <span id="s2826">He had very bad legs, he had broken legs before the war and he couldn't do.</span> <span id="s2827">I protected my father.</span> <span id="s2828">What else can I remember?</span> <span id="s2829">Then, lasted until 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s2830">Did they require armbands of you at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2831">Yeah, that's right.</span> <span id="s2832">Two months later, a few weeks had been very quiet, we should wear all armbands and the Star of David.</span></p> <p><span id="s2833">Did you wear a patch or--?</span></p> <p><span id="s2834">Wear a patch, Star of David and a yellow armband.</span> <span id="s2835">This way, they left us still in our homes.</span> <span id="s2836">But we were not allowed after five o;'clock out.</span> <span id="s2837">In the morning, they let us out.</span> <span id="s2838">But in order for us to sustain ourselves, especially my mother was the one who was the supplier of food.</span> <span id="s2839">She ran into the village and bought some food from the peasants and brought it home dressed as a Polish woman.</span> <span id="s2840">And I took off my band whenever--and I didn't walk in the sidewalk, I walked straight on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s2841">Because if I walk in the sidewalk, they knew already I am a Jew.</span> <span id="s2842">The only thing I have to watch out for is that a Polak should not see me, he would tell him this is a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2843">You would walk in the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s2844">In the street, right.</span> <span id="s2845">You see what I mean?</span> <span id="s2846">I walked--not in the street, I walked on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s2847">Took off my band, went over, brought something for somebody else, the other guy had sugar, this one had bread.</span> <span id="s2848">You know, we did some exchanging in order to survive.</span> <span id="s2849">This was about till 1940, till they made a ghetto.</span> <span id="s2850">They took part of the city and they separated.</span> <span id="s2851">We all had to leave within two hours our homes that we were living for many years and go into this ghetto.</span> <span id="s2852">Two, three families in one room.</span></p> <p><span id="s2853">So your apartment wasn't within the established boundaries?</span></p> <p><span id="s2854">No, my apartment was not.</span> <span id="s2855">We had to leave, we had to leave.</span> <span id="s2856">We left and the other boundary was closer to the Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s2857">Whatever we took along, we took along.</span> <span id="s2858">Everything left.</span> <span id="s2859">Furniture, who cares about furniture that time?</span> <span id="s2860">We took along some schmattas, (51), to dress, that's all, to sustain yourself.</span> <span id="s2861">There in the ghetto, we lived together.</span> <span id="s2862">Three families into a room.</span> <span id="s2863">Again they took us, the young people had to go to work to build the roads, to clean the snow.</span> <span id="s2864">Winter came in and the Germans--you know they're very harsh winters.</span> <span id="s2865">.</span> <span id="s2866">Snow and the Germans had to travel with their trucks.</span> <span id="s2867">We had to make the roads, we had to work for them.</span> <span id="s2868">Till little by little, they liquidated the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2869">They liquidated us young people, I told you, they took us to camp.</span> <span id="s2870">Shipped off to camp, slave-labor camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2871">So you were the first to go in your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s2872">With the first eighty boys.</span> <span id="s2873">Looking back, retrospect, we were 80 boys with four Germans taking us on the transport.</span> <span id="s2874">Can you imagine?</span> <span id="s2875">No one had to--the strength or the wisdom to attack the four Germans.</span> <span id="s2876">Eighty!</span> <span id="s2877">Take away their ammunition and run to the forests.</span> <span id="s2878">But nobody knew it.</span> <span id="s2879">When I went away, I said to my father, I'm going to tell you the story.</span> <span id="s2880">I'm going to tell you when I come back.</span> <span id="s2881">We all thought that we going to work for three months in labor camp and we'll going to come back.</span> <span id="s2882">.</span> <span id="s2883">But the whole thing was to trick us in, to trick us in.</span> <span id="s2884">So when the young people were already tricked in, there couldn't be no more resistance , right; go in the camp.</span> <span id="s2885">The older people with the younger people, my father with my younger two brothers, they went.</span> <span id="s2886">The very old people, like the buby, the grandmother and-- grandfather was not alive but I had a grandmother and other people, they took them in the cemetery and shot them.</span> <span id="s2887">They all buried in a mass grave there in Praszka.</span> <span id="s2888">So that was the lot of my town.</span></p> <p><span id="s2889">What happened to your oldest brother?</span> <span id="s2890">Did he remain in Lodz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2891">No, my oldest brother, I must say he died a hero,.</span> <span id="s2892">Why did he die a hero?</span> <span id="s2893">Because he had a good trade, he was an electrician.</span> <span id="s2894">He came home from Lodz during the war.</span> <span id="s2895">He run to Warsaw during the war but he came home from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s2896">He came home from Warsaw to his parents.</span> <span id="s2897">When I was taken out to camp, he remained home with my parents.</span> <span id="s2898">When they had the ghetto, they clean up the ghetto, they ask all the people who had a trade, go to the right, and all the other people, my father and mother with the other children to the left.</span> <span id="s2899">I was told, I met a boy who was in the same line, my landsman.</span> <span id="s2900">I met him in 1944.</span> <span id="s2901">He said your brother Moishe did not want to leave the parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s2902">So he went in their line?</span></p> <p><span id="s2903">That's right.</span> <span id="s2904">He did not want to leave the parents.</span> <span id="s2905">He don't know what they're going to do without him.</span> <span id="s2906">That's why I said, he died a hero.</span> <span id="s2907">He thought, he didn't know.</span> <span id="s2908">He thought they're going to take him with the parents and two little children.</span> <span id="s2909">Two younger brothers with a sister, they are going to take them.</span> <span id="s2910">Maybe they're going to put them in the Lodz ghetto, he will work a electrician, he will have a trade.</span> <span id="s2911">No, but it was the opposite.</span> <span id="s2912">They took the other ones to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2913">If he would have gone out from the line and said I am an electrician, they would have grabbed him.</span> <span id="s2914">He would have been.</span> <span id="s2915">--.</span> <span id="s2916">(End of Tape 1) I had to report to the SS man who was watching me.</span> <span id="s2917">He say, Hefling (1), I'm under forty, _______________(1).</span> <span id="s2918">What do you want, you dog?</span> <span id="s2919">Bitte ___(2) ____ means I want to go away, leave him, five minute, two minute.</span> <span id="s2920">It was a better one he give you two minutes, it was a bastard, he said one minute back.</span> <span id="s2921">I run to the toilet, do what you have to do, come back in a minute, if you manage.</span> <span id="s2922">That's what they say.</span> <span id="s2923">I always wondered, what will happen if they should give ____(c.7).</span> <span id="s2924">They wouldn't have to have the problems.</span> <span id="s2925">They always could see this one, this one.</span> <span id="s2926">So in everything in life, I think, there is some intervention.</span> <span id="s2927">I am, most important thing of it, I remained a believer after the war, I still remained.</span> <span id="s2928">I am a believer.</span> <span id="s2929">I believe in divine destiny.</span> <span id="s2930">Why me, not others?</span> <span id="s2931">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2932">What about luck?</span></p> <p><span id="s2933">I believe.</span> <span id="s2934">I believe that it was destiny, divine destiny that certain people should remain alive, continue their life, contribute to the society, contribute to the Jewish people and transmit the story.</span> <span id="s2935">So today, I belong to the synagogue, I am observant and I am very dedicated, very much dedicated to the survival of the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s2936">Not only with words, but with deeds too.</span> <span id="s2937">I guess, it is the story of my life.</span> <span id="s2938">There are different episodes in the middle which we could sit here for five, six hours more and I could tell you.</span> <span id="s2939">I could tell you a story where the SS in Praszka.</span> <span id="s2940">I was once in--thought my survival would be easier if I joined the Hitlerjugend, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2941">This when someone believed that you were not a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s2942">That's right.</span> <span id="s2943">I was joining them for three days I belonged to the Hitlerjugend.</span> <span id="s2944">I thought that this would be the way.</span> <span id="s2945">I went there and they took me in, the German youngsters, they didn't recognize me.</span> <span id="s2946">I was in the kitchen in the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s2947">This was in your town, they had a Hitlerjugend?</span></p> <p><span id="s2948">Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2949">I worked there for three days till I was again given up by a Polish.</span> <span id="s2950">The first Polish came in and he tell this is Juda.</span> <span id="s2951">I took off my jacket and run.</span></p> <p><span id="s2952">Had they given you a uniform to wear?</span></p> <p><span id="s2953">If I would be there a few months, I would have gotten a uniform.</span> <span id="s2954">Therefore, people saw the movie now, Europa, Europa, they say, I said, don't take it so easy.</span> <span id="s2955">They said it couldn't happen.</span> <span id="s2956">It could happen because I --and they stand up there, they don't believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2957">Somebody, one of the German soldiers or an SS man noticed you or--?</span></p> <p><span id="s2958">No, no.</span> <span id="s2959">It was not a German soldier.</span> <span id="s2960">I was again given up by a Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2961">I mean in terms of recruiting you to the--?</span></p> <p><span id="s2962">Recruiting you, no.</span> <span id="s2963">I went in myself, I went in myself.</span> <span id="s2964">I knew that--no, it was not like that.</span> <span id="s2965">I was sent to work there.</span> <span id="s2966">I was sent there to work.</span> <span id="s2967">When I came in, they ask me what are you doing here?</span> <span id="s2968">I didn't tell them I was sent by the Jewish community to work but I said I came in to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2969">So the Judenrat had given out some assignments?</span></p> <p><span id="s2970">Yeah, Judenrat gave us some assignments.</span> <span id="s2971">So I said I came to work in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s2972">They young boys, 18 years old.</span> <span id="s2973">Arbeit (49), --- here in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s2974">Gave me an apron.</span> <span id="s2975">Then I start to think, if I can continue staying here, I have a future.</span> <span id="s2976">But was not easy.</span> <span id="s2977">Was not easy because in my face you couldn't recognize me as Jewish.</span> <span id="s2978">When people tell me the story about Europa, Europa when the Jewish boy was Hitlerjugend, and he did survive and certain things, I said everything is possible.</span> <span id="s2979">It almost happened to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2980">So you stayed there three days working?</span></p> <p><span id="s2981">Three days, I came every morning with my hand like this, Heil Hitler, you know.</span> <span id="s2982">They believe me.</span> <span id="s2983">The Germans was easy to get away than the Polaks.</span> <span id="s2984">They smell you, that you're Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2985">They could hear your accent?</span></p> <p><span id="s2986">Accent, accent.</span></p> <p><span id="s2987">Right.</span> <span id="s2988">How long did you work in that forest?</span> <span id="s2989">In that first labor camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s2990">In the forest?</span></p> <p><span id="s2991">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2992">I don't know.</span> <span id="s2993">1941--.</span> <span id="s2994">It must have been--.</span> <span id="s2995">When I came to camp, I came in short pants so it must have been summer.</span> <span id="s2996">I came in short camps and a little jacket.</span> <span id="s2997">I show it to you.</span> <span id="s2998">My father and mother gave me something there in a little package.</span> <span id="s2999">So I must have been there in summer, autumn, winter.</span> <span id="s3000">Then I was sent to this German camp.</span> <span id="s3001">There it was called Kustrin.</span> <span id="s3002">A factory where they produced a powder for bullets.</span></p> <p><span id="s3003">That was before Auschwitz then too?</span></p> <p><span id="s3004">Yeah, this before Auschwitz, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3005">Do you know how to spell the name of that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s3006">Yeah, Kustrin.</span> <span id="s3007">K-u-s-t-r-i-n.</span> <span id="s3008">But on the u is two dots on top, Kustrin.</span> <span id="s3009">Kustrin, they used to call it, Kustrin __________(75) So after you left your town, you never went back?</span></p> <p><span id="s3010">No, in 1979, I was ridden down to visit my own grave.</span> <span id="s3011">I call it to visit my own grave.</span> <span id="s3012">To find my friend Henry Margolis.</span> <span id="s3013">When I went to Germany, the story like this.</span> <span id="s3014">I went to Germany to testify against two Nazis from my camp near Roznow______(80).</span> <span id="s3015">I went to a _____ in Germany.</span> <span id="s3016">When I was there already, I prepared myself here home here, I got a visa for Poland.</span> <span id="s3017">I said when I am already in Germany and I go through the agonizing, grueling of witnessing, I probably will--let's go to Poland, I said to her, my wife.</span> <span id="s3018">She agreed with me.</span> <span id="s3019">We never went home back.</span> <span id="s3020">Let's go to Poland and see how it is.</span> <span id="s3021">So this is the first time I went.</span> <span id="s3022">After Germany, I went for five, six days to Poland in 1979.</span> <span id="s3023">Went to visit my hometown, went to visit the cemetery.</span> <span id="s3024">It was an agonizing experience.</span> <span id="s3025">I lost 15 pounds at that time.</span> <span id="s3026">Being before in Germany, take care of us two weeks.</span> <span id="s3027">It was very tragic.</span> <span id="s3028">I came in to my town, I was looking for the boy, I was looking for the boy who was 15.</span> <span id="s3029">You know what I mean.</span> <span id="s3030">I was going in the streets and my feet were sinking in like--they were so rubbery--I didn't know why your feet got so rubbery.</span> <span id="s3031">I was looking for a young boy.</span> <span id="s3032">I came into the home where I left.</span> <span id="s3033">I thought I find some pictures, photographs.</span> <span id="s3034">I was lucky, the home was there.</span> <span id="s3035">Was occupied by a Polish drunk.</span> <span id="s3036">He had a padlock on the door.</span> <span id="s3037">Lucky and I didn't go in.</span> <span id="s3038">Then I said to Helen and to the Polish guide who led me there, that I think that it was luck or Providence that the door wasn't open because I might have fainted or got a heart attack coming in the house I was glad it was closed.</span> <span id="s3039">I went up the stair and they told me there's a Polish drunk living there.</span> <span id="s3040">Closed and I didn't bother to go the next day.</span> <span id="s3041">Because I came back the next day again.</span> <span id="s3042">I didn't bother no more.</span> <span id="s3043">I went to the cemetery, did my--did the prayers.</span> <span id="s3044">_____(107), a Jew come to my town, nobody.</span> <span id="s3045">I did my prayers in the cemetery.</span> <span id="s3046">I went to the synagogue, looked just in through the window.</span> <span id="s3047">It was also closed.</span> <span id="s3048">They told me if you want to wait till five o'clock, we open for you.</span> <span id="s3049">I said no, no.</span> <span id="s3050">____(110) I figured enough as a boy what I remember.</span> <span id="s3051">I went on the steps from my Cheder.</span> <span id="s3052">I said please ________.</span> <span id="s3053">Looked around town.</span> <span id="s3054">I saw who is living in Jewish homes, in Jewish houses and what's happening.</span> <span id="s3055">I left, very agonizing experience.</span> <span id="s3056">Then I went with my wife to her town.</span> <span

living.</span> <span id="s3060">She couldn't do any more.</span> <span id="s3061">This is the time I went over to the cemetery because was under Poland.</span> <span id="s3062">Y____(120) is under Poland now.</span> <span id="s3063">So I had to go into Poland.</span> <span id="s3064">It took me nine hours to find the cemetery.</span> <span id="s3065">Because I asked people where is the Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s3066">Nobody knew.</span> <span id="s3067">They all were newcomers because the original populations was no more there.</span> <span id="s3068">Until I finally got a hold of an old German woman.</span> <span id="s3069">I gave her two dollars and she led me to the cemetery.</span> <span id="s3070">I found the graves, I found it.</span> <span id="s3071">Therefore when I came back, I wrote the story in the Jewish paper here.</span> <span id="s3072">It was translated to English but this is only part of it.</span> <span id="s3073">I came back from my own grave.</span> <span id="s3074">Germany--I testified for three days.</span> <span id="s3075">Was very lonely, it was not right.</span> <span id="s3076">It's not right they sending a survivor.</span> <span id="s3077">They are sending a survivor to testify by himself without any lawyers, without any support group without anything.</span> <span id="s3078">Because I came in through the courtroom.</span> <span id="s3079">They were sitting 50 people.</span> <span id="s3080">They brought down all the secretaries and all the words in the courtroom.</span> <span id="s3081">In the front was sitting seven judges.</span> <span id="s3082">They told me to recognize two murderers.</span></p> <p><span id="s3083">This was from that sub-camp of Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s3084">No, from Y____(c.141).</span></p> <p><span id="s3085">Oh, from Y ______.</span></p> <p><span id="s3086">From Y_________.</span> <span id="s3087">How can you recognize after 40 years?</span> <span id="s3088">They old, they changed, they've no hair.</span> <span id="s3089">You see what I mean?</span> <span id="s3090">Instead of saying they taking four people, do you recognize two?</span> <span id="s3091">No, they took 50 people to look at.</span> <span id="s3092">What a _____(144).</span> <span id="s3093">I recognized one on the picture.</span> <span id="s3094">They show me then a picture in his uniform, then I recognize him so I said this is him.</span> <span id="s3095">In the uniform, otherwise, I couldn't recognize him.</span> <span id="s3096">I testified for two days, all by myself.</span> <span id="s3097">I felt that I'm the accused.</span> <span id="s3098">Can you imagine, seven judges!</span> <span id="s3099">Here I have no attorney, have no defense, nobody on my side.</span></p> <p><span id="s3100">So they were busy asking you questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s3101">Yeah, they was asking me questions.</span> <span id="s3102">You have to tell the story.</span> <span id="s3103">How did you see?</span> <span id="s3104">How do you know it's him?</span> <span id="s3105">How do you it's him and how come you're--?</span> <span id="s3106">How close were you from him?</span> <span id="s3107">Were you two feet, three feet?</span> <span id="s3108">I said ten feet away.</span> <span id="s3109">They said how can you recognize it's him.</span> <span id="s3110">I said because I saw him everyday in camp.</span> <span id="s3111">I know it was him.</span> <span id="s3112">If I would be closer, I wouldn't be here to testify, he would shoot me.</span> <span id="s3113">He would kill me.</span> <span id="s3114">The last day, I had an argument with them, not an argument, I had a statement.</span> <span id="s3115">A very positive statement.</span> <span id="s3116">I just spoke to their conscience.</span> <span id="s3117">To the German judges and to them.</span> <span id="s3118">I said one word.</span> <span id="s3119">Through my testimony, I implicated another two SS men which were later tried.</span> <span id="s3120">One got prison sentence.</span> <span id="s3121">They want me to come for the other trial but I didn't want to come no more.</span> <span id="s3122">They want me to come for the trial for the SS men from Lagisza where I was, near Benjum (162) where I told you.</span> <span id="s3123">I didn't want to go no more.</span> <span id="s3124">They came here.</span> <span id="s3125">I testified in the German consulate.</span> <span id="s3126">I didn't want to go no more.</span> <span id="s3127">But he got, he got through my testimony, this one guy--.</span> <span id="s3128">As a matter of fact, i have here a paper, I had it the other day.</span> <span id="s3129">He got sentenced one Smith.</span> <span id="s3130">He was in the camp Lagisza--I know I just saw it.</span> <span id="s3131">Now when I'm looking, I want to show you this piece of paper.</span> <span id="s3132">Where do I have it?</span> <span id="s3133">I cut it out from paper.</span> <span id="s3134">This Smith was sentenced so many years because of--the camp from Lagisza-- because I implicated him.</span> <span id="s3135">I wouldn't find it because I didn't prepare it.</span> <span id="s3136">I don't know where it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s3137">Let me ask you one other question about when you went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s3138">You were transported by train, by cattle car?</span></p> <p><span id="s3139">When I went to Auschwitz from K_____(179)--.</span> <span id="s3140">You know I don't

remember getting off in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s3144">You know where Mengele was there and everybody else.</span> <span id="s3145">They took people to the right and to the left.</span> <span id="s3146">I remember that.</span> <span id="s3147">It was cattle cars, yes, but we were not packed like cattles from that because the Germans who put us there were a little different.</span> <span

hat, with the shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3162">Wooden shoes or--?</span></p> <p><span id="s3163">No, I happened to grab a pair of other shoes but they were too tight.</span> <span id="s3164">But
