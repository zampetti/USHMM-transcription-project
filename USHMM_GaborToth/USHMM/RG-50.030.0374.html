your full name, your date of birth and where you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Answer: My name is Marthe Cohn.</span> <span id="s13">M-a-r-t-h-e, C-o-h-n.</span> <span id="s14">I was born on April 13, 1920 in Metz, which is in Northern France.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: And your maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: My maiden name was Hoffnung, H-o-f-f-n-u-n-g.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Tell me a little bit about your family and your life before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: We were a very extended family.</span> <span id="s19">My grandfather on my mother's side -- I never knew my grandparents on my father's side, they died before I was born.</span> <span id="s20">But on my mother's side, my grandfather was one of the rabbis of Metz.</span> <span id="s21">And we were very orthodox.</span> <span id="s22">Very.</span> <span id="s23">Everything was done by the book.</span> <span id="s24">We never wrote on Saturday.</span> <span id="s25">We went to school because everybody had to go to school, but we were authorized not to write, and there were never tests given on Saturday.</span> <span id="s26">So I had -- my parents had eight children.</span> <span id="s27">One boy, the second boy died when he was 2 1/2, in 1914, 1919 from scarlet bifida.</span> <span id="s28">I never knew him.</span> <span id="s29">I wasn't born yet.</span> <span id="s30">And we were raised seven children.</span> <span id="s31">I had two older brothers, an older sister and three younger sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: What kind of business was your father in?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: My father had a photograph enlargement and framing business.</span> <span id="s34">He didn't make the pictures, but he enlarged and framed them for people.</span> <span id="s35">And my mother worked with him after I was about 8 or 9 at the time she started working with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Well, how would you consider your lifestyle?</span> <span id="s37">Was it fairly comfortable?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Oh, we were not rich, but we never missed a dinner.</span> <span id="s39">We never were hungry or we always had clothes.</span> <span id="s40">We went to good schools.</span> <span id="s41">It was middle income, but not rich.</span> <span id="s42">My uncles, my mother's brothers, she had seven brothers.</span> <span id="s43">She was a young girl, and they were very rich but we were not.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Your schooling, was it a public school . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Did you go to a Hebrew school, also?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s48">I went to public school for first grade to graduation, and when you graduate it's about two years of college from the __________, which is -- do you want me to spell it?</span> <span id="s49">No, okay.</span> <span id="s50">And Ametz (ph), we were very young, when Ametz would come to the house and teach us to read, but not to write or to -- just reading.</span> <span id="s51">When I was little, I went to a hyper.</span> <span id="s52">And there was no separation between state and college, so we had a college teaching in school every week.</span> <span id="s53">And all religion had -- we had the _________, who was like a bishop.</span> <span id="s54">He was the rabbi of the whole area, the general area.</span> <span id="s55">And he taught us, and to Catholic it's a priest and to Protestant the ministers.</span> <span id="s56">We all have religious teaching because when Metz reverted to French rule in 1918, the French wanted to keep the ___________ very happy.</span> <span id="s57">And they are very religious, so they accepted because France was always a state where religion and state were separate.</span> <span id="s58">But not in Lorraine de la Cross, it was a special thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Being Jewish, were your friends Jewish or Catholic or mixed?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: There were mostly Catholics and Jews.</span> <span id="s61">I had in that school there were quite a few Jews, but we were -- most of the kids were Catholic.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: I'm trying to get a sense of how integrated Jewish people were into the life of Metz, whether they had a separate community or whether you were all French.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s64">We had special communities, religious.</span> <span id="s65">We were very religious anyway.</span> <span id="s66">And my grandfather had founded the _________, he had founded everything, you know, synagogues.</span> <span id="s67">He had founded everything for the _______, everything for the orthodox.</span> <span id="s68">Because ________ was a very -- let's see, I try to find the word.</span> <span id="s69">I see a little person in this synagogue at _______ which was outside the forbidden parts, so you see, that's the difference.</span> <span id="s70">But at the same time my parents and my grandfather were very open-minded, and we always had Catholic friends, too, and that was absolutely not following the ________.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Were you aware of any anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Oh, sure, sure.</span> <span id="s73">In that city were many Germans, and in '33 or a little before when Hitler started to get mighty, the Ukraines who were of German descent were very much anti-Semitic and showed it openly.</span> <span id="s74">When until then they showed it not perhaps as openly.</span> <span id="s75">But in 1936 when Leon Blume (ph) came to power, you remember that?</span> <span id="s76">And he was Jewish, we had the First Minister a Jew.</span> <span id="s77">And then there were real high-ups due to that.</span> <span id="s78">And we, my sister and I -- my sister was definitely was _________, we had fistfights with the girls in schools about that because then they showed openly their anti-Semitism and we did not accept it.</span> <span id="s79">No, how can we be governed by a Jew?</span> <span id="s80">Things like that, so that we did not accept.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: You fought back?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s83">I always fought.</span> <span id="s84">My father was a very, very strong person.</span> <span id="s85">Very authoritarian, but in the same way he did not accept.</span> <span id="s86">I remember when I was real small child -- I don't remember what age, but very small -- we came out of the synagogue, which was in the bad neighborhood.</span> <span id="s87">The synagogue was in the slums, and at that time there were lots of bad kids out there.</span> <span id="s88">Teenagers, and they started to call us dirty Jews and throw stone.</span> <span id="s89">And my father took his belt off and just went after them, and I was very proud of him.</span> <span id="s90">I think that's why I agreed to help.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: And that probably influenced you?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Possibly, yeah.</span> <span id="s93">But we were -- I don't know.</span> <span id="s94">My brothers and my sisters and I -- just my oldest sister, she was not the fighting kind.</span> <span id="s95">But all were natural -- in fact, we were on my father's side.</span> <span id="s96">Otherwise, we were much more like my mother, but for that we were like my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: What does that mean, more like your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: My mother was a very soft and very understanding and very -- she grew up with us.</span> <span id="s99">And my father, he was a authoritarian, he was a patriarch and that was that.</span> <span id="s100">There was a big difference between the two.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Do you remember your parents saying anything to you about this anti-Semitism, how did they respond why . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Yes, sure.</span> <span id="s103">We discussed it -- I don't remember if it was '27, 1927 or '29.</span> <span id="s104">I don't remember the year when Schwartzmann or Schwartz-kopf, the general in France, the Russian general who had done so many pogroms in Poland and Russia.</span> <span id="s105">I don't remember if it was Poland, I think it was in Russia.</span> <span id="s106">_________ was a Russian, and he killed him in the streets of Paris.</span> <span id="s107">And every night I remember my oldest brother reading the newspapers aloud to all the family at the table what had happened that day as a crime.</span> <span id="s108">And that had a terrible reparation on me.</span> <span id="s109">I wanted to become a lawyer, that was the goal of my life.</span> <span id="s110">To become a lawyer, but I remember very well the deep -- and I was so terrified that people could -- did not have pogroms.</span> <span id="s111">I didn't know much about it before that.</span> <span id="s112">And that gave me an inkling of what happened in this countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Were there any social or political organizations you were involved with as a girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s115">I was very friendly with a Jewish group who had work in an organization, but I never belonged.</span> <span id="s116">I'm not very much of a belonger to organizations.</span> <span id="s117">In general, I never in my life, you know, _______ and belonged to something.</span> <span id="s118">They were a group of -- I don't remember what they were.</span> <span id="s119">I tried to remember.</span> <span id="s120">It was a Jewish -- a Zionist group, I don't remember exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: And your father, your brothers, they weren't involved with that either?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: You started to mention to Hitler.</span> <span id="s124">How much did you know about what was going on in Germany at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Oh, very much.</span> <span id="s126">We knew it every day.</span> <span id="s127">Since the age of 6, as soon I could read, I get the paper and read it.</span> <span id="s128">I was always and I am still very interested in people and things.</span> <span id="s129">And I keep abreast of what's going on, not just in my country but in every country.</span> <span id="s130">And we knew exactly what was going on, and we had relatives in Germany.</span> <span id="s131">My father had a sister in Germany, and they lived in Dusseldorf, which is not very far from Metz.</span> <span id="s132">And after Kristallnacht, the next morning, their daughter called us.</span> <span id="s133">It was her husband, the Germans came in, the SS Gestapo they came in and went to arrest him.</span> <span id="s134">And she had two small children.</span> <span id="s135">Jackie was by then about 3; another one, Josie, was about 2; and she was very pregnant with the third one.</span> <span id="s136">And by chance, she was able to talk them out of arresting him on the spot.</span> <span id="s137">And then as soon they left -- they were going to come back -- as soon as they left, he ran away to Holland.</span> <span id="s138">Because he had a brother there, but she stayed with the children.</span> <span id="s139">So she called us, and my older sister, Cecilia, went immediately by train to Germany and got the two children out.</span> <span id="s140">And she made heil Hitler until she had the baby and then she went with the baby to Holland.</span> <span id="s141">And we kept Jackie, the oldest one -- we kept during the whole war.</span> <span id="s142">Because his parents later went on one of these ships who tried to go to Palestine, and they were all of them who wanted -- it took them forever to be able to land in Palestine.</span> <span id="s143">And once they landed, the war started, so they never were able to get their children.</span> <span id="s144">And Jackie lived with us and his brother, Josie, lived with my aunt, the sister of my father.</span> <span id="s145">But these were on my father's side.</span> <span id="s146">She was the sister of my father, I never met her.</span> <span id="s147">I never met my aunt.</span> <span id="s148">But I knew her, too, because of Jackie.</span> <span id="s149">I knew Jackie.</span> <span id="s150">She had come to France to see us, so Jackie -- when I talk about what happened during the war, he was always with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Was there a number of German Jews who were coming west and moving into your area?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s153">Very much so, and every Jewish family of Metz who was a German family during the time that they went -- you know, that they moved on, then after that they moved on.</span> <span id="s154">Because we were too close to Germany, nobody felt very comfortable there.</span> <span id="s155">So, oh, yes, I remember very well the family who came to stay with us.</span> <span id="s156">I don't remember their name, but I remember very well they were there.</span> <span id="s157">I don't remember how long, two weeks, and then they moved on.</span> <span id="s158">But we all helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Is there anything else you want to tell me about Metz or your family or the kind of life you lived?</span> <span id="s160">Were you -- you were finishing up school at about the time of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Before, I finished in '18.</span> <span id="s162">And I was 17 when I finished school, and we had a very extended family and we lived -- you know, we were very close to my grandparents.</span> <span id="s163">Very, very close to them.</span> <span id="s164">And my grandfather died on Passover, the eve Passover in '39.</span> <span id="s165">And that was a terrible thing for all of us, but in reality, we felt that he was lucky that he died then.</span> <span id="s166">Because he would never accept these _____ of shame.</span> <span id="s167">He did not wear the garb of the rebbitzin, but he was still looking like a rabbi.</span> <span id="s168">I have a picture of him I can show you later.</span> <span id="s169">You know, with the big, wide beard.</span> <span id="s170">He was a marvelous person.</span> <span id="s171">Very open-minded, very intelligent, very scholarly.</span> <span id="s172">After he died we received letters from Canada and from Australia where he had corresponded with other rabbis.</span> <span id="s173">He was a very scholarly person, he would write, he had beautiful manuscripts and manuscripts that you can never replace.</span> <span id="s174">And all that was disappeared, too, when the Germans entered.</span> <span id="s175">He was starting, in the morning, he got up at 4 o'clock to study.</span> <span id="s176">He was a very affectionate grandfather, and he had a great influence on me.</span> <span id="s177">And he was very open-minded.</span> <span id="s178">One morning we -- my oldest sister and I, we stayed with our grandfather and grandmother, because they were elderly and they were alone.</span> <span id="s179">They only lived two or three blocks from our villa, so every night we stayed with them.</span> <span id="s180">And in the morning, he would get up very early like I told you, and we would prepare the breakfast for us.</span> <span id="s181">And one morning he said to us, "I noticed that you never say a prayer when you eat breakfast."</span> <span id="s182">And that's all he said, and from that day on when we started eating he went out.</span> <span id="s183">He never said it again, just to show what type of person he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: What were your plans when you were 18 or 19 years old after you finished school?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: I didn't like school, I didn't like school at all.</span> <span id="s186">I finished because I needed to finish.</span> <span id="s187">But at that time I did not want to go on, and I started to work with my oldest sister who was making hats.</span> <span id="s188">She had learned the profession, and I was horrendous; I never was able to make a hat.</span> <span id="s189">I was very bad at it.</span> <span id="s190">Then the war started and we had to leave that city, so the hat business was dead anyway.</span> <span id="s191">But then during the war later, I went back to school, nursing school.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Is that something that came to you later or was it something that you were always interested in?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: No, I was always interested.</span> <span id="s194">I wanted to become a lawyer, but then I hated it, you see.</span> <span id="s195">I hated it ferociously for certain reasons.</span> <span id="s196">All my sisters had been fair students.</span> <span id="s197">I was not interested in studying what they were teaching me.</span> <span id="s198">I only interested in the country.</span> <span id="s199">I had read an awful lot.</span> <span id="s200">In French literature or any literature when the teacher always asked us, I'm sure nobody of you have read it, I had always read it.</span> <span id="s201">Or once upon a time I had read the book, because I read constantly.</span> <span id="s202">But then I was not interested in doing my homework and doing these things.</span> <span id="s203">So I really hated school because I knew every class the teacher would say to me, "How can you be such a student when all your sisters are so great students?"</span> <span id="s204">You know, and that did it, I hated it.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Let me ask you one question before we continue.</span> <span id="s206">It's a curious thing to me, it sounds like you had a very strong Jewish facetiousness.</span> <span id="s207">On the other hand, you had a lot of Catholic friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Growing up in France and knowing what was starting to happen in Germany, Poland, did you feel you were protected as a French citizen just like everyone else, or did you feel separate as a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s211">I felt absolutely like a French Jew.</span> <span id="s212">At that time I couldn't believe that we could be treated equally.</span> <span id="s213">First, I never thought we could lose the war.</span> <span id="s214">That was another reason.</span> <span id="s215">You know, we were sure we would win the war.</span> <span id="s216">The English and us, we would win the war.</span> <span id="s217">The Belgians and Dutch.</span> <span id="s218">You know, how can you even imagine that you are going to lose the war?</span> <span id="s219">And then there was whole year of -- almost not quite a year because it started I think in June -- I have troubling remembering months.</span> <span id="s220">But for almost a whole year there was no real war.</span> <span id="s221">You know, we were in _______ but nothing was occurring.</span> <span id="s222">The __________ line was one side; the Siegfried was on the other side and they were looking at each other but there was no real fighting going on.</span> <span id="s223">So we didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s224">And then suddenly it exploded, so that's how these things occurred.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Why did your family leave Metz and where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Oh, okay.</span> <span id="s227">In '39 just before the war was declared, about a week before the war -- there was a government appealed to all the people from Metz who could afford to leave, to leave because we were so close to the border.</span> <span id="s228">I don't know how much, that's 20 miles, 25 miles?</span> <span id="s229">I cannot tell you exactly, but it's not much more than that if I'm mistaken.</span> <span id="s230">And so we left and we went to Pratique, because Pratique was the city where we were supposed to go.</span> <span id="s231">And on top of it my father had a brother in Pratique which made the thing even easier, so we went to Pratique.</span> <span id="s232">My two brothers were in the army then.</span> <span id="s233">My oldest brother was in _________, and my youngest brother had been drafted in Tunisia.</span> <span id="s234">The war started and he stayed in Tunisia.</span> <span id="s235">So they were gone so we, the girls, and my parents and Jackie, we went to Pratique.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: What was the life like in Pratique?</span> <span id="s237">What kind of town was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: It was a complete different town.</span> <span id="s239">Metz in an industrial area, very industrial.</span> <span id="s240">It's steel -- do you know steel mines?</span> <span id="s241">A lot of foreigners, we had lots of ports and Italians were -- in the village was a whole, not in city Metz, but that gave Metz a very -- it was very -- I have to find my word -- progressive as a city.</span> <span id="s242">Politically, it was -- Metz was always very extreme right, okay?</span> <span id="s243">And the extreme right, all the newspapers of the extreme right, and they had two, were always eating -- we had an expression.</span> <span id="s244">We said they were eating Jew at every breakfast, you know.</span> <span id="s245">That was the expression.</span> <span id="s246">That was ________, and these type of newspapers.</span> <span id="s247">And Pratique in the country was very agricultural area, the whole area.</span> <span id="s248">No industry whatsoever.</span> <span id="s249">Very backwoods.</span> <span id="s250">For people who came from an industrial area, you know, it's a big difference.</span> <span id="s251">But the people they didn't accept immediately when they didn't know you, but they were very friendly.</span> <span id="s252">But what happened after when we started to have trouble, they helped us tremendously and it was always at the risk of their lives.</span> <span id="s253">Because nothing could be done with the Jews without risking your life.</span> <span id="s254">You must have heard that by other people.</span> <span id="s255">You know, whatever little thing you would do for a Jew, you were risking your life if you were caught.</span> <span id="s256">And all these people risked their lives for people that they hardly knew sometimes.</span> <span id="s257">But because they felt it was whole, and they didn't even care about the Jews.</span> <span id="s258">You know, in Pratique, you know, I have to go back to that.</span> <span id="s259">Metz was the third largest Jewish community in France before the war.</span> <span id="s260">I don't know now, but before the war.</span> <span id="s261">Pratique had three -- I think three or four Jewish communes; that was all.</span> <span id="s262">We were there for a long time, but most people didn't even know how a Jew looked.</span> <span id="s263">But because they read certain papers, they heard certain things, they didn't like Jews.</span> <span id="s264">But when they saw what happened to us, then they did not -- I don't talk about all of them.</span> <span id="s265">You know, but the majority of people in Pratique did not agree this war was going, with what happened to us there.</span> <span id="s266">And that's why it is so hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: What is the general population of Poitiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: It was about 40,000.</span> <span id="s269">I think 30 -- 20 to 40,000.</span> <span id="s270">I cannot remember, but it was a small -- much smaller town than Metz which was 60 or 70,000.</span> <span id="s271">So it was a much, much smaller town but a very old town.</span> <span id="s272">Very, very old.</span> <span id="s273">Going back to the Middle Ages, like Metz, too.</span> <span id="s274">Metz, too, is a very old town.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Coming from a religious background, if there were so few Jews there, could you maintain your community?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s277">Because all the refugees from Metz came.</span> <span id="s278">So a whole community, even our rabbis which was not any more than -- he was Rabbi Eli Block (ph) who died -- who was imported with ___________.</span> <span id="s279">And he was our rabbi for the last two or three years when I was in the [Lucerne], he became our teacher because he replaced the rabbi who had died.</span> <span id="s280">For example, he was in the German Army during the first war, and when I was six years old when he taught us the Bible, he asked who were the bad people at the Tower of Babel.</span> <span id="s281">And I just looked at him, I didn't know he was in the German Army at the time, I was six.</span> <span id="s282">And I said to him, "The Germans."</span> <span id="s283">And when I came home and I told my parents, they said, "Oh, my God."</span> <span id="s284">He was a very good friend of my grandfather.</span> <span id="s285">When he needed a week's vacation, he would always call that uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: We're going to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: So now unity was reconstituted in parts of Europe, somewhat?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Yeah, somewhat.</span> <span id="s290">Not quite, but there was quite a few people from Metz.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Was the plan to just [inaudible] or what, did you have plans?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: No, when the war started, you had to wait till you see what is going to happen.</span> <span id="s293">You cannot make plans under these conditions.</span> <span id="s294">So my brothers went away.</span> <span id="s295">My parents, we tried to survive.</span> <span id="s296">My oldest brother came back from on permission on furlough in wintertime before the war started.</span> <span id="s297">And he made us start a business there, my older sister and I. And we know was beyond Egypt.</span> <span id="s298">We started a business to make some kind of -- we had to live.</span> <span id="s299">We didn't want to be on welfare.</span> <span id="s300">That's something we -- so started a business, and it was _________, you know.</span> <span id="s301">And we had to start in women's clothing, but that was a little latter.</span> <span id="s302">That's after the Jabotinsky came in.</span> <span id="s303">But we did that to start something, to be okay and to be able to feed us.</span> <span id="s304">We were quite young.</span> <span id="s305">And on top of it, we had Germany -- and also Germany, that was a lot of difference, too.</span> <span id="s306">You know, also people when they came we had to be -- so everybody came, came to our house in Budapest; it was an open house.</span> <span id="s307">So we were -- and then the war started, and the Germans first were -- and there were refugees in the station all along the station.</span> <span id="s308">Thousands and thousands and thousands were killed.</span> <span id="s309">There was not a place, nothing.</span> <span id="s310">And they were just flying over us and just throwing bombs.</span> <span id="s311">And before we started the business and then after, too, we helped the refugees.</span> <span id="s312">My sister and I went -- my sister, Steph -- I call her Steph.</span> <span id="s313">But Stephanie and I, we went down always to the station and helped the refugees.</span> <span id="s314">And so we helped a lot of young people.</span> <span id="s315">And there I have a story, when the Bishop came to see us, the Bishop of Pratique.</span> <span id="s316">And he give me his ring to kiss, and I said, "Sir, I don't kiss it.</span> <span id="s317">I'm Jewish."</span> <span id="s318">And he said, "______.</span> <span id="s319">You should kiss my ring anyway."</span> <span id="s320">And I said I would never do it.</span> <span id="s321">And he was very upset, but I didn't kiss it.</span> <span id="s322">So, these are the kind of things for children.</span> <span id="s323">You know, I would go to church and my parents didn't mind at all that I go to church.</span> <span id="s324">But I would never -- but we had a church across the street, and when it was started, they had a huge _______, it was like a _____ to me.</span> <span id="s325">It was a bigger -- you know, it was really extremely colorful and beautiful music and all that.</span> <span id="s326">I loved to go and see that, but I never thought -- that never influenced my thinking.</span> <span id="s327">But it isn't -- and I took, when my children were bigger, I took them to church.</span> <span id="s328">It's an experience for them also as Jews.</span> <span id="s329">I never -- you know, I never closed my mind to that, even after the war.</span> <span id="s330">After all what happened, I cannot be closed-minded.</span> <span id="s331">Do not be only -- have one view of things.</span> <span id="s332">There is not just one view of things, it's a human wisdom, that's how I feel.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: So what was this in . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: That was when the Germans started to the war, but before the Germans entered, several days before -- I cannot tell you how many.</span> <span id="s335">Several days before the Italian came on the absolutely defenseless city and killed thousands and thousands of people.</span> <span id="s336">And there we had something very strange happened.</span> <span id="s337">I had just called -- because at that time we were living in that house on a hill above the station, much above the station.</span> <span id="s338">They were not hurt because the station was in a valley, and there was a hill on that side and then there is a hill on that side.</span> <span id="s339">It's very hilly.</span> <span id="s340">And I had just crossed the bridge, the bridge for people.</span> <span id="s341">You know, from -- I have to think -- for people to walk, not for cars, but _________ had just crossed it, and I was on the other side of the station when the bombardment took place.</span> <span id="s342">I was not at that time taking care of the refugees that day.</span> <span id="s343">I was going to the store after lunch.</span> <span id="s344">And when that happened, I only thought about -- when the bombardment was over, I only thought about one thing, to run home and tell my mother I was alive.</span> <span id="s345">Which she didn't know where it was, but she knew that there was a bombardment.</span> <span id="s346">So I crossed that bridge back, I was the only one crossing it.</span> <span id="s347">And I didn't think about it, and there were trains of munitions and there were people from the railroad, walkers, who were making signs, "Don't cross.</span> <span id="s348">Don't cross."</span> <span id="s349">But I was just coming.</span> <span id="s350">I wanted to tell my mother I was okay.</span> <span id="s351">That's all I thought, I didn't realize that I -- or I don't think I realized it.</span> <span id="s352">So I went home and I told my mother, but during that time my sister was looking for me because she had been somewhere else.</span> <span id="s353">And she was -- she went to all the hospitals to see if I had been hurt, because she didn't find me.</span> <span id="s354">And I was home, so . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: This must have been fairly frightening.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Oh, I was terribly frightened of the bombardment.</span> <span id="s357">Once they were bombarding, I was -- I never had lived through one before.</span> <span id="s358">I was extremely terrified.</span> <span id="s359">I wanted to be a smaller thing.</span> <span id="s360">I'm not very large, but as small as I could.</span> <span id="s361">There were old people running to houses, and I just wished the whole town -- you know, to hold me in their arms.</span> <span id="s362">That house wasn't destroyed, but it could happen.</span> <span id="s363">It was very close, but just at the beginning of the street.</span> <span id="s364">I don't remember what street, where it was.</span> <span id="s365">And then there was a second bombardment, just that I don't remember when.</span> <span id="s366">But I know there was a second bombardment, and then that was the end of that and Germany came in.</span> <span id="s367">But the Italians they were absolutely, you could see the pilots so low they were flying.</span> <span id="s368">Of course, they had not very sophisticated planes at that time, and you could see the bombs just coming out.</span> <span id="s369">That was my first experience with war.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Did you expect this at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s372">I was so indignant because I felt that they were so cowards to bombard the city without defense.</span> <span id="s373">When there were military people, ammunition in the station, you know, going through, but there was nothing to defend the city.</span> <span id="s374">And they knew that, they wanted us to be just so petrified that we accept the Germany Army when they come in.</span> <span id="s375">It was a psychological warfare.</span> <span id="s376">There was no reason, no tactical reason to do that.</span> <span id="s377">There was not industry; there was nothing there.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Do you remember the date?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: It was several days before the Germans entered.</span> <span id="s380">I cannot tell you exactly when.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Was if it was like in May 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: May -- yeah, May or June -- I cannot remember.</span> <span id="s383">Do you know I cannot remember if it was May or June?</span> <span id="s384">But it took about until June until the Germans came as far as Bastille, because they went to Elgin.</span> <span id="s385">It went fast, but still.</span> <span id="s386">Once they went -- they never hit the Russians.</span> <span id="s387">They were grounded.</span> <span id="s388">Then they came down south where there was no defense.</span> <span id="s389">And the French Army and the English Army were unable to fight them, first because the government was unbelievably bad.</span> <span id="s390">It was a very, very cowardly government.</span> <span id="s391">And then the second reason was that our army was not trained for that.</span> <span id="s392">They were thinking that it was a war like in 1914, '18 and not for 1940.</span> <span id="s393">And De Gaulle had told them what they should do, but they never listened to anything -- they know this.</span> <span id="s394">Do you know his book was read by Hitler, and he used it?</span> <span id="s395">But see, the French didn't know.</span> <span id="s396">They were never very good -- how do you call that?</span> <span id="s397">In your own country, you are recognized for what you are.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: So describe to me when the Germans came in, what that was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: I was walking the streets with my older sister, Sissie, and we sort of felt Germans, what do you say, we just felt them coming.</span> <span id="s400">And I told my sister, "I wish I could kill them."</span> <span id="s401">And at that time -- at that moment in time, they didn't get killed but they fell, and I couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s402">I said, "Did I do it?"</span> <span id="s403">I didn't do it.</span> <span id="s404">It just happened, a coincidence.</span> <span id="s405">But that was my first German I saw.</span> <span id="s406">In the beginning it was horrible.</span> <span id="s407">You know, I have to experience something.</span> <span id="s408">You know, before the war I was very idealistic.</span> <span id="s409">I was an absolute pacifist.</span> <span id="s410">I only think war cannot do anything for us.</span> <span id="s411">War cannot help anybody, what I thought at that time.</span> <span id="s412">But when I saw the Germans' picture in the Champs Élysées in Paris, you know, parading, that is when it just took a hold at last.</span> <span id="s413">And from that day on, I think we have to get out.</span> <span id="s414">But in the beginning I couldn't do anything much.</span> <span id="s415">But in the very beginning when the Germans, they were very polite.</span> <span id="s416">They were extremely -- in France.</span> <span id="s417">They did not behave that way in Poland or Russia or wherever or Czechoslovakia, but in France they had orders and they were extremely polite.</span> <span id="s418">And they were even courteous, and they had rules.</span> <span id="s419">So they did not bother us the first few months, but we didn't press them.</span> <span id="s420">We knew that they could not stay like that forever.</span> <span id="s421">But we didn't know what would happen, we were just waiting.</span> <span id="s422">And then my brother who was in Majdanek, he was in prison.</span> <span id="s423">He was a prisoner of the Germans in Majdanek.</span> <span id="s424">And his cousin, too, from _________.</span> <span id="s425">He was able to escape from there, and he walked through Alsace, it was wintertime.</span> <span id="s426">And he was made prisoner in June or May -- I don't remember, but he was a prisoner until about December.</span> <span id="s427">And then in December he was able to escape, and he crossed over there by foot because he had no way of going.</span> <span id="s428">He had civilian clothes, but he had no papers.</span> <span id="s429">All his military papers would show that he was a POW.</span> <span id="s430">And then he arrived finally in Alsace, where he had a business -- he had a very good business there.</span> <span id="s431">So he told all his clients, he called them and told them he was there and he sold everything.</span> <span id="s432">He had a men's fashion store.</span> <span id="s433">You know, they had all custom-made costumes.</span> <span id="s434">They made suits and things like that.</span> <span id="s435">So he sold everything he had in his store -- so we got some money, we lived on that.</span> <span id="s436">He is the one who really helped to hold together _______ and he came to Pratique finally.</span> <span id="s437">After Helsinger, he was able to take a train and he came to Pratique, and he stayed a month in Pratique with us and he met my sister-in-law who was my best friend.</span> <span id="s438">And they got in love, first time.</span> <span id="s439">First night.</span> <span id="s440">And we knew that could be very serious.</span> <span id="s441">Then he tried to escape with a cousin who was German, who was living with us, too.</span> <span id="s442">They were caught by a German patrol when they tried to cross into French Vichy.</span> <span id="s443">Because my brother's plan was to go to Vichy, France.</span> <span id="s444">Go to Spain and go to _________.</span> <span id="s445">But he was caught then and he was in prison for months.</span> <span id="s446">But the Germans were -- that was still at the time when the Germans were not nasty yet.</span> <span id="s447">They did not -- they looked at these people, but did not see that he was a prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s448">Because if he was not a prisoner of war, he'd be dead.</span> <span id="s449">But there was no people's organization, so they should have understood.</span> <span id="s450">Luckily for him, they did not see, they never noticed that Oscar was a German citizen.</span> <span id="s451">So they both were months in prison and then they came out.</span> <span id="s452">Then they went back again.</span> <span id="s453">They escaped again.</span> <span id="s454">And the way they escaped is how the same place where they escaped at a later time.</span> <span id="s455">But they escaped, then my sister-in-law must know.</span> <span id="s456">My sister-in-law, she went with her friends to join him, and she told him that she had to __________ or we get married; that's it.</span> <span id="s457">So they got married.</span> <span id="s458">They never went to Luck.</span> <span id="s459">But they stopped at the . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: We'll talk about that later.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: Right.</span> <span id="s462">But I come back to Batik, so my oldest brother was going to Vichy, France, and we stayed in Batik.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: Let me ask you a question first.</span> <span id="s464">How quickly was the country divided between Vichy and . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Immediately, immediately.</span> <span id="s466">As soon as the government of France signed whatever.</span> <span id="s467">Do you know -- I don't know if you call that an armistice or a peace, but at that time it was immediately.</span> <span id="s468">And we were just a few kilometers from the line which divided French, occupied in French -- Batik.</span> <span id="s469">And then my second brother, Arnold, went to Tunisia, he went south, and immediately and he joined my brother in ________.</span> <span id="s470">My brother by then was married to my sister-in-law, and when we stayed __________, our store with clothes that the Germans came in '41, beginning '41.</span> <span id="s471">I cannot remember the time.</span> <span id="s472">And so we had nothing, nothing -- no income anymore.</span> <span id="s473">But my brother was helping us.</span> <span id="s474">He gave us all the money we needed to live on.</span> <span id="s475">And I started to work in the city hall, in a French office of dealing with the Germans.</span> <span id="s476">You know, they gave us all the requisitions, what they want from us and we had to deliver.</span> <span id="s477">And I was one in that department, that French office which dealt with the Germans constantly.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: You spoke German?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: Oh, I speak fluently.</span> <span id="s480">In Metz, we always spoke German and French.</span> <span id="s481">My parents until 1918, people had no right to speak French.</span> <span id="s482">My father was arrested by the Germans in 1917 or '18 and put in prison for a few days because they said, "Your neighbor said that you have spoken French."</span> <span id="s483">The poor man didn't even know what was French.</span> <span id="s484">So he was in prison but he was released because they understood that he didn't speak any French, so he couldn't have done it.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Now, when you were working in this office, did they know you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s487">The Germans?</span> <span id="s488">No, they didn't know it.</span> <span id="s489">They never asked.</span> <span id="s490">That was before they were all -- you know, the yellow star and all that, that was before.</span> <span id="s491">I worked there several months and it was friendly because the Germans were telling me that I was a real German, and I was from Metz and I had the German name.</span> <span id="s492">And I was very blonde with light eyes and light skin, so they think I'm a real German.</span> <span id="s493">And they felt that I should come to Germany, so they offered me jobs, you know, in government in Germany if I wanted to.</span> <span id="s494">And I said no, and I told some of them that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s495">And two or three of them, when I told them I am Jewish, they didn't care.</span> <span id="s496">But only two of them, and then I lost my job.</span> <span id="s497">You know, because the government did not accept any more -- the Germans did not accept any more of the Jews at work.</span> <span id="s498">But we still didn't wear the yellow star, but much earlier -- I don't remember when either, but much earlier -- they had an edict that all Jewish fathers had to come and declare the whole family.</span> <span id="s499">If not, we would be killed.</span> <span id="s500">So my father like all fathers went to declare his own family.</span> <span id="s501">It was pretentious not to for him, and we never discussed it even.</span> <span id="s502">He just went because he felt he had to do it, and who was to think that we would be killed?</span> <span id="s503">So that's how it seems, so we were declared but we had no star yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: So what sort of restrictions were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Oh, the restrictions on Jews started after the war started with the Russians.</span> <span id="s506">Then is when it really started.</span> <span id="s507">You know, say where the restrictions -- I cannot remember, but real restrictions, the yellow star and all that, really started after the war started with the Russians.</span> <span id="s508">Because when I was working at that French office at the city hall, I know I was not wearing the yellow star.</span> <span id="s509">And I know that, you know, that I remember.</span> <span id="s510">All that happened after, so I know that these things occurred.</span> <span id="s511">And the Russian -- the war with the Russians started at that time, when I was in that office.</span> <span id="s512">So I know that everything started with that.</span> <span id="s513">That much, I am sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: So that was June of '45?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Yeah, I cannot -- do you know I have trouble remembering dates?</span> <span id="s516">But anyway then . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: So up until this time there was no restriction on your movements or anything you wanted to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: No.</span> <span id="s519">That started once we had the yellow star and all that.</span> <span id="s520">But they had closed our store like they did before.</span> <span id="s521">Because I went to the -- that they had closed the store already.</span> <span id="s522">Because we had to declare what was a Jewish store.</span> <span id="s523">That they had done already because if not, I would not have been working in the office.</span> <span id="s524">So I know that that had already occurred.</span> <span id="s525">But even then we were helped by so many people who came to us and said, "You can hide your stuff in our homes."</span> <span id="s526">And they gave it back, they gave it back after the war.</span> <span id="s527">And the girls transported some suitcases with what we had in the store, you know.</span> <span id="s528">Because it took many -- and the funny thing was one of the Germans helped us carry the suitcases.</span> <span id="s529">Because they felt, "Oh, Mädchen, you can't carry that suitcase.</span> <span id="s530">It's too heavy for you."</span> <span id="s531">So they helped us.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: When you talk about the restrictions after the war started with Russia, other than the Jewish star, what sorts of things?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: Every day there was a edict read.</span> <span id="s534">Every day an edict on the walls for us and it was always punished by death.</span> <span id="s535">Everything was verboten.</span> <span id="s536">But always punishment was never something else than death.</span> <span id="s537">We had edicts put on the walls; every day there were new edicts.</span> <span id="s538">First, we had no right to go to a store and buy food or anything else until 4 o'clock in afternoon.</span> <span id="s539">We had to wear the yellow star so we were recognized immediately.</span> <span id="s540">And if you did not have the yellow star sown on your clothes, you were arrested.</span> <span id="s541">One of my younger sisters was just a little girl was arrested by a German with the SS, and he brought her home.</span> <span id="s542">And he said to my mother, "If I find her once more without the star attached," -- not safety pin, but, you know, how do you call it?</span> <span id="s543">I cannot remember the word in English.</span> <span id="s544">You know, one goes into the other?</span> <span id="s545">Well, do you know you sew one on top and one underneath and you put them . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Snap?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: A snap, yeah.</span> <span id="s548">She had put snaps on, because we had to change every day and then we had to sew it on.</span> <span id="s549">So she felt -- she put it on the snaps everywhere.</span> <span id="s550">So he told my mother if she had snaps one more time, "I kill her."</span> <span id="s551">But luckily [inaudible] , so he brought her home.</span> <span id="s552">And she was 14, 13, something like that.</span> <span id="s553">But at that time they did not arrest Germans.</span> <span id="s554">They arrested what they called the poor ______ , which that was just, you know, that was just a joke.</span> <span id="s555">It was the French were next.</span> <span id="s556">But once the population can see, if only that's __________, they don't for French citizens.</span> <span id="s557">Then they stopped the French, too, after.</span> <span id="s558">So I lost my job in the city hall.</span> <span id="s559">I was -- the gendarmes came in.</span> <span id="s560">They were German's gendarmes, and they came in and they said, "All Jews out."</span> <span id="s561">And on the spot, you had to pay and pick up your things.</span> <span id="s562">And my chief tried to keep us, we were three Jewish girls and no way.</span> <span id="s563">We were all from Metz, because we all spoke German even, that's why.</span> <span id="s564">So they did not let us _______.</span> <span id="s565">They were sure we'd leave, so that was that.</span> <span id="s566">So after that I had to find something else to do, and in between I had left my fiancé, and he was a medical student.</span> <span id="s567">And then one day just talking, I say to him, "What about the _________?"</span> <span id="s568">And from that moment on, I had no chance at all.</span> <span id="s569">I had to do it.</span> <span id="s570">I had no more chance; I had to do it because I had gotten -- I had found the idea that was the right thing to do.</span> <span id="s571">So that's what happened, so that's why I went into Nazi . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s572">End of Tape 1.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: You were starting to tell me about some of the restrictions there were on Jewish people.</span> <span id="s575">I don't know if there were any restrictions on French people, but . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: Not the same.</span> <span id="s577">There were restrictions.</span> <span id="s578">For example, there was -- how do you -- oh, I cannot find the word.</span> <span id="s579">Do you know at a certain hour of the night you had to be in.</span> <span id="s580">Strange because I know these words, but I cannot remember it.</span> <span id="s581">But anyway, for us the restrictions were unbelievable, and they changed every day.</span> <span id="s582">They added some every day.</span> <span id="s583">I told you we had no right to go into a store before 4 o'clock.</span> <span id="s584">4:00 or 4:30, I don't remember exactly, but about that time.</span> <span id="s585">And at that time, there was nothing left because everybody had coupons to buy everything.</span> <span id="s586">You couldn't buy things freely; there was nothing to be had freely, even milk or butter or whatever.</span> <span id="s587">Eggs, you had to have coupons for everything.</span> <span id="s588">So -- but we were very lucky because my mother was very liked by all the people where she brought things for the family.</span> <span id="s589">And they told her not to worry, all of them told her not to worry.</span> <span id="s590">That any time she wants something, to let them know and they will have things ready for her, put her away for her for after 4 o'clock.</span> <span id="s591">So we never missed anything.</span> <span id="s592">We were never -- we always had enough food.</span> <span id="s593">Like also other French; there was not too much, but we had as much as all the other French people.</span> <span id="s594">We had never missed, and then they were also restriction you had no right to have a radio.</span> <span id="s595">You had no right to have a telephone.</span> <span id="s596">You could not use a public telephone.</span> <span id="s597">You couldn't go into any public space like the Post Office.</span> <span id="s598">You had no right -- the wife of the Rabbi Eli Block I mentioned before, she went into the Post Office and make a phone call.</span> <span id="s599">And she was arrested with her little girl and taken to the Gestapo, and the rabbi went and tried to -- he always discussed things with the Germans.</span> <span id="s600">He was an organizer, and he spoke German very well, too.</span> <span id="s601">So he always talked with the community, but there he talked for his wife and child.</span> <span id="s602">So they arrested him, too.</span> <span id="s603">But that was after we left.</span> <span id="s604">Before we left, he was still around, okay.</span> <span id="s605">And he had organized -- the children were in the camp.</span> <span id="s606">There was a camp in Batik, the outskirts of Batik, that the children in the camp can get out and be kept by a family, you know.</span> <span id="s607">So he had a little boy, too: Padova (ph).</span> <span id="s608">I cannot remember his first name, but his last name was Padova.</span> <span id="s609">And his parents were deported, and he stayed with us.</span> <span id="s610">But at night the rabbi had a place where they all -- all these kids were sleeping.</span> <span id="s611">They were in our house in daytime; they came home from school, came to our house.</span> <span id="s612">We fed them and we did their homework with them.</span> <span id="s613">We took care of them like a child of our family, and when Padova, the little boy, he was about 11 -- when he noticed that we were going to leave, when he heard that, he begged us to take him with us.</span> <span id="s614">And we went to the rabbi and told him everything.</span> <span id="s615">What should we do?</span> <span id="s616">And he said, "You cannot take him with you.</span> <span id="s617">If you take Padova, all the children will be arrested."</span> <span id="s618">We still were at that time following the orders because we thought -- we never thought that they were all going to be killed anyway, so what's the difference?</span> <span id="s619">You know, at least you've saved one.</span> <span id="s620">But we didn't understand that, we had no idea what was.</span> <span id="s621">We knew it was bad, but we never imagined how bad it was at the time.</span> <span id="s622">It was impossible to imagine that.</span> <span id="s623">Until the end of the war, we never knew what was going on, even if my own sister was deported.</span> <span id="s624">We never knew.</span> <span id="s625">So that was -- but before Padova, the story of Padova that was just when we left.</span> <span id="s626">Before that my sister was arrested at home at dinnertime because she had done things for the underground, but personally we never belonged to the underground.</span> <span id="s627">We never belonged to Reseau, what we call it, Reseau.</span> <span id="s628">That means a group of underground.</span> <span id="s629">But we did a lot of things.</span> <span id="s630">For example, we didn't even know where they came from, but people would ring our bell and say, "We know that you -- we have heard that you can help us cross the water."</span> <span id="s631">So we helped them cross the water by sending them to a farmer where my brother had crossed the second time, my two brothers had crossed and successfully.</span> <span id="s632">That farmer in -- I don't remember the village where he was, but that farmer had a farm which was ascribed both lines.</span> <span id="s633">You know, you could go on his land you went on both sides, so it was a very good way to cross.</span> <span id="s634">I even crossed there in '41, I crossed there to go to see my brother in -- no, not in Arlise.</span> <span id="s635">St. Marie De Mare (ph).</span> <span id="s636">They were just married and my sister-in-law was pregnant, and I went to see them for the summer.</span> <span id="s637">Do you realize that we lived as normally as possible, we did not let these Germans stop us from walking on.</span> <span id="s638">That was after I lost my job.</span> <span id="s639">I think it was after I lost my job in the city hall, and I had not registered.</span> <span id="s640">I had not started nursing school yet.</span> <span id="s641">So that's when that happened, so that was in '41.</span> <span id="s642">And yeah, because my nephew was born in February '42, so -- I've got remember where I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Well, question: When you got help from these farmers who let people get across, did you have to pay them anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s645">Nothing, they didn't accept any money.</span> <span id="s646">These people did it just to be helpful.</span> <span id="s647">And that happened, one of the persons my sister helped, I helped her -- we were both doing it.</span> <span id="s648">But we helped one person cross, and that person had forgotten in our house his tobacco card, which was valuable, very valuable for bartering.</span> <span id="s649">Because if you didn't smoke, then you could barter it for other things.</span> <span id="s650">Food, for other things.</span> <span id="s651">So he wrote to us and asked him to send him the card, and my sister sent him the card through the farmer.</span> <span id="s652">We couldn't communicate with France -- okay, unoccupied France directly, but we sent that to the farmer who sent it on the other side in a mailbox to the south of France.</span> <span id="s653">And that letter was caught, and she did a terrible mistake.</span> <span id="s654">We never understood, she signed her real name which we never did.</span> <span id="s655">We knew as much, that you never signed a letter.</span> <span id="s656">And why did she do it that day?</span> <span id="s657">We don't know, but she signed the letter.</span> <span id="s658">And during the day, the day she was arrested, the farmer's son, one farmer's son came to the house from his farm which was perhaps 12 kilometers from Poitiers, I don't know exactly, by bicycle, to warn us that a German had gotten that letter, had arrested his father and his oldest brother and were questioning them.</span> <span id="s659">And his father didn't know who Stephanie Hoffnung, so we knew that, so we didn't even think that she should escape.</span> <span id="s660">You know, she stayed there.</span> <span id="s661">And at night at dinnertime, because every night, that was another restriction -- every night after sundown, the Germans would come and make an appeal to see if we were all present.</span> <span id="s662">To make sure we are there every night, the SS.</span> <span id="s663">And that night an SS we had never seen before, a _______, which means a noncommissioned officer, a horrible looking guy.</span> <span id="s664">He was very taller than I, horrible.</span> <span id="s665">He came with two other guys, two other SS and they arrested my sister.</span> <span id="s666">We were eating, you know.</span> <span id="s667">And Jackie was at the table.</span> <span id="s668">We were eating cherries, we were at the dessert; we were eating cherries.</span> <span id="s669">And Jackie took out -- he was about four, five at the most, I don't remember what age exactly.</span> <span id="s670">About five at the most, he took out the pits and threw them at the Germans, and I looked at him.</span> <span id="s671">And in front of the Germans, I said to him in French, I said, "Jackie, a Frenchman is always polite.</span> <span id="s672">Never doubt that."</span> <span id="s673">I was afraid they kill that kid.</span> <span id="s674">So he didn't do it anymore, but the Germans didn't do anything against him.</span> <span id="s675">But they arrested my sister, they were satisfied with that.</span> <span id="s676">They took her away, and then about two hours later, they came back and arrested my father.</span> <span id="s677">But they released him several hours later, and my father tried to help my sister but there was nothing he could do.</span> <span id="s678">They wanted her to tell them that she had written to that farmer, because that farmer was helping people cross and she said she doesn't know anything about it.</span> <span id="s679">She cannot tell them, she maintained that.</span> <span id="s680">And they told her that she's fresh, and they told my father that they keep her because he raised her bad and she's fresh.</span> <span id="s681">And that's what killed her, because she would absolutely not say anything against the farmer.</span> <span id="s682">She would have died before she did.</span> <span id="s683">She died because of it.</span> <span id="s684">And the farmer was released because they had no proof.</span> <span id="s685">So she was kept in prison for one month.</span> <span id="s686">She became 21 in prison in Pratique on the 10th of July she became 21.</span> <span id="s687">And then she was deported to -- she was moved to -- no, she was first in a camp in Poitiers, in the outskirts of Poitiers there was a camp.</span> <span id="s688">And she was in that camp, and that's why we escaped because we hoped that she could escape, too.</span> <span id="s689">We had arranged help that she could escape because until then, she had several times the opportunity to escape.</span> <span id="s690">And she wouldn't because she was organizing everything of the camp.</span> <span id="s691">In prison, too, she had been a leader.</span> <span id="s692">Prisoners who were not Jewish came to see us after they were released, political prisoners.</span> <span id="s693">And they told us what a great leader she is and how she kept morale of everybody up, and that she, you know, organized the prison, how to behave in prison.</span> <span id="s694">How to do everything.</span> <span id="s695">And she did the same, she was the most educated in that camp, as much as I can tell and she took over the whole organization.</span> <span id="s696">And she told us, because we have the guard who we knew very well.</span> <span id="s697">He was one of the kids who had walked with us to the station.</span> <span id="s698">You know, when we helped the refugees.</span> <span id="s699">And we were very, very friendly, and he accepted her to make her escape, but she said she couldn't do that because of the people would be killed.</span> <span id="s700">The Germans always told them if they tried to escape, they would kill her.</span> <span id="s701">But the guards were French, the Germans came in only every morning.</span> <span id="s702">But at night there was no guard -- no German, so the French guard wanted to make her escape and he would have escaped with her, not to be arrested.</span> <span id="s703">But she refused them, but later she understood what mistake it was.</span> <span id="s704">But then I had organized everything; she was a medical student.</span> <span id="s705">I was a nurse, a student nurse in that hospital.</span> <span id="s706">My fiancé was a medical student, and her boyfriend was a medical student, all in that same university.</span> <span id="s707">And all my classmates were ready to help, everybody helped us there.</span> <span id="s708">First, when I was accepted in that school, nobody -- when I told them, you know, I'm Jewish, they said, "Who cares?</span> <span id="s709">That has no meaning for us."</span> <span id="s710">You know, the French administration, the directors of the school, the picture I showed you earlier of my classmates, the directors of the school and our instructor in that picture, too.</span> <span id="s711">And they said, "We couldn't care less.</span> <span id="s712">You are French person.</span> <span id="s713">You want to come in nursing school, you come in nursing school."</span> <span id="s714">And they accepted me, and I was protected there.</span> <span id="s715">When Germans came to arrest patients, it was Catholic nuns who directed the transport.</span> <span id="s716">The school was a Red Cross school, which was separate.</span> <span id="s717">But we all, you know, did all our work, practical work in the hospital, and the hospital of the university was by then at that time completely run by the Catholic nuns.</span> <span id="s718">And the Catholic nuns would be warned if the Germans were arriving and they hid me, so that they don't see me.</span> <span id="s719">Because the director of the hospital said to me, "You are not going to wear the yellow star in the hospital.</span> <span id="s720">I don't want to see it."</span> <span id="s721">And I didn't wear it, but they knew that they would arrest me because I don't wear it.</span> <span id="s722">That was already the best punishment, just for that.</span> <span id="s723">So they hid me every time that the Germans came to arrest people, take them to the stations in the barracks.</span> <span id="s724">You know, old people, young people, whatever they -- whoever they wanted, not just Jews but whoever they felt they should arrest.</span> <span id="s725">It was enough that somebody tell them it's a Communist, even if it was absolutely not true, then they would arrest.</span> <span id="s726">But my sister then she -- we had arranged, I had seen one of the doctors at the hospital.</span> <span id="s727">And we had arranged that she wasn't feeling well, she had a kidney problem, a serious kidney problem and he knew that.</span> <span id="s728">So I had discussed that with him, and he agreed that if she is coming to the hospital the morning we were escaping, then he would treat -- the hospital and then he didn't know anything else, but all my classmates, her boyfriend -- my fiancé said -- as soon she arrives in the hospital, they get her out and get her across the border.</span> <span id="s729">But unfortunately, the morning she was supposed to be there, she was supposed to go to the hospital, the little SS came.</span> <span id="s730">And when he -- you Ametz appealed to her to stand there for hours.</span> <span id="s731">He -- seven people were on the side to go to the hospital, and he said to them, "Nobody goes to the hospital."</span> <span id="s732">That was a combination, because after that they knew we had gone, so then she had no more chance.</span> <span id="s733">So that was it.</span> <span id="s734">So from the camp of Poitiers, she was later sent to Drancy, and from Drancy she was sent to Pithiviers, which is between Paris and Orleans.</span> <span id="s735">And from Pithiviers, she was deported on the day of Yom Kippur, 8-42 to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s736">And we know she went to Auschwitz because I have the book saying that her convoy went to Auschwitz in three days.</span> <span id="s737">And we got cards; after the war was finished, her boyfriend had received a card that she had smuggled out on the day of Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s738">It was a nurse of the camp, and the card said she couldn't write to us.</span> <span id="s739">But she wrote to him, and he was in Poitiers.</span> <span id="s740">And she -- which isn't very far from Pithiviers, and that card -- he gave me that card when he met me after the war.</span> <span id="s741">And in that card, she told that they are leaving, the morale excellent.</span> <span id="s742">They prayed and fasted all day on Yom Kippur; they didn't know how much fasting they would do afterwards.</span> <span id="s743">And she was deported that day.</span> <span id="s744">She wrote to us that she would try by all means, we had the code to make little points on those certain letters.</span> <span id="s745">The Germans, if they had found the card with that, would have absolutely known what the code means.</span> <span id="s746">They would have broken the code in no time, but she wrote, "I will sabotage my work as much as I can."</span> <span id="s747">She didn't realize, we didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s748">It was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s749">But anyway, she was deported, but in between we decided to leave so that she can escape.</span> <span id="s750">And because that things were getting worse and worse, so we knew it was time.</span> <span id="s751">It was right after I was a graduate of the first year of nursing, and all my classmates helped.</span> <span id="s752">Everybody helped.</span> <span id="s753">My fiance helped.</span> <span id="s754">The neighbors helped, they came and took our belongings out of the house with their bicycles.</span> <span id="s755">We got everything back after the war, but one family didn't -- was not honest.</span> <span id="s756">But, otherwise, they all would give us back everything we left.</span> <span id="s757">You know, all that was risking their lives, and the night before we left -- oh, I have first to talk about something else.</span> <span id="s758">Several weeks earlier, a man I had worked with at the city hall, I knew him but not very much.</span> <span id="s759">His name is Albert Charpentier, C-h-a-r-p-e-n-t-i-e-r, and his wife, I have paper here telling me the name of his wife who died, too, now.</span> <span id="s760">And not -- his son, but I can show you the paper later.</span> <span id="s761">And it said Mr. Charpentier came to the house and told me -- because he knew me -- and said, "I know that you need peoples without those damn Jews."</span> <span id="s762">Because on top of it, all of our identity cards had the stamp Jew.</span> <span id="s763">So he said, "I have to" -- "I can give you cards for everybody in your family."</span> <span id="s764">And I asked him how much it would cost, and his response was to say, "How can you ask me how much it can cost?</span> <span id="s765">Such a thing, you don't pay for.</span> <span id="s766">I do it because that's what I believe in."</span> <span id="s767">And he was a poor man, he was not a rich man at all at that time.</span> <span id="s768">And he did it, he gave us cards and that's why we could escape.</span> <span id="s769">Because as long we had the Jew stamped, we could not walk anywhere, couldn't go out of the city.</span> <span id="s770">So he saved the life of my whole family, and for -- he didn't -- but I have to say that.</span> <span id="s771">I forgot.</span> <span id="s772">That Mr. Charpentier since he was very young had worked for one of the three or four Jewish families who lived in Poitiers for a long time and had a store.</span> <span id="s773">And he was there, and he loved them because they had always been extremely nice to him.</span> <span id="s774">And he told me how I will never forget what the Forshan (ph), that's the name of the Jewish family, who survived.</span> <span id="s775">They were not deported.</span> <span id="s776">What's -- undoubtedly, he did cards for them, too.</span> <span id="s777">Never asked, but the Forshan, I'll never forget what they did for me and my family and what I can do for Jews, you're all French and I will do that for you peoples.</span> <span id="s778">I want you to be safe.</span> <span id="s779">I cannot accept that that will be.</span> <span id="s780">And that's what we heard.</span> <span id="s781">You know, when we walked in the street when we start to wear the star, old men -- very proper old men, you know, because they used to love the little nobility in Poitiers.</span> <span id="s782">I told you it's a very backwoods country, very right wing.</span> <span id="s783">They would cross the street towards us to come on your side.</span> <span id="s784">They salute us and say, "We do not agree."</span> <span id="s785">Constantly, it was not just an accident; it was constant.</span> <span id="s786">Not everybody did, but it happened many, many, many times.</span> <span id="s787">They would come to my mother who spoke no -- very little French, because in Metz my parents were raised in Germany.</span> <span id="s788">They were not raised -- they spoke beautiful German.</span> <span id="s789">That's why we all spoke German, and with my parents we never spoke French.</span> <span id="s790">We spoke German, but sisters and brothers, we all spoke French.</span> <span id="s791">We never spoke German and we never do.</span> <span id="s792">But at table we would go from one language, and my parents understood what we were saying.</span> <span id="s793">For a long time we didn't know that, and we thought we can say things we shouldn't.</span> <span id="s794">And then when they would discover what that's about, but that was when we were teenagers.</span> <span id="s795">But my parents spoke French, they understood it but they spoke comically.</span> <span id="s796">It was not what it should have been because they learned it when they were adults and they never went to school.</span> <span id="s797">My mother was very educated in German, but not in French.</span> <span id="s798">My father was not very educated, he knew how to read and write and more than that, but he was not educated like my mother.</span> <span id="s799">He didn't come from the same background, so it was a different -- and he had lost his mother when he was three years old.</span> <span id="s800">So it was a complete different way of life.</span> <span id="s801">But I come back to Poitiers.</span> <span id="s802">The night before we . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Actually, before you move on, may I ask you a couple of questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: You mentioned that the Germans would come in and arrest people.</span> <span id="s806">Was this a common thing on the streets and in businesses that there were a lot of arrests or deportations in Poitiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: They did not do it so much in the streets.</span> <span id="s808">They arrested people, yes.</span> <span id="s809">They arrested people in the streets, but they always tried in the streets at the beginning, the very beginning, to make it very quiet, peaceful.</span> <span id="s810">But in the houses, they came at night when nobody had the right to be in the street.</span> <span id="s811">You know, after curfew.</span> <span id="s812">That's the word I was looking for.</span> <span id="s813">After curfew.</span> <span id="s814">So people were not in the streets, they didn't know.</span> <span id="s815">But when my sister was arrested, I don't know it happened, all my friends knew it in a few minutes and several came with their bicycles at the risk of their lives, because it was curfew, to see who was arrested.</span> <span id="s816">They knew one of the girls, Hoffnung, was arrested, but they didn't know which.</span> <span id="s817">But anyway, they wanted to express their, you know, their sympathy and help us if they could.</span> <span id="s818">And I had one good friend in my class who liked me a lot, and she came and just embraced me and said, "Oh, my God, I'm so happy.</span> <span id="s819">I was afraid it was you."</span> <span id="s820">And I almost killed her, I was so mad.</span> <span id="s821">I said, "How can you say that when it's my own sister who got arrested?"</span> <span id="s822">I was so horrified that she said that, and she felt terrible but she said, "Don't you realize that I know you, I don't know her much?"</span> <span id="s823">But I felt that it was atrocious, what she said.</span> <span id="s824">So this type of things happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: So you were trying to live as normal a life as possible, but clearly this wasn't very normal.</span> <span id="s826">Did you feel safe?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: No, we didn't feel safe, but that's why we escaped.</span> <span id="s828">Mostly, we felt unsafe until my sister was arrested, because we wanted her to be able to get out of there.</span> <span id="s829">I went to that -- my mother asked me constantly to go and see that little Hipp, was the filthy SS, his name was H-i-p-p.</span> <span id="s830">And to see him and try to convince him to get my sister out and I tried, but he told me the last time I talked to him -- it was in the street because when I went to the office of the SS, he wouldn't even accept to see me.</span> <span id="s831">But in the street I met him and I went to him, and he said, "Mädchen, if you come one pace closer to me, I have you arrested."</span> <span id="s832">So what could I do?</span> <span id="s833">It was no help if I got arrested.</span> <span id="s834">My family needed me, too.</span> <span id="s835">So I would have traded with my sister with pleasure, but I could not be arrested on top of her because what would have happened to my family then?</span> <span id="s836">I organized the whole departure from Poitiers then.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: We've got to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: Change the tape . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: Could I just before we start -- oh, yeah, I know.</span> <span id="s841">I was asking her a couple of questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: About Poitiers before we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Correct.</span> <span id="s844">Before you leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: Just, by the way, did you -- when your sister was arrested and she was a prisoner, then she was in Pithiviers?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: First in the camp and then to Drancy and Pithiviers.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Did you have any communication with her during this period?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: In Poitiers?</span> <span id="s850">In prison we couldn't see her, they wouldn't let us, but when she went to the camp, we could visit her in the camp and we did visit her in the camp.</span> <span id="s851">It was all day, it was manned by the French, and at night -- only in the morning did the Germans come to make appell and give all the bad orders and, you know, do all the stupid things they had to do, they wanted to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: What was the name of that camp?</span> <span id="s853">Did it have a name?</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: I don't remember a name.</span> <span id="s855">We called it Cote de Poitiers (ph) .</span> <span id="s856">I don't know if that's the name; my brother told me something and I forgot.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: What was it like from your . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: It was, you know, like a camp.</span> <span id="s859">It was with barbed wire and entrance, but it was only French people.</span> <span id="s860">When we had the right to visit, there were only French guards, and they were not nasty to the camp -- to the people in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: The conditions weren't bad?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: How can conditions be good in a camp?</span> <span id="s863">We brought the food.</span> <span id="s864">We had the right to bring food.</span> <span id="s865">There were cousins there, too, you know.</span> <span id="s866">Cousins of my mother.</span> <span id="s867">One cousin of my mother was in that camp, too.</span> <span id="s868">And I tell you, when we talked to her, she always had the marvelous morale.</span> <span id="s869">Or at least she made believe she had a marvelous morale.</span> <span id="s870">She always said things are good, "I am going to get this done."</span> <span id="s871">She always talked about doing the most harm to the Germans she can do.</span> <span id="s872">That's all she had in mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: You talked a little bit about helping people get to the unoccupied France.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: Do you have any sense of -- that mostly was just showing them where to go and where to cross?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s877">We sent them, we didn't show them.</span> <span id="s878">We didn't take them there, but we gave them -- not a map, but we explained to them how to go there, and we got in touch always with the farmer and told him they're coming.</span> <span id="s879">They couldn't, he wouldn't have accept to just take people without knowing who they are.</span> <span id="s880">But if they were recommended by us, he would do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: How many people do you think you helped?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: I don't know exactly, I cannot remember.</span> <span id="s883">Perhaps 10.</span> <span id="s884">Then my whole family, but not the same place.</span> <span id="s885">Because after my sister was arrested, that farm was -- that was not anymore ________, I don't know if that's English.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: One other question before you continue: I'm curious what the French attitude was toward the Vichy government?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: Oh, that's very important.</span> <span id="s888">In the very beginning, very beginning, Vichy -- Pétain was considered like a god.</span> <span id="s889">You know, he was a hero of first world war.</span> <span id="s890">I cannot stand him, and I know why he was a hero.</span> <span id="s891">His main reason to be a hero is because there were riots in the trenches and he had the people shot.</span> <span id="s892">You know, the people rioting, the people who were rioting in the trenches for so many years.</span> <span id="s893">And instead of trying to make life easier, he just had shot certain number of them, and that riot was over, okay?</span> <span id="s894">He became a hero due to that; that's not a hero for me as a general.</span> <span id="s895">He was not as specific -- Jaffa and Frisch were not better generals than he was.</span> <span id="s896">But I talk about names that people in America don't know much about.</span> <span id="s897">These were our big generals for World War I, but Pétain had a reputation.</span> <span id="s898">And, you know, once people believe in a man, they think he cannot do anything wrong.</span> <span id="s899">So in the beginning, he confused many, many French people who thought that they had to go along with Pétain.</span> <span id="s900">But slowly, slowly people start to understand, mostly when the Germans behaved like that in occupied France, how horrible that was.</span> <span id="s901">And in unoccupied France, and then anyway, in '42 I think November if I remember, once were in unoccupied France, once the Americans landed in North Africa, all France was occupied, even the South of France.</span> <span id="s902">Everything was occupied by the Germans, but they never, never were able to make the same orders in the north.</span> <span id="s903">We had identity cards for Jews.</span> <span id="s904">I didn't and my family didn't anymore because we had changed our cards.</span> <span id="s905">But I think that that's what is ahead, I cannot even -- I am not even sure that they have to stamp Jew, but I think.</span> <span id="s906">But nobody, nobody ever wore a yellow star in the South of France.</span> <span id="s907">Even after the Germans were there, nobody.</span> <span id="s908">We were not deprived of going in stores.</span> <span id="s909">We had nothing of this type of restrictions, but the Jews were arrested.</span> <span id="s910">And some elements in the police helped the Germans because of Vichy, because Vichy gave them the orders and they were the bosses.</span> <span id="s911">And, you know, when you are somebody who's under these type of bosses, many people do what they are told to do even if they don't completely agree.</span> <span id="s912">Now, there were many who did not agree and helped the Jews and the other people.</span> <span id="s913">There were not only Jews that were arrested in the South of France.</span> <span id="s914">The regular citizens were arrested, too.</span> <span id="s915">But anyway, that's another question.</span> <span id="s916">But the country [tape skipped] . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: Until?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: Until they started to believe in the De Gaulle.</span> <span id="s919">You know, De Gaulle saved us.</span> <span id="s920">By going to England and by making that marvelous speech.</span> <span id="s921">By making that marvelous speech, you know.</span> <span id="s922">"France has lost the battle, but has not lost the war," something like that.</span> <span id="s923">I cannot repeat word by word.</span> <span id="s924">Something that is -- and after that, the French started to think.</span> <span id="s925">And then when the Germans were starting to have covered Russia, they became much worse with the whole French population, then a lot of French people started to convert completely and forget about Vichy and not want to have anything to do with the pope.</span> <span id="s926">You know, and help the other side, but it took a little while.</span> <span id="s927">Because it's so difficult when somebody you believe in takes a command and says that's the right thing.</span> <span id="s928">You know, in every country you will have that.</span> <span id="s929">Even now here, if Clinton says something about -- let's see, about a bomb having exploded by terrorists, in the beginning everybody would follow him.</span> <span id="s930">And then slowly some people would criticize him if he goes too far and gives too many plastic orders.</span> <span id="s931">You know, that's what you have to see how things go in context.</span> <span id="s932">It's very complicated.</span> <span id="s933">But, for example, the class I was in called ___________.</span> <span id="s934">And I told my classmates I don't believe in _________, but they were horrified.</span> <span id="s935">"How can you not believe in ___________?"</span> <span id="s936">I was the only Jewish student there, and they accepted me very well.</span> <span id="s937">But at the same time, they said, "How -- it's so difficult to be a nurse.</span> <span id="s938">To take care of patients.</span> <span id="s939">To be completely at the service of patients.</span> <span id="s940">It's so difficult.</span> <span id="s941">How can somebody who is not Christian," they asked me, "do that?"</span> <span id="s942">And I said, "Don't you realize that Jews have high morals, too?"</span> <span id="s943">And I knew a lot about religion because my grandfather and my brother taught me a lot.</span> <span id="s944">And I said, "The moral questions, we believe in the same things as you do."</span> <span id="s945">And I tell them always, "Don't you realize that Jesus was Jewish?"</span> <span id="s946">And, you know, French people didn't believe that.</span> <span id="s947">It wasn't told to French kids at that time.</span> <span id="s948">Even later the Catholic Church 99 percent -- 97 percent of the population is Catholic, and the Catholic Church did not teach that at the time, that Jesus was Jewish.</span> <span id="s949">It was written in every church, you know, Jesus, the King of Judea, but they didn't understand that.</span> <span id="s950">Because they put it in Latin so people didn't know that.</span> <span id="s951">So it's a very complicated thing, but slowly the French people took hold of them, and they understood how hard it was to accept that the Germans do whatever they want.</span> <span id="s952">And the more the German became, the more the French felt.</span> <span id="s953">When I say "the French," I mean the majority of French.</span> <span id="s954">I don't mean the whole country.</span> <span id="s955">There was always an element who went along with the Germans.</span> <span id="s956">The Milles, for example.</span> <span id="s957">You know, the Milles was like a militia, but the Milles was an army of French people who were for Pétain, and they followed the Germans.</span> <span id="s958">They went even to fight with the Germans in Russia, that was a good thing.</span> <span id="s959">Anyway, do you want me to go back to when I left Poitiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s961">I have one other question that may not relevant at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s963">Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: During this period, you were trying to help people and life wasn't very easy for you either.</span> <span id="s965">Did you notice any difference between a man or a woman that was advantageous or was just advantageous for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: We always felt at that time that men was much more in danger than we were.</span> <span id="s967">The Jewish men.</span> <span id="s968">And all of the men, we thought so.</span> <span id="s969">But in reality, the Germans arrested the woman and tortured and killed the women the same way -- and children, as men.</span> <span id="s970">So that was, you know, at that time we had still ideas that army, the soldiers are killed.</span> <span id="s971">The men are killed, but women or civilian are not touched.</span> <span id="s972">But that wasn't true at all.</span> <span id="s973">We learned very fast that that didn't apply.</span> <span id="s974">So it was a general condition for everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Being a woman, was it easier to do some of your rescue work?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: I don't think so.</span> <span id="s977">No, because many men did it, too.</span> <span id="s978">Many men.</span> <span id="s979">And when we left, men helped us.</span> <span id="s980">So I don't think it was easier, and it was -- just happened who was a woman and who was a man and was in a situation to help.</span> <span id="s981">I don't think there was a question of gender there.</span> <span id="s982">I don't believe that.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: Tell me about your escape and who all went with you and how you traveled.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s985">When we decided that my sister was going to try to escape the next day from the hospital and we had to leave, so we made plans to leave.</span> <span id="s986">And everything, like I told you before, was taken out of the house.</span> <span id="s987">And we were going just to sleep there.</span> <span id="s988">It was a big house in the center of town.</span> <span id="s989">And at that time, that's where we lived.</span> <span id="s990">But it was furnished, we had no furniture.</span> <span id="s991">We had left everything in the east, so we had to rent a house with furniture.</span> <span id="s992">So we had no furniture to move.</span> <span id="s993">We moved only our personal belongings, and then my whole class -- we were 9 or 10 -- 10, I think classmates, they all helped.</span> <span id="s994">They all knew I was going to leave and they all helped.</span> <span id="s995">And one of the classmates, her cousin was a priest with one of the parishes.</span> <span id="s996">So the St. Segondia -- that's spelled S-t.</span> <span id="s997">for saint.</span> <span id="s998">And Segondia, S-e-g-o-n-d-i-a.</span> <span id="s999">It's a small, I don't know if you call that a village or town, it was either a village or town near the border.</span> <span id="s1000">Closer to -- the border was in the village or next to the village, and they told me to go to that priest.</span> <span id="s1001">So we all got -- but the night before, one of my classmates, Odile Dae Moril.</span> <span id="s1002">Her first name is Odile, O-d-i-l-e.</span> <span id="s1003">She was a noble.</span> <span id="s1004">D-a-e, and Moril, M-o-r-i-l.</span> <span id="s1005">She came to the house, and she rang our bell.</span> <span id="s1006">Just at the time of curfew, the Germans had already come by because they came just before curfew.</span> <span id="s1007">And she told us -- because all the Jews had to be in before the other people, a little earlier.</span> <span id="s1008">We had to be there at 7:00, around 7:00 and the French were obliged to be in by 8:00, something like that or 9:00.</span> <span id="s1009">So she came to the house, and she heard that there will be a raffle tonight.</span> <span id="s1010">A raffle, r-a-f-f-l-e, meant arresting a group of Jews.</span> <span id="s1011">An the police, the French police very often went to see Vilna they knew well and told them to let the Jews know because they couldn't do it.</span> <span id="s1012">They said it was the whole -- it was an organized and it was organized in such a way, do you know, Louis (ph) organization.</span> <span id="s1013">So she came and said that we have to come to her house.</span> <span id="s1014">If we stay in our house, we will probably be all arrested.</span> <span id="s1015">And I think until -- they can do such a thing.</span> <span id="s1016">If we come to your house, you will be shot, how can they do such a thing?</span> <span id="s1017">Again, here like Mr. Charpentier, she was kind.</span> <span id="s1018">That was always the weapon against us.</span> <span id="s1019">That kindness, and saying, "I cannot leave you here.</span> <span id="s1020">You have to come.</span> <span id="s1021">You have to come to my house.</span> <span id="s1022">If not, you will not be able to leave tomorrow, because you will be all arrested.</span> <span id="s1023">What are you going to do?"</span> <span id="s1024">And I said, "But you cannot risk your life for that."</span> <span id="s1025">And do you know, the house would have been taken?</span> <span id="s1026">She was alone in the house.</span> <span id="s1027">Her parents were sleeping somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1028">She was in school, so she was in that house near -- very close to the school.</span> <span id="s1029">So I said, "We cannot do that."</span> <span id="s1030">She stood her ground, and she said, "You have to come."</span> <span id="s1031">And she wouldn't move, so we finally all went.</span> <span id="s1032">My father, my mother, my grandmother.</span> <span id="s1033">My grandfather had died, so my mother lived with us -- my grandmother lived with us.</span> <span id="s1034">She was at that time 80.</span> <span id="s1035">So she came, and my two sisters, Helen and Rosie, the two youngest and I and Jackie, the little German boy.</span> <span id="s1036">So we all went and spent the night with her.</span> <span id="s1037">And the next day, we left our house, we were going back to her house.</span> <span id="s1038">And we left and my father and my sister, Helen, she was the next to last -- next to the youngest.</span> <span id="s1039">Rosie is the youngest.</span> <span id="s1040">So Helen had had an operation on the knee, so she couldn't ride a bike.</span> <span id="s1041">So she and my father took a bus to a certain point and then they walked to St. Segondia, the city I talked -- the little village to you about.</span> <span id="s1042">And we were all going to meet in the church.</span> <span id="s1043">Rosie, the youngest, and I and Jackie.</span> <span id="s1044">Rosie and I, we rode our bike, and we took turns to have Jackie on the handlebars.</span> <span id="s1045">And we rode to St. Segondia, and my mother and my grandmother were coming at -- they were staying at Odile's house.</span> <span id="s1046">And she was going was going to take them to the bus and put them on a bus and come into the center of the city, of the village, which was very dangerous but we had not choice.</span> <span id="s1047">They couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s1048">My grandmother was 80, and she had perhaps 10 days before, two weeks before, an operation, a major surgical operation, surgical intervention in her abdomen, so she couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s1049">So we first, we drove -- we rode, Rosie and I, we rode our bicycles with Jackie, and we are at the church.</span> <span id="s1050">And then my father and Helen arrived at the church, and the priest was with him.</span> <span id="s1051">And his name is Christian De Chaumac.</span> <span id="s1052">De Chaumac is D-e, he was a noble, too.</span> <span id="s1053">and C-h -- his last name is C-h-a-u-m-a-c.</span> <span id="s1054">And he was the priest of the parish of St. Segondia, so he waited for us in the church, and when we arrived he said to me, "You are Jewish?</span> <span id="s1055">And I don't trust Jews.</span> <span id="s1056">Who tells me that if you arrested, you are not going to tell the Germans that I helped you?</span> <span id="s1057">I will help you regardless, but I don't trust you."</span> <span id="s1058">And I got so mad and so indignant.</span> <span id="s1059">I said, "How can you even mention that?</span> <span id="s1060">We would all be killed before we say a word about you.</span> <span id="s1061">We would never, never say that."</span> <span id="s1062">And he said, "Do you remember the story of Judas with Jesus?"</span> <span id="s1063">And I said, "Yes, but we are Judas, and we have not been -- you can trust us."</span> <span id="s1064">And I was so -- I felt like going away, but at the same time, you couldn't risk the life of so many people.</span> <span id="s1065">And I told him, "I am terribly, terribly upset that you believe that."</span> <span id="s1066">That was so wrong, and I had a long conversation -- discussion with him afterward.</span> <span id="s1067">So he went and scouted the area to make sure there is no other papauté, and then he came back and said, "It looks okay."</span> <span id="s1068">So my father and Helen, Rosie and Jackie went, and I stayed in church all day waiting on my mother and grandmother.</span> <span id="s1069">I was the oldest of the three kids.</span> <span id="s1070">And in our family, it's always the kids who make the decision, you know.</span> <span id="s1071">When we were there at that age, not when we were small, but at that age.</span> <span id="s1072">Mostly in France away from Lorraine, you know, my parents weren't so old, but they didn't speak French well.</span> <span id="s1073">We were the ones who made all the decisions, and the oldest was always in charge.</span> <span id="s1074">That was the way.</span> <span id="s1075">Well, when you are a large family, that's how things go.</span> <span id="s1076">But anyway, I waited in church in about -- I don't know how long.</span> <span id="s1077">A little while later, we had a customer from our dry goods store, you know, the store in Poitiers who lived in St. Segondia near the church and she had seen me, so she came in the church.</span> <span id="s1078">And she knew me very well, she said, "You know, a family was arrested, but we don't."</span> <span id="s1079">And I said, "But how did they look?"</span> <span id="s1080">She said, "Nobody saw them, but we know the Germans just found them a little while ago, a whole family."</span> <span id="s1081">And that was atrocious, you know, because I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s1082">Should I go back to Poitiers and tell my mother and grandmother, or should I let them come and save them?</span> <span id="s1083">But what about my father and the children?</span> <span id="s1084">I just didn't know, it was atrocious.</span> <span id="s1085">I never prayed as fervently as in that church.</span> <span id="s1086">Never, do you know, in my life.</span> <span id="s1087">That was -- and the priest came in the church and saw me praying and crying.</span> <span id="s1088">And that's the Jewish way, okay.</span> <span id="s1089">I couldn't leave, and the priest came in and he felt very bad when he saw, because he knew, too, that they were, as the boy said to me, that he tried to see the people, to see if they were -- but the Germans wouldn't let him approach them.</span> <span id="s1090">They wouldn't them near.</span> <span id="s1091">They were, you know, somewhere prisoners.</span> <span id="s1092">And he couldn't see them, so -- and I told him I don't know what to do.</span> <span id="s1093">And he said, "Save your mother and grandmother first, if you can."</span> <span id="s1094">So I waited and then he became very human to me.</span> <span id="s1095">You know, he said, "Why don't you come in the presbyter" -- you know where the priest lives?</span> <span id="s1096">"Why don't you come in my house where my guardian is?"</span> <span id="s1097">Do you know, he had a woman, like all priests living in sin.</span> <span id="s1098">"Why don't you come?"</span> <span id="s1099">And they wanted to feed me and I said, "Absolutely not. "</span> <span id="s1100">I could not even believe all that.</span> <span id="s1101">And then I went in and I helped her to be occupied.</span> <span id="s1102">And then when the time for the bus to leave, I went back to the center of the -- we were all dressed like peasants, because at that time -- now, you wouldn't recognize a peasant from a city person.</span> <span id="s1103">But at time, they dressed very differently, so we were all dressed, you know, with scarves on the head and long skirts and flat shoes.</span> <span id="s1104">You know, like the peasants were.</span> <span id="s1105">So I went to the bus stop, and my mother and grandmother arrived.</span> <span id="s1106">And we couldn't make my grandmother walk, so my grandmother, we sat her on the bicycle seat.</span> <span id="s1107">And I was pushing the handlebars and my mother was holding her, the seat to make sure she doesn't fall off.</span> <span id="s1108">What I have to say, too, my grandfather was the greatest person on earth.</span> <span id="s1109">My grandmother was a nice woman, but not at all at the level of my grandfather.</span> <span id="s1110">And she was not the most generous or the most easy person on earth, but when she heard that we wanted to go and she had to have that operation, she said to us, "I am an old woman.</span> <span id="s1111">I had my life.</span> <span id="s1112">You just go because with me, you cannot make it.</span> <span id="s1113">Just leave me here."</span> <span id="s1114">And I said, "Absolutely not.</span> <span id="s1115">Either we all go, or nobody goes.</span> <span id="s1116">If we go, you go, too."</span> <span id="s1117">So she didn't -- she did not object to it.</span> <span id="s1118">She was very happy.</span> <span id="s1119">And that I have to say during the whole war, when people talked about relatives they had to leave behind, my grandmother always looked at them and said, "Not me.</span> <span id="s1120">I was taken by my children everywhere they went."</span> <span id="s1121">You know, she always boasted about it, she was not -- she was not the type to be very generous with people.</span> <span id="s1122">But anyway, we took my grandmother, put her on the bicycle, and we left and we went back to the church.</span> <span id="s1123">It was just a street from the church.</span> <span id="s1124">And it was toward dusk, so the Germans were probably eating dinner, because we didn't see any in the city.</span> <span id="s1125">And the priest went again and scouted the area of the line.</span> <span id="s1126">You know, the way to go to the line.</span> <span id="s1127">Because there was nobody, no guards at the line.</span> <span id="s1128">It was just a line, you know, an open line.</span> <span id="s1129">It was an imaginary line, but everybody knew it was there.</span> <span id="s1130">So he went and he came back, and he said it's okay.</span> <span id="s1131">So we put back my grandmother on the bike and we went.</span> <span id="s1132">And that was an extraordinary story, it's hard to believe it that it really happened.</span> <span id="s1133">As we walked in the city . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: Oh, there's only one minute?</span> <span id="s1135">Let's change the tape before you tell the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">End of Tape 2.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: So when we stopped, you were going to tell me about the experience of crossing the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1140">When I met -- when I took my grandmother and my mother -- my grandmother on that bicycle and we had to walk along and it was at dusk.</span> <span id="s1141">We had to walk along the street.</span> <span id="s1142">I don't remember if it was a main street or secondary street, but we had to walk along a whole street to go to the ligne de marquer, to the line -- to the border where, you know, none of you had friends, and farmers were all sitting in front of their houses resting at that time.</span> <span id="s1143">Do you know, around dusk.</span> <span id="s1144">And when they saw us -- my mother, my grandmother and I -- with that bicycle, they started to pray for us because they understood what was going on.</span> <span id="s1145">They had seen many people go through, and they prayed for us; they crossed themselves.</span> <span id="s1146">Some woman kneeled in the dirt, and it was pitiful to see that.</span> <span id="s1147">And none of them betrayed us, and they were all very poor, very poor farmers.</span> <span id="s1148">And the Germans were there with them with a lot of money.</span> <span id="s1149">But none of them betrayed us, they all prayed for us.</span> <span id="s1150">It was so beautiful, it's unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1151">You know, when I tell people, they think I tell them a movie.</span> <span id="s1152">It was absolute reality.</span> <span id="s1153">It was what happened to us.</span> <span id="s1154">And my mother, my grandmother couldn't believe it; they saw it, too.</span> <span id="s1155">And I thanked them, going by I thanked them.</span> <span id="s1156">And I told them thank you for praying for us.</span> <span id="s1157">Then we arrived at the -- we walked past the street, and we arrived very fast to the demarcation line.</span> <span id="s1158">And we crossed it, and then I met my whole family, they were all safe.</span> <span id="s1159">Another family had been arrested, people we don't know.</span> <span id="s1160">They were, let me see, the sacrificed lambs, you know, for us.</span> <span id="s1161">We were saved because the Germans were so busy with them and they let us go.</span> <span id="s1162">They didn't let us go, they didn't find us.</span> <span id="s1163">They didn't look for us.</span> <span id="s1164">Do you know, they were not patrolling actively.</span> <span id="s1165">They had gotten the details, arrested the whole family.</span> <span id="s1166">They were satisfied with that.</span> <span id="s1167">So they were _______, and they were very busy doing all that work because Germans are very organized, you know.</span> <span id="s1168">They have to do all the paperwork, that was very important.</span> <span id="s1169">All Germans are extremely organized, and that's why we were against such an organization that Jews could not get out and survive unless French people, who were not Jewish, helped.</span> <span id="s1170">It was impossible to do.</span> <span id="s1171">Absolutely impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: You arranged this whole . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1174">Because I told I was the oldest and I felt -- but all my classmates helped me.</span> <span id="s1175">My fiancé helped me, and I told my mother we are going to go.</span> <span id="s1176">And she said, "We cannot.</span> <span id="s1177">How can we go?</span> <span id="s1178">Look like us, we are going to all be arrested."</span> <span id="s1179">I said, "We have to try.</span> <span id="s1180">We have to go."</span> <span id="s1181">My father agreed right away, but my mother said, "What are we going to do with grandma?"</span> <span id="s1182">I said, "We take her."</span> <span id="s1183">She said, "How do you want to take her?"</span> <span id="s1184">I said, "We take her on my bike."</span> <span id="s1185">I arranged all that, and it's a funny thing, I never had done anything like that.</span> <span id="s1186">I never had, you know, been so active in my life.</span> <span id="s1187">I had never done anything like that.</span> <span id="s1188">But it's very strange, because when we arrived in the unoccupied France, I sent a telegram to my brother.</span> <span id="s1189">Another thing I wanted absolutely to go and fast is because our brothers wanted to come back and get us.</span> <span id="s1190">We knew they had written that they wanted to come and get us out.</span> <span id="s1191">And that was too dangerous for them to go back and forth, that was even more dangerous.</span> <span id="s1192">That's twice as dangerous, you know, to do it twice.</span> <span id="s1193">And that's why I felt we should go.</span> <span id="s1194">And I wanted Steph to escape, and that was the only way.</span> <span id="s1195">If we didn't escape, we would all have been arrested.</span> <span id="s1196">So that was the only way to do it.</span> <span id="s1197">I wasn't alone, I organized it in my family, but everybody helped me.</span> <span id="s1198">You know, my friends all helped me and so many of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: At what point in time was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: That was in August of 1942, because Steph had been in prison in July 10th, and she was in prison most of July.</span> <span id="s1201">She must have been arrested end of June, I don't remember exactly when.</span> <span id="s1202">So it has to be in August of '42, but the date I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1203">I cannot remember those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: What was going on in France . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: Oh, it was -- the Germans were having trouble in Russia, and as soon as they start to have trouble in Russia, all the edicts became worse every day.</span> <span id="s1206">And they made more rules and more -- and arrested more people and deported more people, but we all thought that the deportation was strictly for working.</span> <span id="s1207">Do you know, to send them to working?</span> <span id="s1208">We never, never had any idea what really the death camps were.</span> <span id="s1209">We never heard of that.</span> <span id="s1210">We knew that the Germans had not been very -- how can I say -- sweet to their Germans that they arrested, you know, and put in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1211">But we never could even realize that they would do that to other people.</span> <span id="s1212">Do you know, it's very strange, it's very -- that we did not realize it.</span> <span id="s1213">We couldn't figure it out, and how can you figure out that people can be so barbaric with other people?</span> <span id="s1214">It's impossible to figure out unless yourself have barbaric tendencies.</span> <span id="s1215">I feel that way, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1216">But it was a very strange thing, we never knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s1217">And it's lucky because we survived, but we survived, too, with so much hope.</span> <span id="s1218">From the first day on, we had so much hope because of de Gaulle.</span> <span id="s1219">He was our, do you know, like Pétain was a god for these people; de Gaulle was our -- he was hope with a big H. And we believed in him 100 percent, and we really thought that it would be -- that we would survive.</span> <span id="s1220">And when my mother complained about the condition, we were young and we saw things differently than she did.</span> <span id="s1221">So we . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: We got to stop, we got to stop.</span> <span id="s1223">The light went off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: Oh, how did . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: When we had to stop, you were talking about your mother's reaction, do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1227">She was always terrified for her children.</span> <span id="s1228">And I always told her that we are living history.</span> <span id="s1229">And she said, "I would like a little less history.</span> <span id="s1230">I could do without."</span> <span id="s1231">And she just did more like any mother, she was just concerned about her children.</span> <span id="s1232">The worst blow came when my sister was arrested, and she -- I remember she said we will never see her anymore.</span> <span id="s1233">And I said, "Why do you say that?</span> <span id="s1234">She's just going to go to work."</span> <span id="s1235">She said, "When they take a young girl like that, they are not going to let her come home."</span> <span id="s1236">That's how she felt about it.</span> <span id="s1237">And during the whole war, she always was very nice to us.</span> <span id="s1238">Never cried or -- you know, but sometimes she would say, "How can I sleep in a bed when I don't know where my kids sleeps?</span> <span id="s1239">How can I eat when I don't know if she has food?"</span> <span id="s1240">It was very, very difficult for her.</span> <span id="s1241">For my father, too.</span> <span id="s1242">It was very difficult, he felt terrible that he had not been able to get her out of there when he was arrested.</span> <span id="s1243">He cried, he said, "Steph, but you know that" -- and he tried to make her say certain things to be pleasant to the Germans and she refused.</span> <span id="s1244">She absolutely refused.</span> <span id="s1245">And one thing, she was not feeling well because I told you she had a serious problem with her kidney.</span> <span id="s1246">She was holding at the desk with her hands because he made her stand all the time.</span> <span id="s1247">And he barked at her, the SS, "Get your hands off my desk."</span> <span id="s1248">That was not Hipp, that was another SS that was a higher up officer.</span> <span id="s1249">"Get off your desk."</span> <span id="s1250">And when I was in Germany and a German in my office would keep his hands on my desk, I would do the same thing.</span> <span id="s1251">It was just I couldn't stand it.</span> <span id="s1252">It would just react the same way, "Get your hands off my desk."</span> <span id="s1253">Demonstrate, I couldn't accept that.</span> <span id="s1254">They always remember that happened to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">Q: Where did you go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1257">That night we slept in that village in a hotel.</span> <span id="s1258">And the next morning, we waited all day for Stephanie to arrive because we thought she would escape.</span> <span id="s1259">And she never showed up.</span> <span id="s1260">So that night we couldn't stay in that little village, it was just a village.</span> <span id="s1261">So we took the train to Mogilev near Velle, not far from Velle.</span> <span id="s1262">It's a mining and steel center.</span> <span id="s1263">And my aunt, the sister of my father, was living there, was retreating there with her family.</span> <span id="s1264">So we went and stopped there at their house, and Jackie was able to see his father, Josie, you know.</span> <span id="s1265">Because Josie was with my aunt, and they hadn't seen each other for a long time.</span> <span id="s1266">And then the next -- I don't know, the next day or two days later, we went to Haifa, to where my brothers were and we stayed with them.</span> <span id="s1267">And very soon I had to leave because I wanted to continue my studies.</span> <span id="s1268">So I went first to another university, not Marseilles, but to I think it was Montpellier or ____________.</span> <span id="s1269">I cannot remember, but it was Montpellier, because Montpellier is a very well known, very good university.</span> <span id="s1270">So I went there and I went to the Red Cross because once you are Red Cross, you stay Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1271">You know, that's the top schools in France for nursing.</span> <span id="s1272">In Europe at least, in all Europe.</span> <span id="s1273">So I went to the school in Montpellier and I had an interview with the director of the school.</span> <span id="s1274">And she was an old, ugly person.</span> <span id="s1275">I don't mean ugly physically, but the first thing she asked me, "Are you Jewish?"</span> <span id="s1276">Because I told her that I did one first year in Poitiers and I had to get away from Poitiers.</span> <span id="s1277">She said, "Why?</span> <span id="s1278">Are you Jewish?"</span> <span id="s1279">And I said, "Yes, what difference does it make?"</span> <span id="s1280">I told her because you have nothing to lose at that time, and I could not accept that French people tell me that.</span> <span id="s1281">I just couldn't accept that.</span> <span id="s1282">And she said to me, "I cannot accept any Jewish girl here."</span> <span id="s1283">And I said, "Do you realize, are you German, or are you French?"</span> <span id="s1284">And she said, "No, I'm French, but I cannot -- I believe in Hitler and I believe in Lovel," that was his minister, "and I believe in all that and I cannot accept any Jew."</span> <span id="s1285">"Okay, are there any rules and regulations that Jews cannot be accepted in school?"</span> <span id="s1286">There was none.</span> <span id="s1287">In unoccupied France there was, but not in occupied France.</span> <span id="s1288">And . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: You said the opposite.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: Oh, in occupied France there were, but not in unoccupied France.</span> <span id="s1291">I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s1292">So I said to her, I was really very upset and I left because she was -- and in leaving I told her, "When the war is over and de Gaulle enters France, I will come back and visit you."</span> <span id="s1293">But I never did.</span> <span id="s1294">How can you try to punish people years later?</span> <span id="s1295">Do you know it's impossible to do.</span> <span id="s1296">You have said that and you will never forget, but you don't go back all the way to __________ to Montpellier, to punish that person.</span> <span id="s1297">So I never did, but I was terribly upset.</span> <span id="s1298">So I went back and I tried my luck in Marseilles, and how I went, why I went to the Red Cross Headquarters in Marseilles first, I never know.</span> <span id="s1299">I can't remember.</span> <span id="s1300">There must have been a reason.</span> <span id="s1301">Probably somebody told me to go to see Mrs. Keller, K-e-l-l-e-r, who was a marvelous person.</span> <span id="s1302">She was Alsatian, I don't remember, I think from Strasbourg but I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s1303">Her daughter had been a nurse and died.</span> <span id="s1304">She contracted an infection as a nurse and she died.</span> <span id="s1305">And her mother became a nurse because of that.</span> <span id="s1306">But she became the Regional Director of the Red Cross in Marseilles.</span> <span id="s1307">She was a very educated woman and a very nice woman.</span> <span id="s1308">And I met her, I am sure somebody must have recommended her.</span> <span id="s1309">Told me to go to see her.</span> <span id="s1310">And I told her my problem.</span> <span id="s1311">I told her I did one year in Poitiers at the Red Cross School.</span> <span id="s1312">I want to continue my schooling, but I'm Jewish.</span> <span id="s1313">I told her right out.</span> <span id="s1314">And she looked at me and said, "What does that mean?</span> <span id="s1315">Who cares what you are?</span> <span id="s1316">You wanted to become a nurse, you will become a nurse."</span> <span id="s1317">And she said, "I am going to make sure of that."</span> <span id="s1318">And she called the Red Cross School in Pithiviers on the telephone, and she talked to the director of the school who is Chabannes, C-h-a-b-a-n-n-e-s.</span> <span id="s1319">And she told her that she wants me admitted without a problem.</span> <span id="s1320">And he told her that I Jewish, and I went to Red Cross -- she told me go right away.</span> <span id="s1321">She told me how to go there because I didn't know much of Marseilles, you know, about buses and I went there.</span> <span id="s1322">And when I arrived, I had very special reception because what I learned much later is that the brother of the -- not Vice -- I don't know you call that.</span> <span id="s1323">But she was not the director, she was Assistant Directress.</span> <span id="s1324">Her brother was the chief of the Militia, of the French Militia.</span> <span id="s1325">And I didn't know that, but when I arrived these two women, Ms. Lovel and Ms. Chabannes were there.</span> <span id="s1326">I don't know if it's Lovell or Lovel, something like that.</span> <span id="s1327">I don't remember her name exactly.</span> <span id="s1328">They were both there and their reception like an iceberg.</span> <span id="s1329">"We cannot accept you.</span> <span id="s1330">No Jew can come in that school.</span> <span id="s1331">No way can we accept you."</span> <span id="s1332">And I said, "But Mrs. Keller said that I would be accepted."</span> <span id="s1333">"No way can you be accepted."</span> <span id="s1334">I wanted desperately to finish my studies, and they said to me, "You never return to Ms. Keller.</span> <span id="s1335">We forbid you to return to see Ms. Keller.</span> <span id="s1336">Just stay away from her."</span> <span id="s1337">And I said to her, "How can you forbid me?</span> <span id="s1338">You don't accept me in the school, and you forbid me to go to see Mrs. Keller?"</span> <span id="s1339">And I went straight back to Mrs. Keller and I told her what had happened.</span> <span id="s1340">Oh, she was completely -- she took the phone and called them that they were going to be fired on the spot.</span> <span id="s1341">That she's going to send me back and she wants to hear that within an hour I am accepted in that school.</span> <span id="s1342">And they had to accept me, but life was atrocious for the first few months.</span> <span id="s1343">Because they treated me terribly, you know, I was there against their will and they hated Jews.</span> <span id="s1344">But that was pure malice, that was the worst French people you could meet at that time.</span> <span id="s1345">And the brother was a doctor and he was teaching at that school, so he had a lot of clout.</span> <span id="s1346">And his sister was Assistant Director, so you know -- so anyway, for several months nobody -- I mean the administration, the students were okay, you see.</span> <span id="s1347">But the administration, nobody would respond to my greetings.</span> <span id="s1348">I had to greet them, I had to be polite, but I was never obsequious.</span> <span id="s1349">You know, I never tried to enter into their good grace.</span> <span id="s1350">I just did my work, I was polite, but I stayed away from them.</span> <span id="s1351">But they were horrible with me.</span> <span id="s1352">I tell you they would not even talk to me or answer my greetings, nothing.</span> <span id="s1353">And then after several months, slowly they changed.</span> <span id="s1354">We had our own clinic at the small private hospital for the Red Cross, for that school.</span> <span id="s1355">And the director slept in that building, and every night she would go around and talk to the patients about the students and ask them their evaluations of the students.</span> <span id="s1356">And my evaluations were such -- the patients loved me because they said I was always smiling.</span> <span id="s1357">You know, I never told them who I was, what problems I had, nothing.</span> <span id="s1358">But I was doing my duty, and I was always pleasant and I was always taking well care of them.</span> <span id="s1359">And then slowly they accepted me, and it was a slow process.</span> <span id="s1360">But finally they were even very nice to me after, you know, but the beginning was -- I never thought I could finish but I did.</span> <span id="s1361">I finished school in these conditions, but when I finished school, they were already completely different to me than in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1362">So that was quite an experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: Was there relationship between -- I was asking if there was any kind of official relationship between the Red Cross and Vichy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: I cannot tell you official.</span> <span id="s1365">That would mean there was a written statement.</span> <span id="s1366">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1367">But, for sure, the Vichy as the Red Cross was extreme right in general.</span> <span id="s1368">And not only the right, they were for Pétain and Vichy 100 percent, and they never helped the Jews in the camps.</span> <span id="s1369">Never did anything in the camps to help them, and they -- I mean the camps in France.</span> <span id="s1370">My uncle who had been in Drancy and my mother made him escape and then he was arrested, he was not the type of person who stayed out of trouble during the war.</span> <span id="s1371">Because he was not at all the type of person who looked for trouble.</span> <span id="s1372">But he was the real scholar, you know, and the real doctor, and he did not know how to save himself.</span> <span id="s1373">So he was again arrested in Marseilles, and I went every day to see him in the camp which was outside of Marseilles and brought him food and clothing, cleaned his laundry and all that.</span> <span id="s1374">And that's where I saw a departure, that's the only time I saw a departure of deportees.</span> <span id="s1375">He was put on that train, and somebody from the Jewish organization who knew him very well got him out.</span> <span id="s1376">He said, "That man doesn't belong there."</span> <span id="s1377">But he -- and then later he was saved by one of my uncles who got him out in a car from a camp.</span> <span id="s1378">And that uncle was deported and never came back.</span> <span id="s1379">You know, that's how things were, but Max, who was a marvelous person, and he survived the war because we made him go to Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: But the Red Cross, you saying . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1382">But the Red Cross, they never helped, so in that camp, I saw deportation and I saw thought the Red Cross was absolutely not doing anything in the camp.</span> <span id="s1383">They were there because they were supposed to be there, but they didn't help anybody.</span> <span id="s1384">They didn't take care of patients.</span> <span id="s1385">And I saw the Germans and the French Prefect and Super Prefect, which is the highest -- you know, like your government, in the camp making sure that everything was according.</span> <span id="s1386">And I saw people, Germans and French people -- mostly Germans, taking the babies out of the arms of the nurses and pushing the mothers in the wagons.</span> <span id="s1387">I saw all that.</span> <span id="s1388">I didn't see the wagons, but I saw them pushing them toward the railroad which was behind.</span> <span id="s1389">So I couldn't see the wagons, but I saw how they were pushed to all that.</span> <span id="s1390">And I was in that little place, do you know, an office, a little office.</span> <span id="s1391">They made us go in there because they didn't want us to see, but there was a window.</span> <span id="s1392">And I was there with a French policeman, and he started crying, sobbing, and saying, "I am a policeman, but I don't want to be involved in such things.</span> <span id="s1393">Look what they're doing, it's atrocious what they're doing."</span> <span id="s1394">And I was absolutely -- I never knew that such things could happen.</span> <span id="s1395">But I saw it with my own eyes.</span> <span id="s1396">That was near Marseilles, I don't remember the name of the camp.</span> <span id="s1397">Very close to Marseilles, I cannot remember.</span> <span id="s1398">And that was in '42.</span> <span id="s1399">In late '42.</span> <span id="s1400">You know, about -- no, late summer of '42.</span> <span id="s1401">Perhaps September, October, I cannot tell you exactly.</span> <span id="s1402">And it was -- but I come back to the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1403">When I was in Paris at the end of the war, just before the liberation went on, the resistance started fighting in the streets of Paris.</span> <span id="s1404">And they formed groups of nurses and doctors with the white flag running and pick up, you know, our wounded and take them to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1405">That's all Cross organized.</span> <span id="s1406">When I went to a G-stop, the first thing they asked me, "Are you Jewish?"</span> <span id="s1407">And I almost killed them, I was so horrified.</span> <span id="s1408">I said, "Our lives are at the front of Paris and you still ask that question?</span> <span id="s1409">I am a Red Cross and I'm ashamed to be Red Cross nurse."</span> <span id="s1410">It was horrible.</span> <span id="s1411">Do you know, that was the Red Cross?</span> <span id="s1412">I absolutely feel that the Red Cross in France, I cannot tell everywhere else, but the Red Cross in France had a very bad role during the war.</span> <span id="s1413">And I will say that until the end of my life.</span> <span id="s1414">And I'm a Red Cross, you know, I am part of the Red Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: What was the political climate like in Marseilles compared to Poitiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: It's an enormous city.</span> <span id="s1417">It's an enormous port.</span> <span id="s1418">You don't know as many people, but in Marseilles like in Poitiers, I found people who helped me.</span> <span id="s1419">And I found other who didn't, you know.</span> <span id="s1420">You always had both sides, but I had more people helping me than people not helping me or doing wrong things to me.</span> <span id="s1421">Much more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: Was there a difference, though, in the whole mood?</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s1424">Because it was not occupied the same way.</span> <span id="s1425">The Germans were not in charge of everything.</span> <span id="s1426">The French government was still in charge; in Poitiers, no, it was the Germans.</span> <span id="s1427">For example, in the office where I worked for Germans, we order to get out and greeting -- do you know it was a complete different way of living.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: More freedom than the south?</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s1430">There was no comparison.</span> <span id="s1431">We didn't -- nobody wore a yellow star.</span> <span id="s1432">I told you that before.</span> <span id="s1433">Nobody, nobody ever wore the yellow star.</span> <span id="s1434">That doesn't mean that Jews were not arrested.</span> <span id="s1435">That's another thing.</span> <span id="s1436">They were arrested, but it was in a complete different way.</span> <span id="s1437">Completely different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: I was asking you a bit about Marseilles.</span> <span id="s1439">I know that at some point the Nazis had occupied Southern France, and I was wondering how that changed things.</span> <span id="s1440">And do you remember when that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s1442">That was in, I think, November '42.</span> <span id="s1443">Yeah, I think several months after we made that -- so it changed because you had the presence of the Germans.</span> <span id="s1444">But in Marseilles there were more Italians than Germans.</span> <span id="s1445">There were Germans, too, but there were more Italians.</span> <span id="s1446">The whole de la ______, do you know, the ___________, all that was more occupied by the Italians.</span> <span id="s1447">And they were not at all like the Germans.</span> <span id="s1448">You didn't trust them, but they were not as, you know, the barbaric as the Germans.</span> <span id="s1449">They probably did very wrong things, but I never had any run-in with them so I cannot judge.</span> <span id="s1450">But there certainly people who suffered from these type of things, but I didn't.</span> <span id="s1451">So it's difficult for me to judge.</span> <span id="s1452">But there were Germans all over, and they started to deport first foreigners and then they started to round up the French.</span> <span id="s1453">Do you know, it was just an excuse, the foreigners.</span> <span id="s1454">That was just to make the French feel good, that they are not going to take their own citizens.</span> <span id="s1455">But that didn't last very long.</span> <span id="s1456">And the worse the situation became in Russia, and worse the situation became for us.</span> <span id="s1457">And that's what we all told my mother when she complained they were doing terrible things.</span> <span id="s1458">We said, "Don't you realize they are losing the war?"</span> <span id="s1459">Much before they lost the war.</span> <span id="s1460">They are losing; if not, they wouldn't be so barbaric and so nasty, because they know that they are losing the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: What was it like to live in this environment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: You had to survive.</span> <span id="s1463">It's difficult to tell you exactly.</span> <span id="s1464">It was very lonely for me in Marseilles all alone.</span> <span id="s1465">I had a cousin and his wife there and their little girl, and I saw them once a day.</span> <span id="s1466">I had one meal a day with them.</span> <span id="s1467">My brother sent, you know, was in the mountains, and he sent packages, Care packages, to them to feed me, too.</span> <span id="s1468">So, you know, for everybody because Marseilles, the food was very, very low.</span> <span id="s1469">It's a very poor area of agriculture, so if you didn't have things grown in that area, then you had much less to eat.</span> <span id="s1470">You had tomatoes and melons and seasoning and things like that, but you had nothing else.</span> <span id="s1471">The Germans took all the food to Germany to feed their people.</span> <span id="s1472">And we had things like sweet potatoes and rutabagas; you wouldn't make me eat these things.</span> <span id="s1473">Since the war, I never eat them.</span> <span id="s1474">I cannot even -- when I see it in the store, I walk away.</span> <span id="s1475">I never buy it, you know.</span> <span id="s1476">These are the things we eat.</span> <span id="s1477">We had no different very much potatoes, very seldom.</span> <span id="s1478">That was a luxury.</span> <span id="s1479">And people were starving in the street.</span> <span id="s1480">You would see people -- mostly the people who had no connections and no money, they had not enough.</span> <span id="s1481">They were not sufficient to feed you, and you would see them collapse in the streets of hunger.</span> <span id="s1482">Mostly in Marseilles in that region.</span> <span id="s1483">Now, where my father's family was in the mountains, there was much more food.</span> <span id="s1484">Because they had cheeses, they had chicken, they had -- you know, there were lots of farmers.</span> <span id="s1485">It was a different area.</span> <span id="s1486">So my brother sent me things.</span> <span id="s1487">My brother was always taking care of me, my brother.</span> <span id="s1488">And I told you that after _______, he moved the whole family to the Cottian, which is in the mountains.</span> <span id="s1489">The massif _______, which is the central mountains in France, west of Lyon and a little more north.</span> <span id="s1490">West, north of Lyon.</span> <span id="s1491">And [Souse], too, but it's west of Lyon about.</span> <span id="s1492">And he went to a resort which is called Vic-sur-cere, V-i-c, hyphen, s-u-r, hyphen, c-e-r-e.</span> <span id="s1493">And it was a beautiful little resort in the high mountains, and there only two roads leading to the Vic-sur-cere.</span> <span id="s1494">So my brother organized Jewish patrols night and day, and as soon the Germans were announced, then every Jewish family had a place to go.</span> <span id="s1495">Do you know, up the mountains.</span> <span id="s1496">And many, many Jews were saved due to that.</span> <span id="s1497">And my brother tried -- he became the chief of the resistance in Cottian of the whole area.</span> <span id="s1498">And I have a book of one of his nephews, of the nephew of my sister-in-law who wrote a little paragraph like that about him.</span> <span id="s1499">Saying not only did he save his extended family and took care of everything, but he had such a very active role in the resistance.</span> <span id="s1500">You know, I have that book here somewhere.</span> <span id="s1501">But he was amazing.</span> <span id="s1502">And my brother, Arnold, the second brother, was as active as Fred.</span> <span id="s1503">But he is not the guy who wants to be a leader.</span> <span id="s1504">He's a leader, he does things.</span> <span id="s1505">But he doesn't want any recognition for it; you know, he's that type.</span> <span id="s1506">And he -- but after the war, when the war was ended -- oh, but I go too fast.</span> <span id="s1507">They stayed in the Cottian, and then when things went really bad -- I don't know if it was the end of '43, beginning of '44, I don't remember when -- my brothers moved my whole family up even higher up in the mountains in Narniac, N-a-r-n-i-a-c.</span> <span id="s1508">But during that time -- and then he was still the chief of resistance.</span> <span id="s1509">And during that time my sister, Helen, who was in the university at Clermont-Ferrand, which is to Nièvre, but it's still more west than Vic-sur-cere, I think it's northwest, but it's west of Vic-sur-cere.</span> <span id="s1510">She became -- she was in the university, and she became extremely active.</span> <span id="s1511">She had the printing machine in her home.</span> <span id="s1512">She lived two floors above the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1513">Two floors.</span> <span id="s1514">But she had the printed machine in her room where she printed, you know, all the posters and all the things for propaganda.</span> <span id="s1515">And she traveled from city -- she was a very pretty girl, I will show you a picture.</span> <span id="s1516">She traveled with her rucksack full of ammunition from one city to the other to bring to the resistance.</span> <span id="s1517">And she was never caught.</span> <span id="s1518">Like one time she went out of the station with her rucksack full of it, and a French policeman said, "Hey, young girl, show me what you have in your rucksack."</span> <span id="s1519">And she gave him a huge smile -- she was dying, but she gave him a huge smile, and he said, "A girl with such a pretty smile cannot do anything wrong.</span> <span id="s1520">Just go."</span> <span id="s1521">And, you know, things like that, and she was in the university in Clermont-Ferrand in the library when the Germans, the SS or Gestapo -- I think it was the Gestapo walked in.</span> <span id="s1522">And the professor who was in the library at that time objected to the Germans to enter the university ground, you know, library, which is sacred for university.</span> <span id="s1523">Sacred territory.</span> <span id="s1524">So the Germans just killed him in front of the students.</span> <span id="s1525">They just shot him.</span> <span id="s1526">They were very nice, they were very sweet.</span> <span id="s1527">And my sister was arrested and taken to the Gestapo, and all the Jewish kids were arrested.</span> <span id="s1528">But she had the card for the Jews then, but all kids were arrested.</span> <span id="s1529">And the next day she was released because they didn't think she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1530">And also she was very lucky, but she was extremely active during the whole war.</span> <span id="s1531">And then after that, she went to a school to become an officer of the Air Force, French Air Force.</span> <span id="s1532">But she couldn't finish because she had an accident, and she almost lost a leg.</span> <span id="s1533">She had an accident with a bicycle in Paris.</span> <span id="s1534">But that was nothing to do with the war.</span> <span id="s1535">And she married a French Jew, Jon Claude Bellisianni (ph), who had was decorated with the highest decoration of the resistance by de Gaulle.</span> <span id="s1536">So she married the right guy, and they are still married.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">Q: Let's go back to you in Marseilles.</span> <span id="s1538">Another question I had is how much information did you have or communication did you have with the outside world?</span> <span id="s1539">How did you get information about what de Gaulle was doing and the resistance and all that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: Everybody was listening to BBC in hiding.</span> <span id="s1541">And do you know if you had no radio, then somebody else told you what they heard.</span> <span id="s1542">It was just, we knew -- and then we had some reporters, French reporters on the radio, who always said the English didn't do this and this and that.</span> <span id="s1543">But we knew they had done it, so we knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s1544">Even the last few days in Paris, that reporter -- I cannot remember his name -- he was very well known.</span> <span id="s1545">He was standing -- and he didn't mean to do that to help us.</span> <span id="s1546">He was really on the other side, but he was always denying -- he was always denying that things were wrong for that.</span> <span id="s1547">And then we knew that he was denying, it was the truth, and we always celebrated, you know.</span> <span id="s1548">But we knew, we listened to the BBC and we communicated with people.</span> <span id="s1549">And the newspapers gave us very little information, but it was mostly people who gave it.</span> <span id="s1550">So the most important thing was the BBC.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">Q: What was your daily life like in Marseilles?</span> <span id="s1552">Were you studying?</span> <span id="s1553">Were you practicing nursing, as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">A: No, I was not a nurse yet; I was a student.</span> <span id="s1555">But I was in the hospitals, yes.</span> <span id="s1556">The university hospitals were -- how do you call it?</span> <span id="s1557">_________ in French, do you know what that means?</span> <span id="s1558">You go through medicine, surgery -- we called it [starge].</span> <span id="s1559">I don't remember how you call that in English, but I went through all this teaching and we had classes every day.</span> <span id="s1560">Every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Q: Well, why didn't you decide to pass as a Catholic?</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">A: I couldn't do that.</span> <span id="s1563">I never said that I was Jewish to people around me normally.</span> <span id="s1564">To the directors of the school, but I normally didn't tell people I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1565">Certain people, I did.</span> <span id="s1566">You know, I really believed that I had trust for people, I told.</span> <span id="s1567">And I very seldom made -- but I am lucky, too.</span> <span id="s1568">I am very lucky.</span> <span id="s1569">That's why I am alive.</span> <span id="s1570">But I -- I forgot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">Q: I'm just asking you, you never chose to lie about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: No.</span> <span id="s1573">I never said I was Catholic, never, never.</span> <span id="s1574">That is something I just couldn't do.</span> <span id="s1575">When I was in the Army, I never felt I was Jewish, but I would never go to church with them and never told them -- I said, "I don't believe in that."</span> <span id="s1576">I never went.</span> <span id="s1577">I cannot do that.</span> <span id="s1578">If I went to a funeral, I wouldn't mind -- I don't mind going into a church.</span> <span id="s1579">That doesn't bother me at all.</span> <span id="s1580">But if I go into a church, I don't kneel and I cannot cross myself.</span> <span id="s1581">I cannot do that.</span> <span id="s1582">It's just impossible.</span> <span id="s1583">Do you know, when you learn as a child the Bible, the people were ostracized because of their faith and they didn't bow in front of kings, things like that.</span> <span id="s1584">This impresses you as a kid.</span> <span id="s1585">And then later, you cannot do that.</span> <span id="s1586">I feel that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">Q: Were you able to continue celebrating holidays or . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1589">They didn't eat meat most of the time because there was no kosher meat.</span> <span id="s1590">But for holidays, they had the Shavuot and they had to travel to Aarau, to the capitol to go to the shop and come back, but they always did.</span> <span id="s1591">One time my father decided he couldn't stand it anymore, he wants meat.</span> <span id="s1592">Because my brothers and my sister-in-law and my youngest sister say -- and my mother let them and my father didn't.</span> <span id="s1593">So one time my father said he eats meat and then he was sick for 24 hours because he had eaten unkosher meat.</span> <span id="s1594">And he was not as religious as my mother, but still that was against all his beliefs.</span> <span id="s1595">He couldn't do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: How long did you stay in Marseilles?</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A: A year and half, about.</span> <span id="s1598">In '43, I think in October or November '43, I left Marseilles and I went back to Paris.</span> <span id="s1599">My sister, my oldest sister, lived in Paris.</span> <span id="s1600">That was after I graduated.</span> <span id="s1601">It must have been in November -- in October '43 -- oh, yes, in October '43, the day -- I don't remember now if it was the day of my examination or the day before, I read the newspaper.</span> <span id="s1602">And I knew that my fiancé had been arrested.</span> <span id="s1603">I knew that, and that he was condemned by the French Tribunal to life in prison for resistance.</span> <span id="s1604">But then I didn't know anything else, and that morning I read the paper like I always read the paper.</span> <span id="s1605">And I saw that four of the five of these young people had been shot.</span> <span id="s1606">It was written in the paper, and that was in October of '43.</span> <span id="s1607">I think it was the 6th of October they were shot, so I must have read it the 7th, the 8th.</span> <span id="s1608">And I had my examination on that day or the next day, I cannot remember.</span> <span id="s1609">But anyway, I read that, but I didn't know which one of the five had been saved.</span> <span id="s1610">I never knew until after the war.</span> <span id="s1611">After Lincoln.</span> <span id="s1612">No, I knew it -- I got in touch with girls in Poitiers.</span> <span id="s1613">Do you know with classmates?</span> <span id="s1614">And they let me know if yes or no, and I heard that Jack was killed and his brother.</span> <span id="s1615">He had two brothers, the two only kids of that family were shot together.</span> <span id="s1616">These two others in Paris in Moldavia.</span> <span id="s1617">That's the place in Paris on a little hill where the Germans shot the French people, resistance people.</span> <span id="s1618">And I didn't know if I should take my exam or not, but my brother had put so much money, you know, and so much effort to keep me in school that I felt I should.</span> <span id="s1619">So I finished, I got it.</span> <span id="s1620">And then after that, I went back to Paris to be with my sister.</span> <span id="s1621">Because I had nothing to do in the mountains.</span> <span id="s1622">I couldn't walk, I couldn't find any work.</span> <span id="s1623">In Paris I knew I could find work, and I worked in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">Q: Did you get involved in any kind of resistance activities in Marseilles?</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">A: In Marseilles?</span> <span id="s1626">No, not really, no.</span> <span id="s1627">I didn't have the opportunities.</span> <span id="s1628">I remember my brother came to see me one day, and we met in the streets a lawyer from Metz, a classmate of my brother, who I knew.</span> <span id="s1629">And he had been in the Army, and he and my brother talked about resistance.</span> <span id="s1630">That was very much the beginning, before my brother moved to the Cottian, to the mountains when he was still young.</span> <span id="s1631">But I told them that I want to join, too, and they looked at me and that lawyer said to me, "Little girls cannot do it.</span> <span id="s1632">See, we don't want little girls to risk their lives," you know.</span> <span id="s1633">And I reproached him, and after the war when I met him, I said, "I could never forgive you for having said that."</span> <span id="s1634">I was so mad at him, and I had no opportunity in Marseilles to really join anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Q: You went to Paris.</span> <span id="s1636">Was it easy to get back and forth, to go where you wanted to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1638">It was not.</span> <span id="s1639">There were controls in the train, and the German came and controlled my papers.</span> <span id="s1640">But I was lucky and they didn't think I was Jewish until after I go.</span> <span id="s1641">They didn't question me.</span> <span id="s1642">I was always very lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">Q: Were you afraid?</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">A: I don't even remember.</span> <span id="s1645">I don't remember that, how I dared to do that.</span> <span id="s1646">I was probably afraid, how can you not?</span> <span id="s1647">You know, for a few moments until they leave you, you don't know what's going to happen to you.</span> <span id="s1648">I sure I was afraid.</span> <span id="s1649">But I arrived in Paris and I joined my sister and lived with her.</span> <span id="s1650">And she lived in an apartment rented by non-Jews.</span> <span id="s1651">That was the only way we could do it.</span> <span id="s1652">And we had to move several times.</span> <span id="s1653">Because when somebody got arrested and they had our address, we had to move to make sure that they, you know, they were tortured, you don't know what people can talk.</span> <span id="s1654">And you cannot trust anybody, not because you don't trust them, but I don't know if I would talk under torture.</span> <span id="s1655">Nobody can know, nobody can judge that.</span> <span id="s1656">Because you don't know how you would react to that unless you have gone through that.</span> <span id="s1657">And even if you got through that, one day you may not talk and another day you may talk.</span> <span id="s1658">Do you know, you can be a hero one time and be the worst coward another time.</span> <span id="s1659">That same person, that doesn't mean that -- you cannot be always hero when you have no brain; you don't think.</span> <span id="s1660">And you have no reflexes, you just -- you are just muscles.</span> <span id="s1661">That's how I feel about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">Q: Just tell me a little bit about what you did in Paris, the political environment, just what was it like being there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">Q: Now, this is the beginning of 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">A: No, end of '43.</span> <span id="s1666">Until the liberation of Paris.</span> <span id="s1667">First, I started to work for an agency, because I couldn't work in a hospital.</span> <span id="s1668">That was too dangerous.</span> <span id="s1669">They would have inquired about many things.</span> <span id="s1670">But I worked for a private agency who placed me in families.</span> <span id="s1671">And I was the luckiest person.</span> <span id="s1672">I got to know marvelous people, and they were -- the people I worked for usually were on my side.</span> <span id="s1673">They didn't know I was Jewish, I didn't tell them.</span> <span id="s1674">I couldn't tell them, they were -- it was too risky for them to know.</span> <span id="s1675">If they were arrested, they could absolutely say they didn't know.</span> <span id="s1676">But if I tell them, they have no chance.</span> <span id="s1677">It's not right, it wasn't right.</span> <span id="s1678">But I worked for them, and they knew I was on, you know, on the same side.</span> <span id="s1679">Their son became very involved in the resistance, and he joined the Second Army -- do you know -- no, that's French words.</span> <span id="s1680">Do you know for army it's difficult for me to find the words in English.</span> <span id="s1681">So bandes of the Division of Bandes of La Claire, he joined.</span> <span id="s1682">My second cousin joined them, too, and he went to Berlin; he was in Berlin for a year and a half or two.</span> <span id="s1683">And Fred went into a school for officers, because he had been just an enlisted man in the Army.</span> <span id="s1684">He was only drafted, he was never, you know, an Army person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">Q: When you were working for this family, what kind of work were you doing?</span> <span id="s1686">Were you doing nursing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1688">Private nursing for the old lady -- the old brother of the woman.</span> <span id="s1689">And she was a marvelous person.</span> <span id="s1690">Her name was Mrs. Lucca (ph).</span> <span id="s1691">I cannot remember the name of the mother, but her son and the brother of Madam Lucca was the Curator of the Louvre, you see.</span> <span id="s1692">And they were cousins of French poets, it was a marvelous family.</span> <span id="s1693">And I had a marvelous time with them, and they were very helpful.</span> <span id="s1694">They even when they knew that we were in danger because somebody had been arrested that we knew, they gave us an apartment to stay there.</span> <span id="s1695">We were extremely lucky.</span> <span id="s1696">We became very friendly with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">Q: Did you go to church?</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">A: No, I couldn't.</span> <span id="s1699">There was no reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">Q: What was going on in Paris?</span> <span id="s1701">Were there a lot of roundups?</span> <span id="s1702">Were there deportations?</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1704">And we lived as normally as possible.</span> <span id="s1705">My sister and I, we went to the theater, we saw Octagon.</span> <span id="s1706">We saw Octagon which was a terrific play at that time, because if you know Octagon, do you know Octagon?</span> <span id="s1707">It's play now, but the play of Octagon is a team of the Berlin prison, and her uncle is going to have her killed.</span> <span id="s1708">And the guards talk about her and her life and her killing like she wouldn't exist.</span> <span id="s1709">And it was exactly what the order tried to do to show what the Germans were doing.</span> <span id="s1710">And there were Germans in the room, in the hall.</span> <span id="s1711">They were there and they applauded, and they didn't even think of what really the meaning was.</span> <span id="s1712">And the French were wild, you know, they applauded these scenes absolutely.</span> <span id="s1713">I remember that one night I saw that -- and others, we went to movies.</span> <span id="s1714">We went to things, but we had -- I was always extremely lucky, because many times, I don't say once or twice.</span> <span id="s1715">I cannot remember how many times, but let's say several times, I went to the station, a subway station, ready to go downstairs and then walk away.</span> <span id="s1716">And I never knew why, and then suddenly I heard the whistles and Germans were arresting people.</span> <span id="s1717">So I was never caught in such a thing.</span> <span id="s1718">I always walked away from it.</span> <span id="s1719">Do you know that's -- I was very lucky.</span> <span id="s1720">There's is no other explanation, because I didn't do it because they said it's dangerous.</span> <span id="s1721">I just stopped and walked away.</span> <span id="s1722">And I have a sixth sense of danger, I don't know how I got it, but I have a sixth sense.</span> <span id="s1723">Because that happened to me, that's why I'm alive.</span> <span id="s1724">Because in Germany, too, that happened.</span> <span id="s1725">Do you know, that I suddenly sensed that I couldn't go any further, that I had to stop.</span> <span id="s1726">So . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">Q: Was it wartime conditions there?</span> <span id="s1728">I mean was there enough to eat?</span> <span id="s1729">Were there . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">A: We had enough to eat, but many people starved in Paris, too.</span> <span id="s1731">People who had no money were starving.</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">Q: Was it easier to get by in a big city like Paris as a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1734">If you had friends who rented an apartment, yes.</span> <span id="s1735">But if you had no friends doing these things, then it was as difficult as anywhere else.</span> <span id="s1736">Or worse, because that was in occupied France.</span> <span id="s1737">But it depended who you knew and who helped you, and I told you that before.</span> <span id="s1738">That no French person would have survived the marvelous, if you can call it marvelous, but extremely effective organizations of the Germans if they were not helped.</span> <span id="s1739">It was impossible.</span> <span id="s1740">And Jews could not help you, they were in the same situation as you were.</span> <span id="s1741">It was the non-Jews who could help you.</span> <span id="s1742">But everything they did for us was always, always at the risk of their life.</span> <span id="s1743">And that's what so beautiful about it, that they didn't hesitate.</span> <span id="s1744">And, for example, the family who rented the first apartment for my sister and several apartments, and then that other lady give her her apartment.</span> <span id="s1745">But every time they rented an apartment, the mother and father knew about it and the sons knew about it.</span> <span id="s1746">There were two sons.</span> <span id="s1747">The father was a lawyer.</span> <span id="s1748">The mother was a very educated person.</span> <span id="s1749">The two sons, one was a doctor; the other was a lawyer.</span> <span id="s1750">They were -- do you know, but they did not hesitate to do these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">Q: Let's change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">End of Tape 3.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">Tape 4</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s1755">Do you know, I helped, whoever needed little help, the Jews or non-Jews . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s1757">Hold on.</span> <span id="s1758">Were you involved in any kind of resistance efforts while in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">A: Not any structured resistance at all, but I felt always that just by surviving that was resisting.</span> <span id="s1760">By not dying, others thought that was already resistance, and that was a victory.</span> <span id="s1761">Any Jew who could survive or any French person who could survive was resisting the Germans.</span> <span id="s1762">And by being hidden, hidden in a way because we did not rent an apartment in our name of things like that, but we still normally.</span> <span id="s1763">We went out in the streets, we did things.</span> <span id="s1764">So we felt resisting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">Q: This may be a strange question, but as you recount your experiences to me, you're doing this in a very lively way.</span> <span id="s1766">And you're telling me that you were able to go to a theater and that you tried to maintain a somewhat normal life.</span> <span id="s1767">But my sense is it really wasn't, couldn't have been that cheerful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">A: No, it was terrifying because you always had very much -- you worried terribly about your family.</span> <span id="s1769">You know, I didn't know what was going on in the Cottian, we had no relationship.</span> <span id="s1770">We had no communications between Paris and the Cottian where my parents were.</span> <span id="s1771">So it was very difficult to know what they were doing, and it was -- we worried enormously.</span> <span id="s1772">If you want to survive, you have to live, and to live, you have to live as close to normal as possible.</span> <span id="s1773">But that doesn't mean we went to the theater all the time or to the movies.</span> <span id="s1774">Only when it was something unusual, like Octagon, or there was a movie, I remember, about scaling mountains.</span> <span id="s1775">That was another symbol of resistance to the Germans, so every French person knew that that movie was made for that purpose.</span> <span id="s1776">So we all went to see that movie.</span> <span id="s1777">You see, these are the things which were very important.</span> <span id="s1778">And we had books which in a very subtle way showed that we were resisting, do you know?</span> <span id="s1779">These were complete different environment and a complete way of life in that way.</span> <span id="s1780">We were always looking for what the meaning of our survival means.</span> <span id="s1781">Do you know, what we can do to survive and what meaning it has.</span> <span id="s1782">But if you lose your whole family, then there is not much meaning to it.</span> <span id="s1783">It was hard enough for us to lose my sister.</span> <span id="s1784">We lost an awful lot of uncles and aunts and cousins, an awful lot.</span> <span id="s1785">I don't know if I count them, there's at least 25 or 30 or more.</span> <span id="s1786">I never counted them really.</span> <span id="s1787">So . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">Q: So what else can you tell me about Paris up until liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">A: We just survived, that's all.</span> <span id="s1790">Do you know, it's difficult to remember events, different events, but it was a constant -- we moved there and took up refuge in other people's homes when we felt that we were trapped by something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">Q: And the Germans were everywhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">A: Oh, everywhere.</span> <span id="s1793">Everywhere you went, they had the best of guns.</span> <span id="s1794">You know, the had the best of guns.</span> <span id="s1795">They had all the best mansions in Paris.</span> <span id="s1796">They were everywhere.</span> <span id="s1797">Wherever you went, they were there.</span> <span id="s1798">And they went out a lot, they went to theaters everywhere.</span> <span id="s1799">They had the money, they had the means.</span> <span id="s1800">That's . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">Q: Were there ever situations where these German flirting with you or . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">A: Oh, they tried.</span> <span id="s1803">They tried always to, you know, to stop the girls and talk to them.</span> <span id="s1804">But all armies do, but we didn't respond; we walked away.</span> <span id="s1805">But when they saw that we didn't respond, you know, they didn't dare do anything.</span> <span id="s1806">They still maintained a behavior which was different from the Eastern countries.</span> <span id="s1807">In France, they always had to behave differently.</span> <span id="s1808">That doesn't mean that they were not barbaric and caused terrible things and did terrible things, but their behavior in general had to be okay.</span> <span id="s1809">Because we were in a Western country, and they had orders.</span> <span id="s1810">And you know Germans obey orders, they are very good at that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">Q: Describe for me liberation, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">A: Oh, that was different.</span> <span id="s1813">We knew the Army was arriving, and we knew that Paris -- we heard that Paris was going to be destroyed by the Germans, but they never destroyed it.</span> <span id="s1814">And the last night they were, or the last day, during the whole day there were posts with machine guns at almost every intersection with a group of soldiers waiting for the Army.</span> <span id="s1815">But we didn't see any more tanks in Paris, but we saw were these little machine guns, they could do enough damage.</span> <span id="s1816">But the resistance had already started for several days to fight against them.</span> <span id="s1817">And there battles in the street, and that's why I told you I tried to go to the Red Cross, they wanted to be partners; it was their duty.</span> <span id="s1818">They simply wouldn't accept it.</span> <span id="s1819">So -- but the resistance had wounded them, too, Germans.</span> <span id="s1820">But they were very active all of the time.</span> <span id="s1821">But then, suddenly that was when the French Second Division of La Claire entered Paris first.</span> <span id="s1822">The Americans gave them that marvelous courtesy to enter Paris first, and we knew that.</span> <span id="s1823">We heard that on the radio.</span> <span id="s1824">That guy who I told you, that reporter, announced that now -- or was he hearing from somebody else?</span> <span id="s1825">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1826">But the reporter announced that the Army is entering Paris, one of the doors, I don't remember if it was [Borneo] one of the doors of Paris.</span> <span id="s1827">And then all the windows opened in the whole neighborhood, and I know in every neighborhood in France, and everybody started to sing the Marseillaise.</span> <span id="s1828">And the Germans posts were still down there, and they looked up to us but they didn't shoot.</span> <span id="s1829">And then the Army came in and they disappeared, the Germans disappeared.</span> <span id="s1830">They knew that -- what could they do against tanks?</span> <span id="s1831">There was a whole division of tanks coming in.</span> <span id="s1832">And then at 12 o'clock De Gaulle went to the capitol, Notre Dame, and had a big mass of celebration.</span> <span id="s1833">But -- and the next day, I took my bike, I rode all over Paris, and they were shooting everywhere because there were snipers on the roofs.</span> <span id="s1834">And they were shooting all over.</span> <span id="s1835">And I didn't find that that was dangerous.</span> <span id="s1836">You know, I just rode around, I was living really history then.</span> <span id="s1837">You know, that was my life.</span> <span id="s1838">And I was so excited about it, and then the next day -- do you know that was the next day when the Army entered Paris.</span> <span id="s1839">And that's how we were liberated, but there were still snipers for two, three days.</span> <span id="s1840">And then suddenly, you know, it slowly -- they were arrested, beaten, shot.</span> <span id="s1841">I wasn't involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">Q: German snipers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1844">Or French, do you know, the French who were against -- who were for Pétain.</span> <span id="s1845">There were some, there were some of them, called the collaborators.</span> <span id="s1846">You know, they ones that collaborated with the Germans had everything to lose.</span> <span id="s1847">So that's how it happened.</span> <span id="s1848">That was quite an event, you know, of periods, this Army coming in.</span> <span id="s1849">But we didn't know what had happened to my family.</span> <span id="s1850">But a while, perhaps a week or two, I don't remember, but it took so long to -- because the Army was coming from Normandy going east from Normandy and from Britannia, from Britain.</span> <span id="s1851">But then another Army came up from the south, from [France], and went up north.</span> <span id="s1852">So they were completely different fields of battle, and the Cottian was completely in a different zone.</span> <span id="s1853">We couldn't have any communications for quite a while until they were liberated, too.</span> <span id="s1854">But luckily, they all survived, but had horrendous adventure.</span> <span id="s1855">My sister, Rosie, was caught -- the youngest, she was caught in a forrest at night.</span> <span id="s1856">She had that day, there was a resistant who had been shot in the village of Narniac, and they had nobody to take care of him.</span> <span id="s1857">So she went to another village to find the priest because he had some nursing experience.</span> <span id="s1858">To ask him to come and the priest refused to come.</span> <span id="s1859">And she was coming back from that priest -- I met that priest later when I came on -- but I didn't tell you what it was.</span> <span id="s1860">But, you know, I wasn't there and I couldn't do that.</span> <span id="s1861">But anyway, she came back in that forrest late at night, and she was suddenly arrested by a group of Germans in the forrest.</span> <span id="s1862">And the officer said, "She's just a little girl," and his aide or somebody else -- but she understood what they were saying, but she made believe that she didn't understand, she didn't tell them she spoke German.</span> <span id="s1863">And then the aide said, "Why, don't you see that she's dressed like the resistance?"</span> <span id="s1864">You know, she was in shorts and a shirt like the kids in the resistance were dressed.</span> <span id="s1865">And he said, "Oh, come on.</span> <span id="s1866">She's just a kid."</span> <span id="s1867">And he refused to do anything, so they let her go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">Q: Let's get back to you in Paris.</span> <span id="s1869">Now, I know that talking about your family would be really interesting because they all had . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">A: They did an awful lot . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">Q: . . . very important experiences, that for today, let's continue with you in Paris.</span> <span id="s1872">What you did after the liberation.</span> <span id="s1873">You found out that your family was all alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">A: Yes, at a later date.</span> <span id="s1875">And then, I decided to join the Army.</span> <span id="s1876">I didn't tell my mother.</span> <span id="s1877">And I tried, and it was extremely difficult to join the Army because they were afraid to begin bad elements.</span> <span id="s1878">You know, who wanted to hide in the Army that passed.</span> <span id="s1879">So you had to have all kinds of certificates and recommendations and I finally was able to join the unit of former resistance.</span> <span id="s1880">And the chief of that -- the chief of that unit was Colonel Fabian, who was very well-known as resistance.</span> <span id="s1881">And his name is F-a-b-i-a-n.</span> <span id="s1882">And Colonel Fabian was a Communist, and his group was a Communist group, but I didn't know that.</span> <span id="s1883">When I arrived, I was very broken because my reception was very bad.</span> <span id="s1884">Because the guy who started to question me, he asked me what I done in the resistance, and I told him I did certain things, but personally I would never restructure group of resistance.</span> <span id="s1885">And he just bawled me out, and I was supposed to -- as a nurse, I came as a nurse.</span> <span id="s1886">I was sent as a nurse.</span> <span id="s1887">Then he said to me, "You are not going to be a nurse, you are going to be a social service person, social service."</span> <span id="s1888">And I never had done that in my life, and then he refused to give me my grade.</span> <span id="s1889">You know, normally as a nurse, you're an officer.</span> <span id="s1890">He said, "You will be a soldier, because you didn't do anything during the war."</span> <span id="s1891">And I told him, "Do you know my fiancé?"</span> <span id="s1892">He was very well-known there, even books written for his story and his brother.</span> <span id="s1893">Because they did very many things, they even attacked a train, you know, sabotaged the train of _________, the German ________.</span> <span id="s1894">And they killed many Germans by that sabotage, so they were very well-know.</span> <span id="s1895">And I said, "But he was my fiancé, and I lost him.</span> <span id="s1896">Don't you think that's already something?"</span> <span id="s1897">He said, "He died, but you survived and you didn't do anything."</span> <span id="s1898">He was absolutely atrocious, so he treated me terribly.</span> <span id="s1899">And then he told me I was a sergeant, and I told him but as a nurse, I'm supposed to be a nurse.</span> <span id="s1900">And he said, "Not here.</span> <span id="s1901">For us, you're just a sergeant."</span> <span id="s1902">He was another Communist, how can I say?</span> <span id="s1903">Real strong Communist.</span> <span id="s1904">So he said, "Did you ever join the Communist group?"</span> <span id="s1905">I said, "No, I'm not a Communist.</span> <span id="s1906">Why would I join the Communist group?"</span> <span id="s1907">And he said, "But we were the only resistance."</span> <span id="s1908">I said, "No, you were not.</span> <span id="s1909">There were other people resisted, too."</span> <span id="s1910">And we had a big fight.</span> <span id="s1911">Anyway, I became a sergeant, and I did my work as a social -- in the social service and took care of the kids.</span> <span id="s1912">I went to the front, you know, which wasn't very far.</span> <span id="s1913">There was a river, we were on one side of the river.</span> <span id="s1914">The Germans were on the other side of the river.</span> <span id="s1915">A little bit, but not a lot, you know, in Alsace.</span> <span id="s1916">And I went every day to the front, asked them what they wanted, you know.</span> <span id="s1917">They were very happy because nobody else was doing that.</span> <span id="s1918">So one day, I was there very little time, and I felt very much as an outsider.</span> <span id="s1919">But I didn't complain, I was in the Army; I didn't complain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">Q: Why did you want to join the Army?</span> <span id="s1921">What motivated you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">A: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">Q: Um-hum (yes).</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">A: To combattre, to fight back.</span> <span id="s1925">They had done so many bad things, you had to do something about it and defend your country.</span> <span id="s1926">My country helped me so much, why wouldn't I help my country?</span> <span id="s1927">I am not a perhaps a candidate, but it just happened that way.</span> <span id="s1928">But it's true, you know, I was helped by so many people, and we were still fighting, why would I, as a girl, not do it?</span> <span id="s1929">I had no reason, and as a nurse, I had a real good reason to go there and help people.</span> <span id="s1930">I never thought of doing anything else.</span> <span id="s1931">Anyway, I went -- I was walking the street one morning, late morning, and that Colonel Fabian saw me near the headquarters near his office.</span> <span id="s1932">And he called me, he never had talked to me.</span> <span id="s1933">Didn't know me, didn't know who I was.</span> <span id="s1934">And he said to me, "Would you mind manning my telephone?"</span> <span id="s1935">We were moving to another --probably it was during the Bulge, you know?</span> <span id="s1936">The Battle of the Bulge.</span> <span id="s1937">And he had to go back because we couldn't go forward -- we couldn't advance because of the Battle of the Bulge.</span> <span id="s1938">We were all stopped there.</span> <span id="s1939">And he said to me -- I think it was at that time, I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s1940">But anyway, we were moving somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1941">And he said, "Can you man the office during the time I take lunch?"</span> <span id="s1942">I said, "Sure."</span> <span id="s1943">And he said to me, "I'm sorry, but we have nothing to read for you.</span> <span id="s1944">There are only German books."</span> <span id="s1945">And I told him, "Oh, I have German fluency."</span> <span id="s1946">He said, "Do you speak German?"</span> <span id="s1947">I said, "Yes, I speak German fluently."</span> <span id="s1948">And he looked at me and he said, "Would you be able to do intelligence work?</span> <span id="s1949">We desperately need people to do intelligence work."</span> <span id="s1950">And I never was able to resist a challenge, so I said, "Sure."</span> <span id="s1951">After that I wondered what was wrong with me, to have accepted, but then I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1952">And seven days later, I was transferred.</span> <span id="s1953">Somebody picked me up in a Jeep, and I was transferred to the intelligence.</span> <span id="s1954">And I was trained, you know, to go into mission and then they tried to get me through the Germans' lines 14 times.</span> <span id="s1955">But . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">Q: What kind of training did they give you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">A: How to recognize units.</span> <span id="s1958">When you look at them, talk to them, you know, from where they come.</span> <span id="s1959">From what area.</span> <span id="s1960">You know, you had to learn all that, and to recognize equipment.</span> <span id="s1961">German equipment.</span> <span id="s1962">How to ask questions.</span> <span id="s1963">And they let me choose on my own what story I wanted to use to give as a reason for being in Germany if I'm questioned.</span> <span id="s1964">And that was a good idea, because if somebody imposes a story on you, you may not keep it right.</span> <span id="s1965">And I felt that the best way was to say that I'm in love with a German's son here and that I was looking for him.</span> <span id="s1966">He had disappeared and I was looking all over for him.</span> <span id="s1967">The Germans are so sentimental for these type of things, that is -- and it worked very well.</span> <span id="s1968">It helped me tremendously.</span> <span id="s1969">And at the same time, I was a very young girl, I knew it would protect me because I had a fiancé I loved so much.</span> <span id="s1970">So I wouldn't have to worry about it, you know.</span> <span id="s1971">So I felt that was the right story, and I proposed that to them.</span> <span id="s1972">I had to tell them what I wanted to do.</span> <span id="s1973">And they thought that was an excellent story, so they found a German.</span> <span id="s1974">They took him, put him in a reservation, and I had the picture and I had letters from him, one or two; I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1975">And all that and they made sure that he was kept in isolation until I came back because that I don't meet him somewhere and I shouldn't.</span> <span id="s1976">So that's how things worked out.</span> <span id="s1977">Then I was trained in all these type of things.</span> <span id="s1978">Do you have any more questions about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1980">Well, who was the leader of your unit, and what was the spirit of your . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">A: The leader of the real unit was a captain who I couldn't spell.</span> <span id="s1982">He was Alsatian and I had a lot of trouble later with him.</span> <span id="s1983">He was _______, but he was not located in the same city as we were.</span> <span id="s1984">I was at that time in Mulhouse, and he was in St. Denis, which is south near the Swiss border.</span> <span id="s1985">And I had very little contact with him, I knew him very little.</span> <span id="s1986">But later when I got to live in the same place as he did, then we got into lots of trouble with him.</span> <span id="s1987">I got in a lot of trouble with him.</span> <span id="s1988">But not because of anything sexual, but because we did not agree.</span> <span id="s1989">But that is for later, but anyway, then I . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">Q: Were there other Jewish people in your . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">A: Not that I know, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">Q: But you were treated equally?</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s1994">They didn't know I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1995">I never told them.</span> <span id="s1996">If I had told them I am Jewish, they would never have trusted me with that type of work.</span> <span id="s1997">This was not something you tell people in the French Army at that time.</span> <span id="s1998">Now they are all for Israel, and they are very for Jewish, but not at that time.</span> <span id="s1999">Most of them, not all of them, but most of them came from North Africa.</span> <span id="s2000">Do you know, with the American Army?</span> <span id="s2001">They were in North Africa and were from there, they had fought in Corsica, in Italy, and then they went to France.</span> <span id="s2002">Most of them, not all.</span> <span id="s2003">And they came with the American Army and they came from the south, from North Africa.</span> <span id="s2004">So that's one thing I wouldn't have told them.</span> <span id="s2005">I never discussed that, they never asked me because nobody ever thought -- and I had not given the name Hoffnung, they didn't even know my name.</span> <span id="s2006">Only very few people knew my name, the big chiefs, but nobody else knew my real name.</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">Q: What was your name on your identity card?</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">A: Of what?</span> <span id="s2009">Of French identity card?</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">A: I had no identity card.</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">Q: Well, I thought that you had gotten false papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s2014">But that was Hoffnung, that was always my real name.</span> <span id="s2015">And that I was born in Lorraine.</span> <span id="s2016">I always kept that, but when I was in the Army in intelligence, when I was with the Fabian, unit, then I was under Hoffnung.</span> <span id="s2017">But as soon I joined the intelligence, they made me change names, and I chose the name of Lelotra because during the war, that's the name I used for my fiancé to write to me.</span> <span id="s2018">Because he could not from Poitiers write to me in my name, so I had shortened -- and that name I continued keeping in the Army.</span> <span id="s2019">And everybody knew me under the name of Lelotra, which is L-e-l-o-t-r-a which is a very French name.</span> <span id="s2020">It's the name of the man who designed the gardens for Louis XIV, Lelotra.</span> <span id="s2021">So I liked that name.</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">Q: What was it like serving as a woman?</span> <span id="s2023">Was it different than serving as a man?</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2025">It was different in a way.</span> <span id="s2026">You -- but they didn't give me any trouble about being a woman.</span> <span id="s2027">But it was different, I was not in the infantry.</span> <span id="s2028">I was in the intelligence, but the people in the intelligence didn't do the work of the infantry either.</span> <span id="s2029">You know, we were all doing the work of intelligence.</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">Q: Maybe being a woman had its advantages.</span></p> <p><span id="s2031">A: But no, I really cannot tell you.</span> <span id="s2032">Because yeah, it would be more difficult to have sent a young man to Germany my age because he would be in the Army, he wouldn't be walking around.</span> <span id="s2033">In that way, yes, it was much more important to have a woman.</span> <span id="s2034">And anybody who spoke German was important to the intelligence.</span> <span id="s2035">They had not so many people who spoke German absolutely fluently.</span> <span id="s2036">I had a Lorraine accent, but I had always said I come from Lorraine.</span> <span id="s2037">But I told the Germans that my parents died, that everybody was bombed and killed by these horrible Americans.</span> <span id="s2038">And, do you know, I had a good story, and so that's how things worked.</span> <span id="s2039">I'm trying to remember where I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">Q: Well, you were going -- I think you were about to tell me about your efforts to get over the border, but since we only have a couple minutes left on this tape, let's save that.</span> <span id="s2041">I'm just trying to envision you doing this work and how it might have been different for you as a Jew, as a woman, doing this really very, very dangerous work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">A: Oh, I felt it was my duty to do it.</span> <span id="s2043">As a Jew and as a French person.</span> <span id="s2044">I felt absolutely, I could never stand that people say, "You can go to the Army, I don't need to," you know.</span> <span id="s2045">For example, my cousin, Oscar, who was from Germany, he would never -- he was saved by the French and all that.</span> <span id="s2046">And I had big fights with him because he would never think of joining the Army, he was not that type, you know.</span> <span id="s2047">And I told him that that's his duty, to join the Army.</span> <span id="s2048">That the French give him hospitality, even without knowing he's German, but he still survived of that and he should fight.</span> <span id="s2049">I was the type . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">Q: I think you were about to tell me what you actually did for the French Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s2051">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s2052">The first time I tried to cross the lines was near Thann which is in Auvergne.</span> <span id="s2053">And Thann is T-h-a-n-n.</span> <span id="s2054">And there were quite high mountains, the Vosges, but it was a plain winter and it was snow.</span> <span id="s2055">I had snow to almost to my waist.</span> <span id="s2056">And they had organized -- I had joined the Commanders of Africa, which is a unit.</span> <span id="s2057">And the Colonel of that unit was Bouvet, B-o-u-v-e-t.</span> <span id="s2058">And I was sent -- I was brought by my intelligence unit to that commando so that they helped cross.</span> <span id="s2059">And the Colonel Bouvet had a daughter my age, and he took a terrific liking to me.</span> <span id="s2060">And he helped me -- do you know, he was so worried that something happens to me, so a whole group of people came with me of the Army.</span> <span id="s2061">A Captain was chief of the group, and then there was at least 10 more people.</span> <span id="s2062">And some soldiers, three or four more officers and some soldiers, to accompany me to a certain little way in the mountains, I don't remember how you call that.</span> <span id="s2063">This sentier in French, which is a small passageway in the mountains.</span> <span id="s2064">And I had been explained what to do, that I come to that -- they will accompany me to that point, then they would leave me.</span> <span id="s2065">And I would walk along that little sentier, that little passageway, until I reached the Germans, who would be -- and I knew where I could find them.</span> <span id="s2066">And the Colonel said, "Just below where you reach the Germans, I am going to have a group of my people watch for you, and if you feel that the Germans have understood what's going on, that they are going to harm you, you scream and they come and get you."</span> <span id="s2067">You know, they were commanders.</span> <span id="s2068">"They come to get you.</span> <span id="s2069">You don't need -- I absolutely want you to be safe."</span> <span id="s2070">And I went, and that was in the middle of the night and we arrived to that place where they left me.</span> <span id="s2071">And I started walking, and it was before sundown -- sunup, much before.</span> <span id="s2072">And it was very gray, it was a lot of snow, very cold.</span> <span id="s2073">But when I walked, I saw a group of two soldiers, German soldiers, in a post hidden below me.</span> <span id="s2074">But I continued, I had no intention -- they were looking, they saw.</span> <span id="s2075">But I had no intention of talking to them because I want to go to the post; I didn't want to talk to them.</span> <span id="s2076">I wasn't told to do that, you know, I was told to go there.</span> <span id="s2077">But I knew where they posts, I noticed.</span> <span id="s2078">But I continued walking, and just when it became a little less gray, I arrived at a little in the mountains.</span> <span id="s2079">And there were forests, and I came in an intersection of the roads, of the little mountain roads.</span> <span id="s2080">And suddenly a soldier arrested me, and I thought he was a German, but he was a French soldier.</span> <span id="s2081">And he was a Moroccan and then there were several Moroccan around him who came towards me, and they want to shoot me because they thought that was a German spy.</span> <span id="s2082">And I said, "No shooting, no shooting."</span> <span id="s2083">Because they were telling me, "We are going to shoot you, you dirty German spy."</span> <span id="s2084">They were insulting me, do you know, in French because they spoke French.</span> <span id="s2085">They were French soldiers.</span> <span id="s2086">And I said, "Oh, no" . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">Q: Could I ask you to stop for a moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2090">So the Moroccans were ready to shoot you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">A: Yes, and I told them, "Don't shoot.</span> <span id="s2092">Call your officer," because I knew that they always had an officer.</span> <span id="s2093">But I didn't know who they were.</span> <span id="s2094">And then they called their office, and I said to him, "Why was I arrested?"</span> <span id="s2095">And he said, "Because you walked into here.</span> <span id="s2096">What are you doing here?"</span> <span id="s2097">And I said, "Okay, I don't what you are, but call Colonel Bouvet immediately in such-and-such unit," and I gave him the phone number," and tell that I'm with you."</span> <span id="s2098">And he said, "Colonel Bouvet, how do know him?"</span> <span id="s2099">And I said, "But I know him."</span> <span id="s2100">And then I looked at him and I said, "Are you from that unit?"</span> <span id="s2101">And he said, "Sure."</span> <span id="s2102">And I said, "You were the people who were supposed to protect me and you arrest me?"</span> <span id="s2103">And he said, "But you were not walking on the right little passageway.</span> <span id="s2104">You were walking one below."</span> <span id="s2105">You know, they are on the hill, there are several.</span> <span id="s2106">And in the night, the guide took me there.</span> <span id="s2107">He was an Alsatian from the Barrier, but in the night he made a mistake and put me on the wrong passageway.</span> <span id="s2108">So I was arrested and then the Germans saw it because they were just a few paces away, but they didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s2109">They want to see what was going on, and they took me back to the headquarters where I was debriefed and I told them what everything I saw which was very important things I saw.</span> <span id="s2110">Where resistance was -- do you know, where the Germans had posts in our area where they were watching us and reporting.</span> <span id="s2111">But it was such a big mountain, you can have a lot of things.</span> <span id="s2112">So I gave all the information, but I was terribly upset that I had been arrested by the French.</span> <span id="s2113">And top of it, I could have been shot.</span> <span id="s2114">They were absolutely ready to do it if I hadn't defended myself.</span> <span id="s2115">But I had been told how to react to people, you know, what to do in case I was in danger.</span> <span id="s2116">That was one the premiums you get, how you survive in such cases.</span> <span id="s2117">So I came back -- first, I was debriefed by another unit and by intelligence, and then I went back to Colonel Bouvet.</span> <span id="s2118">After that they tried 13 times to make me cross, 13 other times.</span> <span id="s2119">That was bungled purposely, but the Captain who was the chief of the unit who took me there, he could not accept that his mission was not done right.</span> <span id="s2120">So he said that I got confused and went on the wrong passageway.</span> <span id="s2121">And I had a terrible fight with him, and I said absolutely not.</span> <span id="s2122">And the guide said, "Look, that's enough.</span> <span id="s2123">No, I made the mistake."</span> <span id="s2124">So that was okay, but the Captain and I, we were not on the best terms after that.</span> <span id="s2125">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">Q: Did you and this officer have a . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2128">Right.</span> <span id="s2129">But after that I tried 13 times to cross, and the second time they let me go in a big field and they were shooting, you know, tracers all over.</span> <span id="s2130">And it was night, it was always at night, and that was perhaps a week later or 10 days later.</span> <span id="s2131">And then they let me go and they go this way, but they didn't give me any indication, do you know, a real indication what I should do, and then you will find the Germans.</span> <span id="s2132">And I walked around at night, I walked in circles.</span> <span id="s2133">And I heard dogs barking everywhere, but I didn't know where the dogs were, you know.</span> <span id="s2134">And I walked in circles, and they didn't tell me there was a canal there.</span> <span id="s2135">And I fell in the canal, never even caught a cold, nothing, I walked all the rest of the night in my wet clothes and I never caught a cold.</span> <span id="s2136">There was -- you know, you live under such hype that nothing happens to you.</span> <span id="s2137">But anyway, I walked all morning -- all night, and couldn't find my way because there was snow, there was a canal.</span> <span id="s2138">There was dog barkings and I didn't know where to go.</span> <span id="s2139">They had not given me good indications what road to go, how to do it.</span> <span id="s2140">And toward the morning when it started to be light, I saw a whole unit of tanks with soldiers coming on the road a little far away.</span> <span id="s2141">Quite far away.</span> <span id="s2142">And I thought it was the Germans, so I walked toward them.</span> <span id="s2143">And when I approached, they were speaking French.</span> <span id="s2144">So they were -- so I was -- but these ones did not try to harm me.</span> <span id="s2145">Because immediately the officer took me aside and said, "What are you doing here?"</span> <span id="s2146">And I explained to him, and he got in touch with my unit and they came and got me.</span> <span id="s2147">But 12 more times -- but most of the time it was very bad.</span> <span id="s2148">One night they wanted me to cross the River Rhine, swimming in wintertime.</span> <span id="s2149">I would have died of hyperthermia before I crossed even half of the river.</span> <span id="s2150">It was so stupid, I said, "That is impossible."</span> <span id="s2151">Any girl would not survive such a swimming.</span> <span id="s2152">That is impossible, I couldn't explain that I'd do that.</span> <span id="s2153">No German could believe so much, you know, that the girls would swim in plain winter through Rhine.</span> <span id="s2154">So I said that I didn't accept.</span> <span id="s2155">And then the 15th time or the 13th time -- I think it's the 15th time, I finally made it.</span> <span id="s2156">But that was well organized -- well, I was sent to Germany through Switzerland.</span> <span id="s2157">And it's a Swiss agent who picked me up.</span> <span id="s2158">I was taken by my unit to Basel, you know, to Switzerland?</span> <span id="s2159">And in Basel, I was met by a Swiss agent who took me to Sachsenhausen which is not very far.</span> <span id="s2160">And in Sachsenhausen there is a little enclave, the German road passes near a field which is Swiss, and there is a little -- I remember how it looked and there was a forrest to the left.</span> <span id="s2161">The road in front of us and to the right was a little enclave -- is a fence.</span> <span id="s2162">And the Swiss spent all day with me there, and he was -- for me, was an old man.</span> <span id="s2163">He was God know, he was near his 50s, perhaps late 40s.</span> <span id="s2164">For me, he looked very old.</span> <span id="s2165">And he said to me, "Listen, you are surely going to die.</span> <span id="s2166">Why don't we sleep together?</span> <span id="s2167">Why don't we have a good time?"</span> <span id="s2168">And I told him, "Why don't you go and jump in the river?</span> <span id="s2169">But I'm not going to do such a thing."</span> <span id="s2170">I had no intention of dying and no intention of sleeping with him.</span> <span id="s2171">And he cried, but -- and then he told me -- but he was very decent in that way.</span> <span id="s2172">He did not assault me or anything.</span> <span id="s2173">He tried verbally to entice me, and his way of enticing me was not very enticing anyway.</span> <span id="s2174">But anyway, towards the evening, towards dusk, I lie down in the field very close to the road.</span> <span id="s2175">And I had white knee socks on, and I had the impression that the whole German Army could see my white socks, do you know?</span> <span id="s2176">You wouldn't believe in what terror I was.</span> <span id="s2177">It was absolute terror, I could not move.</span> <span id="s2178">And I think how did I -- what did I get into such a predicament?</span> <span id="s2179">How can I do it?</span> <span id="s2180">I cannot do it.</span> <span id="s2181">And I stayed there quietly, I couldn't bring myself to do it.</span> <span id="s2182">And at one point, I said I have to do it.</span> <span id="s2183">No way.</span> <span id="s2184">And I remembered that that Captain who was Captain Mollet, M-o-l-l-e-t, had said that I had bungled because I had got confused.</span> <span id="s2185">And that made me do it, and when I came back, I told him that.</span> <span id="s2186">Boy, was he feeling -- was he embarrassed.</span> <span id="s2187">In front of everybody I told him of the whole, you know, all the officers of the unit.</span> <span id="s2188">But anyway, I finally stood up, walked to the road and there were two Germans, sentinels, who were crossing each other.</span> <span id="s2189">So I walked to -- but were never -- you know, I waited until I see that, and I walked there and I met him.</span> <span id="s2190">I said, "Heil, Hitler."</span> <span id="s2191">And he said, "Where are you going?"</span> <span id="s2192">I said, "To Helsinger," which was a city there, or a little town very close.</span> <span id="s2193">I don't remember how big that was, very close to that, walking distance, but at night and I walked there and he didn't bother me.</span> <span id="s2194">He didn't ask for papers, nothing.</span> <span id="s2195">But I had identify papers of the German __________, and my name was Marthe Ulrich, U-l-r-i-c-h.</span> <span id="s2196">Unfortunately, I lost all these papers, I don't know where they are.</span> <span id="s2197">They must be somewhere, but I don't know where.</span> <span id="s2198">I looked for them, and I didn't find them.</span> <span id="s2199">And I had these papers, and I had coupons for food and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s2200">And I had all places where to go.</span> <span id="s2201">The first one was in Sink, that's why I walked to Sink.</span> <span id="s2202">And it was a young -- somebody gave me a recommendation for that family, but they never knew who I was and what I was doing.</span> <span id="s2203">But I knocked at the door, it was quiet, it was 10 o'clock.</span> <span id="s2204">Knocked at the door, and they opened -- the woman opened the door.</span> <span id="s2205">Her husband was in the Army . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">Q: Something was moving around , or --</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">A: Was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">Q: How many minutes left?</span> <span id="s2209">Why don't you begin you were going to live with this family in Sink.</span></p> <p><span id="s2210">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s2211">I knocked at the door and she opened the door, and she said, "Who are you?"</span> <span id="s2212">And I told her that such-as-such person -- I don't remember who it was -- recommended me, who was a good friend of hers.</span> <span id="s2213">That he had told me that I could come to her house and get a room there.</span> <span id="s2214">That she would, you know, take me in.</span> <span id="s2215">And she did and she was very nice about it.</span> <span id="s2216">And the next day, she said to me, "I notice" -- because underneath my socks, my white socks, I had silk socks, you know.</span> <span id="s2217">She noticed they were all torn.</span> <span id="s2218">"What happened to you?"</span> <span id="s2219">And she said to me, "Did you . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2220">Q: We need to stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">A: She had noticed that my silk -- at that time, we had no pantyhose, but silk stockings were completely torn.</span> <span id="s2222">So she said to me, "What happened?"</span> <span id="s2223">I said, "I fell," because Helsinger was -- and she told me, you know, "We have so many worries about spies coming over from Switzerland, when I saw your torn socks, stockings, I was afraid of something like that."</span> <span id="s2224">And I start laughing and said, "Do I look like a spy?"</span> <span id="s2225">No, I had to absolutely get out of that.</span> <span id="s2226">And she said, "No, really you don't."</span> <span id="s2227">And I said, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s2228">I'm not one.</span> <span id="s2229">I'm a good German."</span> <span id="s2230">So that's how I got out of that.</span> <span id="s2231">So I stayed with them about two or three days, and then by train, I went to Freiburg which is northwest of Helsinger, and that's not too far from the Rhine, Freiburg.</span> <span id="s2232">And that's in Germany, not in Switzerland, but there's a Fribourg in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s2233">And I arrived in Freiburg, and there I had an address, too, to go where a young Alsatian doctor who had been in Germany had lived with that family, with a man and woman.</span> <span id="s2234">And he -- they were very good friends, and he told me to -- oh, I never met him.</span> <span id="s2235">But soon my unit, I knew that he accepted to send me there.</span> <span id="s2236">So I said I came from him, and I had papers from him.</span> <span id="s2237">I had some proof that he had, you know, that I had a husband.</span> <span id="s2238">That he had written me a letter or something.</span> <span id="s2239">So they accepted me very well, and they never questioned me.</span> <span id="s2240">And -- but I had another address in Freiburg of the doctor who was Alsatian, and his father was in ______ and he asked -- he knew that somebody was going to go to Germany on a mission.</span> <span id="s2241">And he asked if they would go and see him so that he can help me so he can possibly return to France.</span> <span id="s2242">Because he had married a German woman and stayed in Germany.</span> <span id="s2243">He was Alsatian.</span> <span id="s2244">And I went to see him, and that was terrible fiasco.</span> <span id="s2245">Because the guy absolutely -- he said, "I am married to German."</span> <span id="s2246">I told him, I was told to tell him what I was doing there.</span> <span id="s2247">But his father -- I didn't meet his father again, the father gave the instructions that what I should tell him.</span> <span id="s2248">And I told him, "I will help you go back to France.</span> <span id="s2249">You know, the war will be soon over.</span> <span id="s2250">It's just a question of days now, and I can help you go back to France if you help me.</span> <span id="s2251">Give me information about what's going on here.</span> <span id="s2252">Military information."</span> <span id="s2253">And he said to me, "Oh, how can I do that?</span> <span id="s2254">I'm married to a German citizen.</span> <span id="s2255">I cannot do that, absolutely."</span> <span id="s2256">And then he said, "Where are you staying?"</span> <span id="s2257">And I said, "I have no address yet.</span> <span id="s2258">I have not found yet anywhere to stay.</span> <span id="s2259">I am going to probably travel right away."</span> <span id="s2260">I was afraid of him, I was terrified.</span> <span id="s2261">I wanted to get out of there, so I got out as soon as possible and took all kinds of tours to make sure that I'm not followed.</span> <span id="s2262">But I was never followed.</span> <span id="s2263">And when the French Army came in Freiburg later, quite later, he looked for me and wanted me to help him go back to France.</span> <span id="s2264">But I did not accept to meet him, I refused because he had not helped me.</span> <span id="s2265">He was very atrocious, he would have had arrested me, had he known where to find me.</span> <span id="s2266">I understood that, and I stayed away from him.</span> <span id="s2267">But I found other people who helped and they would give me information.</span> <span id="s2268">The girls, Alsatian girls were in the German Army and were dying to go home.</span> <span id="s2269">And, you know, I could tell them that I can help them go home, if they help me.</span> <span id="s2270">And that was a great help.</span> <span id="s2271">It was the last few weeks of the war.</span> <span id="s2272">Three weeks, two weeks, I don't remember exactly.</span> <span id="s2273">Three weeks about.</span> <span id="s2274">When I came to Germany, I think I was there about three weeks.</span> <span id="s2275">But -- and then in Freiburg, I had another address to go outside of Freiburg to a certain place I cannot remember, which extremely close to the Siegfried line.</span> <span id="s2276">And the last village near the Siegfried line.</span> <span id="s2277">You could just walk there, 300 yards and you were in the Siegfried line.</span> <span id="s2278">And I went to that doctor, there was another doctor who I was told to go to.</span> <span id="s2279">But he wasn't home, and his wife, which was probably very good, but the maid, they fed me because I was hungry.</span> <span id="s2280">I was walking all the time, and I didn't know where to stop, so I was afraid.</span> <span id="s2281">But when she asked me, "Would you like something to eat?"</span> <span id="s2282">I said, "Yes," when I told her I want to see her employer.</span> <span id="s2283">But walking towards that village, I was with a group of people.</span> <span id="s2284">Women and there was one non-commissioned officer, an SS, little guy, too.</span> <span id="s2285">Very little guy.</span> <span id="s2286">And he was talking about, you know, all the things the SS do.</span> <span id="s2287">How much they do and how they hate the Jews and how they hate the Poles and how they hate the Russians and what they do to these people.</span> <span id="s2288">He was talking openly about it, and then suddenly he fainted.</span> <span id="s2289">He was coming back, he told us that he had been wounded and just came back to Zurich, and he fainted.</span> <span id="s2290">And I was a German nurse, so I took care of him.</span> <span id="s2291">So when he came back to it, he was very grateful, you know, that I had been so nice to him.</span> <span id="s2292">And we became best friends, even if he told me that he could smell a Jew at miles; he had told me.</span> <span id="s2293">And he told me any time I want to come to the Siegfried line to visit him, he would be delighted and he would introduce me to all his friends.</span> <span id="s2294">And he gave me his address and told me how to get there.</span> <span id="s2295">So the day -- I was Freiburg a few days, but then I went back somewhere else, but I cannot remember.</span> <span id="s2296">I traveled and I was in a bus one day.</span> <span id="s2297">And in that bus -- but that was in the Offenburg.</span> <span id="s2298">I think that was near, not too far from Freiburg, but just a distance.</span> <span id="s2299">Because I was afraid to take trains, and I went, you know, I went with military transports.</span> <span id="s2300">But they took you, as they took the civilians because they knew that it was very little -- there was very little communication.</span> <span id="s2301">You couldn't travel very easily.</span> <span id="s2302">And the Americans were always bombarding, but I was so lucky before I entered the city, they bombarded the city.</span> <span id="s2303">When I left, they started bombarding the city.</span> <span id="s2304">But I was there, I was never under bombardment of the Americans, which was good because boy, did they destroy things.</span> <span id="s2305">And then I went to that Offenburg, and I was in a bus going somewhere and -- because the transport had told me to say goodbye to the south, to go up the Swiss border where I wanted to go.</span> <span id="s2306">But they took me to Offenburg to a complete different section.</span> <span id="s2307">And we were in the -- I remember now.</span> <span id="s2308">We were in the truck all night, and it was freezing.</span> <span id="s2309">You know, on the bed of the truck in the back, it was freezing.</span> <span id="s2310">We were absolutely frozen.</span> <span id="s2311">It was in winter in Germany in the forrest, and we arrived early morning in a place where the convoy stopped.</span> <span id="s2312">So we went out of the convoy.</span> <span id="s2313">There were seven civilians, and we were lying in the fields.</span> <span id="s2314">And then planes came over, American planes, but they didn't bombard.</span> <span id="s2315">I was there, so they didn't bombard.</span> <span id="s2316">And I fell asleep there, I was so tired that I fell asleep.</span> <span id="s2317">And suddenly more planes came by, so they shook me up.</span> <span id="s2318">You know, the people around me shook me to awake me.</span> <span id="s2319">And I was so surprised and I didn't know where I was, and I started to answer in French.</span> <span id="s2320">That was quite a thing.</span> <span id="s2321">When I realized they were looking at me very strangely, and I said in five minutes I'm arrested.</span> <span id="s2322">So I got up and said I needed to go to the bathroom and I run.</span> <span id="s2323">And I run to a hole, and I find the milkman who came by with the horse and wagon.</span> <span id="s2324">And I stopped him and he took me to the next city.</span> <span id="s2325">And that's how I escaped, but I would have been arrested because they looked at me very strangely.</span> <span id="s2326">They had to think what they were going to do next.</span> <span id="s2327">But that was the only time where I awoke and spoke French, but it's very difficult not to.</span> <span id="s2328">And then I took another bus, I don't remember exactly, do you know, the sequence.</span> <span id="s2329">But I know I was in another bus, and there was only one non-commissioned officer in that bus.</span> <span id="s2330">And all the rest were women, and that commissioned officer started to tell how they treated Russians and Poles in the East.</span> <span id="s2331">They were not talking about Jews, that how they treated the Russians and the Poles.</span> <span id="s2332">How they assembled the whole people, all the people from one village.</span> <span id="s2333">Put them in a square, and start shooting them with machine guns.</span> <span id="s2334">It's the ach mein, you know, the Germans speak like that.</span> <span id="s2335">Ach mein, and slap the side many times and say,"You should have seen running like little mice."</span> <span id="s2336">It was horrible.</span> <span id="s2337">And I thought that, and everybody -- all the women laughed.</span> <span id="s2338">They felt that was very funny.</span> <span id="s2339">And I had to laugh with them, I had no choice.</span> <span id="s2340">So I didn't laugh too much, but I had to laugh some.</span></p> <p><span id="s2341">End of Tape 4.</span></p> <p><span id="s2342">Tape 5</span></p> <p><span id="s2343">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2344">A: One point I wanted to make is that always the German afterwards, after we won the war, always pretended that they did not know, and that's absolutely not true.</span> <span id="s2345">They knew it because the soldiers came home and they told the story.</span> <span id="s2346">They told about all these barbaric things.</span> <span id="s2347">I head it, I was there only three weeks and I heard it.</span> <span id="s2348">And how could the people who lived there all the time not hear it?</span> <span id="s2349">And I didn't know the people who told me then.</span> <span id="s2350">So they boasted about it openly, so that's a big myth that's the Germans did not know.</span> <span id="s2351">And I have friends who were in a concentration camp, a young Alsatian, who was later in our unit.</span> <span id="s2352">And he said -- he was in Dachau or Buchenwald, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s2353">And he said that when they were taken out on walks to go to the work site every day, there were skeletons, all these people.</span> <span id="s2354">And there were barely walking, and people in the town would throw stones at them and beat them.</span> <span id="s2355">On top of -- do you know, all the other brutalities?</span> <span id="s2356">So these were town people, and they all said, "Oh, we did not know."</span> <span id="s2357">You know, one German one day recognized what the Germans did to me, and I shook his hand.</span> <span id="s2358">I said, "You are the only honest German I ever met."</span> <span id="s2359">It was unbelievable that they absolutely denied the horrible things they all knew they had done.</span> <span id="s2360">It was no secret.</span> <span id="s2361">It was impossible to have a secret.</span> <span id="s2362">So I think that point is very important.</span> <span id="s2363">Okay, now I go back to my story.</span> <span id="s2364">I don't know where I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s2365">Q: Well, you had been to the Siegfried line.</span> <span id="s2366">You had traveled on a bus . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2367">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2368">Then I came back to Freiburg, and I hope that the French were coming that day.</span> <span id="s2369">I knew they were getting close because -- and there Germans with bazooka in corners, you know at every place where they could hide a little bit and waiting for the French.</span> <span id="s2370">And I went around, and I was such a good German, and I said, "Oh, my God.</span> <span id="s2371">I hope nothing will happen to you because you don't know, do you realize I saw them coming from up there?</span> <span id="s2372">They have enormous tanks coming."</span> <span id="s2373">They have no more tanks, they have nothing, the German tank in Freiburg.</span> <span id="s2374">So most of them got down from their post, they got frightened because I told them that.</span> <span id="s2375">And then I was in the main street when the first tank came.</span> <span id="s2376">French tank -- no, yeah, French.</span> <span id="s2377">They were the French.</span> <span id="s2378">And I made the V sign like that and stopped it, and I asked that the officer come down.</span> <span id="s2379">They had quite a few Germans, prisoners, on the tank all over.</span> <span id="s2380">And I told him, "Please come down, I need to talk to you."</span> <span id="s2381">And I took him aside and I told him, "I am here.</span> <span id="s2382">I am part of the Army.</span> <span id="s2383">I'm in the intelligence.</span> <span id="s2384">I need to see -- to be taken to the headquarters right now.</span> <span id="s2385">I need to go there because I have very important information to give them.</span> <span id="s2386">And he took me and I met Commander Petit, Petit, who was the chief -- he was commander or colonel, I don't remember, of the second Division Zaire, that was the regiment.</span> <span id="s2387">And that was, too, a regiment from North Africa.</span> <span id="s2388">And Colonel Petit first was a little leery about me, you know, when he start to question me.</span> <span id="s2389">And he was -- he didn't believe me.</span> <span id="s2390">He thought I was making up stories and then he start questioning me.</span> <span id="s2391">He had been in intelligence, and I told him what information I had, who to contact, how to contact and then ended story and I was okay.</span> <span id="s2392">So I told him the important information I had.</span> <span id="s2393">That day, I had gone back to Siegfried line to see my good friend, the little SS, who had invited me to come because I want to see what's going at that Siegfried line.</span> <span id="s2394">And when I arrived at the Siegfried line and I inquired about him, they were all leaving.</span> <span id="s2395">The Siegfried line was emptying, the French came down, not south but west -- no, east of the Siegfried line.</span> <span id="s2396">They did not want to deal with the Siegfried line, but my information was the Siegfried line was empty, not to worry about it.</span> <span id="s2397">So that was extremely important military information right then and there.</span> <span id="s2398">So Colonel Petit believed me and he sent out, you know, patrols and they found out that the Siegfried line was empty.</span> <span id="s2399">So after that, he really believed me.</span> <span id="s2400">And I was very well treated, and he said to me, "Do you want me to send you back to your unit?</span> <span id="s2401">I know where they are located."</span> <span id="s2402">He had gotten in touch with them to tell them I was safe, because they didn't know, didn't have any news from me.</span> <span id="s2403">And I told him, "No, my mission isn't finished.</span> <span id="s2404">I have to go back south."</span> <span id="s2405">Because they were coming not south.</span> <span id="s2406">The south, nobody was there yet.</span> <span id="s2407">So I said, "I go back south tomorrow morning, but I will ask you a favor.</span> <span id="s2408">Find me a bicycle because I'm tired of walking."</span> <span id="s2409">So he found me a bicycle, and the next morning I left.</span> <span id="s2410">And I have papers where he said that for that night, to protect me if somebody attacks me and to go through the French line.</span> <span id="s2411">And he said, "Destroy these papers you arrive."</span> <span id="s2412">After the French went, I never destroyed it.</span> <span id="s2413">I still have them.</span> <span id="s2414">You know, saying that I should be protected.</span> <span id="s2415">But under the name of Lelotra.</span> <span id="s2416">He, too, didn't know my real name, nobody did.</span> <span id="s2417">So I left the next morning and went south towards the mountains.</span> <span id="s2418">And when I climbed up the mountains in the Black Forest, it was quite high.</span> <span id="s2419">And at one point, I was just pushing my bicycle, I couldn't ride it.</span> <span id="s2420">It was much too incline, steep.</span> <span id="s2421">So a German soldier was walking there.</span> <span id="s2422">There were always soldiers all over walking, they didn't know where to go because they didn't know where their units were.</span> <span id="s2423">They were completely disorganized by then.</span> <span id="s2424">So he said to me, "I push your bike."</span> <span id="s2425">So I let him, he pushed my bike up the mountains.</span> <span id="s2426">What do I care?</span> <span id="s2427">Well, I don't need to do that, so I let him.</span> <span id="s2428">And we talked and I always talked to them that I was looking for that fiancé who was lost, do you know that?</span> <span id="s2429">I didn't know where he was.</span> <span id="s2430">I always used that, and I told him that I had run away.</span> <span id="s2431">And I told that everybody when I got out of Freiburg, when I went south, everybody I met from the Army, I told them what horrible experience that was to see the French Army with black people.</span> <span id="s2432">Would you believe that they have black soldiers and a lot of them and they look terrible?</span> <span id="s2433">And they're barbaric, I made a big story.</span> <span id="s2434">They were all terrified, you know, because they had not more organization.</span> <span id="s2435">They were not structured anymore, they had no real defense.</span> <span id="s2436">And they were not going to get killed for nothing, so the best thing was to do that and I did a good job at that.</span> <span id="s2437">And I told them -- and then I went south toward the border because there I had a family I wanted go to see just near the Swiss border.</span> <span id="s2438">But that was the brother-in-law of the daughter, of one of the daughters of that family was in our unit.</span> <span id="s2439">And he told me that I can absolutely trust them, not to worry.</span> <span id="s2440">They wouldn't even know, they knew already that I was going to come.</span> <span id="s2441">So they knew all about me, and they knew that I was from the French Army.</span> <span id="s2442">They were very Catholic, Bavaria -- no, Bedouins, you know, from Baden from the territory of Baden and they were very anti-Hitler.</span> <span id="s2443">So I went to their house, but before I arrived there, I met a whole group of ambulances who were coming from the north going south, too, and east.</span> <span id="s2444">Because once you arrived to south, you have to go east.</span> <span id="s2445">You go into [Brest] along the Rhine.</span> <span id="s2446">And I asked them what they were doing there, and I told them how terribly unhappy I was that Freiburg was taken by these horrible French and all these blacks and all that I repeated.</span> <span id="s2447">They told me, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s2448">It's here, not far."</span> <span id="s2449">They told me exactly where, in the forest there is a whole division hidden in the forest and they are going to beat them.</span> <span id="s2450">And they told me the names and they told me who they were.</span> <span id="s2451">You know, they were so convinced I was such a good German.</span> <span id="s2452">And then, I knew that it was imperative to go to that house of the Swiss and to get that information to my partner as fast as possible.</span> <span id="s2453">That was vital, and I had no radio.</span> <span id="s2454">I had nothing, the only way I was told that I can give important and, you know, rapidly information was to go to the Swiss and tell them that I'm a Swiss agent.</span> <span id="s2455">And that's what I intended to do, so I arrived -- I traveled and it was quite a distance.</span> <span id="s2456">So at night, very late at night, I arrived in a village, in a square of the village.</span> <span id="s2457">And for some reason I never understood, I sat on a bench and I didn't feel like going anywhere.</span> <span id="s2458">And in a few minutes a man came by and asked me where I was -- what I was doing there.</span> <span id="s2459">And I told him that I came from Freiburg, that I escaped the French Army and told him about all that.</span> <span id="s2460">And then he said to me, "Don't go this way because you are going to be bothered.</span> <span id="s2461">There is a patrol there, and they bother everybody.</span> <span id="s2462">They are really a hard group."</span> <span id="s2463">Boy, I was very happy to have stopped there.</span> <span id="s2464">Do you know, I had always an instinct I cannot go.</span> <span id="s2465">And then he told me, "Go to that house near the square.</span> <span id="s2466">They are very nice people, and they will give you a bed."</span> <span id="s2467">So I went and they really did, they give me a bed.</span> <span id="s2468">And I slept there, but very early in the morning I told them I had to be getting up.</span> <span id="s2469">And I told them the same story, I always told everybody the same story.</span> <span id="s2470">Their husbands were prisoners of war, and they no news.</span> <span id="s2471">Or they were killed, they had no news.</span> <span id="s2472">But anyway, I left the next morning very early and rode to that Swiss border, to that place where I was going.</span> <span id="s2473">And I arrived late in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s2474">It took quite a -- it's quite a distance.</span> <span id="s2475">And I had to write that letter for keeping all that information, and I had no time to do it in code.</span> <span id="s2476">So I just wrote and the next morning at dawn, the two girls took me to the border which was just a few hundred yards away.</span> <span id="s2477">And they were -- you know, between the German and Swiss, and they told me, "Go through the barbed wire."</span> <span id="s2478">And they helped me go through.</span> <span id="s2479">"Then turn left and you will see a building, that's the Swiss Custom House."</span> <span id="s2480">But like many people, left and right, they didn't know the difference.</span> <span id="s2481">So I crossed the barbed wire, went up left and then I saw the building and knocked at the door.</span> <span id="s2482">It was -- and nobody answered when I looked in, and I saw swastikas; it was a German Custom House.</span> <span id="s2483">Luckily they were sleeping, they didn't hear me.</span> <span id="s2484">And here my letter in my left pocket with my hand on it, I remember that so well.</span> <span id="s2485">And from far away I turned around and said, "Oh, my God.</span> <span id="s2486">I'm in the German Customs."</span> <span id="s2487">And I saw from far away behind a tree a Swiss guy making big swings like that, so I run towards him.</span> <span id="s2488">But the Germans never woke, because they could have killed me.</span> <span id="s2489">I run towards the Swiss, and he pulled me behind the tree and said, "What are you doing?"</span> <span id="s2490">It was a Swiss German, he spoke German only, but I understand him.</span> <span id="s2491">You know, he spoke more German than Swiss German to me.</span> <span id="s2492">And I said to him, "I'm Swiss intelligence.</span> <span id="s2493">I am in the Swiss intelligence, and that letter has to be in Basel at such-and-such office in such-and-such's hands before 11 o'clock this morning."</span> <span id="s2494">And he saluted me, he said, "It will be done."</span> <span id="s2495">And it was done, and the Swiss took all the information first, they always did.</span> <span id="s2496">And then they give it to my unit, and that's one of the things that is written in one of my citations, that I had given that information.</span> <span id="s2497">And that was very important information, and it saved many lives.</span> <span id="s2498">And then the Swiss said, "What do you want to do?"</span> <span id="s2499">And I said, "I return."</span> <span id="s2500">He said, "Oh, my, you really want to return there?"</span> <span id="s2501">And I said, "I am not finished," so I returned to Germany to that house, but the Germans never saw me.</span> <span id="s2502">I don't know how that happened.</span> <span id="s2503">What I told you, I'm extremely lucky.</span> <span id="s2504">And I went back to the house and I stayed that day, and the next morning, I went -- no, the same afternoon with my bike, I went west -- east.</span> <span id="s2505">I went east to see what was going on because I knew they were coming not south, this way, so I went east to see what was going on this way.</span> <span id="s2506">And when I arrived at a certain small town, there were a lot of soldiers, of German soldiers.</span> <span id="s2507">A whole division of them.</span> <span id="s2508">And I stopped and talked to them and told them, you know, always my story how I had escaped from Freiburg, from these horrible French.</span> <span id="s2509">And I said, "What are you doing here?"</span> <span id="s2510">And they said, "Oh, this night we are all going, the whole division is going to go across into Switzerland.</span> <span id="s2511">Because we want to go to Austria, and we would cross Switzerland."</span> <span id="s2512">Then I went back along that road, you know, in the south and on the west.</span> <span id="s2513">And I met -- I arrived in the village very close to this -- you can go any more west, do you know?</span> <span id="s2514">To the end of the road, before you go up north.</span> <span id="s2515">So I went out of there with my bike, and when I arrived in the village, there were white flags all over.</span> <span id="s2516">And the men said, "Don't go any further.</span> <span id="s2517">The French are there in the square."</span> <span id="s2518">And I said, "Oh, I am not going to go toward them, no way."</span> <span id="s2519">And I run to meet them, and the Germans were horrified when they saw that I was going to them, when I just said, "Oh, don't worry about it."</span> <span id="s2520">They were, but they couldn't do anything; they were civilians, they were not Army people.</span> <span id="s2521">And the French immediately I went to, to the officer.</span> <span id="s2522">He was sitting in a Jeep, and I say, "I want you to take me to your headquarters."</span> <span id="s2523">Always the same thing.</span> <span id="s2524">And he said to me, "Why would you go to the headquarter?"</span> <span id="s2525">I say, "I need to go to the headquarters and talk to your officer."</span> <span id="s2526">And then I saw an insignia on his uniform, and I said, "You are a second _______, aren't you?"</span> <span id="s2527">And he said, "Yes," that was the same unit I had met in Freiburg.</span> <span id="s2528">I said, "Then take me to Colonel Petit."</span> <span id="s2529">And he took me, and Colonel Petit, I don't remember what he was, but Petit was extremely to see me again.</span> <span id="s2530">And then I gave him the rest of the information and I told him, "You see, if you go east now, at that village is a whole division, but this night they will go over to Switzerland."</span> <span id="s2531">So he sent me immediately with the Jeep to the General, who was a general with one Army, he had one Army and Petit.</span> <span id="s2532">And he was called __________.</span> <span id="s2533">That was his -- he always said ___________, which means there are no Germans.</span> <span id="s2534">And I was brought to him, and I told him my information.</span> <span id="s2535">And he looked at me, he didn't -- nothing was important to him.</span> <span id="s2536">He wouldn't believe me or I don't know what.</span> <span id="s2537">But anyway, he did not use my information, and he gave orders to attack these Germans, and there were several dead on our side and wounded.</span> <span id="s2538">And on their side and it was absolutely a waste of time.</span> <span id="s2539">And then the next night -- no, it was that night, they really went into Switzerland.</span> <span id="s2540">But you know what the Swiss did?</span> <span id="s2541">The next morning, they gave them all back to as prisoners.</span> <span id="s2542">They didn't want them to cross Switzerland.</span> <span id="s2543">We were too close now.</span> <span id="s2544">The Swiss have always worked all sides, but at that point, they did not want to do it because we were too close to the end of the war.</span> <span id="s2545">And we winning, so they had nothing to do with the Germans anymore.</span> <span id="s2546">They had helped the Germans very much before, but that's the gist of the story.</span> <span id="s2547">Then I met Colonel Petit and I stayed with that unit until the liberation.</span> <span id="s2548">Then after that, I rejoined my unit.</span> <span id="s2549">So that's how the war -- my mission ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s2550">Q: It sounds very exhausting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2551">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s2552">Q: Very exhausting.</span> <span id="s2553">I don't know how you kept up that momentum.</span> <span id="s2554">All by yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s2555">A: You are not tired.</span> <span id="s2556">You are not tired.</span> <span id="s2557">You are not cold, you can take if for hours when you are hyped up.</span> <span id="s2558">It's a complete different -- do you know, I told you I fell in the canal, and I was not even, I never even got a cold.</span> <span id="s2559">And in plain winter, when all clothes were frozen on me.</span> <span id="s2560">When the Army found me, they give me uniforms, do you know, of men to change because I was so I was absolutely drenched.</span> <span id="s2561">I had clothes -- and I never caught a cold or got sick.</span> <span id="s2562">So you live under different conditions.</span> <span id="s2563">It's a complete different world.</span> <span id="s2564">If you made me do that now, I would die.</span> <span id="s2565">I wouldn't be able to.</span> <span id="s2566">So . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2567">Q: An amazing story.</span> <span id="s2568">You accomplished quite a bit on your own.</span> <span id="s2569">Were you -- did you ever feel terribly isolated or . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2570">A: Yeah, but the mission was so important to me.</span> <span id="s2571">Once I had the courage to go through, then everything was forgotten.</span> <span id="s2572">I only thought about the mission and what I wanted to do.</span> <span id="s2573">And I wanted to do it the best possible -- I found prisoners of war, French prisoners of war who gave me information.</span> <span id="s2574">Do you know I tried to get information from whoever could give me some information?</span> <span id="s2575">That's what they say, that I built a Reseau, you know, a group of information.</span></p> <p><span id="s2576">Q: And your family didn't know about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2577">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s2578">Nothing, nothing.</span> <span id="s2579">They absolutely had no inkling.</span> <span id="s2580">During the whole time I was in Germany, I had written letters in advance dated once a week, and the letters were sent to them by one of my friends.</span> <span id="s2581">They were absolutely -- they had absolutely no idea.</span> <span id="s2582">When I told them, they couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s2583">They believed me, but they were very surprised.</span></p> <p><span id="s2584">Q: You stayed in the French Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s2585">A: Yes, I went to Vietnam after.</span> <span id="s2586">Oh, first I stayed, I was awarded.</span> <span id="s2587">They had promised me a lot of things.</span> <span id="s2588">And we were first in Constance, my unit was first in Constance, which is a city on the Lake of Constance, not far from Switzerland.</span> <span id="s2589">And there I had to live in the same building as the captain I talked to before.</span> <span id="s2590">And after a few days when it was absolutely verboten to have any relationship with the Germans, and I didn't feel like having any relationship with the Germans.</span> <span id="s2591">You know, social relationship.</span> <span id="s2592">He invited Germans who were businesspeople who he was trading with them.</span> <span id="s2593">God knows what.</span> <span id="s2594">But he was making business with them, he was an Alsatian.</span> <span id="s2595">And he obliged us all to a dinner with the Germans, and I got up -- when they came in, I got up and left.</span> <span id="s2596">That's another thing to talk about.</span> <span id="s2597">No man could have done that.</span> <span id="s2598">So he put me in arrest, you know.</span> <span id="s2599">I had to stay in my room, and then he wrote me a note that I had to be shipped back to France.</span> <span id="s2600">That he didn't want me anymore, and I was not going to accept that.</span> <span id="s2601">So I called the Colonel Bouvet, who was not too far away.</span> <span id="s2602">His headquarters was not too far away.</span> <span id="s2603">And immediately he sent a Jeep for me, and with it I under arrest but I left.</span> <span id="s2604">And I went to Bouvet, and Bouvet called the superior of that captain in our department.</span> <span id="s2605">I knew him, but I could not call him.</span> <span id="s2606">So Bouvet called him and asked him to get -- to receive me, that I had something very important to him.</span> <span id="s2607">So he immediately accepted, and I was driven by a chauffeur off to Bouvet with a Jeep to that place.</span> <span id="s2608">And I told that commander, that major what happening.</span> <span id="s2609">He was an Alsatian, too, and a friend of the captain, but he was horrified.</span> <span id="s2610">And he said to me, "You know, in you papers, in your file is a note that I will never forget.</span> <span id="s2611">That after having been in so much danger and doing all what you did, you refused the financial reward."</span> <span id="s2612">And at that time we really needed it, because my brother had eaten up all his savings, you know, for keeping the whole family alive during the whole war.</span> <span id="s2613">But I couldn't be paid for such a war, so he said that's in your file.</span> <span id="s2614">And after that he has done that to you?</span> <span id="s2615">And then he punished him.</span> <span id="s2616">He was demoted and sent away from Constance, which was a marvelous city.</span> <span id="s2617">And I was put in another unit.</span> <span id="s2618">I was transferred to another unit where I was very happy.</span> <span id="s2619">And that in Linz.</span> <span id="s2620">I was in Linz, my unit was a little outside of Linz.</span> <span id="s2621">They were living in the villa of -- what's his name.</span> <span id="s2622">Not Himmler, but one of the big chiefs, you know, of German Nazis.</span> <span id="s2623">Above the Constance, it's still the Constance Lake, but that was at the other side in Bavaria near Austria.</span> <span id="s2624">Near the Austrian border.</span> <span id="s2625">So I was in that place for quite a while, and they awarded by making me the chief of the department where every German wanted to come into French Bavaria had to ask my authorization.</span> <span id="s2626">And I organized that exactly like the Germans had organized in France.</span> <span id="s2627">I learned from them.</span> <span id="s2628">They had to be fingerprinted, they had to give me a picture, and at the same time that work was a front for intelligence work that I was continuing to do.</span> <span id="s2629">And the intelligence work, which is not very nice as allies, was to send people to investigate what was going on in the British, the American and the Russian sectors.</span> <span id="s2630">And we all did it, they did it to us; we did it to them.</span> <span id="s2631">In Landau when I was in that department, one day the French police came and arrested my secretary, a German who was an agent of the Americans.</span> <span id="s2632">You know, so we were back and forth, you think that's intelligence if you never see it.</span> <span id="s2633">And our lives are not the lives you do that, you do these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2634">Q: Weren't you honored by the French Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s2635">A: Yeah, I had two citations.</span> <span id="s2636">I had really -- I had applications for three citations -- not my application.</span> <span id="s2637">But I was three times, I was supposed to get citation.</span> <span id="s2638">I got two.</span> <span id="s2639">And that captain who had done the horrible things to me because of the Germans that he invited, he got a citation for my work at the highest grade.</span> <span id="s2640">And he said to me, "You will get it, it's a silver medal, because nobody will give you more than that."</span> <span id="s2641">And I couldn't care less at the time, but he got the highest, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2642">Q: What were your citations?</span></p> <p><span id="s2643">A: They are about my work.</span> <span id="s2644">Oh, they were __________, two quad a guerre (ph) from the Army.</span> <span id="s2645">One was signed by General Schwin (ph), and the other one was signed by De Lapp (ph), General De Lapp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2646">Q: You've been really gracious with your time.</span> <span id="s2647">We've been here a long time.</span> <span id="s2648">Maybe you can tell me very briefly how you -- you know, what you did after the May 1945 end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2649">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2650">After staying in Linz for several more months, in February of '46, I volunteered for Indochina.</span> <span id="s2651">And I went to Indochina where I stayed until December '48, which is almost three years.</span> <span id="s2652">And I was first in Phnom Penh for eight or nine months.</span> <span id="s2653">Phnom Penh in Cambodia.</span> <span id="s2654">Then I was in Da Nang arrived right after Ho Chi Minh started the revolt against the French, which started in December of '46, not before.</span> <span id="s2655">When I went it was against the Japanese.</span> <span id="s2656">The Japanese Army was still there, most of them were prisoners.</span> <span id="s2657">But we had a lot of snipers, and that's what we were fighting at that time until Ho Chi Men started this revolt in December.</span></p> <p><span id="s2658">Q: Were you in nursing and intelligence?</span></p> <p><span id="s2659">A: I was nursing, purely nursing.</span> <span id="s2660">No more intelligence, I needed to go back to reality.</span> <span id="s2661">I had a very swollen head, and it was not healthy.</span> <span id="s2662">And I wanted to lead a normal life, go back to normal life.</span> <span id="s2663">And that was the only way.</span> <span id="s2664">If I had stayed in intelligence, God knows what have happened to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2665">Q: So you thought going to Indochina was a normal life?</span></p> <p><span id="s2666">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2667">That was normal life.</span> <span id="s2668">It was going back to my profession.</span> <span id="s2669">But I loved the Army, I was happy in the Army.</span> <span id="s2670">I felt it very interesting.</span> <span id="s2671">I felt I did not want to get married, I had decided -- I had absolutely decided after my fiancé was killed that I would never get married until I met my husband.</span> <span id="s2672">I changed my mind.</span> <span id="s2673">But it took me 11 years, pretty good.</span> <span id="s2674">But I went to Indochina and after Da Nang I was several months in Da Nang where the fighting was ferocious around Da Nang where it started.</span> <span id="s2675">The whole thing started there.</span> <span id="s2676">Then I was sent for a whole year into Quang Tri, which was the DMZ.</span> <span id="s2677">And after that I went to Da Lat in the mountains.</span> <span id="s2678">That was a war, and I finished my time and then I came home.</span> <span id="s2679">But in Quang Tri to go when we left Da Nang for Quang Tri, I became the head of the ambulance.</span> <span id="s2680">It was not a march unit, because we were only team.</span> <span id="s2681">But we were a team going in the front where we were needed, and I organized that.</span> <span id="s2682">I was asked to organize that, and I found all the equipment and all the supplies and everything.</span> <span id="s2683">I had to find it because the Army doesn't like to give you things.</span> <span id="s2684">But that's how -- and then later I was in nursing in Da Lat in the mountains.</span> <span id="s2685">And then I came home in '48, in December '48 I came home.</span> <span id="s2686">And I lived first in Poitiers for until 1953, and in 1953 I went to Geneva in Switzerland where my older sister was living because she had married a Swiss violinist of the Roman Orchestra.</span> <span id="s2687">And they invited me to join them, because my sister and I were very close and we are still very close.</span> <span id="s2688">And I went there and I became -- I entered nursing school to get the Swiss degree.</span> <span id="s2689">Red Cross school, where I was very unhappy.</span> <span id="s2690">Because I was a French citizen, they made me do all the cleaning.</span> <span id="s2691">And the student nurses were doing the care of patients and I was the cleaning woman.</span> <span id="s2692">But I finally got my diploma, and then I worked in the hospital as a chief nurse, in the Department of Neurology for quite a while.</span> <span id="s2693">And I did other things in Geneva, and then when I met my husband in December of 1953.</span> <span id="s2694">And in '56, he had finished his studies, and he asked me to come with him to America, but we were unmarried when we came.</span> <span id="s2695">I want first to see if I could adopt here.</span> <span id="s2696">And, you know, it was insured.</span> <span id="s2697">You come to America, but God knows what happens once you are here if we are going to get married or not.</span> <span id="s2698">But finally I went to -- first, I worked at Bethel Israel Hospital in Newark, New Jersey for six months to learn English and to make a little money.</span> <span id="s2699">And then I went to school at Washington University to become a nurse and in '58, I graduated.</span> <span id="s2700">In August of '58, and in January of '58 we got married.</span> <span id="s2701">Because my husband came, he first was an intern at Brooklyn Jewish in New York, and then he came to Washington as a resident.</span> <span id="s2702">And then when we first were able get both fellows then we got married in New York religiously.</span> <span id="s2703">My mother came to make sure that we got married by a rabbi.</span> <span id="s2704">And then we moved back to St. Louis.</span> <span id="s2705">After a while, we moved to New York, where I worked at New York Hospital and my husband worked at Memorial Cancer for the -- Memorial Hospital for Cancer Research at Sloan-Kettering.</span> <span id="s2706">He was a resident and a fellow, and then we moved to Minneapolis where he did a master's in biochemistry.</span> <span id="s2707">And then we moved to Pittsburgh where he did a Ph.D. in biochemistry, too, and nutrition and -- no, in Minneapolis, it was endocrinology.</span> <span id="s2708">In Pittsburgh, it was biochemistry and nutrition and public health.</span> <span id="s2709">And he got his Ph.D. and then he worked at the same hospital where I worked at the University Hospital at [Magee] Women's Hospital and I started to do research with him.</span> <span id="s2710">I became his assistant in the lab.</span> <span id="s2711">He told me yes, you can do research because you are good in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s2712">You know how to cook, then you can do research, too.</span> <span id="s2713">I start research and we quite successful.</span> <span id="s2714">Then we came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2715">Q: To California?</span></p> <p><span id="s2716">A: Yeah, to Los Angeles where we were offered by a former colleague a job at Martin Luther King Hospital, which is -- and Drew Medical School.</span> <span id="s2717">And the four first years were tough, we were okay.</span> <span id="s2718">We did very good work and we were very marvelous with our research.</span> <span id="s2719">The research was in anesthesiology, and, you know, how to make -- how anesthetic make you sleep, because nobody knows what sleep is.</span> <span id="s2720">And how you awaken, all this research.</span> <span id="s2721">And then we got in trouble, and we had to go to have -- we had two big trials, and we finally won the trial for discrimination, racial and religious discrimination.</span> <span id="s2722">Which was quite -- it took us nine years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2723">Q: That you were discriminated against?</span></p> <p><span id="s2724">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2725">By the black administration.</span> <span id="s2726">Not the people we worked with, but the administration and the school.</span> <span id="s2727">The administration of the hospital and the school.</span> <span id="s2728">But we finally won, but last year.</span> <span id="s2729">It took us since '84.</span></p> <p><span id="s2730">Q: And you had children . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2731">A: Yeah, yes.</span> <span id="s2732">I cannot forget that.</span> <span id="s2733">In 1960, I had the first son, Stephan, who is a doctor in Chicago.</span> <span id="s2734">And he's married and has a little girl who is three years old, Anna Regina.</span> <span id="s2735">His wife is Barbara.</span> <span id="s2736">And then in 1964, I had my second son, Benjamin, who you will see later here.</span> <span id="s2737">And he is an EMT, emergency medical technician in San Diego.</span> <span id="s2738">He lives in San Diego.</span> <span id="s2739">So . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2740">Q: Let me just ask you a couple of questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s2741">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2742">Q: And then we'll introduce the family that's here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2743">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2744">Q: Your life was disrupted at a pretty early age.</span></p> <p><span id="s2745">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2746">Q: Do you have certain regrets, resentments?</span></p> <p><span id="s2747">A: No, I never have.</span> <span id="s2748">I only regret that people were destroyed, but for my personal life I never regretted.</span> <span id="s2749">Because I went ahead, I never let it stop me.</span> <span id="s2750">And my whole family was like that, they all, you know, did -- they all studied or did what they needed to do.</span> <span id="s2751">And the one who did the most sacrificing was my oldest brother, Fred.</span> <span id="s2752">So -- because he supported the whole family.</span></p> <p><span id="s2753">Q: What do you think gave you the strength to accomplish what you did?</span> <span id="s2754">Did that come from your family?</span> <span id="s2755">Was it . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2756">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s2757">Q: What gave you the strength to accomplish all that you did in very difficult situations?</span></p> <p><span id="s2758">A: Survival is a very strong instinct, very strong.</span> <span id="s2759">That's one thing, and revenge is another very strong instinct.</span> <span id="s2760">You know, I want really revenge.</span> <span id="s2761">I felt -- and I felt that it as my duty to do it.</span> <span id="s2762">It was not only -- revenge was important, to get even for all the things we had been going through.</span></p> <p><span id="s2763">Q: After having all these extraordinary experiences, was it difficult to return to a more conventional lifestyle?</span></p> <p><span id="s2764">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s2765">Very much.</span> <span id="s2766">But with time, it was okay.</span> <span id="s2767">But the beginning was very hard because I loved to be in the Army.</span> <span id="s2768">I had lots of friends, excellent friends.</span> <span id="s2769">And a whole group of friends.</span> <span id="s2770">And they spoke highly of me, you know, because of what I did.</span> <span id="s2771">My reputation always followed me wherever I went.</span> <span id="s2772">You know, there was always somebody who knew about what I had done, and they told everybody around them, I didn't.</span> <span id="s2773">But when I went out and I had -- for certain things.</span> <span id="s2774">Usually, I didn't carry -- wear them much.</span> <span id="s2775">But when I wore my decorations when I had to, that always made a big -- a big splash.</span></p> <p><span id="s2776">Q: What were the difficult adjustments?</span></p> <p><span id="s2777">A: To just live normally.</span> <span id="s2778">You know, without the excitement, without all the danger, without the adventures.</span> <span id="s2779">It was very adventurous to be in Vietnam, too, very.</span> <span id="s2780">Even as a nurse, and I loved the country.</span> <span id="s2781">It was a very interesting country.</span> <span id="s2782">I loved it.</span> <span id="s2783">And it was so different of what I had known before, and I took care a lot of natives.</span> <span id="s2784">Because we were taking care of our soldiers, but we were taking care of the natives, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2785">Q: Can you talk for just a minute about what the long-term impact of all these experiences is?</span></p> <p><span id="s2786">A: What is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2787">Q: What sort of a long-term impact these experiences have had on you in terms of the way you've lived your life, in terms of your values or your fears or lack of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2788">A: Oh, fears, I have plenty of fears.</span> <span id="s2789">I hate the dark, I cannot stand dark.</span> <span id="s2790">And I don't deaths, you know.</span> <span id="s2791">I am afraid of these things, and I don't hide it because I don't feel it's important.</span> <span id="s2792">And my values have not changed much.</span> <span id="s2793">I was very religiously brought up, but when I was 13 I absolutely revolted against everything.</span> <span id="s2794">My mother said always that I was brandishing the red flag of revolt.</span> <span id="s2795">I was -- my older brothers and sisters didn't do that, they were much too respectful.</span> <span id="s2796">I was respectful to my parents, too, but I was always revolting against what I thought was right.</span> <span id="s2797">Or when I raised my children, I raised them religiously.</span> <span id="s2798">They went to religious school, I went with them to the temple.</span> <span id="s2799">I even went to learn Hebrew with them so I can help them with their homework.</span> <span id="s2800">I did all these things, but I never pushed religion down their throat, and I felt that I had -- you know, in my environment, religion was governing every minute of life.</span> <span id="s2801">And that, I felt, was too much when I was a kid.</span> <span id="s2802">But I am, I wanted my children to be raised religiously.</span></p> <p><span id="s2803">Q: Do you consider yourself religious today?</span></p> <p><span id="s2804">A: I never know.</span> <span id="s2805">I don't know.</span> <span id="s2806">It's very difficult.</span> <span id="s2807">I think I believe in God, but I don't know how much.</span> <span id="s2808">I never knew.</span> <span id="s2809">Since I'm 13, I don't know.</span> <span id="s2810">Before that I absolutely believed, but since then it's difficult to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2811">Q: What about the traditions of Judaism?</span></p> <p><span id="s2812">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s2813">I believe in traditions, absolutely.</span> <span id="s2814">And I believe in Israel, and I believe, you know, in keeping the traditions we keep.</span> <span id="s2815">My husband is absolutely not religious; he was raised religiously.</span> <span id="s2816">But we keep all the holidays and we always have lived as a family, you know, in keeping the holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s2817">Q: Why don't we introduce you husband . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2818">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2819">Q: . . . and son?</span> <span id="s2820">Why don't you stop tape, okay?</span> <span id="s2821">Do you want to introduce them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2822">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2823">Behind me to my right is my father, is [Captain Major] Al Cohn, my husband.</span> <span id="s2824">We were married in February of 194- -- no, 1958.</span> <span id="s2825">And here's my son, Ramie Benjamin, who was born on April 13th, 1964.</span> <span id="s2826">Is my second son.</span></p> <p><span id="s2827">HUSBAND: My wife has always been the strong member of the family.</span> <span id="s2828">Is her son, she'll tell you.</span> <span id="s2829">And he turned out fine, it's because of her.</span> <span id="s2830">She has an inner strength, which has always been there.</span> <span id="s2831">And I think you heard it on the tape, as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s2832">Q: Were either of you kind stunned by your mother and wife's accomplishments?</span></p> <p><span id="s2833">HUSBAND: Well, I knew very little about what she had done during the war.</span> <span id="s2834">I heard more after we were married.</span> <span id="s2835">I knew she had come back from Vietnam and that was really impressive.</span> <span id="s2836">And I was impressed that she took a strong position against the United States at that time, when she lived here entering the war.</span> <span id="s2837">Telling them the results would be the same as what happened to the French.</span> <span id="s2838">Ramie has been fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2839">SON: I knew even less than the little that he did.</span> <span id="s2840">I'm just now learning a lot about what she did.</span> <span id="s2841">What she went through, what she experienced.</span> <span id="s2842">And I must say it's all pretty amazing.</span> <span id="s2843">I'm impressed about the way things were handled as far as I know so far.</span></p> <p><span id="s2844">Q: It's an extraordinary life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2845">SON: More than what I'd want to go through, I must say.</span></p> <p><span id="s2846">A: But you . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2847">SON: I'm not sure I'm strong enough to go through, so . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2848">A: It depends on the circumstances.</span> <span id="s2849">If you are thrown in certain circumstances, you are going to go through what you never thought you could do, that's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2850">HUSBAND: She did that as a family, too.</span> <span id="s2851">When we had extremely difficult times, she was just as strong as all her experiences during the war.</span> <span id="s2852">And he put us through a lot of challenges, as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s2853">SON: I thought this was about her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2854">Q: . . . if you survived those, as well, you're all here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2855">HUSBAND: Yes.</span> <span id="s2856">We're only missing my oldest son who lives in Chicago with his family.</span></p> <p><span id="s2857">Q: Anything you all want to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s2858">HUSBAND: No, I love my wife and sons.</span></p> <p><span id="s2859">SON: We love our mother, and that's about . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2860">A: That's true for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2861">HUSBAND: Short but sweet, what can we say?</span></p> <p><span id="s2862">Q: Thank you all for patience.</span></p> <p><span id="s2863">HUSBAND: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2864">SON: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2865">Q: Okay, we're just going to do this for a couple minutes so we need silence except for your mother.</span> <span id="s2866">What is this photograph?</span></p> <p><span id="s2867">A: Oh, this is my grandfather, the Rabbi -- he was __________.</span></p> <p><span id="s2868">Q: Do you know when this was taken, this photograph?</span></p> <p><span id="s2869">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s2870">I cannot remember, but it must be -- he died when he was about 78 from a heart attack.</span> <span id="s2871">He died suddenly.</span> <span id="s2872">That's -- I don't know when it was taken, but it was in the later years.</span> <span id="s2873">On the left on the horse is my former fiancé, Jacques De la Rae (ph) who was killed.</span> <span id="s2874">He was tortured and shot by the Germans in 1942 in October, I think October 6th, 1942.</span> <span id="s2875">Next to him is his brother, Mark, the last brother who was killed, shot the same day with his brother and two other friends who had formed a group of resistance against the Germans.</span> <span id="s2876">And they were caught and tortured first and shot later on the Val-de-Marne in Paris.</span> <span id="s2877">This photograph must have been taken in the spring of 1942, but I can see leaves, it must have been in the spring.</span> <span id="s2878">And the first -- I am not sure.</span> <span id="s2879">Okay, the first person to the right is our instructor, Ms. Valez (ph).</span> <span id="s2880">The next person to her is the directress of the school of Red Cross, Ms. -- now, I cannot remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2881">Q: Is this in Marseilles?</span></p> <p><span id="s2882">A: I am next to her, and in the back -- in the back of my picture half-hidden is __________, the young lady who saved our life by making us come to her house before leaving the occupied France for unoccupied France.</span></p> <p><span id="s2883">Q: This was in Poitiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s2884">A: That's in Poitiers.</span> <span id="s2885">That was the Red Cross School of Nursing which was in the hospital of the university, and the hospital was run by Catholic nuns.</span></p> <p><span id="s2886">Q: You can't point.</span></p> <p><span id="s2887">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2888">Q: You can just tell us that you're in the middle front.</span></p> <p><span id="s2889">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2890">I am on the left of the Directress of the school who is much older than we are.</span> <span id="s2891">I am standing just left to her.</span> <span id="s2892">This is my sister, Stephanie, who was deported on Yom Kippur Day 1942 to Auschwitz, and she never came back.</span> <span id="s2893">She was a medical student when she was arrested in Poitiers in July, end of June 1942.</span> <span id="s2894">And then she went to prison and to camp in Poitiers then Drancy and then Pithiviers.</span> <span id="s2895">And from Pithiviers, she was deported to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span
